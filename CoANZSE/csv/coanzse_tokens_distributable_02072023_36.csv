grieving from their partner they used the surface because they think they need help every year councils Meals on Wheels program delivers on average 40,000 meals to around 200 people these meals include salads roasts pastas fish casseroles and much more the meals are prepared cooked and packaged in the kitchen facilities at the core alike a center in Ringwood they had been transported to the

meals a day we do one vegetarian and we usually do two meat dishes on an average we do just about under a thousand meals per week that 's including frozen meals on a weekend when you 're dealing with elderly people it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's a lot more rules and regulations when it comes to cooking a meal and it comes down to hygienic practices our suppliers they have to be checked before we can use their produce there 's temperature controls there 's so many different things just to get the food in here that we can use with ring winning Gordon it 's a very diverse community so there 's so many different backgrounds so we make it very worldly and nutritious each person that has to be given certain amount of nutrition that means the amount of protein amount of carbohydrates amount of vegetables amount of daring that that person actually takes so that all has to be taken into account some of the positive feedback so that we receive here is personally are the meals of the delicious they love the desserts they love mashed potato and that they bring up and say yes more mass more mass we want to get away from that Hospital stigma we want to give you know the best restaurant calling that we can give the people that end up getting meals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take away their cooking aspect it 's it 's it 's sad so for us being able to give them a meal that you probably used to love cooking themselves and for them they 'll get some enjoyment out of it for me it 's rewarding if someone is happy with their meals my name is Sabina I 'm involved with meals on wheels I volunteer three four times a week I joined 21 years ago I heard it from my friend and then when my husband died I was too old to get a job but too young to retire so I decided to try meals on

would love to see new faces too I 'm Albert Ayler and I 'm one of the many people who received meals on wheels I really don 't have any bad things to say about the meals because there 's not @ @ @ @ @

Maroondah Hwy, Ringwood VIC 3134, Australia",1072,the 1 million stars project started in 2012 in response to the death of Jamar and community artists Mary and brought people together to wear stars I think in her church in Brunswick and the Stasi used as a form of representing solidarity and light around quite a powerful message it was a subject or an issue that I felt rather powerless to do anything about and then reading about this project I thought wow that 's something that I can do and then I came to worry nuh in croydon to find out about hiring a space so i could have lots of girlfriends get together on weave stars and fortunately that started an incredible growth from marine do it 's turned into a fantastic project that 's touched on lots of lives across our community and we 've been able to spread a very important message in a very non-threatening way through the power of community arts I think what 's amazing about the project and the way probably the reason it 's grown so much is because of its accessibility my people of all ages and really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think the Stars project is important to do because it helps raise awareness of things that people don 't really like to talk about that often and it 's such a simple idea but it can show people that one little thing can actually lead to a big difference everyone felt so included and it was really nice because if you worked with one a group they 'd also say oh my cousin 's making them with Scouts oh my friends doing them here so all of those stars will be used at realm for the installation we 've then take that down after a couple months and they 'll all go off to the gold coast for a holiday there 'll be an installation of 1 million stars so it 's it 's gone from a small one star for person to make into a huge one minion start installation at the gold coast for the Commonwealth Games I came to this project having recently retired so working with this projects been good for me to have some activities to have some appointments in my diary that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memorable to work with so many people from our community I got out of it the pleasure of meeting people I hadn 't met in other groups and at other times in the village and the other thing that intrigued me was the outrageous enthusiasm of some of the ladies who would say can I have some ribbons to take home then they 'd ring up and say it 's got any more ribbons and then they come along to the next workshop onto the table and here because mound enough stars so apart from lots of our Mirinda community weaving stars the great thing for me has been other areas of council working around messages of non-violence have been included for instance our youth services team work with LGBTI young people aged and disability promote the message around elder abuse and awareness of child abuse as well with our Children 's Services team that message around prevention at such an early age has been really pretty cool I think to our work and has shown us that we can educate very young children around non-violence and about being kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life that exists for us it 's been so rewarding it 's created bonds between staff staff and the children the staff and the families between the families on a completely different level I guess I had a parent approach me to say thank you for taking this project on I 'm actually a domestic violence survivor and so on my children and that really took me back I knew that we would touch on it with people but I wasn 't sure whether anybody would come forward and it just reiterated for me that if this was a great thing for us to be taking on and that it did matter so I felt that we even if we just reached that one family it was so worth it I had a meeting recently that i was quite anxious about an interview and we were meeting in a cafe in Croydon I was feeling very unsettled very uneasy and I walked in here I saw a star installation all these beautiful stars swaying in the life and I instantly felt safe and I felt grounded and I felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the beautiful things about the project is that not even necessarily that you know the main point of the project with ending violence it is creating this sense of support and community and togetherness so it 's a beautiful thing the project just was very significant for me because it was very different when I was younger it was I grew up in a violent to harm household and in my day violence was normalized and I know it isn 't now the project taught me that and this project is helping me you see issues in the different lights so the installation at realm isn 't just about having a beautiful installation made of community artworks that people have done it 's it 's going to be about people asking the questions they 're going to be reading information they 're going to start thinking about how our community needs to go forward and maroondah City Council has provided that platform to get those difficult conversations going when we bring together art and we bring together people who care about a common interest or idea then what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and inspiring that really makes a difference if you look at what represents the star star represents light so to me when you put a lot of stars together they basically shed light I think the whole thing is to shed light that there is violence out there and there 's a lot of people that 's highlighted let 's make it so everyone knows and let 's do something about it,"(-37.8148577, 145.2290482)"

name is Liz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Y Rina would I 've been on council since nine and 83 previously from the former city of Croydon and since amalgamation the city of Miranda what I enjoy most about representing the community is working on projects and with different groups in the community and hopefully hopefully improve the quality of life of the most vulnerable my value set tends to lean towards helping those demographics such as people with disabilities the elderly and youth as a counselor most passionate about representing the people and listening to their views I enjoy representing the community on a wide range of things mainly that it 's so firstly we have a very good community maroondah it 's great to get around and about and see people but it 's also listening to what their views are and trying to make the city as friendly as possible and also keeping the environment that had over all the years that I 've been in Miranda all the things that I love most about representing the community are really getting involved with the community groups and the church groups and the business groups and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and establish a relationship with the groups that are get involved with what I enjoy most about representing maroondah is the fact that I get to engage with the community I get to communicate with them and then I get to work with them on projects right across the community what I enjoy most about representing our community is helping and supporting all the different community groups in Miranda from the large football groups down to the small kindergarten it 's great that as counselors we can advocate and have a say in how our community looks and feels the thing I enjoy most about representing their community is the actual people that I get to meet and all the different organizations and community groups that we have in the city we have really great community spirit and so that 's one of the things I love most about miranda is you can go out and about and meet so many people that volunteer or have different organizations they belong to and it 's just a great place to live what I 've enjoyed most so far about representing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any level but I think my favorite thing is meeting with residents personally and sorting out their issues for them one on one representing the community and satisfaction that council they have is like any volunteering job you take serving the community and see the satisfaction when you achieve for them what they ask you to do it 's a great feeling as a council of maroondah are most passionate about children services and working with families from right across the community to improve services to improve their access to services and to mostly improve their engagement and provide a better quality of life I always love an opportunity to talk about my libraries pretty passionate about libraries to been on on the board of Eastern Regional libraries for about seven years now here in maroondah we have our two libraries at ringwood and Croydon and it 's always fascinating to see how the the face of the public library is changing all the time and they 're no longer places that you just go to read a book and I often like to use the phrase that libraries are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of social exclusion well I think that the main achievements that we 've had as a disability Advisory Committee is that we 've elevated the level of conversation about people with disabilities and access in the city of borunda to a level never seen before we have communicating with people with disabilities guide that went out to all the businesses in Miranda so that people could understand the different types of disabilities and how businesses and other organizations could assist people with a disability and having a full life and having full access to the same things that everybody else did I 'm currently involved with the well-being committee and last year we created a new plan so it was implemented at the start of this year so it was great to be part of that team and to create a new plan for Miranda the bayswater North renewal project just ended as I was elected was in the final phase and since then we 've opened the community garden and it is just truly wonderful people come mostly on a Saturday to do their gardening it 's lovely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vegetables and coming up to the next harvest will be a great time when we get to share all the harvest it 's been great the council 's been able to fund some extensions and renovations at the caribou center in kilsyth caribee runs some facilities for the asian and frail and have a pretty heavy dementia program which has been established through the renovations and extensions to the facility gives the opportunity for not only the people to attend and have a social outlet and an outing during the day it also gives the opportunity for the people who care for them to have some rest spot has some time to themselves as a counselor for mullum I 'm most excited to see all the changes across the whole area the fantastic changes at parkwood which will bring a whole new community together of age groups community groups and different aspects of the community all working together in those fantastic new areas the development of the Nord preschool is a great another fantastic facility across maroondah really most recently the last couple years forreston the baseball north community renewal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money being spent in the glen park community center and alibi and and what everything to a condition man the community garden that looks fantastic and and people use it and very happy about it arab rides another great community house that are involved in and i think seeing those areas flourish and develop and get more people and help people get jobs I think it 's amazing through my work on murdered disability Advisory Committee we 've done some a lot of work lately with the reshaping of room ringwood and the works that are going on there so the new East land the ringwood railway station and acclimation have all been projects that are murdered disability Advisory Committee have been heavily involved in making sure that it 's suitable for all people and everyone can access it when they 're opened over the next few years kara like it runs theatre shows and programs for adults and four kids as well so the kid says the carrick it 's and so they run a number of different programs through the school holidays so have a look and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to and then adults there 's the theatre shows that they run through the year so which is also great to a tendency I was the the mayor in 2012 when the Croydon wife space was opened and I love the fact that you can drive past mad and I wrote a twice place and you can see the kids anytime of the day or night enjoying the facilities that are there yeah the Miranda Artz trail is another new initiative that is really exciting it 's an initiative between the urban life community in ringwood and n council and it 's a collaboration I suppose between 13 cafes and restaurants around the city of maroondah that have now become many art galleries they 're showing exhibitions of art by local artists I loved attending the Miranda festival it was a fantastic event for everyone across the community I was lucky enough to spend several hours with the Children 's Services team coring apples it was great to engage with families but it was wonderful to see all of the community out and enjoying the live music the different demonstrations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the council quite often I get approached when I 'm walking which I do a lot of work in the morning and whatever the shopping centre doing some shopping they approach you and they complain whether in my ward in another wood why is this one done that way or ways and then the other way and my job and always do bring that back to the proper to the directors concerns and act on it not all the time you can succeed where you can stuff that people ask for you can do but you try to do most of the things that people ask you Warren offer a number of activities during the week for people with disabilities through their art programs I was lucky enough to head down there week or two ago to sit in and have a look and see what sort of activities they got up to we have well connected bike paths which link into a number of different trails you 've got malam malam eastlink dandenong Creek and Terrell a trail and my family loves to use those trails on a regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to achieve balance within planning we 've currently doing 20 40 but we did the 2020 so there was a lot of planning and community consultation and that 's the same with 2040 now and it 's really listening again to people what the community needs are the chat changing needs of the community at the different age groups of the community and it 's important again to listen to those but then we have to plan and set about how we actually achieve what the community is looking for as a counselor it 's interesting to talk to people in the street and you find out that a number of the residents actually don 't have much idea about what council or more importantly what council is actually there for and what we achieve and so I think what I would say to people who have had perhaps no involvement with council ever is to get to know who your ward councillors are and if you get an opportunity to to meet them and have a cup of coffee with them and talk about what 's important to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are with perhaps other members of the community it 's very important for the community to have the voice and that 's the role of a counselor to actually have a voice that will implement that voice for the community but it 's listening to people who are in our community and what they enjoy about maroondah what they 'd like to see in the future of our Parranda and and them trying to achieve their their goals I think that for I 'm a counselor for any government organization it 's important to have long-term planning so I think that miranda council has done a great job in saying what do we want maroondah to look like in 20 40 and out of that came a whole vision from all the different people in maroondah whether it was people on the street people who came to some of our functions different organizations business leaders you name it they all decided you know that they wanted to have a say in what they thought the future would look like locally within Miranda I 've always been and passionate about recycling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are have a very tidy city we are one of the best municipalities in Victoria ver recycling and also very high up in the diversion of land for all exciting thing at the moment is very heath night and we would a structure plants there has been an amazing amount of community consultation and as a result of that there 's going to be linkages between the stores the community the shops the restaurants the back lanes public transport it 's all coming together but keeping that original feel that community vibe but developing it so it 's new and safe people can contact us via the social media through Facebook Twitter or YouTube or we do have our ringwood going places website which you can access as well it cancels not just a bad roads rates and rubbish there 's a lot more things that council do and there might be things that the council can do for you as a resident that you 're not familiar with and so what I would say is talk to a finer counselor that 's in your award and you can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see who the council is up all their mobile phone contacts are there give us a ring and tell us who you are what your concerns are and you might be surprised that some of the things that we can achieve might be and able to be done for,"(-37.8148577, 145.2290482)"

Message to residents February 2015",TjqP_xAQqCo,20150227,231.959,"179 Maroondah Hwy, Ringwood VIC 3134, Australia",726,hi i 'm rob steen on one of the ward councillors for the Y Rena would I was elected to council on 2008 and reelected again in 2012 the thing that I suppose I 'm the most passionate about as a counselor is trying to make Miranda safer and I suppose that 's the the background of my involvement in the police force and I saw that being on council gave me the opportunity to have an extension of that what Miranda means to me is a green leafy suburb I like the fact that you can drive down mount dandenong road and I was there the other day and I I noticed that the trees were so advanced that you can in some places you can hardly see the Miranda hospital which is probably our most substantial building and and their green leafy canopy sort of hides a lot of that and I like that and as a ward councillor sitting on public consultation meetings I like the fact that we can make determination on proposals and developments and I always have in the back of my mind being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly can I 'm most passionate about being having marina being the safest place in Victoria unfortunately drugs and alcohol abuse or a major part of society these days and as part of my role as a counselor I 'm the deputy chair of the National local government drug and alcohol advisory committee and it gives me an opportunity to see what other councillors around Australia doing in relation to drug and alcohol treatment and drug and alcohol systems to try to reduce the extent of that and so I 'm fortunate enough to have that opportunity to find out what 's best practice around the country and occasions we can introduce things in marina to make sure that the scourge of our society which is drug and alcohol is minimized as best we can I was the the mayor in 2012 when the Croydon wife space was opened and I love the fact that you can drive past mad and i wrote a twice place and you can see the kids in any time of the day or night enjoying the facilities that are there i think one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms of government can get together and contribute equally or in partnership this better outcomes for the community and what I mean by that is if Y space for example was just a council funded facility it wouldn 't be anywhere near to the scale or the quality that it is now more important I suppose just in Wairoa the barge Don reserved the buildings down there we redeveloped last year and again it was a combination of funds from council and the state government as a counselor it 's interesting to talk to people in the street and you find out that a number of the residents actually don 't have much idea about what council are more importantly what council is actually there for and what we achieve and so I think what I would say to people who hadn 't perhaps no involvement with council ever is to get to know who your ward councillors are and if you get an opportunity to to meet them and have a cup of coffee with them and talk about what 's important to you then you might be surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the community it councils not just a bad roads rates and rubbish there 's a lot more things that council do and there might be things that the council can do for you as a resident that you 're not familiar with and so what I would say is talk to a frantic counselor that 's in your award and you can do that by going to the website and having a look to see who the council is up all their mobile phone contacts are there give us a ring and tell us who you are what your concerns are and you might be surprised at some of the things that we can achieve might be and able to be done for you you,"(-37.8148577, 145.2290482)"

Maroondah Hwy, Ringwood VIC 3134, Australia",972,now speaking of rainwater you 're going to love this next story John 's down in Melbourne and he 's found a street where they 're using innovative plant solutions to solve the problem of flooding this street in ringwood in outer eastern melbourne was just a typical suburban street but for one thing it had a major problem of flooding it lies between ringwood lake at the top of the hill and a creek at the bottom and in fact this is the line of an old creek bed luckily engineers and landscape architects got together and undertook a revolutionary change to the street that has solved many of its problems now only who you as a landscape architect who was responsible for this project tell me a little bit about what it was like before you undertook the project sure this street was just a standard residential street it had on street parking two-way traffic the only issues that we had to solve in the street with the flooding issues there 's a large amount of water that actually enters this street from maroondah highway so it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all through here sometimes would enter into the houses that 's how bad it was so what was your broad strategy for overcoming that we 've put in a three-step process where it slows the flow of water down by the river up pebbles it enters supply retention swales gets cleaned and filtered and then sent back into the storm water system you mentioned swales what is a swale yep this whale is pretty much an open touch rain it 's emulating what was he before this used to be a dry creek bed the plants are we 've used here have a fibrous root system and they take up some of the water take up the new the nutrients that they need and also some of the harmful nutrients in the water and then some of the excess water will seep into the actual water table I mean the top thing we 've got here are these are these pebbles and what are these a couple of centimeters of aren 't they across yes that sort of size what 's underneath them yep we 've got layers of sand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water so what this really is doing is its beneficial to the local street trees it maintains that the qualities of the soils it can takes out a lot of the rubbish so it 's not just an aesthetic result for counsel or for the street it really does help with a number of issues that council has to do with on day-to-day basis life drainage an occurrence selected plants for her scheme that really are suited to wetland environments for example as juncus the rush there are some sedges or carex down here on the higher area she 's used some l 'amanda and then down here she used a bit of a little ground cover called biggy Wiggy rather a nice plant I really like this because you get a real sense an ether of the water rushing down here and all of this foliage being trapped against the plants they really are doing their job it looks just like a creek and the residents who live in here they must look down on this and think it 's sensational they 're almost living in the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street so we couldn 't ask for anything better they they help maintain it so well let 's go down and have a look at a little Park you 've done down the bottom of the street here too perfect at the end of the street a new park has been designed to harvest water runoff and serve the needs of local residents the whole theory behind his back was to have an edible garden so ninety percent of the plants within here edible their fruiting all the herbs or vegetables are alike when we open the park we had a number of residents from the development along the street come down and actually plant these plants themselves yeah so they 're taking that extra care and know exactly where the plants are going and so they come through and maintain it on a weekly basis I know is we got sage and we 've got some time we 've got some mints through here with a lemon balm over there and some strawberries so it 's quite a nice selection of the injury you can just come and pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen it is like having your own kitchen garden i guess but just out on the street yeah now underneath here you say there are water tanks they collect the bulk of the water that 's then used for irrigation this little park that 's correct we try to hold the water within the tank and then any excess water in the tank there 's a valve that releases it into this wild birds through here and that gives you control and again prevents flooding that 's great yeah all over Australia we 've traditionally treated our urban waterways in a most Cavalier manner this innovative solution however has solved the problem got the community on side and really given us a wonderful streetscape to enjoy one of the best successes I guess you can tell from a pressure like this is having new life coming into the area 's we 've had some frogs that kind of coming in cited to use what utilizes whalers their habitat so that 's great,"(-37.8148577, 145.2290482)"

for a really great conversation hello everybody my name is tiffany crawford and i 'm the co-director of climate change and city resilience at the city of melbourne and i will be your mc today before we begin uh let 's pause though and acknowledge country whichever country you may be on and the many many generations of aboriginal and torres strait islander women in particular who have cared for the lands that we are all on and that there is so much we have to learn from traditional caring approaches uh caring for country approaches i respectfully acknowledge the traditional owners of the land i 'm on today the raw andrei rarong people of the eastern cooling nation and i pay my respects to elders past present and emerging the city of melbourne is committed to our reconciliation journey because at its heart reconciliation is about strengthening relationships between aboriginal and non-aboriginal peoples for the benefit of all victorians and australians hello again and i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are joined by councillor elizabeth mary deutsch professor hillary bambrick and tamara dimitina as well as my co-director christa milne who we job share and is my fellow director here at the city of melbourne i 'd also like to acknowledge uh councillors who are present and our executive leadership uh in particular i believe that councillors jamal hakim and rohan lepet are with us and alison layton the deputy ceo here at the city of melbourne if you wouldn 't mind just noting that today 's event is being recorded and shared with others who have registered for the event we would love it if you would use the chat function to introduce yourself if you 've got questions and comments or if you just wanted to say hello and let us know where you 're joining from there will be opportunity later in proceedings for you to ask questions of our panelists so you can use the q a function for that unfortunately our lord mayor sally capp is unable to join us today she is unwell and although she is fairly unstoppable she is taking a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deutsch to provide a few welcoming remarks thank you councillor deutsch i 'm going to introduce you apologies councillor deutsche was born raised and has lived her entire life in melbourne i believe your very proud parents are joining us here in the audience love to hear a few secrets from them about how this how to raise such a strong female climate warrior she has a very proud career in the trade union movement playing a key role in communication and stakeholder engagement councillor deutsch currently works in the construction sector engaging with a diverse range of industry and community stakeholders she was elected to melbourne city council for the first time in 2020 and recognises the important role that uh the council play and all councils play in the recovery of our city and and climate and the opportunity presented um to contribute to the design of a more productive inclusive and enriched city for all of us councillor deutsch is also the portfolio lead for sustainable buildings and the deputy portfolio lead for environment city activation and creative melbourne portfolios welcome very much councillor deutsch thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the acknowledgment of country tiff that was fantastic and acknowledging um where we are and especially the week that this is i know it 's meant to be international women 's day but we 're turning it into a week and i 'm totally cool with that um so thank you to everyone who 's attending today welcome um and we 're joining today as we said to discuss something very close to our hearts uh women leading climate action so uh we 're delighted to share this stimulating event with you and celebrate the bold women in the midst of leading climate action in australia um as tiff mentioned the lord may really wanted to be here but she 's unwell and sends her apologies and i definitely want to give um a wonderful lord mayor a shout out for the absolute incredible work she does i mean all the time but particularly um in this space i need to acknowledge the room she makes for younger women like myself to be able to um take up space and have opportunities like this and um it 's really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was uh invited to be a part of this so that 's very much acknowledged and again that actually goes out to you tiff and krista as well thank you um i too uh respectfully respectfully acknowledge the traditional owners of the land i 'm joining you from i am here in what looks like a jail cell but is actually um an office space in adelaide uh the traditional owners here where i am at the ghana people and i pay my respect to their elders past present and emerging i also pay tribute to our female female elders past and present and emerging female leaders um this story is an essential part of our story must be remembered as we grow i think it 's pertinent um to be having a discussion at this time you know each day we 're horrified by the images of our friends and family and other people across new south wales and queensland and dealing with the impacts of the floods um whether it 's flood fire drought you know australians have a front row seat to the uh the ravages of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the women in our communities because climate change disproportionately affects women um research following victoria 's black saturday bushfires found an increase in the incidence and severity of domestic and family violence um which is something it 's a horrible statistic because it 's a horrible fact that i wasn 't aware of um quite some time and i think that 's because perhaps we don 't talk about it enough perhaps it 's something that 's a bit too difficult for people to talk about they don 't know how to talk about i mean climate change alone is difficult for people to talk about but i would encourage anybody um who is also alarmed and learned about that statistic today to encourage talking about it and tell other people do other people know about it um i mean it 's not a it 's not a friendly topic it 's not something we want to talk about but i think it 's very very important according to um the united nations 80 of those displaced by climate related disasters and changes around the world are women and girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more pronounced for women who sit at the intersection of those minority groups and i think international women 's day is very important that we 're talking about intersectionality um and particularly in this space so 70 of the 1.3 billion people living in conditions of poverty are women in urban areas at least 40 percent of the poorest households are headed by women and we cannot allow crisis to cause women living with disabilities uh those in the lgbtiq community migrant women and women living in rural remote conflict disaster prone areas you know to disappear even further into obscurity and which is just going to happen if we keep heading in the way that we 're heading in the direction that we 're heading in um you know our inclusion and equality initiatives need more and more to take into account the impact of climate change and when we 're talking about climate change too we need to make sure that we 're looking at um gender equality and intersectionality in that as well you know the time for debate um and discussion is rapidly dwindling it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our fingers especially last um no december during cop 26. i was so proud to suddenly hear discussions around um climate change and you know the need to actually be doing something and i was so incredibly frustrated that i felt like the conversation uh was more directed towards text messages and french presidents and those kinds of things i think you know we lost bit of an opportunity but at the same time i was heartened to hear more of that conversation you know we all need to commit to tangible large-scale solutions vital vital for the health and the future of our world and in particular women you know in melbourne we are proud to set the standard in climate action and sustainability in many ways we have declared a climate and biodiversity emergency and we act on clean energy innovation um and i know tiffany christie you 'd be able to speak to this if anybody uh has more questions later on or wants to know more about this but there 's so much incredible work we 're doing the city melbourne headed by the wonderful women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of melbourne led the transition away from coal and that was through a 10-year 150 million renewable energy group purchase agreement um in an australian first the melbourne renewable energy projects for a group of local governments universities and corporations um collectively purchasing renewable energy we 've now delivered two energy purchasing agreements reducing the equivalent of five percent of the city 's emissions um leading melbourne to be the first capital city council in australia powered by 100 renewable energy um the wind farm supplies energy for town halls bank branches universities street lights across melbourne um and this model 's actually been replicated across australia which is really really cool we 're building on the success with power melbourne and if you haven 't heard about that do do keep your ears and eyes uh open for that one um power melbourne 's basically going to unlock you know the possibilities of uh what can we say coordinated neighborhood scale batteries which will deliver more renewable energy into the grid you know and that 's as well as creating new research education training opportunities for women in stem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access to affordable and renewable energy so the average city melbourne resident lives in an apartment building um 50 of what 51 of our women of our residents are women they 're important stats for us to take note of and this group is currently these are the guys in the apartment building sorry are currently locked out of um renewable energy options such as on-site renewable energy generation um all collected power purchasing agreements due to the property type or uh the scale of energy use so power melbourne is already underway and will play a lead role in reaching our ambition um to become a city powered by 100 renewables by 2030 and reaching at zero emissions by 2040. so um tiff mentioned earlier that i lead the sustainable buildings portfolio and i 'd love to tell you a bit more about that um in the panel discussion so if you have any questions or anything please ask although i must admit um it 's a it sounds very technical but i think at the moment it 's much more of a creative space and that 's why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and without um fantastic people getting together and putting their ideas together we don 't have solutions we can 't come up with solutions and that 's very much the space um myself with the wonderful work of our council offices are in at the moment so um you know it 's really comes from the fact that our community wants our buildings to be built to the highest environmental standards and it 's not just something we want i think it 's becoming very clear that it 's something we absolutely need um you know to meet this expectation we 're going to have to continue to improve the planning provisions that guide development um but i 'll get on to more about that later and getting a few waves um and yeah there 's a huge there 's also a huge incentive for um environmental building because it 's you know we work in office spaces we live in apartments uh we need to look at sustainable building upgrades now i mean take a look at the city of melbourne or i mean any city where you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that infrastructure and building it again overnight um to you know the highest standards there 's got to be a lot of work put into um what we 're doing now so um i look forward to hearing from our expert panel today thank you everybody there 's some really exciting uh conversation that 's about to begin so i 'm not going to rub it on for too much longer um but i hope that everyone comes away inspired energized and looking forward to taking action in their local communities today and i also look forward to seeing you all back in our city soon um and this is something that i do have to mention because it is

the east coast um behind me you can probably just see that 's my sofa bed i 've been sleeping on for the last week and a half after my bedroom was flooded so i 'm one of the lucky ones so i 've only temporarily lost a very small part of my home many people around me were much less fortunate um and for anyone following the devastation will know in particular that lismore and surrounds and now greater sydney have been catastrophically impacted now i 've given a lot of talks about climate change over the last two decades and the impacts that it has on people and communities 20 years ago we were modeling what was likely to happen in coming decades and right now we 're actually living through those predictions we 're seeing cascading unprecedented events unfolding again and again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intractable droughts deadly heat waves one after the other only a few short weeks ago uh before the floods brisbane was suffering through an extreme heat wave an unusually oppressive combination of heat and humidity um the extreme rainfall the rain bomb that 's been occurring these last couple of weeks and the impacts that it had is having on people in their communities is utterly shocking but it 's also absolutely no surprise so our climate has been supercharged any leader who tells you that no one could have predicted these types of events has willfully buried their head deeply in the sand for any of you who 've watched the movie don 't look up that 's basically a documentary of the lived experience of every climate researcher since the 1990s these are exactly the types of events that researchers and emergency management experts have been warning of um loudly for decades these events are why we need an urgent national approach to dealing with the consequences of climate change to take action to be better prepared to put resources towards building resilience in our towns cities and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are robust that our infrastructure is protected and that we have the capacity to respond adequately to mega emergencies like this one when they occur so not only do we need to be prepared for these events but we also need urgent and meaningful reductions in greenhouse gas emissions because these events are only going to get worse our capacity to respond has demonstrably already been surpassed as we 've seen over black summer and now these mega floods our emergency response capacity simply can 't keep up with the ravages of climate change the large-scale catastrophic multi-region impacts that are already occurring so first the bad news because greenhouse gas emissions release to date there 's about another 20 years of warming for us to get through we 're very likely to exceed the 1.5 degree average warming target that was set in paris in 2015 this last decade the hottest on record will soon be being remembered as one of the coolest this means more intense more frequent heat waves more dangerous bushfires and these are occurring in areas that weren 't previously prone to bushfires uh prolonged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of health consequences there are the direct impacts from these extreme events heat exposure hospitalizations and deaths injuries and trauma and there 's also mental health impacts on survivors there are also other impacts such as mosquito-borne disease which is something especially to be on the lookout for after periods of heavy rainfall thunderstorm asthma which you 're familiar with in melbourne because climate change means more pollen and that pollen is also more allergenic impacts on food production affecting accessibility accessibility and affordability of fresh produce and displacement and conflict over resources one of the biggest health impacts of climate change catastrophes like the floods over this last week and a half is the impacts on mental health which can carry over for some time after the queensland 2011 floods um reported incidents of family violence increased and residents affected by the floods were more than five times five times more likely to report poorer health and more than twice as likely to report post-traumatic stress disorder than those who weren 't affected by the floods loss of loved ones homes family treasures cars businesses and livelihoods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and long-term mental health trauma women and girls around the world as it 's been mentioned bear more of the brunt of climate change than men in large part particularly because they 're over represented in poverty climate catastrophes exacerbate inequality women are much more likely than men to die in a disaster they might less likely to swim less literate have less decision making power can 't drive can 't be out unaccompanied all those sorts of factors really impact on women in an emergency women are also more likely to be providing care for those in a disease outbreak they 're also more likely to be vulnerable to violence in emergency shelters they 're also more exposed quite often to injuries from having to travel further for example to collect water if there 's no water available where they 're living and they tend to put the nutrition and medical needs of their family before their own so we 've seen um just here in australia examples of this where women working from home during covert were still doing the lion 's share of childhood and other unpaid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action we take today still matters in fact it matters now more than ever so if the world can harvest emissions this decade and reach net zero by 2040 we do have a chance of avoiding the worst consequences of climate change and being able to stabilize temperatures below two degrees before slowly coming back down to where they should be for australia to do its fair share that actually means cutting our emissions by 75 this decade and reaching net zero by 2035. the only way to do this is to switch to an energy system based on renewables because of the decades of delay there 's now no room for any amount of coal or gas expansion in australia that 's a cold hard fact gas is not a transition fuel it 's a dangerous greenhouse gas and it 's also bad for our health and our children 's health wherever it 's burned so we have a very small window of action eight years if you like more good news um it 's worth noting has been mentioned that it 's frequently women who are leading action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ australia and internationally and it 's often young women so whether it 's greta tunberg and sweden vanessa nakate from uganda or anna rose in australia what also gives me hope is the growing cast of women in australia who 've stepped forward as independent candidates in both the house of reps and the senate in this coming federal election on a platform of climate action spurring on national conversation because this is the conversation that we need to be having right now thank you thank you so much hillary that was really inspiring and uh well sobering at the same time terrific to also reflect on what we can do and the positives of the conversation moving on now um to introduce you to our next speaker and discussing living a waste-free conscious consumption uh tamara dimattina fairfax media called tamara the pr to pr to the planet and in january 2010 tamara visited dharavi in mumbai 's slum to see where waste from the west goes to get recycled and then in march in the same year visited antarctica to study sustainability returning to undertake a fellowship at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by nothing new month the shopping detox campaign that receives global media coverage and in 2012 created the new joneses a living pop-up installation that inspires us to make everyday lifestyle choices that are good for us and our planet buy nothing new month and the new joneses are taking green from mungbean to mainstream when covert wiped out the new jones 's award-winning lifestyle activations tamara turned it into a digital doco an ev powered road trip featuring that 's what i reckon um the hollywood hollywood actor yale stone and stephen curry so tomorrow i believe you 're going to be sharing with us your insights on living a waste-free conscious consumption lifestyle welcome tomorrow thank you very much tiffany um and i 'm glad i remember to take myself off mute i 'm coming to you today from the lands of the cooler nations and i 'm very honored to be amongst all of you here today thank you for having me um i feel like i think many women suffer impostor syndrome but certainly on a day like this um in the company that i 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm just an everyday person who thinks the way that we are living and consuming on our planet is nuts um my background is pr and communications media relations and i used to work for a pr agency fmcg which is fast-moving consumer goods which couldn 't be further from where i am now my job was to get people to buy stuff that they didn 't need most of us have heard this quote with money they don 't have to impress people that they don 't like um and i hated it so i um i went out on my own wanting to do comms for good but i didn 't really know what that looked like i was doing a lot of work in the mental health space which was i was very passionate about but it wasn 't really until i went to antarctica um in 2010 and um and arabi in mumbai to the slums to see where so much of the waste from the west goes and the people who are not creating this waste um have to deal with our rubbish i really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not turn away to what was going on but not having any background in this space i studied at the centre for sustainability leadership in melbourne where i really learnt um what was what was going on on our planet and felt very um inspired to do something about it so i created by nothing new month i 'm a big believer of that idea of do what what you can with what you 've got where you are and i 'd always just been so confused by waste um and this stuff even as a kid driving around the streets at night and i wasn 't driving obviously in the back seat lights are on in all the retail stores and all the stuff and i used to think where does it go where does it come from and where does it go so when i started looking into this stuff i realized it comes from our precious finite resources there 's not a never-ending supply of this stuff we 're digging it out of the ground we 're stripping all this stuff out of beautiful mother nature we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's heading to landfill creating disastrous environmental consequences for us all but then i realized the beautiful alternative to this very wasteful life is better for us it 's better for our people it 's better for our planet it 's better for our pockets so the alternative is not a um is not giving up stuff and that 's what i 've really learned in my journey over the last 12 years i haven 't bought anything new yes undies and bras included if they 've got the tags on media always want to know that so if they 've got the tags on i 'll still buy that stuff second hand everything in my life my beautiful home all the clothing i wear everything in my kitchen the it stuff i use my phones it 's all sourced secondhand and it 's a really easy way that i 've found that we can all immediately today get on board to start making the changes that we all need to see so i 'd love everyone who 's listening today don 't don 't admire us and don 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action because i 'm i 've been saying this stuff for 12 years and i don 't want to have people walking away going that was inspiring and not do the stuff we really need everyone to get on board now and start doing the stuff um my journey when i started by nothing new month i was working with the city of sydney and they loved the idea of buy nothing new month and they wanted me to create a live piece instead of just the media relations campaign that it had been and i said oh easy we 'll install a house we 'll deck it out with secondhand stuff and we 'll engage all the local retailers who sell second-hand stuff and it 'll be fantastic everyone will see how great and easy it is to lighten their footprint um and how wrong i was 12 years ago i got slammed by the then premiere who was saying i was nuts um and everyone should ignore buy nothing new month and everyone needs to go out and shop more and buy more stuff so i 'm so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea but that 's um that 's their where the new joneses came from i didn 't want all the beautiful messages of our waste free life to be lost in this media um i want to use the term shitstorm but i probably can 't say that it was a media storm um and so i created the new joneses which i 'd love people to check it out because i 've done all the hard work for you anyone who 's listening and is confused about do i do this or do i do that with taken all the sustainable development goals made them more engaging entertaining and easy to do the stuff we 've made a super simple like tick off 10 list for you um please check out the new joneses we show what we can all do every day from our choice of bank choice of energy company at the super funds we choose the food we eat how we get rid of that food the stuff we buy all of those things are having an impact but the really inspiring thing is that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we 're spitting out into the atmosphere throughout consumer lifestyles um [Music] i want to talk to you about how we do the stuff that we do and my frustration i 've engaged people like heavy metal musicians architects builders there are so many people doing so much great work across the board i 'm very frustrated by the lack of mainstream media engagement and understanding of the issues and our governments i think i 'll probably skip over that to avoid any controversy but everything that we do is trying to engage more people to be part of this growing movement when i started doing this 12 years ago people would ask me how 's your charity work going which was just a stab to my heart because i would think um breathing clean air and drinking clean water and having a habitable planet and a healthy place um for everyone uh that 's not charity work i think that 's really essential and so i 'm so thrilled today that the people that we 're interviewing for the new joneses doco series we 've got afl players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on board we 've got male coal workers who 've been in the coal industry for 40 years sticking their necks out saying it 's time everyone needs to get on board so i think it 's um it 's time now for everyone to to do the things take the actions and and get on board don 't be inspired just do the actions they 're all they 're all there we know what we need to do if you need a little um if you need a hint please go to the new joneses.com we don 't sell anything we just want you to live a a lighter waist-free lifestyle and join us and get on board be part of this movement that is creating um a better place for all of us and looking after the planet that we all share thank you so much tamara it 's really fantastic um to hear about your work and i 've got i 'm going to come out of the closet now and say that i have almost exclusively bought my all of my work wardrobe from op shops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work now i am open about it and tell people that i just bought this designer silk dress for four dollars from the op shop and they look slightly horrified that i 've told them but now i do it proudly and crystal will attest to this might you krista um but we 'd love to find out more about the new joneses and we 'll all be going online what you said tiffany i love that because you 've just nailed it it 's buying second-hand stuff it 's activism that you can weigh up because people always say to me where did you get that and my response is always the same it 's always from an op shop so your spending and your consumption is going to help the op shops do their amazing work in the community and it opens up the conversation so i 'm really pleased that you said that great we 'll have a panel discussion now and i 'm going to hand over to my brilliant job share partner christa milne but not before i introduce her christa has worked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together in another capacity here at the city of melbourne and she 's led a lot of our world-leading initiatives here at the city of melbourne so i 've just embarrassed you a bit krista um but we look forward to this conversation i 'll hand over to you now thank you tiffany and um thank you to all our speakers for those inspiring uh words stories about um your work in the climate change space um it 's a great pleasure to join the stage today uh it 's always a pleasure um tiff and i have a great time job sharing and living out gender equality and making it work for us and that 's been a really pleasurable experience in our career really fantastic to continue the dialogue please if you have questions uh post them in the chat we 've got a few that we 'll start off with but we 'd really like to get to audience questions so please um please share those so um yeah we 'd like to explore uh your views to all the speakers um on and ideas on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomorrow so many of you referenced uh women and girls in the in your experiences in your careers focused on climate change and action um so maybe firstly to you hillary uh you mentioned you know climate change does impact girls and women more um disproportionately can you talk a bit more can you expand on that experience um and some of the research that you 've come across and done in that space and and how we are dealing with those impacts that 's an absolutely huge question krista but thank you um i i think um i might just start by saying it 's not just um the impacts of of a climate catastrophe that affects women and girls more than more than men and boys but it 's also some of the drivers of climate change as well so in particular if we 're thinking about um you know sources of cooking fuel in many countries um as a cause of indoor air pollution which which kills around i think it 's around four million people every year um it 's it 's largely you know women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children who are exposed to that um so the sort of burning um of solid fuels inside the house um in very unventilated um in very unventilated places so um so it 's also the sort of the dirty fuel if you like is also um um you know uh causing immediate health impacts on um on women um so i think you know if we 're thinking about disproportionate impacts on on women and girls we 're probably it 's probably a little bit less of an issue in australia unless you 're thinking about the caring responsibilities that that women tend to take on um you know so um you know i i just think about uh queensland closing the schools last week you know yet again and you know it 'll be women working from home who are who tend to be managing that um that care of the children as well so so if we 're talking about countries like australia that 's kind of where that impact is is probably rather than um you know in increases in drownings for example but if we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women um and it is for sort of a multitude of reasons um and but the main one is poverty so it tends to be women who tend to live in poverty um disproportionately in poverty um and the thing about climate change i 'll stop rambling in a second but the thing about climate change too is it actually um the the the disasters and the changes to to climate um because of you know the greenhouse gases that we 're pumping into the atmosphere that also that 's also serving to keep people in poverty so it makes it very hard if your crops are failing if you 've got you know rampant malaria all of these things it 's very hard to actually get out of get out of poverty as well so climate change is actually affecting um global capacity to deal with it for poverty reduction and that 's something it may it 's just such a complex um complex issue so if you like climate change is going to be keeping women in poverty um much more than they would otherwise be so it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humanitarian disasters um which is um you know what what what we can see with climate change um uh conflict um displacement those sorts of things they 're they 're the things that we 're expecting to have the biggest impacts on people 's health and well-being you know you might think it 's a um you know a one-off flood or a one-off bushfire or something like that but it 's actually those really complex things where you 're going to get people fighting over resources you know massive displacements of people and that that leads to greater risk for women as well you know i talked about sort of emergency emergency shelters and sort of um you know it exposes women much more to um risks of violence so it is it 's a very complex big question um and i you know can 't give you all the answers right right now a fantastic um diversity there and it 's certainly there 's a numerous kind of comments there that i hadn 't really connected the dots between the climate change and domestic violence for example so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melbourne has that impact that um we it increases incidences of violence because just heat stress causes causes stress in people and so that has an impact locally um right turning to sorry i 've got mosquitoes buzzing around me turning to uh tamara and kathleen deutch uh we 've heard a bit about uh some of the things that people can do on individual level and we 've also got this political uh movement happening where women are standing up and saying um we 've had enough i 'm going to enter politics what what sort of sits in the middle in terms of what can people do further at the community at the individual level and maybe at the community level to take action on climate or live more sustainable lives from your experience maybe tomorrow you 're off mute do you want to go first yeah um i think uh it 's really important to acknowledge whilst there 's a great just for me to speak on behalf of myself such disappointment of our um i 'm going to say of our federal government our for our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to talk about a gas-led recovery from covered um the deep heartbreak to hear that coming from a leader but i 'm so inspired and um there is so much community action so much action in business groups and people leaving seeing that our government and we are a prior on the global stage when it comes to climate turning away from that and doing it themselves so i would hope everyone would feel really empowered that there 's so much going on in australia and community groups individuals um and not to self-promote but just bump back to the new joneses to see the things that you can do it 's all many of them are free it 's um yeah i don 't think any of them cost you any money some of them they 're major actions that you can take we try to break it down and make it very easy for everyone to understand the most impactful things that we can do as i mentioned before they are things like changing your bank changing your energy company changing your superannuation fund think of where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the super fund that you 're in invested with they 're going to take your money investing in coal or gas or they 're going to take it and invest it in renewables so that 's a massive thing that you can do so we do have these solutions we know what they are they 're easy as i said change your bank change your energy company um educating girls is one of the biggest things that we can do um and we have an episode on this we interviewed jane carro am for the new joneses season one of our road trip again all the content is free for you to for everyone to enjoy at the new joneses.com um educating girls is one of the biggest things that we can all do i 'm not going to go and teach a girl individually but i can i can support the organizations like one girl or these incredible organizations around the world that are um supporting the education of girls when women and girls are educated it changes the world so there 's a the old quote i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a girl and you educate a nation so the impact of educating girls um they can they go on to marry later have fewer children and can make better decisions they know more about their own rights make better decisions for themselves for their communities which impacts they 're the way that they live and the way that they um experience the world their impact on the world so find a local organisation support the education of girls that 's another massive thing that we can do we have all these solutions at our fingertips again it 's simple it 's like so like all the things we know what to do so get on board do it today go to the new joiners and see what you can do print it off and start ticking it off some of them are so simple um but so impactful great thank you and councillor dodge your deutsche perspective on um the communities that you are within whether that 's uh through your um counsellor role or your role with the um cfmeu what 's your perspective on actions that we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women in those actions um i kind of want to echo a little bit of what tamara was just saying uh to be honest i think conversations education is important and it 's i don 't say it 's underrated but you know i think we take the ground that education is doing a course or doing something you know formally to educate ourselves but some of the best uh opportunities i 've had to educate myself and other people have genuinely been through conversations and collaboration and you know going out for brunch or something with my girlfriends um and just talking to them about what i know what my experiences are in terms of climate change impact um even speaking about you know the disasters we 've seen up in new south wales and queensland ex like just explaining to people well you know the connection between that and climate change it 's not obvious to a lot of people especially i think a lot of our people of my friends in particular they 're not engaged in politics or social justice matters necessarily but they do care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain it to them their minds are blown and they 're you know they 're completely taken back you know absolutely horrified and the more we have those conversations the more people are going to become involved um in getting themselves educated educating others and taking climate action themselves never take the ground to what somebody knows or you know what they think they want to know and yeah i think that 's probably the best thing we 've been doing and i suppose on a community level as well the more we have those conversations the more people want to get involved i mean with my work at the cfmeu building and construction industry just i 'm one of the first people to begin talking about uh i suppose the environment and climate change within the realms of the work that we 're doing at the union um and there are so many people who are interested in finding out more and want to get involved and want to know what they can do and um you know there 's all these projects we 're looking at launching and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah get educated in terms of those um within the cfmu or in the sustainable buildings um sector which i know is a um a strong interest of yours can you um see some strong leadership opportunities that emerge for women in that space in taking action in sort of bringing in general women 's interest in climate change and and then sustainable buildings uh together what opportunities do you see for women 's leadership in the space um absolutely there are opportunities and huge opportunities and you know what one of the best things for me about um the kind of the intersection between the construction and building industry and action on climate change is that it 's a it 's really an emerging field there 's a lot of work being done i guess in the domestic sector and there 's a lot of conversations about you know how to build sustainably and what the perfect building should look like um but in the scale of things and considering the amount of you know work theories around engineering and all that kind of stuff it is very much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women to dominate and and to shape you know we don 't have to you know walk in the shadows of men who have been doing this for hundreds of years before us you know um it 's it 's something new that we can take and we can make it our own and you know there 's so much space for innovative thinking um again for education how we how i take my messages around climate change and um speak to other people about it especially those people who haven 't been engaged in conversations is completely shaping for the first time the way that we 're going to be having those conversations from here on i just felt a large glass of water excuse me because it hasn 't happened before so uh that 's a huge opportunity and you know what i think not to play on stereotypes or anything but there 's an opportunity to use that to your advantage sometimes it 's some of the uh the blokes that i work with um i mean they associate climate change with caring and that 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't know how to do that but it also means their eyes and ears are open to what we 've got to say um you know and it 's a place it 's there 's plenty of room for us there and where there 's not room we 're there and we 're taking up space and anyone any women who have ideas i want to get involved to have the conversations get involved and take up space start talking to other people about your ideas because the opportunities are there some fantastic perspectives and certainly um aligned with my experience in the space over over many years and something that i um as a manager constantly found interesting was that i only had women applying for roles i was like why is this you know you can 't you know you want to join a gender diverse team when you 're um uh building a team but it it was often challenging because of some of those things um okay uh moving back to hillary so what do you think some of the most pressing issues we have as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to address creating a more sustainable and equal at the same time future for everyone right um well thanks thanks christopher again a really huge question um if we um in australia if we could transition our transport that would do a great deal um so that 's that 's the the largest single contributor if you liked i 'm just talking climate change at the moment um to greenhouse gas contributions in australia so we need to we we basically need to electrify our energy system um and use clean sources of energy to produce that electricity so solar and wind we now have battery storage so you know again anyone who says oh but the sun doesn 't always shine and the wind doesn 't always blow that 's what batteries are for and there 's a great opportunity in australia to um because you know we we actually have the um a lot of the the minimum resources required to to make those batteries so you know we can transition from coal mining to mining for for materials for batteries so um you know there 's it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's about directing if you like directing the work to where it needs to go for us to be a much more sustainable society we do need to move i guess the most important thing is to get the message out there that we actually do need to move away from from gas um any idea that it 's some transition fuel that that ship actually sailed about 20 years ago so anyone who 's still trying to sell it is that um i don 't know where they 've been for the last 20 years um it 's a there 's absolutely no room for gas as a transition fuel in australia we can switch straight to renewables um new renewable energy is actually cheaper now than new coal and gas um so we shouldn 't you know even from a and just a purely um basic boring economic perspective we shouldn 't even be looking at expanding coal and gas we should be looking straight to renewables um so renewables will actually drive down the power bill so i think that in terms of the challenge that um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the political spin on um on coal and and gas in this country um you know for far too long that 's sort of been given priority you know there 's the talk um i 'm all for um you know transitioning um out of coal mining in a just way we can see it coming we 've been able to see it coming for some time so there 's no excuse to to suddenly sort of leave communities and people high and dry so we do need to work on that but you also need to wonder why there 's so much concern over for example 30 000 coal jobs in australia where you don 't hear a peep about the 40 000 academic staff who lost their jobs during covert you know that kind of thing um the 60 000 people who are employed in tourism to do with the great barrier reef which won 't be there if we don 't deal with climate change so um it 's a it 's a matter of being able to really direct um you know we have choices um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our resources um and those choices clearly have to be towards a much more sustainable um sustainable australia and without expanding coal and gas mining but switching straight to clean renewables fantastic thanks um for that really uh you said it was a large question but you 've given us a great snapshot there we 've now um got a question from our audience thank you very much and um while i 'm sharing this question um please if anyone else has got any more uh we 've got a few minutes left so please post the questions in the chat um so this is from anita who has asked for all the panelists opinions on whether um we think that climate action is something that is exclusive to those that are more well-off how can we involve those that are from a lower socio-economic background or do you think that most of the weight falls on those that can afford to take action uh tomorrow i might go to you first you 're off mute so that 's a great question thank you very much question it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do anything about climate change are currently most impacted um so i think the responsibility is on everyone and uh there 's but there are actions that we can all take like we for the new jones of season one we interviewed tish king she 's a proud torres strait island woman and she was talking to us about how her homelands are already they 're being impacted by climate change the king tides they they 're they 're having to leave their their homelands they haven 't done they haven 't been consuming in the wasteful way that that we have to create that um i think so a lot of people who are really impacted feel it and they understand it better sometimes wealthier people are very buffeted by many things whether it was covered um people didn 't expect everyone experienced that very differently but again climate change if you 've got a lot of money you can be nice you can um heat and cool your home or get away from these disasters um but i think there 's a great responsibility for all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um but again that there are so many things that we can do that are free cheap and as i was pointing out before i think one of the greatest um stuff ups of humanity has been this crazy consumer treadmill that we 've all gotten on so if people want to save the planet they can stop shopping so much stop buying so much stuff that we don 't need um so much of my lifestyle is it 's inexpensive like i remember years ago thinking is someone putting money in my bank account because i used to compare myself to a girlfriend who earned a lot more money than me and yet was always in debt but she was spending a huge amount of money on stuff and i was saving money by having a much smaller footprint um you know in all the actions that we take many of the actions that we we take um we are reducing our footprint print when we reduce our spend and expenditure so i wonder if i 've addressed your question but um i think we all we all have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are so many areas that we can tackle and i think it 's very important to say it 's not about a few of us doing this perfectly we need all of us doing it imperfectly and get on board and start start with the free things but yeah i think it 's it 's for everyone to do um whether it 's free completely free stuff like eliminating your food waste keeping those food scraps from the bin getting that back into the soil doesn 't cost you anything but it 's one of the biggest impacts that we can have everyone can change their bank everyone can change their um their energy company so there are so many actions that we can take that are um going to have a massive positive impact on our footprint and cost us nothing and can sometimes save us a lot of money as well fantastic i think that 's a great a great summary that everyone has a role to play um and do what you can within your context um hillary this is questions are coming fast now in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floods are linked to climate change um this is from cath um we know that i know they are but have trouble explaining it to friends they understand bush fires but not floods yeah sure i 'm sorry i just um i called kath kate in the chat sorry about that kath um yeah so climate council is usually putting out a very helpful explainer um this week so keep an eye out for that it 'll do a better job than i 'll do right here but the the basics of it is that a warmer atmosphere holds more water um and that that water can then um is there therefore they 're available um to be you know fall as rain um and cause that flooding and what we 've been seeing um what we 've been predicting for decades and what we 've been seeing in in more recent times is that rainfall um is is it might happen um so you might get more unpredictability in general rainfall patterns so um you might get longer periods of dry but when it does rain those um the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intense than they would otherwise have been but do keep an eye out for the climate councils explainer coming out this week i think you 'll find that very helpful and that 's a great question because often we think climate change it 's just about the um you know heat waves and things like that but it 's actually climate change underpins absolutely all the weather that we 're seeing today is underpinned by climate change fantastic thank you hillary um next question is what 's the panel 's advice on how we as every day people can advocate for more renewable energy investment from our national leaders anyone want to councillor deutsch do you want to go with that one tiff you can go for it am i going to tamara sorry yes go for it mine 's not so much about advocating with the leaders but everyone can change your energy company today have a look you can google i think greenpeace have a fantastic list that they put out every year on who are the greenest energy companies in the land and change like with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy and i will say not to name any names but the biggest energy companies that we know are some of them are the biggest polluters in the country and many of you listening today will be giving your money to those companies so pick up the phone use the internet find out who is the company that you can give your money to and help them um with the transition to the renewable energy future [Music] fantastic advice any other counselor deutsch yeah i just want to weigh in i think the best the best way to send a message to um the federal government is on election day uh your vote is the strongest message you can send um and don 't think that your vote ever gets lost amongst the millions of other australians they look at every single first preference vote and where it went every politician does um and even if you know you 're on a safe in a safe seat or you don 't think it matters uh trust me it absolutely does vote for the party that you believe um will deliver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parties that uh preference uh the coal mining industries all those kind of um let 's say anti-climate change action uh industries fantastic well we have reached uh one minute before one o 'clock so i think it that 's been a great discussion thank you for your perspectives tamara councillor deutsche and hillary and i 'll hand back to my uh job share partner in crime and in action tf crawford to wrap up thanks christa thanks panelists what a brilliant conversation um it is a call to action isn 't it uh not to just sit in in our positions in our homes in our roles and sit back but we need to continue to talk to inspire those around us and to do more because we are running out of time we 've heard today that higher levels of gender equality are linked with greater action on climate and we know that women 's leadership can and already is driving progress on climate policies and we also know that women are disproportionately impacted by the crisis um by heat we 're more likely to die in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declining ecosystems by water insecurity and flooding um so in that we also know that cities are key players in addressed in addressing gender and climate challenges and doing that together it is something that we are really committed to here at the city of melbourne um we are leading some work uh is the first city in um in the nation to be localizing the sustainable development goals and this is really important in fact sdg 5 concerns gender equality and that recognizes that gender equality is foundational in achieving the sdgs and both a gender equal and sustainable planet um there has been that 's not let 's not despair there has been lots of progress in the last decade there are more girls going to school there are fewer girls being forced into early marriage there are more women serving in parliament and and seeking those positions of power that we need them to have laws are being reformed to advance gender equality but there is still so much to do and we are all part of continuing continuing to make that progress and that means women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just sits with us as women and the many men that are joining us in this conversation today thank you talk to your friends um and your family about that and ask them what they 're doing what action they are taking in their lives so thank you um i will say goodbye now and i hope you 're all feeling inspired not worn down let 's remain motivated and energized and thanks for coming along today

affected that much social change that i 'm aware of in fact i used to be a professional fancy man you know waving my jazz hands around a restaurant critic and a magazine editor um and i was here in melbourne in my capacity as a professional fancy man a few years ago when the fuderati of the world descended on the city for the world 's 50 best restaurants right here in australia a proud moment in australian gastronomy and uh in my capacity as a professional fancy man i it was my happy duty to show people around so i had you know fellow fancy men women and others from beirut from paris from rome from texas i just made the texas up but they were from all over the place you know very worldly fancy people and we went to fancy places and we ate some fancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fancy old time lord mayor it was great and after this you know orgy of fanciness i had a chat to them afterwards and i said what did you think they said yeah look you know the fancy restaurants are great you know like your restaurants are as fancy as anything in the world your wine is wonderful you know coffee you 're the great coffee boys of the world but what we really like is the way you actually live we like the way you eat and drink every day in melbourne we 've got fancy restaurants back in beirut and paris and texas probably but what we really admire is the fact that eating and drinking well is something that everyone in melbourne seems to be interested in you know we think this is not this is not what we expect from you in the english-speaking world you know this is not how it 's done i think what we have in melbourne is unique um i think that we have the fancy restaurants we have that we have even non-fancy restaurants we have a robust and interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know do the food of one city from italy or one city from vietnam we have bars that just do non-alcoholic drinks that 's pretty out there but it 's not just restaurants it 's the food that people in melbourne eat and drink and cook and buy every day so last year or over the last year i got to know the five kilometers around my house quite well i 'm sure many of you did in my five kilometres i can buy a rooster i can buy fresh yeast i can buy black cardamom and green hazelnuts i know where to get bread from ethiopia and i know where to get noodles from china all within my five kilometers and i can tell you i 'm a newly minted melbourne i 've only lived here for two years great time to come down and get into the events business and move to victoria couldn 't have timed it better but i can tell you that it 's not like this in the rest of australia it 's not like this in any other australian city and i think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this in pretty much the rest of the world we need to savour this we need to treasure this and we need to protect this i think i have a segway here somewhere hot bear with me but if you 're if you live in melbourne and you you know i assume most of you do live in melbourne you know this i don 't need to tell you that um food and hospitality are very frequently the anchors for communities the places where neighborhoods grow and it might not be the food you know it 's it 's the people as much as anything else it 's who gets together at the table but who has a seat at the table and i think i think both of you have touched on this i mean uh my job at the melbourne food and wine festival again there 's a certain amount of fancy man work involved with that but in the festival that we were going to be bringing to life almost exactly one year ago this week we were doing things differently we were very interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melbourne you know so we were going to take all the exciting chefs visiting from around the world and we 're going to make all their talks free so we took them out of the auditoriums and out of the restaurants and we put them into the queen victoria market anyone your your clients or colleagues at street beck you mentioned before that maybe the the people you work with can 't afford to go the kind of events we do at the melbourne food and wine festival but a festival that truly celebrates the food mine in melbourne is one that 's available to everyone and for that we need a food and drink scene that is available to everyone the novelist william gibson wrote that the future is already here it 's just not evenly distributed yet looking at the speakers here and thinking of yoast wherever he is wrestling yabbies back in the tank at future food systems right now you could argue that we have the technology we have the ideas we have the people we have the re-wildlings we have the buildings we have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to share our knowledge about our food systems we need to share the exact information that you guys talked about the fact that we need to protect our peri-urban farming and we need to make sure that the people who bring the food to our tables are recognized and protected as well um we need to strengthen what we have in drawing back drawing people back to hospitality you know there 's never been a harder time to get staff in hospitality it was the hardest thing in hospitality before the pandemic hit and now it 's the hardest thing minus danny valen you 're in the crowd yeah how many how many temporary visa loot workers did we shed in australia last year i think it was six hundred thousand temporary visa holders in total and a very large number of that of that number came from hospitality and tourism what i think we need in victorian hospitality and you know as a part of the city of melbourne is we need to invest in making hospitality a place where you don 't just feel safe and secure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already here we just have to make sure that everyone has access to it brilliant well what a great way to kick off a conversation thank you you 're pretty good at responding to stitch ups pat that was fantastic uh well look thanks to all the speakers i 'm going to kick off with a question each but really keen if you 've got questions um you can start to let me know with a nod a wink or hand up traditional way and i will come to you next i 'm going to go back to jeremy for a moment on the league tables of most densely populated cities in the world manila is leading the way at the moment with 46 178 people per square kilometer we 've then got cities that we i think we all love to go to and we admire like paris which is around 21 000 people per square kilometer and new york which is about 19 000 people per square kilometer based on our city of melbourne so our municipality 37.5 square kilometers about 180 000 people we 're at 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go you touched on a theme earlier i call it density done well uh 83 of our population currently lives in a multi-storey dwelling of some sort tell us well often the feedback comes to me that we already too over populated within the city and yet we know we 've got two big urban renewal areas such as fisherman 's bend and arden i feel like we 've got space to grow but we want to grow well jeremy can you tell us a little bit more about your thoughts on density done well and what is the capacity that we have in melbourne to do that thanks um why should i change back back thanks sally um the interesting thing is that there 's no equity to the way that our city works so um at the south end of our city um in south bank our density is denser than new york um whereas you know in craggy burn our density is you know lower than just about in texas you know let 's let 's talk about houston um so there 's this interesting problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with people stacked vertically and then incredible urban sprawl where people are building where we should be growing our food and what we do know is the further someone lives from the city the lower their chances are in life so they require two cars per household they spend a lot of their time tied up in a car each way um and the average cost of running a car last time abs checked was ten and a half thousand dollars a year including depreciation and so when you 're on a low income or you 're a hospitality worker with no fixed income or guaranteed to that income it becomes incredibly problematic we know that at the city 's edges in very low density that there 's low social capital and what that is is you know the ability for people to be able to access work the opportunity for work the opportunity for social connection the opportunity for study the opportunity for basic things like a medical center a dentist a place that you can walk to to buy some milk and bread without having to require a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy a loaf of bread and a liter of milk and then if we think about you know cities like paris you know six seven and eight stories and what an incredible city it is and if you think about that you know the place that is now heritage listed that we all look at look to as like an icon in the world paris had to adopt massive change in the late 1850s so it was a city that was you know bursting at the seams it was largely two and three stories they had a population problem they had a health problem and large parts of paris were replanned demolished and rebuilt and there was massive outcry at the time um and obviously the old marae district in paris is still you know the old gothic part which is still incredibly beautiful but what resulted in paris was yeah six stories seven stories and eight stories separation between those buildings good access to natural light and ventilation and florence nightingale will tell you that 's very good for your health and beyond that the other thing that happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with that accommodation the price of housing in paris went down and people from all around europe flocked to paris as the place to be and so following the rebuilding of paris that 's when toulouse-lautrec turned up in paris that 's when everyone flocked to paris that 's when paris became the arts and the thinking capital the intellectual capital of europe and i think that melbourne has that opportunity i think there 's plenty of vacant space in the dockland sally that if we offered at concessional rents to artists thinkers um you know people at an affordable rent if we weren 't driven by some economic system instead we were thinking about social capital i think that we 'd really start to re-engineer the place that melbourne is and you know as you said pat it 's already an incredible place so i think that you know the problem for us is that melbourne has density done generally very poorly and there are there are examples of it done well and i think that rob adams and your city design team had it right you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know a long match of transport corridors and it should be about you know six stories and we can handle our density growth really well at a similar density to copenhagen fantastic some good things we can come back to there uh and particularly given just some quick stats so here in docklands and on a normal day uh it 's been our fastest growing employment precinct so pre-covered there 'd be 72 000 workers coming into this precinct and there are about 12 000 residents so very much in employment zone if we accept as we should that the way that we work has changed forever in good ways you know we 've been looking for flexible working remote working for decades now and coverts really accelerated that what does it mean for the spaces here and how we can repurpose some of those as well i know that excites you jeremy but it 'd be good to get some of those conversations going we 're certainly getting lots of suggestions at the city of melbourne and then just lastly on that there are 47 of the shop fronts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been able to survive through covet and that sense of devastation that comes through empty spaces then impacts everybody else who 's still trying to have a go so how do we quickly pirouette i call it instead of pivot i got over that word pirouette to activating those spaces and we agreed to a program this week at council to invest and we 're now looking for ideas on how we can can pirouette in that way so we 'd love any ideas about that as well just to come to beck giving you some some warning we 've um we loved that visualization of you flying uh into the city from mount bourbon of what we could be and uh to to go to another end of the scale each spring in the city outside town hall we have these mini farms that are in big pots and we grow corn and pumpkins and zucchinis and tomatoes and and peas birds come insects come people come herbs lettuces spinach it 's a tiny little micro farm which has all of these brilliant benefits not least of which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always wash first but you are welcome to take the produce so we see these microfarms we have your vision of what the city could be when it is a farm again tell us about what you may have seen at scale here or other places around the world and how do you see that we can build scale because it can actually come from a lot of microfarms based on what i heard you say earlier yeah i mean if i think about different places i 've been overseas you know i think about traveling to la many many years ago and standing outside the la town hall and it was this gigantic piece of concrete but what they had done is is rebuilt a victory garden um the kind of victory gardens that were built during the war war time that was you know just the whole of this part of la was just an enormous garden and you know it was a garden that was on an artificial structure you know it was it was straight down onto the concrete but if i think about you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a really beautiful one in vancouver called hope street farms uh it 's got phenomenal amount of contaminated land that 's that it 's essentially grown new wicking beds on top of and so all of that contaminated land now is creating is is growing this incredible regenerative kind of produce that goes into top restaurants kind of around the city but it 's also a training and employment venue for people who really need a hand if i think about sitting in temple temple hoffer garden in in berlin you know many of you have probably been there but that 's a garden in a community garden an enormous kind of environmental park that you will equally be sitting you know playing your guitar as you as your family will be sitting around in your little community allotment garden uh there 's you know walk off to one side and there 's an amazing you know little um telephone booth that 's now a micro library and the garden is the place where you come together as a as a community um so i 've been to so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become part of the fabric of of the city and one of the things that i you know when i first started street you know it was the first little food cart that i pushed out onto federation square in 2010 the reason why i wanted it to be street food and in public space was because i 'd been living in vietnam and i saw again and again how a community comes together over food you don 't cook your breakfast you know in your house but what you do is even in the middle of the monsoon you come out onto tiny little plastic blue stools and you sit out as a whole community and you share food together and what the food did is it became the social capital it became the the way that you have conversations the way it 's the currency of that city because you come together three times a day as a community around that food rather than sitting in your house watching television and so that preciousness i think of those kind of rituals that we can create around both eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the way that um indigenous communities have often used food as you know this city you know it 's here because it was a food bowl but it was here because we had so many different food ecosystems you know down on the south bank side it 's incredible marshland with all of this you know wetlands with all of this kind of teeming wildlife there where we are now was kind of far more murnong daisy fields but right beside us down here is you know this beautiful river that had you know great big waterfall that was at you know queen street and there was a great big waterfall there that that separated out a freshwater ecosystem from a saltwater ecosystem but we blew the whole thing up um to try and get more ships being able to move up and if i think about you know ceremony and social gathering in this city for you know what would be tens of thousands of years was around a food bowl and i and i think that possibility of of doing exactly what you were saying pat you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we make it accessible how do we make that food system inclusive that 's what i 'm passionate about you know the young people that we work with you know we embed into our hospitality businesses they 've come from parkville and malmsbury prisons they 've come from sleeping rough all around the streets of melbourne they 've come from detox they 've come from the homelessness shelters and and i 'm really interested in how do you use this food system to be the place that brings people together because most of all i think what food can do is it can make people belong the richness of cultural diversity and our food reflecting our and our heritage i think gets gets really precious so i think there are so many examples around the world of how people how communities use food for social inclusion and belonging um and we don 't have to look too far the other example i 'll give is one that i would love to see the city of melbourne adapt um or adopt you know the city i think has done extraordinary things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubling tree cover you know in the next 20 years paris has got a really similar goal but a third of all of that has to be edibles so when you start to green a city but you also embed foodscapes into that city i think you change the nature of that city really fundamentally fantastic i 'm getting excited uh pat a couple of years ago would it have been now not that long actually a global table came to town and it 's a a was a conference but it 's a group you can talk more about i 'll let you do that really dedicated to understanding again here are top chefs or top restauranteurs uh that really appreciate that they can make a significant difference to procurement to supply uh to the way that we produce food the way that we use food the way that we deal with waste that whole sort of food ecosystem and can you give us some insights into you know some of the themes coming through there and the ways in which uh the hospitality industry is responding to sustainability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think global table was an event uh it 's actually part of the company that um melbourne food and wine festival is part of put on um not for the public but for people in food people in in government everyone from supermarkets to indigenous growers of native food um and the question at the heart of global table was how do we keep feeding the world when we haven 't really found a way to do that in a way that doesn 't damage the world in the meantime and i think one of the really exciting things about global table was that it was in melbourne and i think one of the questions we asked in in putting that event together was why can 't australia be the place for this conversation why can 't melbourne be the place leading this conversation and just listening to i 'm going to go slightly rogue here sally i 'm sorry just listening to um to beck and jeremy today i 'm thinking of i don 't want to call them easy wins i don 't want to call them low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there 's a lot that we can own here there 's a lot you know just for a much less grand example of something a little bit closer to home for me at the festival last year we were going to stage a plant-based party you know and i just rose out the question of where 's where 's the where 's the best vegan food or plant food party where 's the best celebration of that in the world i can 't really answer it you know maybe berlin i don 't know but it should be melbourne it can be melbourne you know we have the roots we have the communities we have the reasons to make it happen um i so many times i ask these questions you know where is who 's really leading conversations in first nations food culture in the world and you know just hearing bec speak today you think why couldn 't melbourne be the site for these conversations you know and sustain i mean those two examples do are very much sustainability oriented because a plant-based diet is something really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and involvement of first nations people is absolutely crucial to anything any conversation about sustainability melbourne is the place for these things for so many reasons it 's not an easy win it 's not low hanging fruit but at the same time it 's not like we 're saying why don 't we become a season seaside town really famous for tiny snacks no that 's san sebastian we could do that but it would take a lot more work whereas these things these are conversations that are live in melbourne these are conversations that are real in melbourne and what i think they 're saying is it 's easier to make a fast horse run faster you know and i think i think we have the grounding here so let 's give it a push can i jump onto that cell um one of the things i think is really interesting is you know if you take a city like ours that 's been so so proud of its you know most livable city in the world title um we know kind of from the from the science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do all of the united nations sustainable development goals through it 's the one place that both human and planetary health collide and so what i get excited about is how do we you know obviously we 're facing this unbelievably catastrophic you know existential crisis now in the climate crisis we 're going to feel that most of all in a city which is a heat island you know an extra four degrees in in this city but with 80 percent of the world living in cities in the future you know this is a problem that we are facing across the whole world so how do we use the food system as that you know what i what i always think of as an acupuncture needle you know if we 've got if we 've got somewhere in a system that we 're going to put an acupuncture needle to do social and environmental at the same time you keep coming back to the food system because it 's the one system that can do all of the sdgs so i 'd love to see us say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know food policy as part of you know affecting every other policy that 's there and see it as the vehicle that we 're driving kind of health policy and environmental policy and all of that kind of city stuff that we need to do and that climate adaptation stuff that we have to do so what if what would it look like in this city to put food front and center and and do everything else through it it 's it 's a great topic because as we 've been looking at this reimagining of melbourne one of the things we 're conscious of is that of course responding to economic hardship given that that has been so severe is a priority but in a sense of making sure that we remain dedicated to progress on some of the big conundrums like homelessness for example how do we make sure that the conversations come together because so often in the past the debates have been for example economic prosperity or environmental outcomes they 've been separate they 've been seen as one impeding the other and yet how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ways forward and you 've already touched on some of those today whether it 's how we can make uh projects like yours jeremy actually economically viable all of those sorts of elements of building in social and environmental outcomes has to be key i 'm looking around to see if there are any questions from the audience at this point or any statements phil yes go go on phil and then we 've got a question up there well voluntold i think you were voluntold yeah and thank you uh and things that were sort of changing gradually maybe over time anyway we 've had a bit of a step function change forced on us and you mentioned the one about people working from home uh which is it 's great and it 's it 's and it 's undeniably a lot better for people people with young families and everything else but but we also have to protect the health of this great city we 've all recognized it is a great city i know you know in in the property industry uh typically used to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.4 people per desk was the aim that most people had which was about 70 you know of the population in the office at any time everyone 's now talking about 1.7 that 's 20 of the daily commuting population is is gone from the city of melbourne and that 's before we talk about tourists and students in in the short term how do we and and in order to do all this stuff that we have to do that 's just been spoken about we still have to have a viable city so what are the things we can do to bring people back and i was kicking some ideas around with jeremy the other day and you talk about paris or you talk about the higher density cities most of them have two or three schools on every street their little schools their preschools their primary schools you see the kids out walking with their with their teachers you know we are going to end up with a whole lot of vacant space you know obviously homelessness you know is a big one and that that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can put into the city that are going to bring bring that population back in the short term until we have time to adapt to whatever the new city model is over time do you want to kick us off with another idea um look i think i think the scores was the big one obviously you know um arts you know creative arts and other things you know the city 's a really expensive place at the moment and you know is is this a time to look back as jeremy said as to how we do make it um so that people that can 't afford to be in the city city can be you know pat 's discussion on on the hospitality in just you know too i i think that that is a key and those examples you know of it in those communal places in shenzhen and places too where everyone just pulls the plastic the plastic stools up and uh and everyone everyone eats together i think that sort of happens a little bit you know i 'm a fitzroy boy nowadays and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the different places you eat and you have a different group of community that you meet at all those different venues it is it is all those sort of things but if we don 't have the population in melbourne on a daily basis you know and one of the things will be too for the hospitality industry is if if people are not in the office one day a week it 's highly likely going to be friday and that was the day when business was done for for the hospitality industry it was lunch or people stayed in and went to a show went to dinner or whatever else but i guess sally the only thing i can think is we 've got to get families you know that they were probably the missing thing in the city so how do we get our density back up by having whole families here sounds good i i just thought we could go back a little bit in the early 90s when we 'd gone through the financial recession here in melbourne you 'll remember people were leaving in droves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about history repeating itself i was a young worker and i actually would walk around the city in the evenings and feel that this wasn 't a place that had opportunity for me as i was starting my career which is really depressing and we were described then i think it might have been by a new south wales politician as a moribund city in a rust bucket state from there decades on we 've had a record run of being one of the most livable cities in the world and it started in that crisis with these big ideas and a policy that rob adams had a lot to do with but city leaders uh and industry leaders came together and it 's still regarded as one of the most transformational urban renewal policies called postcode 3000 and there were some key elements to that one was to bring residents into the city if workers were leaving in the mid-80s we had 685 residents 685 residents in our hodle grid cbd in the same hotel grid today there are 42 136 and they are absolutely the heartbeat and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much personality but also confidence for all those other little businesses back in the early 80s before postcode 3000 cafes weren 't allowed to have tables and chairs on the streets can you believe it and that activity was brought out onto the streets and that sense of life and bringing what was happening inside buildings out to make it more accessible and more exciting and literally fill our streets and of course outdoor dining through as the restrictions these last year and through to now has been magical in terms of transforming our streets these are the sorts of initiatives relatively simple when you think about them on a piece of paper but can be momentous more schools and i was just going to finish with artists creative organizations cultural organizations social entrepreneurs the different pricing of space in the city as we came out of that recession means that they could come in and fill even the nicholas building uh still dedicated to artists other spaces around the city became filled with that creative energy and completely changed the city and it 's those sorts of activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's question would anyone like to pick it up jeremy um i think it 's it 's a time of incredible opportunity so at the last census in 2016 there were 116 000 people experiencing homelessness in this country we 're one of the wealthiest countries per capita there 's no excuse for that in finland there is no homelessness because when someone is experiencing homelessness they build them a house because they worked out in helsinki that it costs you about fifty thousand dollars a year to house someone but it cost you about half a million dollars a year to put them in jail and when you put someone out on the street and they don 't have a secure accommodation and they can 't get access to food and health they end up resorting to petty crime to be able to just house themselves and their family so there 's an opportunity sal to actually sort that out here you know we need to make a decision as a society who we want to be and how we want to be and what 's equitable and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries in the world we have some of the highest emissions carbon emissions per capita there 's no excuse for that and it doesn 't matter what happens at a federal level we have to make our own decision about how we 're going to do that and so i think they 're incredible opportunities and if you think about what happened in paris you know at the turn of the turn of the 19th century at the time of the 20th century and they reimagined themselves as an intellectual and arts capital and i think that you 're absolutely right that you know that um melbourne is already there but we 've got the opportunity to take it to a next level so you know and and the city of melbourne already has you know it 's uh it 's creative spaces program it 's been supporting artists and now if we have vacant space phil perhaps you know it 's time for less bank employees to sit in there but time for us to you know embrace our creatives and house everyone and and give people a reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we really do need to burnish brand melbourne right now for for visitors i mean we need it for ourselves as people who live here but we need a little reset on the sictoria hashtag i think we 'd be happy to see the end of that and i don 't want instagram oh it 's nasty and i want and i don 't want to see instagram targeting me with ads encouraging me to move to newcastle because the commute is shorter and the you know the the city is less congested yeah and their primary export is awesome i 've got a question here and then a question here thank you we 've got a microphone coming thank you it just means everybody who 's watching on the live stream can hear as well no worries um thank you i think since i put my hand up i 've had about 50 different questions flow through my mind because there is so much to talk about and yeah the ideas are definitely sparking but i think what i 'd love to put to each of you and i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and just you know some of these issues you talk about are so overwhelming and they 're so huge you guys are all real doers in your own fields and you know the things that you do really ripple outwards but i just wonder if you could even perhaps with some concrete examples like how can we all feel empowered that the changes that we can make in our own respective fields that they will make a difference and set us on this path to you know this glittering future and i 'll fly over the city of melbourne too and celebrate it with you back firstly for everyone the single most important thing you can do for yourself and for your organization is to buy 100 certified green power so currently our energy mix is largely coal when you buy certified green power you are changing the energy sector to move to renewables the second thing is pay the rent so accept the fact that we built this incredible city on first nations land land that was stolen land was stolen through genocide and so our organization and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first nations people so so to the land which we 're on with the warranty people and that 's something that you can all do and you can decide what that rent is you know and so it might be as little as a hundred dollars a week it might be a hundred thousand dollars you know it might be one dollar a week whatever you can afford but it 's about acknowledging what happened and what are the steps we take forward yeah i love that the the thought that that our the food is the way we reconcile i think is quite extraordinary um can you go next pat because i 'm still thinking go go small like if you 've got a choice between shopping at a supermarket or an owner-operated business down the road go to that owner-operated business you know think about think about where you spend your money it 's it 's basically what jeremy 's saying and you 're you 're voting every day you 're making decisions that shape your city every day um which businesses do you want to be here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critical in hospitality but in all sorts of businesses the dry cleaner you go to the nail salon you go to um any of those things you know think about that it 's every day you know do i want what do i want my neighborhood do i still want them to be here and start a conversation with them they want to hear from you the person you buy your coffee from the person you buy your fruit and vegetables from it starts with you it doesn 't and it doesn 't have to be a big conversation it can just be looking up from your phone to look them in the face and say hello and thank you i 'm sure everyone in this room and on this stream does that but i hear that there are people who don 't do that and it 's just worth noting that woolworth 's parent company has massive holdings in gaming you know and gaming in all the wrong spots if you want to know how to destroy a community it 's having gaming in communities that can 't afford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure uh because they 're going to be doing social and environmental at the same time um so they 're you know their business models is is transformative kind of their engines essentially for doing good the other thing that i would say is also go to your local farmers markets to buy your food don 't go to coals and woolies and just prop up what 's a really really broken system go local and if it means you know having to drive even you know hope for most people there 's a local farmers markets near them but but try and go to a farmers markets and and support you know fair regenerative growers particularly and then the other thing i would say is try and reduce down how much meat you you know you 're eating and and move as much as you can to a plant-based diet um i think if we 're you know if we 're trying to if we 're trying to you know address catastrophic climate change our diets are so much part of that solution and and how our food is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen the drawdown projects which essentially looks at all the top projects kind of globally to to address catastrophic climate change but the food system is right at the very top of that and then the other thing i would say is please please please don 't put food waste in landfill one of the things that 's so tragic the most wasteful industry in this in the city of melbourne is its food is its food industry more than building more than offices more than every other industry and the thought that people would be putting a banana peel or something into landfill that 's creating methane rather than keeping that precious nutrition in the system is just a tragedy so i think we 've got to be thinking about circular economies and the circular economy work that you know the the state is starting to do around its circular economy system is really exciting um but thinking about circular economies and food start to get really exciting i think and i 'd love to see a bunch of that you know emptied locations in the city that aren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of circular economy food products that are in them because there 's just so much opportunity for preserving and making products from that waste and actually just we 're really good at our pre-covered we got very good at our keep cups in melbourne but you probably are more across this than i am back but as i understand it the environmental cost of the coffee grounds if they go into landfill are worse than using a disposable cup so i didn 't know that there could be could be some programs for coffee grounds pick up in the coffee coffee capital of the world i don 't know there is a part of all of that goes into a big orca and we 're just doing another one don 't forget queen victoria market of course if you 're looking for a local produce but but the point is made i think we 've also been slow on fogo collection so that 's something that will be kicking off this year uh quite challenging in multi-story dwellings but nonetheless worth having a go but i think in response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examining uh i love the theme for international women 's day this year because it applies to everything choosing to challenge your current procurement processes the current stakeholders the way that you engage the energy that you use and the other thing i was going to get back to talk about was just starting small so if you want to do something different as an apartment dweller i 'm going to be learning uh how to have a little farm on my little balcony via beck 's program and i think starting that way to really understand how we can do things differently in action starts a whole lot of other good habits as well no pressure back i 'd also like to say to actually start doing some gorilla stuff as well and i know the city never likes to hear that stuff but one of the reasons i love berlin so much is that the residents start doing they don 't wait for local government to tell them can they or can 't they do it they go out onto their nature strips and they plant stuff and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they just they they have such a sense of ownership of public space and i think that possibility to start to start to use you know start to see all of that public space as your space you know it 's us pushing that you know pushing equally against our lawmakers and our policy makers and saying this is what we want our city to look like we 're not going to ask for permission we just start doing it so start guerrilla planting everywhere i 'm up for that i 'm a collingwood supporter so a bit of elbowing pushing and shoving is is right up my alley but of course you know if it 's led by the citizens it 's very very powerful so that 's fantastic should have brought the gumboots with us today back by the sounds of it a question here yeah thanks sally um i must be in the wrong forum here because i thought this was a forum about job creation in melbourne now maybe i 've got the wrong place so i know where the door is and i 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make is you 've got empty shops here the key is jobs how are we going to get the jobs you know that 's pretty easy i just sit sideways think of auckland about i 'd say 20 years ago and i might be having memory lapses auckland was a dead city and they tried to work out how are they going to put themselves on the map and they in a space of 10 years made themselves a seven day a week 24 hours a day city all businesses are open based on the boating industry here out the window here we have miles of unused jetties you can 't tire we could get about 10 20 super yachts in here tomorrow if we wanted to each super yacht spends about five million dollars a month you 've got the whole waterfront unused i can 't tie a boat up and you can 't you don 't even allow any facilities to build here for boats so there 's a thing you could do without spending money just open up the waterfront these super yachts are now all keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're all in the pacific and got nowhere to go just open the door for them and say you 've got free birthing you 'll have unlimited jobs and all the shops here will be full what 's the problem sounds fantastic so i look forward to hearing more about it and what you 've said at the start is absolutely right it is about jobs that 's that point of having economic stimulation that comes through achieving uh other outcomes as well so there 's some of the other the um social uh and environmental outcomes we 've been talking about but if we can become the home of jobs in new sectors and and grow existing ones fantastic we 're a waterfront city i absolutely get it and we neglect it completely so if there 's more we can be doing with super yachts assuming they can get under the balti bridge that would be uh absolutely fantastic so look forward to hearing more can i add something in there sally um the reason that i run social enterprises is not because i want to feed rich people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because there there are tens of thousands of young people in this state who are going to be unemployed for the rest of their lives given their skin color and their postcode and so what gets me out of bed every day is thinking about how do you create training employment pathways into this food system there were two really exciting pieces of research that were released during the pandemic one was called the cling clean jobs plan and it was done by alpha beta jobs and it talked about the 76 000 jobs that needed to be created in australia right now to green out to to green this the country um and a third of those were low low barrier to entry jobs they were those vocational roles that someone who doesn 't need to have finished year 12 or can have come as a refugee and migrant or can have dropped out of school at an early age or face barriers are you know are suitable for another amazing plan was the million jobs plan that was put out beyond zero emissions and that once again painted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of them have talked about anywhere from the renewable energy opportunities in this state through to the revegetation that we need to do through to the food system work and and i think if you haven 't read them they 're really really exciting plans because what they do is they address what 's going to be decades of of unemployment and particularly for our most marginalized communities if i go down right now to dandenong and i sit outside centrelink i will be there watching an endless stream of young people who came to this country hoping for a better future and are going to be on welfare for the rest of their life and it feels like an absolute travesty to have those young people that are facing the beginning of their life with so much potential sitting on welfare when we have so much work that 's got to get done so i totally agree with you we 've got to be clever about that the way we use the way we stimulate our community where we 're putting that focus but the training and employment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create those for themselves but for people who are otherwise going to be left out of that for a really long time so if you haven 't read it i 'd i 'd recommend those two pieces of research because they 're extraordinary and it is about sharing that opportunity right across the city we 're going to do one more question and then we 're going to have to finish up thank you oh hi i was just wondering in the short term with going into winter and trying to get people back into the city particularly families whether you look at having free public transport every sunday with afl coming back on having reduced fees maybe children for free in the zoo i know you have to pay for all these things but we came in on public transport today and we saw families coming in there were a lot of young families but i just thought even if you set up some sort of um app type passport where you could have it for people who are cyclists and you know they get rewards when they get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have one where you bring in all the gardening for the children where you can set up things not just a once-off but every sunday for instance in federation square you can teach the children to do all their echo gardening and that sort of thing and have different facets for different interests get families back in have free public transport on a sunday just temporarily over the winter period and you 'll find that with more people coming into the city it 'll become more of a habit because i think oh it 's free public transport a bit like with the football i think they had kids for free at one stage you know have your face painting and run it in with the afl as well have the zoos open so you 've got different facets for different interests and just in a short term with some sort of passport act type thing great idea absolutely love it one of the reasons that moomba 's been so important is bringing families and people back into the city building up that covert confidence uh and how we operate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come back uh certainly free public transport has been instrumental this weekend in supporting people coming into the city and we 're grateful to the state government for coming on board with that as well as free parking around the city for those that need to drive and that sense of accessibility but really i think what you 're saying is presenting it in a way that is compelling for people to come in and to keep coming back in during winter one of the great things about the city of melbourne has always been that events based [Music] economy that we have and getting that sector up and running again after such a bleak 2020 is is absolutely key across that visitor economy so hospitality retail and events about 142 000 jobs of people clamoring to get back in so how we can continue to promote it this month moomba fashion week melbourne food and wine festival melbourne comedy festival and then leading into big festivals like rising how we can help people understand the opportunities that are here and as you say help bring them in is really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any responses or comments anyone here i 'm all for free public transport we 'd have to buy it back though yeah we 'd have to do a big structural change to make that happen but let 's think big that 's what it 's all about it does make a difference well look we are now over time thank you so much for coming along uh for listening for participating with questions for giving us ideas i 've written a couple down while we were going uh a very special thanks to our provocateurs today to jeremy to beck and to pat uh it 's been fantastic to have you come along and paint pictures of what melbourne can be like uh and ways in which we can move towards that this is a really big conversation that we all have a vested interest in and there are lots of ways to participate through these sorts of forums and many others on participate melbourne and otherwise it 's absolutely joyful to see you here in the city of melbourne out and about thank you for sharing you,"(-37.8146168, 144.9664898)"

Bala Williams you know murder ghoul we 're and regal mangu and mundungu to Uncle Perry for that welcome to country hello everyone my name is Anita hice I have where a tree belonging from around omission and wrangle mission in central New South Wales I 'm a Williams and I pay my respect to there were Andrew people here in Melbourne a may I say mum Bangu is thank you so I want to say my man go to shame and all these team the beautiful team in it this morning and everyone here at the city of Melbourne for the invitation to speak I acknowledge our elders as leaders who continue to pave the way for people like me to have a voice many of them when they were young didn 't have a voice and I want to acknowledge the regional storytellers of this country as well because we 've been passing on stories since the beginning of time and I want to thank everybody who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brisbane and in 12° nobody would go outside at all so I 'm so impressed so so impressed I 'd like to acknowledge all the VIPs in the room by that I mean the very indigenous peoples now obviously the mayor sally cap who I 'm told from people on the ground is a fantastic supporter for mob locally and that 's always a good thing to hear also the camp counselor now at Nick Francis Gilley I 'm not quite sure if I call you Nick or Nick Francis or Francis Gilley counselor Nick would be polite okay to count funny and counts like Kathy oak thank you for being with us today as well so I 'm speaking to you today as a sovereign where a jury woman who never seated at my sovereignty I 'm a where a jury citizen with the rights and responsibilities to help build that were adrià nation and we think a burning desire today to help rebuild Australia through the process of reconciliation this year using truth-telling or every year we hope using truth-telling and courage as guiding principles we need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have about a dozen pairs of glasses and I left them all in Sydney I 've had it six people loan me pairs and I can 't see anything so but if you 're taking photos I prefer to have glasses on so let me know okay so the theme of this year as we know is grounded in truth and walk together with courage so the first thing I thought about when I was coming writing my paper for today was I needed to begin with my own truth about reconciliation about the movement the process and my role within that so I want to preface my confession to you today it 's been a long time since I 've been to confession bless me for I have sinned I 'm I want to say I 'm actually really thrilled to be here today sharing in the city of Melbourne event I happily spoke this week to Airservices Australia in at Brisbane Airport it was really interesting experience and they have a very proactive diversity team nationally so that was really pleased to be there and they 're doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University of Queensland part-time and I was part of a great book swap for the indigenous Literacy Foundation there I firmly believe that national reconciliation week with a focused theme each year provides individuals communities organizations and corporations with the opportunity to come together specifically to engage on the big issues on a journey that we have all chosen to share I know that reconciliation action plans when they are treated as policy documents and I like to call them policy documents because if you call it policy then there 's a greater urgency to actually follow policy and they 're public you 've made a commitment to the public that you will have these outcomes so I think they serve as a great structure for accountability and outcomes and it 's through the stats structure and that structural process that I understand at the city of Melbourne has a very proud history of reconciliation being one of eight wrapped Trailblazers and I understand there the city of Melbourne is transitioning into the fifth route which is elevate stretching stretching the stretch up and Shane is happy to talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my confession now I was an official supporter of national reconciliation week back in 2014 but the truth is my truth is that I 've not always been a fan nor an advocate for the reconciliation process when the Council for Aboriginal reconciliation or car as it was known was set up back in 1991 I was 22 years of age and I had a very very simplistic view of what I understood the process to be I thought it was quite bizarre to have a government created agency designed to teach white people to simply respect and acknowledge and be kind to black fellows so it was very simple I was also annoyed I was very annoyed back then because as an Aboriginal person I was expected to participate in this process because it was for Aboriginal people because it was the council for Aboriginal reconciliation while non Aboriginal people could easily choose whether they participated or not which is still relevant today now it 's because of that my feelings back then that I kept my distance from anything reconciliation related until 1997 when I was living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend of mine she was a member of car back then and she asked me to attend a women 's reconciliation dinner in Brisbane now I went because Jackie was my friend and really that was the only reason but I 'm really glad I went because it is there that I had my Epiphany now in that space in vulture Street West End on a Friday night I think it was a Friday night the space legally held 250 people and the organizers squeezed in 400 women right so I was confronted by the reality that there was a whole grassroots movement of Australians in this case women wanting to be part of a process that allowed us all to be dignified and respected and to live together peacefully now one stage at dinner the MC asked all the non-indigenous people in the room to stand up all the women to and recite a pledge that would bring other Aboriginal other non Aboriginal people into the process and I stood up on my chair and I took a photo and it really shook me and my understanding of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was 22 years ago though and I didn 't think about making all the non-indigenous people stand up today but I 've changed my ID there so I really I thought there was a quite extraordinary moment so to was the moment when the emcee suggested that ladies if you haven 't had the chance to hug an Aboriginal woman perhaps you could do that tonight don 't that 's not part of the process okay we are not some kind of novelty okay don 't be friended me on Facebook out to this either I 'm kidding now in preparing for this talk look laughter you would think that black fellas never laugh humor is what has sustained us over 200 odd years of living you know with adversity we have to be able to laugh so in preparing for this talk I was reminded of my own personal journey as an advocate but once reluctant recruit to the process and I dug out some poems that I 've written back in the 1990s around the time of attending that event in Brisbane and I just was gonna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not really a poet when I go to schools I 'm sure English teachers are horrified because the kids will say what 's the difference between poetry and prose and I say well if it looks like that it 's a poem and if it if it goes to the end of the line its prose but I know there 's probably some really deadly poets in the room so mine mine 's not poetry it 's just not prose all right so you want to be my friend make peace with me now after all this time but you show no remorse for the wrongs done saying compensation it 's your penance rather than my right you want to reconcile but will never admit that we were at war the greatest undeclared war in history and you want me to forget now but will you forget your own sufferings will you stop marching on Anzac Day will you stop saying the ode in RSL clubs of course not then why should we forget the battles the deaths and the continued dying why should we forget the raping of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say we 're forgive when you can 't even say you 're sorry keep your reconciliation budges if you can 't see in your heart that the present is a continuum of the past and the future looks no better reconciliation is only for some and many of them were already on our side now I wrote that 21 years ago unfortunately some of it remains relevant today but of course some of it doesn 't obviously we 've had a national apology and we acknowledge sorry day annually since my epiphany in Brisbane back in the day I 've spoken at many reconciliation gatherings and I 've witnessed the success and the sustainability of the residents for reconciliation movement I understand there 's about 23 local groups in New South Wales that are still active and they 've been going for a very long time I had a quick look on Facebook the other day and the Hornsby residence a reconciliation group are hosting their own mongrel match this Sunday and they 've got an event today with students and so I think with that in mind the longevity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement is possibly one of the most successful grassroots movements this country has seen in terms of stamina and determination of course it hasn 't been successful in the in the fact that we 're still having to do this and hopefully you know in the next generation announced the children and grandchildren won 't have to be having these conversations but we 've come to a space from a space where my mother couldn 't even have the conversation so we have to hope I 'm a glass-half-full person and I say to people if we didn 't believe that we can make change I mean I wouldn 't get out of beds I 'm going to talk about that in a minute post the election a couple of weeks ago this movement is outlasted the Liberal Labor and Liberal government 's and will no doubt outlive the current government and I believe this because there are many like those of us in this room who understand the importance of what we are doing and why we are doing it our rights have already been recognized by the UN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of Australia and our government to understand and adhere to those rights truth in history and truth in the present can commute my left sides best honestly no I don 't mind I don 't mind attacking photos but from that sighted and we talked about up high one chin he got the brief all right no so treaty like that so my first book came out in 1996 that 's called sacred cows and it was born out of an experience that I had about lives and untruths about Aboriginal people when I was at university at the University in South Wales doing my honours to Graham the 1967 referendum and I had to do a seminar paper on a tape paper on a book uniquely titled Australian Aborigines but it was written by someone who 'd never been to Australia so I say to girls in classrooms can you imagine if you had to go to the library today and you were gonna run an essay on the feminist movement in every single book in the library was written by a man in wood we think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so so this was a nice I get the book off the shelf penned by somebody it was based on letters written by someone in New South Wales in the new colony and they write today we did this with the natives and today we did that with the natives and you 'd send a letter off to this feller in Britain who ended up publishing the book so one day five Aboriginal men take this fella hunting and they go out bush and they leave him for a short period of time and only for come back so he assumes they ate the fifth one as you do so you go out from what if I said let 's go have afternoon tea and somebody can come back I 'm not gonna assume yeah the other half there 's a few sandwiches out there and we laugh because it 's insane that logic is insane but what I tell writing students is when we die we take our opinions with us but the written word lasts forever so he writes the loaded back to Britain says the natives are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fifth one he sends it off to Britain I get it in a book 100 years later from the University in South Wales library now until that moment in time I have never heard anything about Aboriginal people being cannibals and I didn 't hear anything again into a Pauline Hanson appeared and that 's another oration were together and so I realized two things at that moment in time the first thing is that the recording of history is completely subjective and the way in which the colonizers remember and record history is significantly different to the language of the colonized remember and record history the world over and most of our history books have been recorded by colonizers and so then like if we came back here tomorrow and I asked you to record the history of today I guarantee you every single person in this room would record it differently including myself there are facts that you could not change we are you know this one Stern room is it counselor doesn 't even know we 're in this Funston room or in the Swanston room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Melbourne I have that subjective it 's it 's 14 degrees it 's rainy and we 're in Swanston Street in the town hall facts I 'm fabulous facts you can 't change yeah you 're all hearing the same thing but I guarantee it all of you would record it differently some would recall it chronologically some emotionally some will focus on a particular point in time and that 's all okay we all just need to be conscious of when we read we 're reading through the lens of the author and so my students say oh you 're saying we can 't read books by white people about like people I start saying that at all we say and be conscious of the lens they 're writing through but if I want to learn about farming I 'm gonna buy a book by a farmer not a stockbroker so that like the subjectivity that 's what I realized everything wasn 't I needed to write something and as you know the first person in my family to go to university and so forth I wrote sacred cows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are bicultural we employed socialized educated through non indigenous systems and so forth but we 're always under the microscope at being measured against Eurocentric values and so forth so I thought I 'm gonna look at what white culture looks like Skippy the backyard bomb it can you throw another shrimp on the barbie he remembers that add another shrimp on the barbie Paul Hogan makes a note for American television you know it 's fascinating about that so that 's 95 four or five Ozzie snuba three shrimp on the barbie before then Ozzy 's ate prawns fresh all back in those days covered in honey and sesame seeds at the local Chinese restaurant and all of a sudden aziza throwing shrimp on the barbie because Paul Hogan makes an advert for Americans to lure them to our shores they have barbecues and prawns and I just thought you know it 's easy to pick apart somebody else 's culture so I wrote I didn 't know back then that I would have those going too right I think 18 books now the first novel excuse me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Facebook you should be working [Music] better all public servants well artists I 'm joking okay so no hello out there in facebook land if I do drop any profanities I will say that it 's colonizers language we didn 't have repented easy and people say to me I wish you did I said well we 're a dreamer we would call someone a MIDI but that 's just a dog that 's not that bad I mean it 's not nice but okay the first novel I ever wrote was 18 years ago so when I wrote them two days ago I said I 'm getting so old it 's about a young girl who was stolen from her family New South Wales in place and Obama dairy Aboriginal children 's home before she went to CUDA Mundra I was on girls home where my grandmother was now married talented the fictional character but she encompasses all the stories of so many children like her who suffered from racist government policy that disconnected out people from family from community from country from culture and significantly from identity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to write a story about a soul and child so that Australian school students could come to understand through a diary format what life was like for an Aboriginal child at that time living under the active protection this book came out in 2001 and we were teaching in New South Wales about stolen generations from before them so let 's say around 2000 now to my great despair disbelief and disgust last year I have spoke during reconciliation week at the State Library of Queensland a teacher in the audience came up later on had a chat to me and chief teacher on the Gold Coast and she said you know we still don 't teach the Stolen Generations 2018 2018 and this is why I 'm an advocate for a national curriculum because what we have in this example on the Gold Coast is two levels of denial by not teaching the history of the policies of removal that are still impacting people our people today or by picking and chew in what aspects of Australian history you want to teach you aren 't denying that that happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their right to learn a complete history now it 's partly because of this denial of truth of Australian history and where we fit in where we don 't fit in where we are underrepresented or misrepresented or not represented at all that inspires me to write to write up into the Australian tree landscape into this rain narrative to write us into history books because our truths are also your truths everything post 1770 and the flag going down a position point is Australian history we didn 't Massacre ourselves you often hear about that 's Aboriginal history we didn 't write the policies of removal and protection and assimilation that 's oh well it 's your history there 's shared history in September 2014 I was in Pearl Harbor for the third time and I noticed the number of Japanese tourists said before but it was the first time I really I really observed that the bulk of tourists at Pearl Harbor at Japanese and I wonder what they must be thinking watching has anybody been to Pearl Harbor yeah he 's very intense moment experience and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their shared history and it made me think about world war two and we 've been talking about the war today and uncle and his family and made me think about World War two and particularly Kara my mother was on a rambi mission during the Kara breakout of people heard about the Carrie breakout so on the 5th of August 1944 early hours of the morning 1200 Japanese soldiers attempted to break out of compound be who they were housed and I thought nothing I 'd ever read or seen about the Kara breakout mentioned that we 're a dream and went to war went to both wars from that town some did and that 4.5 miles in a direct line from the powa amp was a rambi mission with another camp where we 're a dreary people and my mother and the williams mall been hot 16 lived under the active protection on rations it was a segregated town the cinema was segregated black fellows entered through a side door the hospital was segregated with linen have had two letters written on it so it wasn 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were four compounds a B C and E there 's Italians Japanese Indonesians they had a military hospital we treated POWs to the letter of the law under the Geneva Convention as we should as we should have my point is we treated POWs better than we treated our mom right Italians could go out and walk work in community and they were more employable than the local quarries yeah Japanese soldiers were fed rice and fish and got healthy and they had their own military hospital and so I wanted to write I wanted to write the stories of our men particularly in our life under the Act during wartime in a way that it 's never been shared before and so and when uncle talked about his family that went to war I was seen anything like where are their stories where we 're at our stories in the military history of this country at a time where people came back home and were treated like dirt again yeah so I wrote barbed wire and cherry blossoms and it 's interesting I went to Hiroshima as part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we frame shared history at pearl harbors a war memorial Hiroshima 's peace memorial and you can walk through there for 10-15 minutes and not even realize who dropped the bomb because it 's not about blame it 's about this happened let 's not let it happen again it 's extraordinary the way in which we can share a moment in time and tell the same story differently yeah-ah our stories are our survival as Lawrence pamphlets here 's from Kara from Rambo as well a Rabi is what was his PhD and there 's lots of stories in there and and how recording history through storytelling he 's also our survival so I learned a lot through reading his work as well last year we released growing up Aboriginal in Australia with it we had a hundred and twenty submissions and around the country can 't see really in the audience so don 't know if any of the local Melbourne people are here but there remains that you can recognize obviously from up there people we had we published 52 we 've got submissions or stories from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to nuna were added to Western our endure kuku yalanji took on a big chicken tomorrow gun bang gear and everywhere in return between either 50% of their contributions or women I didn 't know that until a reviewer pointed it out so I wasn 't looking to fit any you know gender gap or even country I just wanted as many stories as I could Killian as possible there are recollections of growing up Aboriginal in Australia by educators artists journalists sports people academics and activists and others obviously and in many ways the anthology also serves to demonstrate how we contribute to and participate in many and varied aspects of society every day the youngest contributor was 15 and I read her story I was filled with hope you know the passion of youth that we all had when we were young and we changed the world and then you get old and they tied them and I she was 13 sorry I 've met since met her and she 's 15 now in a West Sydney the oldest was only Norling bring words from Yara bar and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book in her for sure we had a student here within you 12 in South Australia Frank 's a Kelly he was Sony portage asta and we had brother incarcerated in Adelaide and someone outside a writer outside help to get his story involved now every contributor told their own broad truths about their experience of growing up Aboriginal in Australia the focus of course was on Aboriginality but a common theme was the preoccupation that non-indigenous Australians have with how we look and the challenge to identity that our people face every single day like it 's your right under that menu but something like that its your right to ask me how I 'm black and to prove that and it 's quite disturbing racism in the education system just more like I was reading stories going yet you understand that and then the moments us going oh my god like still races in the education system obviously the impact on of Stolen Generations and resilience so it 's a challenging read for non-indigenous people I have people message me who 've given whole sets to them senior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this as a starting and that people are challenged you know I 've got friends who went to their first funeral in their 30s you know we go to funerals when we 're kids we are now burying our children because we have a crisis they need suicide and there 's a strong theme of suicide so it 's it 's a it 's a challenging room having said that it 's full warmth and hope and generosity of spirit and courage so yes it 's challenging but I do recommend you read it and sometimes I 've had people review for instance my memoir am i black enough for you and they 'll write this is the book he gave that racist uncle right so if you want if you 've got someone you think could benefit and you can afford to buy it or get it from the library and loan it to them do that all right now I know that 's blurry that is how I prefer to view it I woke up at 30 a.m. on Sunday May 19 feeling depleted of energy disillusioned about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the federal election I had cried a lot the night before and I 've been awake on and off since 3 a.m. drafting and rear drafting my Facebook post trying to understand the election result and wondering who in my world had possibly voted in this bigoted government a government that had time and time again made it perfectly clear that indigenous Australia was not a priority that our voices are of no importance and that they had no respect for any consultation process that we had employed to provide them with a blueprint for a better future via the Restatement from the heart and most days of the year I 'm a really early rise I 'm wait before 00 so I run or I go to the gym or I write I 'm saying that in case my publishers watching I write emails I could not get out of bed That 's not me like I I never stay in bed I could not get out of it I well like texting people begging for everyone 's like lots of profanities tears or so depressed and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society that values money and self over land and community I said my piece on social media and then deleted those who kept referring to the fact that we can agree to differ we are all entitled to our opinion and it 's ok to feel sad if your team didn 't win politics is not sport legislation to protect the planet is not a game choosing a government is not very keen for a team and of course I know we can agree to differ on our opinions but my politics are not based on my opinions my politics are based on my values and I 've out values come from tens of thousands of years of our a dream of living together respectfully I 've been learning my language and uncle Stan grant and Letitia Harris and GRE since last year and Lloyd Dolan in Wagga it 's a really hard language to learn and I 'm a slow learner you have to forget everything you learned in English because it 's a completely different grammars I 'm are we lucky we 've got loads of resources the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at school to be honest with you we 're also looking at native we 're adrià nation boarding and talking about what an ideal were a jury nation would look like at least within the confines of the discussion of our classroom we talk about exercising our sovereignty and creating a lifestyle that supports everyone and we talk about inclusivity it 's not just for rotary people we have multiple relationships with nominal Adric people it 's not about us in them it 's about our rights to exercising sovereignty you know in a nation that supports everybody particularly the most vulnerable but we all live together everything we talk about is for the nourishment and future of the whole community the whole nation and all that encompasses following it you know we live without PowerPoint for tens of thousands of years we also I was going to be cranky about that stuff on that slide all right following the election result it took a few days not just for myself but for many of us to regroup I went back to a very short list we have like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ values to gather my strength in this list I know this this does not just represent my clothes or a jury family and the people I study with in water and beautiful family I know that most of you probably live these values as well and what we need to remember and why I believe many of us are here today is that at the core of why we believe in the reconciliation movement is our shared sense of humanity and our need as human beings to know we are behaving the best we can and doing what we can as human beings as citizens of Australia and as citizens in a global village I use the word you know murder daily senior people at UQ when they message me they sign off in Dimona or they 'll say you 're doing wrong Anita no I bet that means a lot to me because language demonstrates the complexity of who we are and we need to reclaim that okay the work that has been generated by the reconciliation process is both mentally and emotionally exhausting we are as original and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every issue an answer to every question and to engage in every conversation and argument that we are invited to at all times we never clock off unless we make a determined effort to do so when I was writing this paper I record watching a documentary about reconciliation with my classes at Macquarie University back in 2005 and 2006 when I was teaching in the Department of Indigenous Studies it 's called Whitey 's like us by Rachel Landers and Tom 's herb Rickey in it an Aboriginal heritage officer Dave Watts speaks with a reconciliation circle has anybody seen that by chance yeah it 's a group of white fellows on the northern beaches of Sydney now Dave is specifically knowledgeable in the area of sites and heritage protection in the North Sydney region but the first question thrown at him is about why Aboriginal people die so young I felt Dave 's exhaustion when that question was asked the struggle to be the font of all Aboriginal knowledge for white fellows to be that walking talking Aboriginal encyclopedia has has to attempt to answer questions that your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex questions on the spot without time to fully consider do you think any for example white criminal lawyer invited to speak in an event would be expected to talk about literacy or nutrition I don 't think so in my experience white fellows do not expect themselves to have the same level or anywhere near the same level of knowledge of their own 200 plus year history or their own current social issues that they expect Aboriginal people to have over fifty thousand years nor do I believe that many white fellows recognize that issues that they classifies Aboriginal such as life expectancy rates the Aboriginal youth suicide crisis incarceration car serration rates and treatment of indigenous youth in detention black deaths in custody the uluru statement from the heart and the list goes on these not our issues these are Australian issues that need to be understood an Australian Senate take responsibility and work towards finding solutions these are issues that we all must demand our government act upon to be blunt because it wasn 't blunt enough sorry and I know I 'm preaching to the converted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done by non-indigenous people but I can tell you that by and large it 's done by us we are hand-holding we are spoon feeding people who insist that they need to take baby steps and if I hear one more fifty-year-old say to me ah but I didn 't learn it at school we have the internet now we have theater literature films galleries courses there is no excuse for people to say now that they didn 't know or they don 't know and honestly if you can google an aboriginal person like myself and find me to email me your question you can probably Google to find your answer as well honestly people are lazy like to tell my mother when people ring her no don 't keep the my email address I 'm just gonna google it anyway have to do some work now when I wrote this I had a particular group of people in mind clearly it wasn 't involved I 'm sure they 're not in the room but maybe some of what I say today will help you in your conversations later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clarifies something to me because we all have people in our lives somewhere in our workplaces in our friendship groups and unfortunately even our families that mean we need to have conversations with let 's face it Lee and I aren 't here today because everybody thinks like us everyone thought like us who wouldn 't mean reconciliation week because the work would be done it 's not and we have a long way to go we need to work together to get more people into this process to get the change we hope and desire not just for us as black fellows but for all Australians because I know that non imagens people ache for change as well and we saw it on the stage today I 'm a bit immune to white people crying because because I see it I know there 's grief you white people grieve like we grieve why people feel ashamed I understand that we feel the same things and so I wanted to acknowledge people that came along today because I think you are non-indigenous supporters around goodwill soldiers but we need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought rather than don 't taking questions today I would do a call to action we 're going to turn we need,"(-37.8146168, 144.9664898)"

the elders past present and emerging we 're also committed to our reconciliation journey because at its heart reconciliation is about strengthening the relationship between aboriginal and non-aboriginal people for the benefit of all victorians and for all australians we are also in different locations i would also like to pay respect to all elders past present and emerging from the lands and the communities across australia where we sit today i 'm actually on your country so i 'd like to pay my respects to the traditional owners past present and emerging on behalf of city of melbourne i 'd like to thank you for all tuning in to what i hope will be an amazing experience as we the aboriginal people talk about nato and this year 's theme always was always will be and for those of you who join us in the national march each year you would know that that sentence ends with aboriginal land so i 've invited a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in sharing their nadox stories and the journeys as they and their families past and present have taken into establishing and driving nadoc since its inception in the 1920s and first protests march in 1938 our deadly panel of guests are ms nagara murray mr dean coombs mr lisa rose thorpe and mr jimmy peters so stick around and enjoy the stimulating and insightful discussion that i 'll be having with all things no doc with my guests but my first guest that i have as my panelist is miss nagara murray she 's a proud wan bawamba yoda yoda judora and jaja warong woman with a strong family history and connection to naidoc which we will have a yarn about in a minute how you going to go hello aaron good to see you yeah you too um among many of her roles and achievements nagara is also the metropolitan regional representative and executive member of the first people 's assembly of victoria and national naidoc committee member welcome thank you thanks for having me yeah well first let 's just talk about the history with nato with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generations it does and i think you know naidoc is in our blood um and it 's the one thing that still belongs to our people and um right across this country we 've championed it in many forms um year in and out for decades and as we all know nadoc was born out of a protest and one of the first civil rights protests in this country the day of mourning a movement that would ultimately become what is now our nadoc week so it 's quite a um significant um you know week for us and it 's been a gradual evolution um since then old people marched in the streets of sydney back in 1938 at the day of morning so people like my grandfather um doug nichols and his uncle william cooper i know at the time my grandfather had just retired from football and he went up to sydney and marched in the streets with all those people so i think from there it 's been a gradual evolution um and it 's grown into what it is today um so yeah it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has so i think originally um coming from the day of morning and then it went into what was known as um aborigines sunday or aborigines day and then from there it kind of grew into the observance committee and then we recognized our tasha islander brothers and sisters and then it sort of become what it is today so it 's such a um significant um you know week for me and my family it continues the vision of those old people and i know my my grandparents in particular were instrumental in the early days from kind of the naidoc balls and cabarets and fundraisers that they used to have and now what is a week-long celebration that kind of unifies our people and acknowledges our history and celebrates our survival that 's why i love being part of it um it 's one week on our annual calendar that we all love all our mob yeah you can hear it in your voice so i mean obviously the the from generation to generation it 's not is gathered strength what do you what do you envisage for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with always was always will be that 's like a theme that 's kind of grown out of our our land rights movement and the protest that we 've always fought for land rights and in particular in the 70s and 80s and we raised our voices um with that chain every time we march in the streets and i think um until our people um um are recognized properly in this country and that we don 't face injustices and inequality and that we 're not oppressed in our country we 'll always fight for our rights and in melbourne we 've always used it as a platform um to raise um you know issues that are currently happening in our communities um and it 's something that um i think the naidoc march in particular here in melbourne it 's it 's it 's a big um part of our our history and it 's always been this from when we were kids you know marching with our old people well it 's inside us and it 's in our hearts and our souls and it 's in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an intergenerational responsibility to keep us connected to our people especially our young people too to connect them to our community and this tradition that we now have um and yeah i just love it and i 'm really privileged to sit on the national nadoc committee um with a good group of people got a deadly little mob that we um have on the committee and through our yarns we kind of set the scene each year for naidoc in regards to the theme and the poster and the awards um and unfortunately we weren 't able to have the awards this year um due to covert but we will pick it up again next year so i think alice springs that 's the host city so oh there you go national nadal awards will go up to alice next year um so that 's something for all the mob to look forward to well that 's up in my home country there you go yeah so you 'll have to come up have another country now always always will be i mean those are seven strong words that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a number of generations but also we 've chanted it over a million times and they 're simple words negara and they 're simply they stand out on their own and they explain what our fight 's about always was always will be and that 's the way it 's always going to be do you think that our fellow brothers and sisters of this country non-aboriginal people will start to understand what that what the main significance of those those words are to us and what they are to themselves yeah and this is where this country is it 's a national shame that they don 't embrace our culture and celebrate our people and and recognize the true history and i think truth telling will be a big part of that as we head into treaties here in victoria but for me that theme it really pays homage to those old people and our country and that you know our people we 've carried those stories and songlines and languages and all those intricate knowledges over thousands of generations and that has kept our culture alive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it always will be um so i think the theme this year it means a lot to our families but we 've still got lots of work to be done well you 're talking about the past when you say always was and then you 're talking about the future there always will be i mean that in itself has to be self-explanatory i mean you put it within the education system you put it within the government of the legislation the policies of this country they 're just simple words that mean so much more than than what people how people are listening or how they 're actually listening to it yeah yeah and i think with with naidoc and that theme um you know we have a powerful role to play in leading change our people right across the country and nadoc is that platform to do that you know we 've had some amazing themes in the last few years with voice treaty truth last year we had because of her we can with celebrating our women the year before so i think that these are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year and i think that we 'll continue to do that um and naidoc will always be that that one week that kind of unifies our people where we 'll come out um as a unified mob and um you know we 'll protest in the streets but we 'll also celebrate our survival and our resilience as well yeah that 's true i mean you know we 're all united front that 's for sure from the national point national from an indigenous national perspective um well if we might move on to our next guest can you stick around for sure stick around and um and join in because we 're gonna have a conversation at the end well my next guest is janine coombs who 's a proud watcher black woman uh who has worked in the traditional owner and native title and treaty space for the past eight years janine is currently deputy chair of barangi gajan land council aboriginal corporation in western victoria and is passionate about the need for a stronger aboriginal voice in all areas of society g 'day janine how are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ janine was one of the first members of the victorian treaty working group and was one of 250 aboriginal people who were part of the uluru delegation who came together to create the ordering statement from the heart she continues to be on the uluru statement executive committee now welcome janine so would you like to tell us what this year 's theme actually means to you uh always was it always will be always was always will be is basically synonymous um for when there is any discussion regarding naidoc and or um the history of the plight of um aboriginal people um especially here in victoria but also across the nation as a daughter sister mother and grandmother those words are synonymous in our household in regards to the warriors for want of a better term that came before us and the warriors that are here today and the warriors that are coming through our younger generation so letting on from what negara was saying um i think as the years have progressed those words are synonymous to the broader broader non-aboriginal community around the thinking of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victoria have fought for for so long can it be even a more simpler message for non-indigenous australians to understand do you think they 're really understanding what those words actually mean those seven words are pretty strong always was always will be that they are very strong seven words but it but at the same time if i was asked the same question 15 20 years ago i would have said no however with the changes that are happening not just here in victoria but on a national base where non-aboriginal people are starting to understand and not be interested but understand that there is the truth to the australian history there is a truth to um the injustices that happened here in victoria let alone the country the the unspoken um injustices that happened in regards to the massacres across the state across the country um understanding that um what aboriginal people have been through being my ancestors nagara 's ancestors every aboriginal person 's ancestors the fight that they had to endure for us to be where we are today should never be forgotten and with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young fellas are our future i mean how can we listen encourage and support that journey as our emerging aboriginal leaders is it really about truth-telling i think truth-telling is a complaint is a big component of it yes i think in regards to our younger people um it 's about ensuring that they have a sound under understanding of their connection to their country connection to their family group and extended family groups through the clans it 's an understanding of the injustices that have occurred from day dot until today um but it 's also about ensuring that things like nagara mentioned before about the nato march my eldest child 's you know early 30s my youngest child is 25 and i 'm a grandmother of two and with each one of them i have ensured that they are present at every naidoc march event so then they can know that that is the tradition that is within my family they have an understanding and a somewhat educated perspective or the next generations that come along yeah we 'll talk about the next generations i mean is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater responsibility within yourself having grandchildren definitely don 't get me wrong i 've said this to anyone that 'll listen uh like any mother any parent i love my kids my two grandsons are the reason i do what i do whether it 's in regards to um what 's happening in victoria in regards to treaty to what 's happening across the country in regards to the uluru statement it 's about ensuring that they have an understanding of oh a number of things number one what it what it is to be a traditional owner of victoria number two what it is to actually know your mob and know your extended family groups and extended family plans it 's about being accepted within the aboriginal community because you have that understanding because you haven 't that you can have an opinion and you can avoid that opinion and it might not be in agreeance with everybody else but that you will be accepted and your opinion will be heard because of that collectiveness that is the aboriginal community now you mentioned treaty janet do you reckon so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to see a treaty god i from from your lips to bundles wings i i really hope so because for example um my father whose um 79 when it was announced that you know victoria was looking at a treaty and when the legislation was passed he was the first person i called to say hey listen it 's been passed he actually thought that i meant that somebody had passed but that was a side issue um and i said no no the treaty bills passed and he started to break down into tears over the phone and said in my lifetime i never thought that there would be any government that would ever want black fellas or aboriginal people to have this um he openly says that he will probably not see it i 'm mindful that at my age um i might not see it but good lord it has to be something has to happen in a positive way that is going to be better for you my future generations and every other victorian aboriginal traditional owner and aboriginal person here in the state yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts you know keeping your heart strong and believing that we 're moving forward i believe that we 'll have a treaty when i 'm not sure but it 's definitely happening because there 's so much fight and so much drive that 's been put behind the cause for such a long time well stick with us janine because i 'm going to bring in my next guest if you can with us thanks aaron no alright that was fantastic my next guest is lisa rose thorpe who 's a proud traditional custodian who belongs to many clans and nations of victoria uh through her father dunai and gundy tomorrow and through her mother boomerang wembowemba and jaja werong how you going to lisa hello aaron hello everybody thanks for having me thanks for joining us um lisa is now living on yori order country after growing up in melbourne in the aboriginal community alice is an accomplished sports person afl and netball and continues to coach she 's currently working for the first people 's assembly of victoria uh as engagement officer uh for the truth telling process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um you know in in um can you tell us a little bit more about what what what that means the truth-telling process yeah well i guess um part of the first people 's assembly um a resolution was passed back in uh june of this year from um from from the chamber in the chamber and um they 've uh agreed to uh potentially establish a a truth-telling process for victoria um in partnership with um well getting the government on board uh of uh creating an independent body to potentially be the first ever truth-telling process in the country let alone victoria so my my role as an engagement uh officer our engagement project officer i am basically responsible for uh filtering out information into community and taking it straight back to um the assembly from from grassroots community people um in particular uh traditional owners of of this country so tell us what the theme means to you always was lawyers will be able to land yeah i when when i sort of first thought about this you know that that statement um i had a really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if i i think i my my thoughts on it is there isn 't a truer statement that you 're ever going to hear in your life as a black fella um as a as an aboriginal person in in this country um when when you travel around and you talk to black followers from all around they all it 's the same language i mean i 'm not sure how many different languages there are across this country but those seven words are the the one bit of language we all understand and we we have this knowledge that 's been passed down for for generations upon generations that has talked about uh the significance of uh what the land means to us as as people as as aboriginal people as traditional custodians of the land um and yeah quite simply those seven words uh talks to me about truth um i you know that where 's the lie is is is a is something that sort of gets that gets spoken about in this day modern modern age and and there 's you know when you talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land it also says to me that our sovereignty was never seeded um and that 's and you know i i truly believe in in those words um i also think that it you know unites um our old people to our younger fellows today um you know and and it 's still the same language whether it 's you know our traditional language that we spoke many many years ago or or the the languages that we speak today um it 's it 's the same message um that 's never it 's it 's never it 's never wavered it 's never it 's never been changed along along the journey and um yeah i 'm i 'm very i guess fortunate and and thankful to know that um you know having you know people around uh around me today um but have also been fortunate enough to have those messages passed on so let 's talk about that week what does that actually mean to you and to family uh past and present yeah naedoc 's one of my favorite times of the year um you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who we are as people um celebrate our successes the the the good things that we 've done in our communities you know today uh but also acknowledging you know the the hard yards and the and the fight and the sacrifice that you know our elders and our ancestors did so many years ago um you know being able to remember um you know uncles and aunties and and and you know the the fight the the struggle that it would have been for for them for them back in in that era um i think you know that that makes me i guess even more so proud that you know that they had a fight within in them that has allowed us to you know have you know the deadly opportunities that we have today um and and the deadly events that we that we have and being able to see my my people smiling and happy um you know and enjoying themselves and and celebrating you know the the positive impact that they 're having you know in their own in their own families lives but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what nadox for me that 's what it 's all about is about being you know positive and giving back to um you know building on on a such a staunch uh people that we are i mean that up week is full of a lot of carnivals and it 's connected to a lot of sport how does sport play a positive role in indigenous communities um thinking about this and you know just having those reminders on facebook just recently about the nato carnival that we didn 't have this year um i i feel that you know sport for us for some of us is is more than you know is is a way of life um it 's it how it impacts on on a lot of people i feel that um it 's it 's more than just you know the physical impacts that that that has for for some people i feel like you know the belonging and the connectedness that you have as a as a teammate or or just a volunteer in a sporting club um i 've you know there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just just being a you know a a full a full forward or a or a goal shooter in a team there 's there 's so many positives that come out of being a part of of a sporting team or a club or or just participating in something as you know as big as a victorian um naidoc carnival um which yeah i feel yeah um but kind of sad that you know during covert we haven 't been able to do that and i think that 's that 's you know been one of the many um one of the many events that i look forward to in um in the calendar um being able to see my brothers and sisters from around victoria doing what they love i feel like sports a leveler for everybody there 's you know people who have jobs and and decent educations and things like that but naidoc carnivals is is something that you know everyone 's on the same level and and um you know respected in the same way um you know so yeah i 'm i i 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mis missed sport um immensely this year um i mean sport i mean it is a community within itself a community within a community so what 's the negatives with covert in relation to sport i mean we 're a social sociable people we love social interaction um and just to be isolated like this has kind of had a major impact yeah yeah i 'm not can 't really speak for everybody else but i know you know being this social person that i am and and loving sport and you know volunteering and things like that i 've really really missed the the the interactions with the mums and dads cheering their kids on or their husbands and wives on in in in that space i 'm i 'm recently retired um so not being i don 't i don 't really miss the the soreness after a game but um i you know like i being uh the camaraderie that i got you know for very many years playing netball and football um that 's that 's something that i 've really i thought i 'd really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know in in some aspect but knowing that everyone 's in the same boat you know it 's it 's that it 's it 's kind of you know lessens the blow for me i guess if everyone was still playing sport and i 'm sitting on the sidelines in this space but yeah i feel that covert has has had some really big impact on on some of our kids in particular and you know that that i worry about that a little bit um you know just in terms of what they 're doing while they 're not playing sport i feel like sports a really big deterrent from the negatives in life it has been for me over very many years and um you know i 'm just hopeful that you know with the the new restrictions lifting or the old restrictions lifting that there might be some hope for our kids to have not lost you know that love of of the game i guess yeah yeah keeps it keeps their hearts and spirits positive look like stick around because uh i 'm gonna bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guest is jimmy peters is a proud geordie order man from the chevron area and is how young jimmy there he is hello and he 's a descendant of the bridges in the cooper clan jimmy is a strong believer in the aboriginal community control and believes that aboriginal and self-determination is best achieved by aboriginal people by empowered to so they can address their own issues and needs at the local work environment and the local level um thanks for joining us jimmy thank you let 's talk about health let 's talk about health i mean that 's your main um platform where you work from now let 's talk about it in an area of covert health 's been a big part of my life my father is one of the founding members of brumbar aboriginal health service in root know where i 'm from um so i kind of that was sort of ingrained within me from a very young age so yeah and i spent most of my life working in health uh joining aboriginal health service um you know over many years i worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be the previous chair of victoria national health service as well so yeah i kind of do have a big health background but my current role is working at um oxfam as the partnership lead there and i suppose it still crosses over because of the ctg program that we currently have work in partnership with our communities but i think for me from a personal level with the coverage system and the health i think our people done it a lot better than most mainstream and i think that the data shows that and the way we haven 't got sick and uh i suppose you know being hospitalized like some other people in australia you know we 've really maintained it and i think that stems back from great leadership and clear messaging i think that the messaging that i i saw going out was around um it sort of catered to all the different um dialects that are out there in our communities and we know there are many of them so yeah i think we did it deadly that 's my thing anyway yeah true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years what has it meant naidoc means or i suppose a lot of things really i mean like janine said he asked the question 20 years ago would have had a different response but i suppose for me looking back at nato gives us an opportunity to look back at what we have succeeded in and and we 've been able to change through that platform it also gives us an opportunity to look back at um what we haven 't where we haven 't had that investment that 's required for um all of australia to get on board and understand uh seven words that everyone 's been talking about always always will be and i think that that 's a that has a lot to do with the education system within this country failing not just our people but um australia in general i mean we 're the oldest living culture in the world and it seems like they don 't want to celebrate it which really is mind-boggling to me yeah so yeah i i think that it means a lot of things i mean it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggles our elders and ancestors went through prior to us being able to hold that day and i suppose for me it it 's been a platform for other things such as you know um supporting the glbtiq plus yeah you 're mentioning the outback yeah yeah so yeah um you know i think if it wasn 't for naidoc i don 't know about black would have had the success that it has over the years so you know naidoc i have a very special place in my heart for naidoc um i also don 't like people missing out on naidoc as lisa will tell you she was traveling around the world the other year and i made sure everyone had a sign that said lisa we miss you happy naidoc and i think i made a cry actually but i 'm a big supporter in everyone feeling inclusive included within that because i think that we all come with a different different outlook on what nadoc is different reasons on why we attend but i think that platform brings them all together so that we can support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so is there anything in our in our history of aboriginal people that that you feel that we can build on or that we can finish oh look i think there 's a couple of things that we could look at i mean for instance you know i 'd love to see how we as a community support the roundary people to look at finishing barracks messaging you know um so it never quite got to where it was meant to go so i 'd love to see that very visited and potentially do some kind of i don 't know relay or whatever it may be to sort of get the work with the traditional land owners to not only take the message barrack was going to take to the government but actually add to it on the things that have been missed over the years so i think it 's 100 and something years since that message was meant to be delivered and he passed away so it 's it 's looking back at that stuff and going well how do we modify it to the up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred hundreds of years here of you know disadvantage and being left out of everything so coming together as a community to support the random people to be able to do that have the elders sitting on a on parliament where we all support them to get that message there and then the elders walk it into parliament and go you know what boys and girls unfinished business because i think there 's a lot of things that needs to be done i mean i 'd love to see a um public holiday in honor of people like william cooper sir douglas nichols you know uncle kevin coons you know these are people that have really stood up and made himself counted when the country actually didn 't count them true you 're talking about the carnivals and extending the idea of having a healing session in the with opening carnival or closing down that off week display a little bit more about that i 'd love to see our carnivals add a little bit more culture to it so i understand how important footy is because i have nephews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way that they feel when they they 're at those things is just amazing but i 'd love to see the cultural element brought into it where we do a ceremony at the start of it in a ceremony leaving with all the different um traditional owner groups that attend those events because i think it 's important that even though we 're using sport as a platform for healing i think that we need to incorporate the culture as part of that because we can 't not share the knowledge we have with our young ones and that 's a really good platform because of the number of people that actually turn up to them very very true now let 's open up this discussion um is anybody have what 's what 's an individual opinion about the treaty look lisa do you think do you think that we 'll get a treaty in our lifetime um that i 'd be very very hopeful um i think you know a treaty is a honestly personally i think it 's a long way off um i think there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to getting a treaty a lot of truths need to be told and um yeah i think you know like a lot of you know our mob need to come together and and and do this uh in in the way that a treaty is meant to be done i 've always believed that um a lot of people have gone before us who 've you know gone i 've left there have left this space with a broken heart not realizing that they had a chance to to see a treaty and for me what makes more comforting is to believe that it 's it 's a privilege to see it and if it happens then that 's a bonus but the great thing about it is that i think we 're all is a collective as a family from all different nations um and different clans that we 're all you know standing up and and you know putting some weight behind the momentum to make this happen and to happen in a lifetime of another generation and i believe that uh i truly believe it 's going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah i agree with you i think that the treaty process is definitely a part of the healing process um i think it 's also a way of moving forward i just don 't know what that 's going to look like yet through the treaty process to me when they do a reach it for me that 'll be like standing there at the aboriginal advancement league the day we got the apology and knowing that my family who had were stolen jen weren 't there to see it but being able to be there to represent them to say your hard work did this not us you know if i was just off and did it and i want our youth and our future generations to think that of us because it is a collective nagara what do you think yeah i it 's true what jimmy said like we 've got to start to prepare our young people for the world that they will inherit you know and i think in victoria we 're really leading the way with the current treaty process that we 're in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designing a framework to how our people our nations our clans will negotiate their treaties and that 'll only come from like you said our like mobilized grassroots and collective action in our communities and like jimmy mentioned that 's about you know having hope and and not breaking hearts i 've always believed that having the knowledge that it 's going to happen and having the belief that it 's going to happen at some time not in my lifetime that itself helps my fight and helps my heart and it gives me that hope and it doesn 't make me feel like i 'm going to leave this leave this time broken-hearted it 's but i leave with the belief that the fight continues and it goes on even when i 'm not here and that itself is a healing process and i think it 's an individual choice that you have to make rather and then it helps the collective i believe there 's my thoughts anyway you know look i completely completely agree and um i 'll be very interested to see um because correct me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then there 's the individual treaties for each of the designer groups i 'll be very interested to see what um the assembly does with the statewide treaty because it 's all well and good for each of the clans and the traditional groups to have their own treaties for their own self-determination for their own healing for their own economic development and growth to be part of the water environment for example to not have joint management to have soul management of crown lands all of these things what i 'm interested what interests me is what the statewide trade is going to look like because at the end of the day um we could potentially from each of our plans actually have our own treaties but all of us are affected by what the statewide trade is going to look like jim i was thinking i 'd get away without talking about treaty because i i 'm talking about treaty can i just say the hybrid model which is you know we do statewide treaty and and individual treaties it 's about obviously traditional owners have first rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across here and we know who we are but the the statewide treaty will benefit aboriginal and torres strait islander victorians so aboriginal tasha are people that live here in victoria that aren 't from here because we had to make sure that we were inclusive of those people um because they live here there 's blood flows that have lived here all their lives but not traditional owners so i just wanted to make that kind of point um and it is about being inclusive but it is traditional owner business of course first nations people 's first but it is about how victorian aboriginal and torture under people would benefit from the treaties but at the end of the day it 's going to be up to the nations and the clans to decide whether they do a treaty that 's their business so really deadly is only there to design the framework and then it 'll be up to the traditional owners whether they pick it up or not and they might do treaties in 10 years they might do them in 100 years we don 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this country so yeah but otherwise i don 't like talking about treaty too much going back to um just going back to what jimmy was saying and aaron said before about the covert and healing yeah yeah now that we 're coming out of i 'm changing the subject you 're welcome nagara coming out of covert um coming out of covert one of the things that i am really mindful of um is i want to make sure that right or wrong this government has done what it 's done i 'll be glad to get out of my house and not spend so much time with my kids but what i 'm looking for from this government now is ensuring that there are healing practices and healing um services for want of a better term that will be available to our community and the broader community because i think like lisa was saying earlier so many of our young ones have i mean as an adult it 's been hard enough but so many of our young ones have really struggled both physically and mentally to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start and enjoy the freedoms of a covered or post-covered life and i think now is the time that this government needs to stand up and go okay these are at these these are the healing services that are available for the community it looks like there 's a new future that we have to plan for with covert yeah definitely you have to yeah yeah because it 's not going away no no and i think that um that 's the other thing that you know there 's going to be a lot of people in the country with a lot of issues out of this and that worries me of how the um health system is going to deal with it um because yeah the yesterday we knew is not the tomorrow we 're going into so that 's so true it worries me but at the same time i have a lot of faith in our people because i 've watched what we 've done through this process and i feel that we have united even stronger and as i said before we 've got some great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the way just to let you know you know there are a lot of um organizations out there that step up and support these processes and i don 't think we should forget them because they 're just as important about yeah we need them followers to talk to these other folks who you know mainstream australia who don 't get it um sometimes it 's not us they want to hear or they don 't they choose not to listen but when it 's with their own peers i suppose that they you know debate it out and come out with a different outlook so i think it there 's a lot of unique we 're in a unique position to sort of put it out there those messages again that 's how i feel well on that note i 'd like to thank you all for being a part of the panel nagaram janine lisha peter it 's been an interesting discussion we 've covered many topics but the great thing about is that we all believe that our theme for this year for nato always was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for lots of uh for many years to come absolutely thanks aaron thank you so much guys really appreciate it thank you

which we meet for me that 's the warren jerry people of the column nation and i 'd like to acknowledge their elders past present and emerging i 'd also like to acknowledge the melbourne city council their support allows us to put on these webinars now unfortunately our listed guest speaker judy o 'connell uh the victorian small business commissioner is unwell and sends her apologies but she also seems to i see mark schramm in her place mark is the senior manager of dispute resolution for the victorian small business commission and he knows the topic inside out the vsbc advocates on issues affecting people in small business and builds awareness of their rights and responsibilities they also provide a quick effective and low-cost dispute resolution service for small business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having worked for the vsbc for many years now and apart from all of that he 's a great advocate for the small business sector he 's a personal friend of mine and he 's someone that simply gets it so please welcome mark schramm and i 'll hand it over to you mark thank you very much for that uh brilliant introduction david thank you very much and uh good to see you again and uh here we have on the screen and uh i should say yes i 'm filling in for duty so who knows where this will go i found out this morning unfortunately she 's not well so uh she sends her apologies and uh well this could go anywhere but let 's hope it stays roughly on center to do with commercial tenancy relief and the tenancy relief scheme uh that the government implemented we 'll go through that in the main uh on the screen here we can see kyomi who 's one of the tenants of the small businesses below the small business commission 's office uh on the corner of burke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while burke and exhibition haven 't been there for ages it seems but hopefully we 'll get back there before too long so uh without further ado let 's uh let 's talk about the commercial tenancy relief scheme if this powerpoint that i 've crafted it works so just before i begin of course the the small business commission as probably many of you know has a general commercial dispute resolution function under the small business commission act 2017 which is only about so big you can easily look at it on the victorian legislation website and it sets out the commission 's role and functions the hallmark of which is to um to enable us to resolve any business to business business to government dispute along the broad spectrum of commercial activity and and as you can imagine that that spectrum is quite broad so therefore so are the types of disputes that we can become involved in and mediate and i 'll talk a bit more about that process in a minute so um uh and there 's no definition of small business so we always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're happy to assist uh and become involved we 've even we 've even mediated some disputes among partners partnership disputes and shareholders even because we take the view the broad view that it benefits the small business and we 've successfully mediated those types of disputes so you can sort of see that we 're prepared to sort of extend the jurisdiction we don 't dwell on the jurisdictional point it 's quite funny when sometimes the law firm say oh you don 't have jurisdiction we 'll say well really what the number of this is do you want to resolve the dispute or not um oh and i should before i forget i 'll just mention too we we 're always um advocates of the small business mentoring service when we have disputes we 're always uh mentioning that the sbms is another another um arrow to the quiver um and sometimes when we were dealing with some of the rail redevelopment disputes some of the some of the businesses hadn 't really thought about that option of thinking laterally to get this to get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they might do outside of just trying to resolve the dispute so i thought that was interesting and and the last thing i 'll quickly mention here is that i 've i understand that there is a the victorian financial counselling service is being extended to provide free free financial counseling to small businesses and probably david you know more about that than i do probably um but i see that as an opportunity as an adjunct to what uh the sbms does and maybe some of your i don 't know whether some of your mentors might be involved in it but i just thought i 'd just quickly mention that because it came up in the last week or two so that 's the part about the small business commission act the commercial tenancy release game okay uh well probably most of you know that the government in victoria put in place the commercial tenancy relief scheme under the kovit omnibus i like to say hit by the omnibus that 's how it feels sometimes but um anyway we 've managed to get through it in implementing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national tenancy code in victoria well sorry the national um the national principles for helping landlords and tenants that 's what that 's how it was enacted in victoria in the coveted omnibus emergency measures leases and licences regulations and the the key parts of the the ctrs if can put it that way um to use an acronym the key parts were to establish or put in place a moratorium on evictions where tenants have followed the process for rent relief and they can 't pay their rent but they have to afford the process for rent relief in order to get a protection against being evicted during the period which is from the 29th of march now now to the 31st of december and i 'll explain why that was so because originally it was to the 29th of october most of you probably know that and now the second key part was to put in place a procedure for tenants to obtain rent relief in the form of a rent waiver or rent deferral and of course the other key part of it was to put in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenants and landlords to help them negotiate these deals about rent relief now i mentioned uh that the scheme was extended so [Music] originally it was set to come complete to finish on the 29th of september it was extended in late october for the end date to become the 31st of december with some changes and the key changes were and i 'll explain how they work first part of it is that the landlord is only required to offer rent relief to the tenant and this is really critical from the date the tenant makes a compliant written application to the landlord for rent relief during that period and from that and only from the date that the application complies supplying all the uh information that the tenant has to provide and i 'm going to go through that so i have a look at the process on our website there 's a link there at the bottom um which is very helpful in which we uh which we wrote and uh steps out the process and uh before i move on from this slide you 'll notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why they thought why is there a photo of strawberries there and there was a picture of a bloke a trading with his arms crossed and you know we always have these sort of ubiquitous photos of tradies um it 's supposed to represent a small business person well this is a photo of strawberries i took in japan from an actual small business so i just thought you know it 's a nice photo i just sort of put it in there and maybe you 'd like that maybe you don 't but want it 's a real real photo from a real person ah there we are we 'll move on um so now other key changes i promise there 's no more random mentions of photos the other key changes are so under the extended uh regulations sole traders um can we were are now were now could can now be covered because pre in the previous iteration they were not covered but they have to participate in job keeper to be eligible the big change also was that rent relief provided by a landlord it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's turnover reduction associated with the premises it says in the regulations from the as i say as i said in the previous slide from the date of the tenants application to the landlord so so for example if the if the turnover is reduced uh fallen by 40 compared to the corresponding period in 2019 then the rent relief that the landlord has to offer must be at least 40 of the rent now what does that mean though rent relief um is defined in the regulations it doesn 't mean that the landlord has to waive all of the rent whatever that rent relief figure is at least at least 50 of it has to be in the form of a waiver and the remainder is provided for in the regulations um and it 's usually in the form of a deferral but it can be another indirect form of rent relief whatever that might be such as i suppose it could mean the landlord could come and do work at the tenant 's premises and get paid for it and that could be a credit but generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with by way of a deferral of rent and it 's repaid from the 31st of december as you 'll see in a moment now another key change in the regulations from the 29th of september was that the commission was given the power to make a binding order for rent relief and that can only occur where the landlord failed to respond or fails to respond to a dispute notice in the form that we require and we put a form on our website and i 've got some more links for that for various various ways that tenants and landlords can um must respond and to comply with the regulations or if the landlord doesn 't mediate in good faith and the commissioner can issue a certificate stating that um that a party hasn 't mediated in good faith and that 's the commission is reliant on the recommendation if it 's to do with media at a formal mediation reliant on the recommendation of the mediator or if it 's before mediation one of our dispute resolution officers um is uh i guess told to well for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of good faith and that that certificate could be issued at that stage which would then trigger the tenant being able to apply for a binding rent relief order that 's the key some of the key changes there now it 's quite prescriptive in terms of the extended rent relief scheme was quite prescript or is quite prescriptive in terms of the information that 's required to be provided by tenant so i 'll step it out and this is in the process on our if you go to our website on the big big banner on our website there 's the the kovid banner and you click on that and you follow your nose and you 'll find the commercial tenancy relief scheme information and there 's a process stepped out very clearly about what what a landlord has to do and what a tenant has to do so the tenant has to write of course to their landlord to tell them what it is they have suffered in terms of a decline in turnover and to do that the tenant can compare their gst turnover for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2019 so that 's called the turnover test period and the cpa australia advice was that the the tenants need to use the same method for those two periods uh to to work out what that reduction is like a cash or an approval cruel basis probably means a lot more i think i understand what it means not being an accountant but uh then it needs to be the same method so that 's the first part of it then we come to evidence of a decline in turnover as uh supported by documents and the regulations provide that the evidence of the of a decline in turnover must be one of those things an extract from the tenants accounting records or the copy of the bas and we 've got an example on our website linked to that information that i referred to a moment ago and we have then the statement issued by an authorized deposit taking institution which is a long-winded way of saying bank or a statement prepared by the by a practicing accountant so that 's the documentary part of it and then even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to provide evidence that they 're participating taking part in job keeper and that can be done by providing a copy of the business registration for job keep a wage subsidy receipt number there 's an example there which uh can uh be obtained by um the um my guess is i think it 's a pdf version or you can i think the advice was that the tenants could contact the ato 's call center and get a copy of the receipt get a copy of the receipt number at least and a copy of the most recent notice to the ati ato under the job keeper rules which is uh here as an example again there 's a link to our website that 's an example for an entity with less than 240 employees it 's very important for tenants to reject the confidential information that these um this information that these statements contain because these are screenshots of what a tenant can download as a pdf pdf so they 'd have to redact that the tfn and the names of people i guess so we 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um yeah so that 's the types of information that the tenant has to provide to be absolutely compliant having said that what we 're hearing is that a lot of landlords aren 't really surprisingly perhaps aren 't really uh relying on the letter the absolute black letter and requiring all these hoops to be jumped through uh provided there 's a sufficient sort of um sufficient uh range of information given about the loss in turnover so um perhaps perhaps going back to those other documents that i mentioned that 's that 's what we 're hearing anyway the um and then the tenant also has to sort of include in their statement that that their lease is eligible under the commercial tenancy release scheme and if they that they are an sma that 's purely just a statement that they 're an sma as far as i can work out from regulations so i mentioned before we had some some templates and forms and things on our website so here 's a template that we wrote to assist the tenant to seek rent relief uh quite quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all out of course but it really encapsulates that information that i just went through the various categories of documents which is a good aid memoir for tenants about kickoff as they go through and explains the regulations as well so the landlord has to respond within 14 days once they get the compliant rent relief request from the tenant that the landlord has to respond and then the regulations provide that there has to be negotiation in good faith but the latter has to provide a um an offer within 14 days i put for those of you who seem to want to know about regulations and specific where specific things come from in the regulations there 's a few other requirements here i 'll just whizz through them so regulation five that that was there was a question under the previous regs about whether the um whether the regulations uh allowed for or whether job keeper payments were part of turnover and that was clarified in the extended part the the next one was reg 10 um the key change here is that the rent relief application @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and no other premises i think it says associated with the premises i don 't think it says and no other premises oh no it does and no other premises yes and that has changed so what does that mean i suppose the question there is well what if there 's um what if the tenant has other premises such as a for example what if they had a warehouse that they 're leasing um in a shop that is supplied by the warehouse which is also leased what if both of them are the subject of a rent relief um application well it 's not seven there 's no case law on this yet there 's no sort of definitive ruling on what what what is associated with the print what does it mean but uh i highlight it as an area that needs to be potentially clarified i suppose i don 't have all the answers to this but i can tell you what the requirements are and that 's one of the requirements regulation 10 says that the landlords well that was redacted under the previous iteration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacity but no longer that was actually taken out of the extended rig so it really seems that with these extended regulations that that it 's purely about proportional reduction in turnover because the landlord must offer rent relief and a lot of landlords are um i think are not potentially not happy about that that is the situation and the uh the repayment date um previously it provided that repayment where renter 's rent has been deferred could not um the landlord could not ask for that rent until um the earlier of the end of release or the 29th of september that 's just now the 31st of december another change was that there 's no rent increases allowed during this period from the 29th of march to the 31st of december and probably the last one i 'll mention is that rent relief rent relief applies to if there 's a if there 's a tenant paying gross rent then the rent relief must apply to the gross rent figure there 's no carving out of the outgoings it 's provided for specifically in regulation 10 4a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a subsequent when a subsequent request for rent relief under rig 11. so if their circumstances have changed or or if the agreement wasn 't proportionate to their decline in turnover the and if the agreement didn 't cover the whole period the previous agreement the tenant can apply for a further for further rent relief but they have to follow the process which is laid out in the regulations in terms of the prescriptive requirements that i 've gone through and previously that subsequent rent relief if the landlord was to grant it could do it purely by way of deferral but that 's been changed now so that there 's no um there 's no requirement to to just confine it to deferral it has to be like the first part at least half of it has to be in the form of a waiver so what happens if agreement can 't be reached well then that 's where we come in so the just like the commercial dispute resolution scheme that i explained at the start by the party can make an application for uh for mediation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether the tenant is eligible or not so even where a landlord tenant or where a tenant 's not eligible under the scheme for example let 's say they have too much the turnover is too hot or hasn 't fallen enough or or or they don 't qualify for job creator because they their turnover is in excess of 50 million or uh or they 're part of a connected to a group therefore excluded from the regulations when i say connected to a group if they 're part of a corporate structure which causes an exclusion then if a tenant 's ineligible will still allow the either party to apply for mediation under our normal pieces of legislation the retail leases act or the small business commission act but we 'll encourage the parties to make to make every attempt to resolve the dispute based on applying the principles of the national code which set out the same sorts of principles in fact we 'll encourage them to apply the same principles under the regulations it 's just they 're not they 're not obliged to the landlord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ineligible um but if mediation if mediation can 't solve the dispute and that 's that 's defined as including at the preliminary stage by one of our dispute resolution officers or um or one of our dispute resolution officers can 't resolve the dispute then goes on to a formal mediation with one of our independent mediators if the dispute can 't be settled then it can go on to to v cap to for a bit uh presumably for a determination about what rented to be but as far as i know there 's only about two or three in the pipeline so far that vacation but that 's because we 've been able to solve many many many of these disputes and i 'll tell you a bit about that so we 've had since the 29th of march up until 28th of november we 've had 13 thousand 152 inquiries about this we 've received 3168 rent-related dispute applications and you can see there on the screen the break-up between commercial tenancy releases scheme matters and the ones that are not eligible we 've been able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a double breakdown there of the ones resolved by that our dros we call them dispute resolution officers before mediation and the ones 903 at mediation which is it gives us a success rate of 86.7 so that 's why not many have gone through the vca which is quite uh vacated quite happy about that so it 's taken us a while though so you can see the time taken to finalize somewhere between 7.7 to 7 to 9 weeks they 're about so it doesn 't happen overnight but we do get there and overall just just for those who are interested for the last financial year just in terms of all our disputes there 's the sort of stats for the uh the um the normal if i say normal the the overall dispute resolution picture so better uh when i say record another year where the dispute application numbers were more than the previous year and that 's sort of pretty much been year on year since we commenced so uh overall 81 successful uh were successfully mediated so 38 i should say the ctrs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mediation which is pretty good um and you can see there 38 of other types of disputes such as retail leasing owner driver disputes farm debt disputes small business commission disputes that the general commercial disputes 38 being resolved prior to mediation which is pretty good uh now a few questions what if you 're a landlord in the tenants stop paying rent well i 've sort of answered that we have a free meeting and these mediations are free these covered mediations normally we charge 195 dollars per partner which is heavily subsidised but these are free the tenant has to follow the process for requesting rent relief in order to be protected as i 've said but we can yeah basically we can mediate the dispute if if the if the landlord and tenant can 't come to an agreement which is i guess what i 've already said plenty of advice on the website too in that last link oops where are we going too fast can the rent be increased no it can 't be and i mentioned that didn 't i so i don 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be increased during the relevant period from 29th september to the 31st of december unless the parties agree otherwise of course a couple of other things worth mentioning that landlord supports so we have um some land tax supports which most people many people may know about involving a 25 reduction on the 2020 land tax liability and a deferral of the remaining land tax so this is where landlords who provide eligible tenants with a rent waiver or 50 over three months um can receive land tax um land tax uh help and uh they can receive an additional 25 reduction up to 50 percent i see here my screen screen 's kind of blocked out but so and there 's also land tech 's uh benefit for owners of commercial properties who run businesses from the property and they 've been impacted by cobia so a lot more of that information 's on the sro website we do get a few questions about people wanting to end the lease and these range from if attendance on a periodic tenancy a month-to-month tenancy does it constitute eviction for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on or not the answer to that is no because if a tenant 's on a month-to-month tenancy then at the end of each month of course unless both parties renew the lease then the lease comes to an end that 's the nature of a periodic tenancy so the landlord doesn 't doesn 't need to renew the lease it 's just that the landlord can 't can 't evict a tenant where there is a lease in place if that makes sense of course there 's other requirements that have people have to watch out for like under the retail leases section 64 requires the landlord to have given the tenant a notice no later than six months before the end of the lease as to whether they 're going to renew the lease or not and if the landlord doesn 't do that the retail leases act says that the lease continues on forever until the landlord gives that notice and then the tenant gets six months the end date becomes six months from when that notice is given that 's a very very much something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and don 't know about but um generally for tena and then we get questions about what if the tenant wants to to end the lease and and so the advice here is that a tenant uh of course is if there 's a deal in place they 're obliged to pay rent to the end of the lease but there are circumstances where we 've had them where landlords have wanted to get the premises back uh they 've been there 's other circumstances where well you know they 're happy to relate it to someone else so the general principle is that if the tenant does break the lease of course the landlord can 't sit back and do nothing the landlord has to try and lease it out to someone else to mitigate their loss but the tenant can be can be required to to pay effectively damages if they do break the lease early so um and that can be in form of a surrender a surrender amount in lieu of lost rent sometimes but uh generally speaking we encourage parties to negotiate and to to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if necessary oh we 've come to the end already so i 'm sort of horrified that i might have gone a bit too quick but perhaps there 'll be some questions and we might uh we might end up sort of somewhere halfway decent towards the full hour that i was supposed to speak for so um i hope that wasn 't too quick but yes i hope that was at least uh half edifying and we 'll deal with some questions if if we have any thanks uh thanks mark that 's very informative there 's a number of things that i 'd like for you to clarify for us independent of um the issues of of landlord tendencies at the moment under the coronavirus challenges um what are the other sorts of mediations that the bsbc might entertain might be involved in mediations over well we 're still getting funnily enough we 're still getting a lot of uh and just recently a lot of non-covered uh applications for mediation and so the other pieces of legislation i mentioned were were the retail leases act so we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guidance on our website about the rights and obligations of landlords and tenants in relation to retail leases and so under the retailers that for example the landlord has to repair and maintain the premises the landlord uh has to compensate the tenant if the premises are damaged um i know i 'm focusing on landlords here but this is a as the one of the court cases mentioned is a merely ameliorative legislation so it 's legislation designed to in the mind to put in place um protections for tenants and there 's no apology for that that 's what it is uh if you read the second reading speech but so the um so under the retail leases uh act things like disclosure statements the tenant has to be given a disclosure statement and a copy of the lease at the commencement negotiations that the landlord has to give the tenant an annual estimate of outgoings which tells the tenant what they 've got to pay the landlord has to give the tenant a reconciliation statement at the end of the at the end of each financial period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so that 's continuing that dispute resolution work and then i mentioned also the few times the small business commission act so we 're getting still disputes um general contractual dispute resolution matters where maybe there 's a failure on one party to supply what they promised they 'd supply or failure by one party to pay for something or a dispute about delays in services being provided we 're doing those sorts of disputes and and very briefly we have a a smaller dispute we 're not so small because we don 't get as many applications for mediation but we have a dispute resolution role in relation to owner drivers so disputes between hirers and hires of drivers and contractors who provide driving services like your rubrics and your trucking companies you know small individuals that provide trucking services and also farm debt mediation disputes disputes between creditors and and farmers so that 's um that 's sort of where we 're at with the other types of disputes and the other bits of legislation that we administer and i noted that you uh commented that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to be able to seek mediations um with your your lease negotiations at this current time yeah well it 's interesting the the national code i mean i imagine most people would be aware right back at the start when all this happened there 's the big announcement by the federal government about this national code for getting the exact title of it the national code leasing principles i think it was actually titled and a lot of people thought well that 's law but of course it wasn 't law it 's only law because each state enacted legislation in the form of regulations under the once once that once each state had enacted uh or at least in victoria a coveted omnibus act under which regulations could be made um that that 's how it became law but but of course those regulations as i mentioned only apply to eligible tenants tenants under eligible leases and there 's a a number of carve outs where tenants are not eligible where they earn too much in the way when they don 't qualify for job keeper because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tenant is part of a corporate structure where they 're related to another company and that 's defined as those are defined in the regulations and the act has not not been covered where a tenant sometimes you 've got situations where you 've got a small and this could affect very small tenants where you 've got for whatever reason they set up one company to do the trading and one and another little company maybe to set up to hold the lease but the problem is the company that does the trading and might employ people might not be the tenant you 've got two different two different entities doing two different jobs but they 're really you know practically speaking though everyone knows what 's going on that maybe it was done for i don 't know to enable a family trust disbursement of monies or or maybe it was done for asset protection or whatever but the fact of the matter is that the the tenant in that scenario is not receiving job keeper because it doesn 't employ anybody it 's the other company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that situation the tenant wouldn 't be eligible but we 've encouraged to get to the answer we we 've encouraged landlords and tenants to come to mediation even where even where the tenant 's not eligible for those technical reasons and to apply the same principles about proportional reduction in turnover in rental open deferral the same principles that were put in place in victoria which were drawn down from the national code so we 've been reasonably successful in being able to get mediations resolved on on that basis okay um mark i 've got a couple of questions in the chat area uh first one is uh email confirmed that the landlord is entitled to give notice to vacate the premises to a commercial tenant who is on a periodic lease can i with a question can i confirm that yes that the landlord is entitled to give notice to vacate the premises to a commercial tenant who is on a periodic lease well i 'd probably i 'd probably put it more on the basis that the landlord 's entitled to um subject to what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requirement i 'd probably put it more in the basis that the landlord is entitled to confirm that the lease is ending on ending on the date that it is supposed to end on [Music] as it would do under a period as it would do under a periodic tendency so that 's probably a slightly long-winded way of saying um yes but you might want to just uh rather than use the language of saying um you know i 'm i 'm i 'm recovering the premises are on terminating your tenancy it 's probably more realistic to to reflect what 's actually going on which is that the landlord 's not not renewing the lease which is a different thing i think cement perhaps semantics but i think it 's important i i also understand that the uh deferral or of of um rent or rent relief by deferral the landlord has to continue your lease in order for you to be able to repay that uh deferred rent um so if for example you only had at least that concluded mid-year next year but you have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is deferred and 20 waived that 20 deferred can be negotiated to be over an extended period of time and so therefore the landlord would have to give you the time a reasonable period of time to make that repayment is that correct um not really no no um the um the the repayment the repayment well sorry the deferral if rent is deferred regulation 16 says that the landlord tenant must vary the eligible lease so that the tenant must pay the deferred rent amortized over the balance of the term of the eligible lease including any extension to that term and now that extension comes about because if rent is deferred it says the landlord must offer the tenant an extension to their lease equivalent to the period of deferral but that deferral that deferral period only arises between 29 march to 20 to 31 december so if if if the if the deferral is for two months say for example for november and december the tenant can defer those two months of rent because now whether now when now we 're in december actually let 's say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the landlord can offer the tenant or must offer the tenant which the tenant doesn 't have to accept by the way but the landlord has to offer the tenant a two-month extension to their lease but then it says so the landlord must land on tenant must vary the eligible lease or otherwise agree so the tenant must pay the deferred rent over the greater of the balance of the lease including any extension that we 've just talked about or a period of no less than 24 months so you can have a situation where even with an extension the lease ends let 's say the lease ends on 30 june next year but we know here that it says the landlord has to allow the tenant to pay the deferred rent over the greater of the balance of the term of the lease which could be 30 30 june or a period of no less than 24 months so you could have a situation where the tenant 's paying back rent over a 24 month period where the lease has ended so 18 months beyond the term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion about any incentives post 31st of december we we still have limitations to trade limited office workers in the city density limits etc or will will it be business as usual post 31st of december look i think we 'll find out more about that we 'll prob i suspect we will find out more about that this or next week yeah i don 't know of anything yet okay i 've also got a question i need to get advice about how to liquidate my small business bearing in mind the new sma liquidation regulations that will come into effect at the end of december is there a government agency that can assist with that are you aware of an agency that can help on that um well i know for personally personal personal um insolvency there 's the um the used to be called the insolvency and trustee service the commonwealth government 's insolvency uh body um i suspect um asic has advice about uh corporate insolvency matters so probably in the first instance have a look at asic 's website and see what information and advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sure from there you 'll find where you need to go probably that 's all i can say about that yeah um i also had a question about uh the the landlord uh who believes they just bring that four walls to the person in the room they expect me to pay all of the outgoings and all of the repairs and maintenance even though they have installed the grease trap and kitchen exhaust am i able to claim back to past repairs over and maintenance expenses from those citing from 2014 to the presence so can they claim back past repairs that the tenant has done um yes yes i suspect the answer is yes um uh the retail leases act can 't be excluded because there 's a section in it that says section 94 actually it says you can 't exclude the operation of the retail leases with an agreement to the contrary in other words you can 't contract out of it you can 't avoid it it 's an anti-avoidance provision section 94. um so if that money 's been paid by way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's quite i mean look i should say with all of these things i 'm saying by the way the commission 's role here and i better better i better spell this out the commission 's role here is to tell part of the story which is to give guidance about the application to give guidance to people about what these regulations state but of course uh the law about retail leases and the law about uh tenants and landlords is governed by three things it 's governed by what 's in the lease it 's governed by the retail leases act you know the regulations and it 's governed by the common law which is the law into lesser extent rulings of the tribunal the victorian civil and administrative tribunal so the commission 's role that 's my role part of part of my role is really confined to the one part of those three things which is to give people guidance about what the what the retail leases act states so i 'm probably going beyond my um beyond my my uh responsibility i guess or even my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um those other two things what the lease how the lease is to be interpreted or how the how the um common law define interprets the legislation and interprets previous decisions but having said that um i know enough to be dangerous and i think pretty much in that situation the tenant would have um [Music] quite possibly a claim to be able to recover monies paid by mistake or where the landlord and the tenant have operated under the misconception that somehow their agreement excluded the operation of the act so uh but of course you know you have to check that with your own legal advice yeah um so the the other way would also be to possibly contact the vsbc and potentially have a discussion uh with somebody in your office and explore mediation opportunities that 's right practically practically for deal can 't be done you know you can try and do it through mediation and who knows what what outcome and also the law institute of victoria has a half an hour 's free legal referral service yeah um there 's a question from many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finalized within the 31st of december 2020 for the attendant protection on receiving rent release so does is that the case is the mediation or the negotiation process does that have to be concluded um by the 31st of december that 's a good question um i think i think not i think that provided that the tenant has made a compliant rent relief application to the landlord within that period that is the that is the uh at the heart of it that is the main requirement because in victoria we have the interpretation of legislation act and it says is a i think it 's around about section 58 from memory buried deep in the interpretation of act there 's a very interesting section so just because um legislation expires doesn 't mean automatically everything just sort of poof goes off into the ether what it says in that section is that previous rights and obligations that are created by a statute don 't expire on that legislation expiring they continue on so the main thing here i think is that the tenant has put in their application @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you for you there minnie um there are no further questions in the chat room i wanted to just cover up on a couple of things first of all my experience with the victorian small business commission has been a phenomenal experience the vsbc does some extraordinary work and as mark mentioned earlier for 195 for mediations for both parties it 's a phenomenally cheap service hugely subsidized by the state and their success rate well no one can argue with what 86 87 success rate um so that 's that 's extraordinary in the first instance second very easy to get support from the bsbc and many cases uh disputes are resolved well before it ever gets to mediation just the very fact that the vsbc has been in contact is often enough isn 't it to to make the parties uh come to a reasonable conclusion so contacting the bsbc is a really valuable thing to do that can be done either through the 1387 22 number or through enquiries at bsbc lastly i would just like to thank mark for coming in today and particularly on such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best wishes for you to get better soon and uh again thank you for your advice today um i would ask also would it be possible for us to have a copy of the powerpoint presentation so we can refer any information on

Melbourne,-GtHi7aM6k0,20201215,2742.24,"120 Swanston St, Melbourne VIC 3000, Australia",8802,to provide you with some information and some easy to use proven financial tools that we 've been using with spms for quite some time now to help you budget your way back from covert in the shortest possible time now i don 't know how long that time will be for each one of you but um you know it 's going to and it 's going to be different for every one of you as well so what the four elements that we 're really looking to do is you have to help improve your knowledge understanding that most people fail because of what they don 't know rather than what they do know we 're going to try and you know give you some new skills that you can apply because application of new skills is the only way to get improved results you 're not going to get the same results from doing the same things over and over and over again using some proven tools you know as we say why reinvent the wheel when it 's already there and lastly um you know to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding that your future as well as mine and everybody else 's is determined by both what we think and what we do and you know hopefully this will give you some insights of things that you know you can use to choose wisely to to move on so what we 're going to be talking about today is ensuring financial uh viability um you know why am i talking to you today um very simply as ross said my name is anthony turner i 've been with the mentoring service from since 2006. i 've been a business coach i teach and have trained in all sorts of small business topics including basic you know the basics of finances and everything else so i 'm not an accountant so i 'm not going to be talking to you from that perspective but i 'm just going to be talking to you as a as a business person and a mentor of business people based on some common pragmatic stuff that i 've designed but also that you know we 've learned over many many years that we 've found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a multitude of different environments including um the aftermath of disasters like the bushfires and floods and stuff like that and now uh the pandemic as well so you know the first thing i think about um you know when we start talking about finances is that you know is to ask yourself the question you know how much money do you want to make um most of us have got some ideas you know as low as as much as we would probably like to make or could make uh but are we clear about you know how much money it is that we want to make and if you 're unsure about you know what sort of money you should be making in the you know business that you 're in i would suggest you know that probably the first and one of the easiest things to do is to um you know have a think about you know what you would be worth if you went to work for somebody else now for some of you 've been in business for a long long period of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bo you know things like fair work australia have got you know and the ac the ato have got sort of guidelines and you know benchmarks and all those sorts of things where you can get an idea of you know what your roles are so particularly fair work with all of the awards um they 've got awards for all sorts of things and guidelines you know for salaries etc so you know certainly get an idea of what you 're worth but also think about you know and particularly if you 're an employer then you know how much you 're paying your staff and ask yourself the question is you know are you taking home the same amount of money now there 's probably many reasons um and hey i 've been guilty of it and i think every small business owner has been guilty of it is falling into the traps of paying yourself last and hopefully there 's some money over at the end of the day or the week or the month to enable you to take homes and pay to pay your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do is try and give you some ideas about doing things a bit differently and about putting yourself first because realistically you know any of you who like me have at times been frightened of my letterbox um because you 're not sure which bills are coming on where hell where the hell the money is going to come from to pay them you know it 's it 's it 's pretty scary to be there and it can be pretty lonely and pretty stressful as well and what we 're hoping to do is you know recognizing that the covert uh response and recovery is going to be challenging um to get you know business uh sales levels up and profits back up to what they may have been in 2019 um then you know what we really need is some sort of formula and some tools to be able to make that really work so first off before we get into the actual physical stuff about budgeting i want to have a i think you have a think about you know the key ways in which you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been impacted by covert in some ways some of us have been able to work through covert in restricted or different ways and some of the people who have been able to do that have actually thrived in that process and good luck to them because they 've been had the ability to adapt to online formats um and move product that way or they 've chosen different ways in doing things or they 've found new audiences so yeah good luck to them however i think it 's fair to say that the majority of business owners you know have been hit and hit hard based on you know ongoing expenses with you know 80 90 drops in their incomes so there 's four key ways that i know of two business so the first one of those is to increase your profit percentage so you know i think you know it 's fair to say that you know the key way to increase your profit percentage is to charge more and buy lower so that 's how you increase your profit percentage so a lot of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this particular point in time we think we 've got to go out there and keep our prices low or even lower our prices to get people coming back through the door i think it 's a false premise and it 's one that i would certainly encourage you to you know forget about and to really think carefully about the reason i say that is if you look back over the history of your business then there 's going to be a large number of you who have been in this competitive mindset for quite some period of time and possibly haven 't um you know increased your prices um over that period of time a couple of people have just joined so if you wouldn 't mind muting your microphones i 'd really appreciate it so think about how you 're going to increase your profits so increasing your profits fundamentally comes you know price increase is one of those things um certainly um look at you know what 's going in on in the market look at what some of your unique selling points are and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enable you to charge a little bit more there may be you know ways in which you can increase the value of your sale so there might be things that you know currently i did some work with a hairdressing business at one stage for example a lady 's hairdresser and she always did you know an eyebrow wax and a tent and things like that as part of her service and she never charged anymore she just did that as an added value for her customers when they did a you know a hair color or perm or something like that but that thing that she was giving away had a value so you know you can think about you know the things that you add into your package but you don 't want them to make you you want to put enough in there for people to know that they 're getting increased value but you don 't want to be so much that they 're at you 're actually giving away the opportunity for profit and for sales within your business as well that 's going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product based businesses in service-based businesses you know you might be given free out free newsletters to you know increase the value or something um you know there 's a variety of different tools and i would suggest you know if you haven 't done so already get the advice of a mentor or somebody who you can sit down and look at your personal circumstances and look at how do you improve your pricing improve you know the sales frequencies how do you increase the sales value maybe some of you need to be thinking about you know and i remember when my wife and i had a gift shop in the yarra valley um you know we used to do little things in like increasing the sales value we would sell locally um packaged teas um and you know we would create packs with a you know a mug a tea strainer and the loose leaf teas so all of a sudden instead of the sales value being for a pack of tea say five bucks or something like that all of a sudden we kick that up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a package and selling those things together you know so have a think about you know your products your services what things are complementary to one another that you can sort of put together in some way so that you can increase the sales value you know we all know about the mcdonald 's version you know do you want fries or do you want to drink with that or do you want a dessert or whatever it might be you know the reality is it 's easier to increase a sales value than it is to actually get a new customer and the reason is that that customer is there buying now they 're not always going to say yes to whatever it is that you 're looking to package together or not for them um you know but the reality is it gives you an opportunity to increase each of those sales value it 's because the people are already in a buying mode you don 't have to try and convince them to buy something they 're already doing it so you know if you 're a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know would you like a cookie or a cake or a muffin or something to go with your coffee you know if you 're selling a meal do you want a coffee to go with that you know turn it the other way around think about you know how you can add things that you do that naturally complement one another to increase the value of each sale and therefore the value of each customer the other one is to increase you know which i skipped over is the increasing the sales frequency so what that really is about is how can you actually get people to come back more often now you know we 've all seen supermarkets like you know we 've heard on the news in the not too dis recent future um things like chocolate bars and stuff like that they 're actually shrinking the size but the price stays the same now that 's a way of increasing profit but it 's also a way of increasing sales frequency because people are getting less so they 're going to come back more often now i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessarily that that is ethical but the thing about it is is that within each of your businesses there are things that are common often used that you can sell more of or you can then start linking that to go from step a to step b to step c to step d now the last one in terms of growing your business and we 're talking about the funding of your business not just your business as a whole is to decrease your expenses and we 'll talk a bit more about that as we go through the budgeting stuff in a few minutes but there are a couple of caveats on decreasing expenses the first and foremost of those is that you know when you 're looking at decreasing expenses look at the reason one of the real experiences that you can decrease these and these are typically the things that you 're not using you don 't necessarily need any more that you might have you know signed up for subscriptions is probably a great example of that okay many of us subscribe to um to newsletters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not just in one which is our main one we 're in two or three um it could be you know um subscriptions to you know netflix at the office or something like that why do you need that up there why you know why wouldn 't you have that on home uh but not necessarily the office you 're not gonna be sitting there watching tv during the day so there 's all sorts of things and i would suggest you know this could be subscriptions to um and often they 're two dollars five dollar things you know it could be um software that you 're paying on a monthly basis you 've got a subscription to but you use it just like once a year sometimes with those things you know you might be better off to pay the fee to actually use as you go rather than have a subscription in place now we did this exercise with a couple of different businesses recently and we 've saved you know some of those businesses young 30 40 50 even up to a couple hundred dollars a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when times are tough you need all of those things um i remember in my own business you know it was a few years ago when voiceover voip voice over internet came first came in as distinct from phone calls and i i reduced my phone bill by hundreds of dollars a month simply by going to voip phone as distinct from this standard telstra line um you know there are other expenses that you know you can maybe look at you know do you need to be getting the absolute rolls royce best of everything you know other things that are less value are you hiring um you know people to come in to do work when you might be able to go to air task or fiverr or something like that and get tasks done as you need them to do rather having the ongoing costs now obviously the key thing about decreasing expenses is whilst that sounds like good common sense particularly when times are tough there is a very very important caveat on all of that and the caveat is very simply this and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decrease the value of what it is that you sell or provide i 'll give you an example you know we 've probably all been to a new restaurant because once it 's opened and you know that restaurant um you know first time you go there they 've got a you know reasonable precise plates nice and full the food 's really fresh and it 's yeah it 's really really yummy you think wow that 's really good i 'll go back and i 'll take some frames and you might go back there two or three months later and you think i 'm not sure that 's as good as what i remember it to be you know maybe they 're just having an off night but then you go back another two or three months later with some other people or just yourself and you think well there 's a lot more source and substance on the plate this time you know it 's not there and what 's typically happening is that once they some businesses once they get you in at the beginning they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get away with doing all this stuff which is actually decreasing the value which is the reasons why you went there in the first place so it 's really really important if you 're going to be decreasing expenses you cannot decrease the value of the customer experience you 're better to charge more and keep that experience high than to decrease that experience and have customers walk to walk away now i know one of the things that we talked about in one of our marketing seminars was that certainly people you know 60 of customers who is quite satisfied with what they got don 't come back to your businesses and the reason that is because they don 't feel valued and decreasing the value of what you offer your customers is very very important in terms of a big big turnaround for pushing your customers away so it 's really really important to remember that you know if you 're going to decrease experience expenses the first question you 're going to ask is does it decrease my customer experience because if it is if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's something that you can reduce the cost of maybe you can get a better deal on finance maybe you can get a better deal a decrease in your rent maybe you can get a better you know deal on your on your phone system or something like that where it 's actually saving you money but it 's not decreasing the value experience or the customer experience by all means go for it but if it 's going to hit the customer experience i 'd suggest you do so with warning okay so now i want to start talking about budget now i 'm not going to ask the question because i 'll probably get a whole heap of no 's but the question really is who likes to do budgets and the reality is not many people um the accountants love it um those people who are really into the numbers you know not necessarily enjoy do it but they know the value of doing it but i think particularly now it is absolutely essential for every business to do a budget for their business for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important you know to because when you 're doing your budget to start considering a couple of things now the first thing it 's really important to consider and particularly of those of you who are sole traders or you know family businesses you 're going to have to really think about what your family expenses are um and i you know i know a lot of people have been you having to you know trim the cloth a bit fine these days because of you know reduced incomes and all sorts of things um so you know and a lot of people have done this by necessity you know re-evaluated their costs of living but i would suggest you it would be very very beneficial for you to do a home budget because at the end of the day you know what you 're looking to do is to do the same as for your business you 're looking for all of the things that might be you know you might have netflix stan and disney um you know um subscriptions you know going for your tv to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with one or you know can you vary them rather than paying thirty dollars a month pay you know ten dollars a month you know and keep some entertainment going you know look at all of the different things about your family experience think about the schools you know if you 've got kids you know think about things like you know dining out or you 're eating out or your humor eats and all of these things you know i know personally it 's a lot cheaper to cook yourself and maybe even get some cooking lessons than it is to actually eating be eating out all the time so it 's really really important to understand how much money your family needs looking at all of the things like you know your car phones your housing education self and kids entertainment and all of the different elements of home expenses to work out how much money you need to be bringing in to be able to cover all of your expenses and save a little bit now quite a lot of you are going to be in partnership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the household and that 's great that means that you know if you 've got a partner who 's earning reasonable money that means there 's less pressure on your business to provide you with a wage however it is still essential i believe to be setting your business up with a view about the wages that you are going to require and i 'll touch it on this a little bit more when i show you a short video about how we look at budgeting okay so that 's about family expenses so you know once again streamline wherever you can think about what 's really necessary and you know take some of the pressure off financially at home if you possibly can the next thing is to do the same thing you know with your business expenses now a lot of your business expenses you are not going to be able to you know put aside and some of the business expenses that you might consider putting asides are probably ones that you is not the best thing to put aside so an example of that might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know i won 't market and everything else because you know i don 't have much money coming in but sometimes it 's actually better to you know strip down some of the bare bones things that you need you know do you need to buy a new christmas tree for the shop this year do you need to buy a do you have to do you know new sign writing or things like that can you make do with what you 've got you know do you have to do you know a lot of marketing you know as in advertising and newspapers and things like that maybe you don 't need to do that maybe you have to be smarter about how you use your marketing dollars to be able to connect with your existing customers or your past customers to bring those up today do you put some advertising you know behind adwords or you know into facebook your instagram campaigns or things like that to actually you know connect with the people that are most important you know to your customers so you can spend less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a case of sitting back and really rationalizing all of your business expenses and looking at you know what is necessary um and many things will be necessary you 've got to keep those things you 've got to have a somewhere to work from you know if you 're working from home and you 've had an office in the past maybe this is the time you know and you 've got some struggling about paying rent or something maybe this is the way that you look at do you need an office going forward or something like that and i 'm not suggesting that you get out of your office if you need it obviously not but there are other ways co-working spaces and you know working from home and things like that which people are starting to accept as the norm in a bit of commerce because of the coverage shutdowns we 've had over the last few months to actually start looking at well how am i going to do business differently because if you start thinking about that as part of your overall plan financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can do you know within your business expenses other things like i 've touched on before which you know re-look at you know all of your you know your telephony bills you know can you get a better deal you know do you have an unlimited data plan you know when you 're only using 20 gigs or you know 10 gigs a month maybe you can save a lot of money by you know having a different plan for your phones um maybe you can bundle things and you know get things different you know and more and less expensively in an overall sense so it 's really really important to you know have a bit of a think about all of your business expenses and how you can actually manage those which ones are essential that you 've got to keep which ones you would like to keep that you can park and then maybe re-start again when the money 's flowing better and which ones actually don 't you need at all that you can actually you know sign out of those i mean are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using one you know little things like that so there 's a whole lot of stuff but once again i would suggest you know get some advice get some mentoring support whatever it may be talk to a business advisor talk to the the team at the economic development melbourne city council you know to get some help and sort of you know evaluating all of this stuff okay so now i 'm going to play a little video um now i 'll apologize in front the it was taken in a sort of a fairly big room it 's got a bit echo it sounds a little bit tinny but i think you 'll find that it works well so sit back it goes for about six minutes but this will give you an idea about a budgeting process that we use and that i 'd suggest might be beneficial to you now if you 've got a problem hearing it or anything please just pop a note in the chat box so that i can see it is then i can make some alterations [Music] hi my name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been working since 2003 helping people start their business or grow their business now one of the fundamental issues that nearly every business owner faces from time to time is the one about cash flow all right so it 's about do i have enough money coming in to pay the bills you know i mean the wages or otherwise it could be do i have sufficient funds coming through my business to actually grow my business and take it to the next level now typically most business owners have done some sort of cash flow or budget predictions and typically what they look like is something like this on the board here we 've got a categories column on this side we 've got a total column in there we 've got all of our months that go across in the middle there now most of the standard tools work from income at the top they 're still listing all the income with a total then there 's the expenses with all the various very various expenses of the total down the bottom here and then last of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did i make money or did i not make money within a particular month or over the course of the year now this tool i believe is great to analyze what has happened in your business but i actually don 't think is the best way to actually determine what you need to happen to take your business to the level that you want and to be able to decide the income that you require to make your business successful so what i 've done is a couple of small changes so let 's rub these out on the side what i tend to do with my business owners is i start with the expenses now most of us have got a handle on what our expenses are and understand how much money has to go out of our business on a day-by-day basis so there 's all the different levels and levels and levels of expenses and these will be things like you know motor vehicles advertising promotion wages stuff all of those different things except stock i 'll come to the stock in a moment now i 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're like many business owners wages is something that you tend to take out when the money is available now lots of small business owners are guilty of doing this and hey put my hand up be guilty of doing it myself so the question is to make your business successful and to understand how much money that you have to have to for your business successful it 's really important we plan to actually take a regular wage now there 's a couple of ways to do it of determining what that wage is the first one of those is to create a family budget go through all of your family expenses and come up with an amount of money which is the things that are directly rated your family which is outside of your business so once you 've actually got your family budget put that amount in on your wages line okay the other thing is if you 're not sure about what that is or if that seems fairly low then i would suggest have a look at your business have a look at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much it would cost you to actually hire somebody to do your job because if you know what that is put that in on the wages line all right also remember to add on the things like superannuation and those other things as well because they you want that as well as everybody else so once you 've got all the wages in there then you 've actually added all those up and you 've got a total heat which is the amount of money of your expenses now the next thing you have to do is to think about well i 'm looking to grow my business so i need to earn more money than just what 's required to cover those expenses so what i suggest we do is we add 20 as a minimum you know and if your service business will be higher product based business it could be 20 profit to grow your business okay i 'll come back to why 20 in a minute now once you 've got all your total of your expenses you add on the 20 what do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a service based business you can stop here right but i would suggest that you increase this amount to 20 as higher than 20 okay so typically my business i run on about 45 to 50 as a service business now why 20 you might ask well it 's very very simple what i 've come to realize with working with hundreds probably two or three thousand small businesses is that those that have a target typically will achieve between 90 and 120 of the target conversely those without a target typically only achieve between 50 and 80 of what they require so just look at these numbers for a moment let 's say your expenses were 100 add 20 that 's 100 that 's 20. so your total is 120. now if you 've got 90 of that 120 minus 12 which is taking away 10 percent you 've still got 108 which is 8 grand more than 100 that you require to make your business go now i mentioned this stops here for a service-based business if you 're a product based business so like a retail shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to add on the value of the cost of goods so that you can do either by a standard gross margin that you use or a real value of cost of goods so whatever it is add the cost of goods value onto the income target and that gives you your sales target then all you 've got to do is you divide your sales target or your income target depending on whether you 're a product or a service business divided by the number of you know the value of your average sale and that will tell you how many clients you have to seek for this business to work and to be profitable that 's my tip for today okay so i did get a message about the bit of uh lack of sync of the frame rates uh so i apologize for that um i 'm not sure whether that 's it seems to be flying frequently a fine at my end um and i only got the ones i 'm not sure whether that 's buffering at yours so i trust that you 've got the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there 's any questions about it please feel free to pop that in the chat box now um just and i 'm more than happy to respond to that so i 'll just give it a moment for anybody to pop something in there if there is a question on that or comment okay so nothing coming through so i 'll i 'll move on and one of the things you saw from the video is that at the end of that equation of you know whether it was the income target or whether it was the sales target what that did give you is a break-even amount in fact the break-even amount is actually the expenses so without the 20 on top of it now i used to run a service business and i used to run my service business on a 40 um profit for growth rather than a 20 and i recommend that most service-based businesses do do that um so what sales talk i 've got a message what sales target would you set for different industries actually i mean profit percentage it really comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ato benchmarks as being something that can guide you on what the profits are by industry so once now that we 've actually got a budget in place and is broken down and we understand what our basic expenses are we then have a break-even amount that 's the actual amount of money that you have to make for your business to at least break even now the reality is what we know to be true with those numbers is that when people understand what their target numbers are typically they will get between 90 and 120 of those and that 's just a psychological thing that we once we know what we 're going for we tend to go for it and we we actually get it we start you know monitoring we think about you know how we 're doing it are we on track with it and we can put in tools to manage it and monitor it um if we don 't know what that number is what i find happens from all the hundreds of businesses that i 've worked with is that people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only get between about 50 and 80 of what they actually require and the first thing that goes out of the window is their own wages so i think it 's absolutely essential that every one of us you know does a budget tool and then puts it together now you know we have a cash flow tool a cash flow forecasting template which actually looks like this which is actually all set up and you know i know ross when he speaks to you at the end of the session we 'll be more than happy to make this available um to people that have been on the session as well so you don 't have to try and create this is the tool that 's already there so this particular tool takes you gives you an idea of all the different expenses you don 't have to use them all but you know the thing about cash flow is that it 's one thing to work out a budget which is how much money you need to generate the next thing is that you 've got to understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money and when you get the money you know in so to actually sell so using our shop as an example um you know we would have to go to sort of like you know in august uh we would be going to the trade fairs and we 'd be spending money to buy goods that we weren 't going to see a return on until christmas time so there 's about three or four you know months where i 'm actually paying money out to actually buy stock for delivery uh to sell at christmas time and i had to carry the value of that so with service based business often times you know we 'll be doing services and then billing people and there might be a delay and then paying so yeah we 're going to sort of work out our cash flow so this particular template is to design to actually help you look at that and then what you do at the bottom is that you start putting in your income once you 've actually understood you know from the video that i showed you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now you 've got to start working out when 's where 's that money going to come from and when is it going to come in so that you can make sure that everything marries up and you know it might mean that you 've got to invest some money it might means you need some credit um it might means you have an overdraft you know whatever it might be there are ways that you can use to actually manage your cash flow but you need to know and plan for when that money is going to be required so you can work around and understand what you 're going to do so this is a tool that can help you do that so the other thing i would suggest that you know in terms of planning your cash flow is to really really be having a think about you know creating some sort of a graph about your sales month by month by month so this was something that you know we did for a particular business and yeah we looked at it so those was a normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um as the month along the bottom and they had small sales you know sort of you know in between like you know five and twenty five thousand dollars a month you know depending on what month it was now this was a retail business um and you can see december high peaks so you know christmas trading that sort of stuff um and this wasn 't my business it was another business but yeah you can essentially see the different you know the way that you know these businesses operated okay so i would suggest it 's easy to do it 's all as a matter is getting an excel spreadsheet or if you 're using things like know myob xero or one of the other accounting type packages you know look at how you transfer that data across into you know graph formats as you can actually see your sales and so you can actually see the trends of your business and understanding the trends of your business will help you with actually managing the finances of your business next thing is about getting your pricing right now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was speaking about the um you know increasing your prices oftentimes we haven 't done it you know pricing is very very critical you know to get your business you 've got to understand what your costs are you know you 've got to unders and this is not just the cost of goods if you 're reselling them it 's also about understanding what it costs you to run your business and import and apportioning an amount of those overheads to the products or services that you sell so you know pricing is very very important and possibly something you might need some advice with some of you will probably be very very good at it but yeah fundamentally knowing what your core profit margins are on if you 're buying goods in applying that over the top of your expenses and factoring all of your expenses from your budget will actually help you determine what the right pricing is for the products or services that you 're selling and if you 're finding that you 're you 've got to sell higher than somebody else rather than just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important to start thinking about how you can do things differently are those products or services for the right that wants to be selling for your business and if they are how can you actually increase the value of them or decrease the expenses around them without you know throwing away the customer experience as i explained earlier so there is a difference between profit margin and markup and very simply um you know it 's um the the difference very simply is this is if you if you buy something for a dollar and you sell it for two dollars you know the markup is a hundred percent so you 've doubled your money with all the cost but your actual profit margin is 50 of what you sell it for now it 's important to know that distinction because sometimes you know we forget that you know when we sell something whether it 's a product or service if we get 10 bucks for it you know we think oh wow i 've got ten dollars to spend well in reality you might only have two dollars or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ margin is which is the bit that you get to keep the rest of it 's actually gone on the expenses of you know creating or you know buying that product to sell there are some certain margins so some businesses they will be thinking about you know manufacturing some businesses will be manufacturing they 'll be thinking of selling it through wholesalers or distributors and then retailers you know so you know we need to understand if you 're going to be a manufacturing business what the various links in the chain are going to require and these are just guidelines that i 've got on the screen here um but you know you know you 've got to understand what the links in the chain are so if you 're going to be pricing you 're going to have to be pricing from the very outset at a retail price if you 're the manufacturer or the wholesaler um so that everybody in that chain is going to be able to get their cut and so and they 're all going to be making some money so it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually formulating your pricing once again you know don 't try and work it out now get some help around this stuff you know if that 's what you 're thinking of doing um the next thing is for bank accounts is a process of managing money i would suggest you would all have a business account i would suggest you probably all got a personal account um and what we suggest that you do with the four bank accounts is that you know from your bank accounts you create a business saver account now i used to use iga most of the major banks have now got these these are on the online savers accounts where you can transfer money backwards and forwards pretty quickly but i would you know put aside from my business account i would pay two ways first is i would pay my wage to my personal account and then from the business account i would pay into the business saver account things like gst or payg or you know things like that or the profit for growth element that i 've been built into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month i 'd make a transfer into that into that account and the reason for doing that is that puts that money aside you 'll get a little bit better interest i know interest rates are not great at this particular point in time but you know you will get something which will contribute but the other thing is good is it takes that money out of your day-to-day transaction account for your business and it makes you more frugal as you actually you know paying your bills the things that you buy on the services thing that you commit to now last thing is that you know i used to run a personal saver as well similar to the on the business saver which is an online one and i 've put money aside you know if i wanted a new car or holiday or something like that or whatever some repairs from the house whatever it might be it was just a way of actually forcing myself into saving and what i found was is that when i was using this sort of a system and quite deliberately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using the business account as the main transaction account i actually had more money available to me to use on an ongoing basis because i 'd actually hidden some of the money that i might otherwise have spent now it 's not always practical that you 're going to be able to do that i understand that but yeah it 's a it 's a great little tool to use or process to use if you know you can have the ability to be able to do that put aside some of that stuff some of you will be very good of it some of you probably like me when i first started business i 'm probably terrible at it this helped me get on track with my finances next thing is that you know it 's really important i think is for every business to create some financial key performance indicators now typically when my wife and i had the um you know the gift shop um what we used to do is was our average daily sales was the amount the profit amount per sale the uh person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually monitor all of our sales activity on a daily weekly monthly basis to make sure we were on track and then we would import those you know the results into our budget document as well so as we could track a variation between you know what our target is and what our actuals were so it 's really really important uh to actually create some kpis um and also to understand what they are and use those as a management tool to keep you on track see the thing is that with the kpis if you know what it is and you 're not meeting that kpi you 've then got to go back and have a look at it or you 've got to work out you know why it 's not working for you and then you can make some adjustments to your business now i know when times are tough we all are looking for some financial support options um so you know you 've got the federal job keeper the job maker so these are you know ones that are available federally um certainly check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you links to the various grants and stuff that are available also check out business victoria they 've got uh this small business digital adaptation program that they 've just launched which is uh up to about twelve hundred dollars um for implementing things like you know accounting systems and stuff like that um there are you know like all grant programs there are you know criteria that you 've got to meet so look at it carefully it may or may not be right for you for those in the in the hospitality industry there 's outdoor eating and entertainment grants that might be applicable to you and the other one is that the third round of the business support fund from the victorian government is about to wrap up it 's closing you know in five days time so if you haven 't gone in for part three of that already and you do qualify you know get on to it very very quickly so i don 't really don 't want to go on with much more because i you know it 's fairly hard to digest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this so,"(-37.8146168, 144.9664898)"

Melbourne,X5XNVOANk9o,20201106,3450.72,"120 Swanston St, Melbourne VIC 3000, Australia",9933,all right well uh welcome everyone thank you for joining me today on our presentation talking about digital marketing um i appreciate that um you know sometimes it 's hard to find the time for these things so i endeavor to leave you with lots of value for your time today so just a little bit about me i am a business mentor with a small business mentoring service which i 've been doing for about five years when i 'm not a business mentor i have a consulting business and i work with clients on marketing strategy website and content and social media management and also information systems i also have been working in or with retailers for about 23 years so that 's a really a strong area of my experience and i also work with a lot of e-commerce businesses and of course professional services so hopefully i 'm without knowing uh too much about the industries represented on this call today i hope i can cover some with some relevant examples for all of you um i 'm also a very active social media user and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that there 's a lot that can be gained for businesses getting digitally savvy and i would probably say that most of my discretionary spend goes on products that i see advertised online so there 's definitely opportunity for product based businesses and service businesses as well um and i will be sharing not just social media tips with you today but also just general digital marketing strategies that you may or may have not heard of so of course um it 's been difficult for most of us um i speak to hundreds of clients and everyone has a challenge story related to this year so definitely you know without discounting how hard it 's been i do find that there 's a lot of things to be excited about especially the opportunities that have um you know come up as a result of covert um this quote really appealed to me in the middle of difficulty lies opportunity and that 's what we 're focusing on today um interestingly i uh completed my information systems degree uh in the early 2000s and we were talking about back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology has progressed to that level but adaptation hasn 't really been there yet and i think one of the best things that covert has done has forced people to embrace technology more so than they would have ever felt comfortable to do before so this is where lies our opportunity so learning objectives for today so when this will understand the most common digital marketing strategies and of course digital marketing is more than just about social media however also social media is of course a major part of digital marketing at the moment so we 'll have a look at a deeper look at the leading platforms and how to harness them uh to promote your business we will also understand website solutions there 's definitely plenty of low-cost solutions available and knowing this can save you thousands of dollars so i hope that if you are looking at a new website um for your business i knowing what you 'll learn today will save you hundreds if not thousands now how to get sales obviously it 's all good and well to promote digital marketing social media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not seeing results from it so we 'll briefly touch on um how to you know see a return on your investment primarily around social media but also will be you know what i want to illustrate that all of this can be achieved without having your website so if your business is not really conducive to having a website or for whatever reason it 's not something you 're capable to implement right now no to worry there 's definitely still plenty of opportunities online that can drive traffic to your business so looking at digital marketing strategies so this is what we 'll essentially be covering today and this is not an order of priority this is more um in order that we 'll cover them because social media is a really really large portion of their topic so i 've left it to the end and we 'll quickly cover um some of these other areas first the reason being is with social media for example i run a three hour um course on um just the two major platforms instagram and facebook so basically each one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least presentation with it so obviously we 've had to compress this in one hour to uh to give you sort of a broader scope but um you know there 's opportunities to discuss it further and what 's relevant for your business um in one-on-one sessions which we 'll touch on a bit later so as much as most people think that people hate email email is actually one of the most effective tools in reaching your customers the reason being is that it 's the only free tool that you can guarantee reach your customers now i personally hate em you know junkie more like chain emails or whatever you want to call them i 've got an inbox of about 30 000 unread emails on my yahoo account so yes to some extent some emails do get unnoticed however i also subscribe and receive emails into my preferred inbox of businesses that i 'm highly engaged with that i like what they do i think they 're clever and they don 't inundate me with spam so that 's important because if you 've got customers that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your business they will allow you into their life as long as you don 't send them daily weekly 50 off specials type wasteful things so the first question is do you have an existing email database if not then it 's time to start working on it collecting it it could even be a you know customers that have bought from you before it could be friends and family some friends and family actually would be happy to receive uh information about your business um if given the opportunity but most people don 't think to do that um if you are already doing email marketing are you doing it effectively you know what what what are the strategies that you 're using and could they be improved what i often say is just it is all even though if you read google email tips often they do sort of uh quantity you know saying that people may miss your email and just send you know send as many as possible when you get those long worded emails to promote products to you or services i actually in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so often to remind customers that you exist you know whether it 's christmas promotion or whether it 's you know spring season or whatever it might be but it 's just a friendly reminder that you exist with quality content whether it 's pictures or links to useful information not text heavy you know really simple that then maybe leads to more information is where it 's at one of the best tips that i ever received and it actually is a formula that pretty much with most of the clients that i work with uh is very applicable so i used to own a retail store um in brunswick street and i used to collect emails and hate sending emails because i thought my customers hated receiving my emails and my husband who works in third party logistics which is uh fulfillment for online retailers said look as much as you hate email fundamentally to these businesses their email addresses are their asset and the asset has value and i also had a business coach which taught me to value the email addresses as an asset and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is if you get a thousand people to spend a thousand dollars with you there 's your million dollars so obviously breaking it down for various businesses it might not work for you or you might you know 500 could 500 emails could be your um you know million dollar asset or whatever it might be so it could be slightly different depending on what type of product or service you offer but fundamentally that is a very applicable formula to most businesses probably the only businesses that i 've encountered that may not be able to use it to the same extent is really like gift focus you know sort of small gifts that you wouldn 't have a repeat purchase off everything else services product wholesale distribution retail whatever it might be this formula is really applicable so see it that way so a thousand active emails that are engaged with you is potential a million dollar revenue so collect emails as a matter of priority don 't offer discounts i suggest provide uh valuable lead magnets it could be books on how to do things or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discounts might be valuable but essentially don 't just say on your website or wherever sign up for newsletters because nobody wants to receive that it has to be a clever way it 's competitions it 's it 's you know lucky deep if you 're in retail a ball of lucky dip you know that way people are happy to give you their details in return for something so really important keep that in mind so obviously websites and sas so sas is software as a service so website trends are changing every couple of years so if i 've got any um web developers on the call you might not like what i 'm saying right now but in the last um five years the web builder website builder software solutions have become so simple that anyone that 's remotely capable in the computer can build their own websites obviously most people might not be but what website builders enable you to do is have cheap website solutions so when i 'm hearing from customers or clients that are telling me that they 're getting quoted fifteen thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick because i know that they can probably get the same result for about a thousand max right so often why this happens is generally people are not sure what they want they 've got their wish list of what they want their website to do and so they go out and google for web designers and they say i would like this and i would like it integrating with this and this and this and that so the provider is like cool that 's what you want so they give you the quote for what that would work will the cost of making that happen for you however there 's really low cost software like customer relationship management software like mailchimp for example which is the email marketing software membership management learning management system if you run online courses you know that have a low monthly fee and really easy setup that are really simply integrating with these uh website builders solutions so you could really have a very tech advanced solution for maybe roughly about 70 bucks a month and a couple of grand and set up fees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's obviously yes some businesses need really really really custom you know back ends or very complex reporting structures through their websites or they 're just mega large retailers that need a lot of complexity so yes from that perspective web custom website development is the best solution but for small businesses really you can do it quite cheaply and effectively and not notice the difference so some of my favorite website builders are shopify uh that 's great for e-commerce if you sell products uh wix is great for just simple usability entry-level website with lots of plug-in features so if you take appointments for example uh you know get various little little gadgets that would make it a better customer experience that 's a good platform generally website developers hate these solutions but it 's sort of one of those things where when someone you know um encroaches on your expertise with a cheaper solution um you know it is annoying but at the same time you know everyone everything has its place so squarespace is one of my favorites again it 's probably not it does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i would probably be using it more as a um you know portfolio really stylized sort of like business card type websites you know for your business profile that could be great for cafes because it 's really simple to make it look schmick wordpress is a very standard system um it 's used by a lot of professional web developers and i think it 's great if you are going to continue working with professional web developers rather than trying to do it yourself but i find even though i have an information systems degree and i 'm very adaptable to software it drives me nuts like it 's really hard to use you have plug-ins things expire it 's really easy to hack whereas all these other systems actually have all that and built and you don 't even have to think about it so as i always say when there 's many mixed opinions there 's no one correct answer so it 's always good to gather as much knowledge about what solutions are available to you and make your decision but i know that i 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great so this is where you know working with a business mentor potentially can help you um understand all the options that are available uh seo kid keywords obviously that goes hand in hand with websites it 's an ongoing process i um it can a lot of it can be done yourself but it 's very tedious so if you can outsource that early stage setup to get all the bones right it 's best but there 's a lot of free online material where you can learn to do it yourself and yet does your existing website need that you would definitely probably always need that um does your business appear on keyword searches do you even know what your keyword searches are so i 've listed a number of free tools here that you might find really useful to understand what you can do for your website in terms of attracting you know the the customers you want is your google analytics setup uh that 's really useful to know where your traffic is coming from and what 's selling and even if you get experts having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where your market actually is and of course creating content to drive seo which we 'll touch on a bit later what 's content creation but you know writing blogs or and things like that so the next point is affiliate and collaborative marketing and apps so affiliate partners and collaborators is different to what i would call affiliate services so affiliate partners and collaborators and businesses that are basically catering to the same customers um as yours but they 're not competing with you so say if you 're an accountant you might partner with a law firm or if you are a bakery you might partner with a coffee shop or whatever it might be in order to cross promote to each other 's client base um because it 's obviously coming as a warm lead um and it 's more welcome than sort of you know cold type of approach advertising you can share each other 's videos images whatever it might be doing collaborative promotions if you are in services could you offer a package that offers both services that type of thing and obviously promoting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more around um you know like apps that uh aggregate of businesses that promote things so for example skip and live and pay um for cafes where people can order things and pre-order and collect their coffee or pay with this app and get points so identifying if there is apps like that that actually are relevant for your business because it basically opens a pool of new potential customers that you might not be able to reach yourself so it 's worth researching depending on what industry and what 's available from the perspective directory listing so are there any other are there any relevant directories for your business um or industry so it could be anything from you know the urban list uh but this is an example of melbourne best gift shops for example but what you know are there other lists like that that your business can participate best accountants whatever it might be um service seeking true local all those types of directories is really useful um and not from even just the perspective of attracting clients but also from search engine optimization with linked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relevant tourist websites if you 're in the tourism industry possibly even in different languages all these considerations um you can you know investigate how to attract tourists from different countries there 's also now new initiatives like go local first so local business support directories and the victorian government campaign click for vic so you can get listed as a destination in victoria on visit victoria for free for a year so you know what are these directories that could be relevant for your business you you need to be on them again attracting a pool of customers that you might not be able to reach directly um so selling through other websites and marketplaces so i say it 's letting others do the marketing for you obviously they do take your um a margin so you know is the cost worth it you 'd have to look at it individually for your business but there 's platforms for retailers like amazon and ebay and marketplaces like catch and cogan platforms for freelancers platforms for learning where you could post the course and promote your consulting service whatever it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etsy uh facebook marketplace even um to give you an example of how effective that was for a business in covert so um i know business that was predominantly distributes her direct to other retailers and when they got closed with the first round of closures of retail and restrictions basically the business went down to about 500 in april or something i believe or march anyway so the the event of the business owner was panicking and they had never really done b2c sales business to consumer so they quickly threw together a website of their product uh to sell directly to consumer and connected it to amazon kogan and catch and the next month they did fifty thousand dollars with four thousand four thousand orders and individual emails that they now had to promote to just because they connected to these third-party platforms so again it 's maybe not a long term strategy because you do if you if you 've got a good customer following uh you don 't want to sort of cannibalize your profit margins by giving commissions to these other platforms but if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but obviously there 's opportunity for services um definitely there 's a lot of opportunity there so keep that in mind so marketing through interest groups so where do your potential customers and clients go to for information so it could be online groups like facebook obviously facebook has millions of groups on it um and networking groups like meetup or melbourne business network so um it 's really easy to i 've you know i 've seen instances where businesses are making lots of money like a nursery shop that sells like um house plants they 've got a shop they 've got an online store but they do regular posting in local melbourne sales groups just to promote their product and it does really well for them so even if you 're a cafe you could probably join like a coffee lovers meetup group when ignoring covert obviously now we can 't but soon it will all be over so you could go to a coffee lovers meetup group and sort of create a network around coffee lovers that come to your coffee shop so you know again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group where you could kind of indirectly market to them just being part of that group so definitely a good underutilized strategy there you know and they say network marketing is word of mouth one of the best ways to do it so that 's this is the key here so now we 'll look at social media so of course it 's the most effective way to reach and connect with customers and why is that it 's you know pro why use these platforms is you know opportunities for growth unrestricted growth without too much investment it 's slow initial investment in that you can set it all up for free obviously some platforms require now payment to get more you know eyes on the post but that 's besides the point low cost of operation of operation uh with an asterisk what i mean by that is if you can operate it yourself then obviously it 's your time which time is money but you know it 's not something that you have to cough up up front um whereas uh you know if you do need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously there 's some costs involved and the cost of that depends on who you get involved um so obviously social media helps you build your company profile you know think about back to the days before social media you know how you were very limited to sort of what you could reach within your own you know your own local area or network um if you had to pay for advertising was newspaper which caught you know like actual media which costs a lot of money so um you know so social media has enabled it to be very easy um so it also helps customers stay connected with you you know previously again people would just come to your business and see it for what it is and then be gone whereas now you 've got the opportunity to continuously remind them of your existence and stay connected if they 've bought into your brand and love what you do um it 's easier to get repeat business than attract and educate new customers so that relationship is you know worth keeping because then again your 1 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it 's at so i 've got we 'll just look at the major players now in um in the social media space so facebook obviously it started as a means to connect and stay in touch with people and broadcast personal updates to your friends and now has evolved into more of a media platform focusing on articles of interest and videos for amusement with targeted advertising and unfortunately very limited opportunity now remains for uh free brand promotion only up to 10 percent of your followers actually see your free posts um just in case you 're not too familiar facebook business page is administered by personal accounts um and you can act as your own business on facebook and there 's facebook phone apps for different purposes so personal and business and um also more advanced options on the desktop and with instagram it started as a means to i didn 't share your own phone pictures and now it evolved into a content sharing platform providing opportunity for brands to create visual identity and attract followers the good thing is that um we 've faced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reach that has an account so there 's no restrictions on um how can i say on you know with facebook you can 't it 's really hard to contact people directly whereas on instagram you can send everybody you know just into arden sally cap and then message so it makes it easy to find and attract your potential customers to follow you as opposed to facebook that really has cut back on that ability it still has its value but not as much as instagram um you can even yeah reach celebrities people of influence um can follow topics you 're interested in with hashtags um and then just accounts can be public or private obviously your business is um its own individual so you act as your business and it 's mainly an app with minimal desktop features so the benefits of each channel facebook i suggest that the minimum you see it as a directory listing you have to have it if you don 't want to update it regularly don 't just make sure it looks current it appears highly in google search terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not important to constantly be posting content on it now because it is getting a lot harder to get engagement obviously if you are getting engagement and you 've got a good content strategy then of course you know it 's still a great tool in many ways so um as i mentioned you stay connected with your fans as i but i said email is better so focus on your emails if you can customers can leave a testimonial about your business on facebook which is good and i think it 's more reliable to some extent than google local because there 's less ability for fake fake person profiles to leave negative reviews on you uh it 's more okay you know there 's more accountability on facebook generally um it 's a good alternative for websites so you can easily sell through it if you didn 't want to have a website to sell through it 's it 's perfectly built for targeted advertising if you spend any money on advertising that this it 's definitely worth a shot because you know you 're reaching your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've got a product or a service that enables a community around it like sustainability or mental health whatever it might be really really easy to create and build communities and nurture your customers that way facebook marketplace is good for products it enables easy cross promotion facebook shop is a new feature so you can list your products and sell them via facebook and service i find that service business is the best aligned to take maximum advantage of facebook at the moment just because of that appreciation for media type content so reading articles watching videos on a specific topic product-based businesses don 't seem to be getting so much traction because people don 't tend to share you know a picture of a deodorant or toothbrush or whatever you might be selling whereas they might share an article on sustainability for example that appeals to them um so instagram value is um the benefit is great it 's great for brand building tool for visual so if you 've got a really creative business or you know kind of aesthetically pleasing business it 's instagram is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um easy to market through images and videos without having to post much wording i get targeted paid ads are great like i said most of my spend goes on things that i see on instagram that i didn 't even know i wanted um individual celebrity and influencers sell on your behalf so if you wanted to engage that as a strategy we 'll talk about it a bit later but um you know influencers have become i guess a new more reachable uh group rather than actual celebrities like movie stars and singers that you previously couldn 't reach as a small business to endorse your product whereas now you do have the potential to work with someone that has a high reach of your potential customers to promote your product on your behalf with that you know the challenges of actually reaching them in the first place um best uh it 's so instagram is definitely best for product based businesses um and individual brand profile building um not services i 've seen services do well on there and it 's becoming more and more kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time i think the the values really for product-based businesses on instagram of course there is many other channels um of with for social media um i 'll quickly go over them but we 'll focus on the major ones today so youtube obviously is video for sharing and creating your own channel so lots of great opportunity there not just to upload videos to share on the other channels but to create your own channel on the topic and be you know show yourself to be an expert or um you know cooking videos or whatever your business does uh how-to videos if you 're a service provider um you know with accounting tax type videos if you 're an accountant whatever it might be um you know it is a great tool tick tock is um relatively new and it basically is entertainment videos i 've seen some businesses do some very clever things with it i 'm not too familiar with it and i think it might i don 't know if it 's a short-term live thing but it 's definitely a younger audience and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wouldn 't be recommending it to um many snapchat very teenagers videos and photos disappear large companies have leveraged it quite well i haven 't really heard of small business doing well with it pinterest is great for decor products that are always available or information even like toddler nutrition for example so if your nutritionist you could post things on there that kind of continue to circulate for years and years it 's not good for seasonal products like um clothing that is seasonal or um something that you know you sell through and don 't repeat because it is something that remains up there for a really long time so you might find it in two years time you 've got someone following up on that product and you don 't have it anymore linkedin obviously great for professional services in your resumes and twitter short text messages um again i haven 't seen too many small businesses get traction with it but obviously for some it is relevant so you know what is the purpose of social media i do get a lot of frustrated small businesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say well you know yes sales is one thing and you want everything to lead to sales but at the same time really social media marketing is equal parts brand identity you know keeping in touch with fans reaching new fans building the community and of course product promotion so it 's not um a channel for advertising type content all the time it 's it 's you know each post has to have a greater purpose um and it doesn 't always lead to sales and it 's a lot about nurturing and engaging with your followers to remind them that you 're there so of course the challenges the with everything there 's challenges so uh with social media media it 's not the holy grail um you know there 's a lot of talk about how you have to be online you have to be using social media and unfortunately it just doesn 't work for all so there is a bit of an x factor so some businesses can do all the best practice advice and um find themselves you know not having any results and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doesn 't goes outside the typical normal conventions of what is normal and cool on social media and do really well with it so it is a bit of a test and measure situation um you do have to kind of play by platform rules and user preferences even though you know novel and innovative content is welcome but you have to kind of balance it with doing what 's on trend and cool right now um you need to really be a user to understand the platforms like if you you just can 't you know you 've never used it and then you log in and start kind of getting valued immediately if you really are a user then you can kind of start to see where your opportunities might lie you need to be creative um and capable to do your own brand content otherwise you have to outsource it and you need to be consistent that 's really important and so random pictures and no clear messaging really is actually detraction i say poorly managed accounts are worse than having nothing at all so again look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will pursue um and of course more businesses are being forced to be paid uh of being forced to pay to show their content to their followers which is not ideal and it 's going to be more so uh as we progress so that 's that 's definitely a challenge um for people that heavily rely on social media for their marketing um and just keeping in mind that format formatting of advertising is quite different to posts formatting and the way you do advertising on these channels is different to your posts so um some people don 't understand that and either do really ad copy kind of like typical ad sounding posts which don 't work and then they boost their normal posts as an ad which also doesn 't work so you kind of have to understand that balance with facebook specifically limited organic exposure which i 've mentioned um it 's really hard to actually get organic followers these days without paying for a campaign to get people to like your page um you 're pretty much relying on your network to grow your fan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just so good for products like i 've mentioned with instagram the challenge that 's a that curated content is essential um it 's not just about the individual post it 's about the grid so as you can see here i 've got examples of before and after of you know mediocre grids and then when they become curated how much more effective it looks and businesses that don 't understand the importance of this grid um often do not will they find that they 're not getting traction on instagram because it looks messy and users don 't want to engage with it also content creation on instagram is very time consuming but it 's short-lived so you know your followers are exposed to it for a couple of seconds max so um it kind of seems a bit disheartening when you 've spent all this time and only get a few you few bleeds from it so it is a challenge from that perspective and it is a bit of a popular popularity contest so a vanity matrix do kind of play into it so uh content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to create content which is essentially uh you know text images sounds videos and animations um so when you are marketing online it 's important to understand who 's your online customer so if you find that for example your main customer in physical presence is 80 year old grandmothers the chances are that they 're not going to be your customers online so um basically determine what your online client persona is and what they would like to say follow and basically target them specifically um the good thing is it doesn 't have to be done by a professional if you 're very clever you don 't well don 't have to be very clever but just you know um you can write you can take photos you can use your smartphone using you know filter filters and things like that so if you can do that you can create your own content if you don 't know what i 'm talking about then you probably need some some professional help with that um so content must be fun must be consistent avoid personal content what i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then you post you know you taking your dog for a walk in the morning or you um kind of post a random what you 've eaten for lunch type thing like that kind of mixes up the brand message message so unless your personality is really tied with your brand just don 't include your personal in details into it um you can do it in the stories though um the social media now has the stories featured which disappears after 24 hours people do like to see inside a person 's um or i guess a businesses back you know behind the scenes but it just shouldn 't kind of be at the forefront of how you present your brand online and remember it 's not an ad feed it 's not for your catalog it 's not for your promotions it 's for what would your brand be like a if it was a person what would it be like and that 's your communication strategy around that um sharing other people 's content will strengthen your brand identity it 's called contents education so if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of supports the point that you 're trying to make of your business you can share it give all the credit where it 's due but you don 't have to write your own blog content from scratch uh you also um don 't uh don 't need to you know for your social media create or your own images so again you can share for example if you sell hats you might find a model wearing a hat and say we love her model x looks so amazing in this hat again it 's not a bad and by our head had 50 off it 's more about that lifestyle and showing um you know how others are living a similar lifestyle to what you are um the easiest way to do all this is create a content bank uh which is just basically a collection of links and images that you want to share rather than posting them as you find them and then you spend about two hours every couple of weeks planning or scheduling your contact with content with a specific goal in mind so are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales are you trying to promote your new range all of that um can be planned out i find with a lot of small businesses saying the lead up to christmas they wake up you know oh my god it 's first of december i haven 't done my christmas promotions yet so if you do content planning you know well in advance that these certain things need to be activated um and you 're a bit more organized about it and therefore you see a lot more from your social media efforts otherwise it is a little bit like you 're posting but you 're not getting any results as a result you don 't want to post and then because you 're not posting you 're not getting results so it 's like very much chicken and egg situation so you do have to you know chip away at it continuously even if you don 't think you 're seeing results if you 're not seeing results it 's really good to speak to someone to try to understand why because you might just be able to tweak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is planning and visual planning apps like hootsuite and plannerly which are free for the basic version and you can schedule your posting through them and see what your grid will look like and you know kind of not have to guess it 's just all there for you presented um there 's a huge number of apps as you can imagine for editing and filtering images and video templates to help you make it look professional so one if you haven 't heard about it you really need to get on it is canva.com free graphic design template apps um so it basically enables you to create professional looking uh imagery for all formats so depending on what you but facebook banners websites uh presentations whatever it might be there 's free free templates really well designed graphic templates on canva it 's amazing i think the girl that started this is now australia 's first self-made billionaire by obviously her company valuation but yeah she 's done really well um phone filters obviously there 's free phone filters that come with every phone you can get free apps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh settings in those or you can even get what 's called presets which are predetermined settings for these types of apps and then they create uh the same hue on all your images which creates that consistency that um is good to have especially on instagram and of course free stock images you know google free stock images i think glass count we found about 16 websites that are for free stock images i 've listed my go-to ones here so you can use them for everything basically other than kind of direct sales so if you find a hat on there you can 't say this is our hat fifty dollars like that 's not okay but you could do more lifestyle shots or you know include that into your content without it being a direct sales promotion and there 's you know millions of images available so what works and of course the answers it depends um you know what are your goals are you trying to get more food traffic you 're trying to get websites out bigger contactless more followers of course all of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of course what works for each uh business depends on what industry you 're in so again it 's worth chatting to someone um that has potentially more insight than you on that type of thing stuff to get strategy we 'll get clear on your strategy around that uh what are your capabilities can you create your own quality content is it the best way to spend your time you know some business owners want to learn how to do it but fundamentally if you 're not going to be the digital marketer in your business as it grows it might not be the best uh investment of time for you so could you work more do earning money and outsourcing um this type of stuff to somebody else so it 's often good if you can do your own content creation because then the consistency is there so again it just depends on what industry you 're in and how much time you have and of course what is your budget if you do have the capability or if you don 't have the capability to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay um you can hire someone for small businesses i often steer them away from the bigger agencies because i do find that they don 't see the value in it for a number of reasons and mainly because the larger agencies work with businesses that are more organized and they 've already got their everything well you know their campaigns planned and they just need someone to execute it all whereas small businesses want these agencies to basically take over and do everything for them without a very big budget and so then they 're disappointed that they 're not seeing what they thought they would be seeing but so i often say for small businesses truck you know probably working with freelancers or single person agencies that type of thing would probably work best for you but i have seen some horrible horrible rip-off stories especially recently where you know um management fees of like 1500 a month and small businesses are not seeing a result on it so i 'm very cautious with the agency so again if you 're getting quotes uh maybe find someone that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get word-of-mouth referrals probably best speak to other businesses on who they use because like yeah we 've been basically you know having been the shoulder to cry on for these people that are getting ripped off by agency so i 'm just really cautious they 're definitely great when you find a good one but the the million dollar question is where i do find a good one so do your research um and then yes of course you can learn to do it yourself but it is hard and there 's a lot of test and measure involved so this is where small businesses get disheartened so you could follow best practice tips for your industry and not get any traction and then you might try something else and it works but how long you have to try things that don 't work before they do work is the million dollar question again so if um if if you don 't have much time or patience you probably are better off going with someone that that 's done the testing measuring for others can set it up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can take it over and manage it yourself and that way you 're not wasting your time and weeks and months trying to figure it out so last but not least um of course how do we increase engagement followers and sales so free increase free tools i guess uh obviously quality content um my favorite strategy at the moment is the following follow strategy i don 't think it has a better name mainly for instagram and that is you identify uh businesses or pages that are within your uh i guess uh realm of customers so it doesn 't have like i say don 't do your competitors but you know someone complimentary so as an example if you 're a food business you might find a local chef um if you 're a um i don 't know like a sustainability business you might find a you know australian sustainability group and see who follows them and then you basically just go to their followers and start following them and what that achieves is they 're basically knocking on these people 's doors that are potentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying here i am choose to follow me or not and you would have a really good call to action on your page so support small business through this tough time or online store launching soon in the meantime supporters by following us that kind of thing people like to support small business um and basically start following as many people as you can from these other pages and you will start to see people following you back now the um the good thing is that you can then also continue to engage them and i know this takes time but it 's worth it um liking and commenting if you can on the posts of the people that are most likely to become your customers because that makes them feel valued and again it 's an opportunity to remind them of yourself often people actually like it when the business seems to be engaged with them personally as an example i 'll show you how a clever social media strategy led to sales from my perspective so i was following a page called bio pack which is a reusable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a page that i would generally follow as an interest piece but they would have a really really really pretty instagram grid so bio dot pack if you want to look it up anyway and one day i 'd been to south melbourne market and i was outraged the use of plastic for um oysters and they happened to just post a biodegradable oyster tray and so i was like it was just the time it was uncanny and i said oh my god commented because i 'm a commentary and engaged and i said oh i 'm just at south mother market and i 'm so outraged about the plastic use and everyone all these fish and mangoes should be using this and just by good coincidence i guess a shop called fish shop responded to me and said well we 're at south melbourne market and we use these and i was like oh how nice they commented and it 's relevant and i had a look at their page and normally fishermongers is not something that interests me as a follow thing or the wood i would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content and i followed them and then so what happened was i saw them post this delicious looking salmon dish thing and i went to southern market and bought it so you know you can see how that i think often people are good how do i get sales i don 't know how to get this sort of conversion but that 's a perfect example where it 's just commenting a relevant comment got me to be a follower and buy into the brand and then their content got me to take action but it wasn 't immediate it was something that i saw you know a month down the track so that i 'm hoping i 'm sort of letting you see how you know engagement on instagram can really you know achieve actual sales without any cost to you to do it other than time now hashtags of course are a popular uh recommendation in terms of getting more followers um and engagement however the issue with that is if say you do you know hashtag coffee uh if you 're a coffee shop that means that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world could tap and hashtag coffee and see your coffee post i know they might like your post and they might like your page because they um like your content but they could be in slovenia or you know venezuela and so then not your customer so yes you should be hashtagging to attract relevant um and if you don 't know what hashtagging is uh it 's beyond we can 't go into that detail but we can have a one-on-one session and that can be explained um but essentially hashtags yes you do them but it 's just not the best driver of um customers that are your customers it 's identifying other complimentary pages and engaging with their followers that gets you the right customers like the bio pack and the fish shop example and like i said like comment and response so when you start following people just have a look when they follow you back if they look like a person that could potentially actually be your customer sometimes you can 't tell but generally you can so stay following them and engage with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you generally like it um if they don 't look like they 'll ever be a customer so that 's someone in venezuela and they liked your coffee well you can unfollow them because you don 't want to have too many people that you follow because you just get too much noise in your digital strategies aren 't that effective um so interactive content via story so you could do polls so if you have two different products or you 're trying to decide which color to introduce to your range you can post it as a story and get people to vote and people genuinely like to engage that way um uh so the engage you know different platforms that are related to your products and collaborate with others so you could do again you know cross-promotional post um to drive business to another you know oh we love we 're a coffee shop and we love this florist next door type commentary and they could do the same for you and you can run competitions competitions work best for um um bigger brands so generally people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of competitions unless you 've got something that they really want but competitions do work for some instances so again hopefully you you know whether it will work for you and if you don 't then again speak to someone that might be able to um you know provide you with a competition format not too many steps is the key so you know scientific competitions you need to go and like our page leave your email address you know invite 10 friends all that type of stuff you definitely start to lose people so the simpler the better are paid so paid options are boosted posts which are different different to ads and what i say boosted posts um kind of fundamentally like i said you 're not able to organically reach all of your followers especially on facebook so if you do want to reach them with your post like say you 're reopening and you want to make sure everyone that 's ever followed you knows this you may want to boost the post saying you 're reopening so it 's a more kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure you reach more people with that post approach which doesn 't necessarily result in actions and sales but um uh you know it it has its purpose but i wouldn 't recommend it as your main paid uh advertising channel ads of course it 's quite like complex um it 's easy to sort of select a demographic but there 's a lot of factors in identifying your potential customers so i would sort of be on the side of getting a professional to at least set you up and show you how to do it influences paying someone to promote your product does it work mostly no but it does create uh content for you and also you could use that for you know your email marketing that so-and-so is using it it 's social validation so look at it from a not like spin to get a return if you don 't get a return it 's a fail look at it more like um it 's a you know all the other benefits of it new followers content promotion social validation customer content so you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers to post on it so obviously it would be the cost of the product or the discount but that 's a really good way to get content and of course you can buy fakes so you can get fake followers and fake likes but obviously that 's not going to generate sales for you but if you do care about the vanity element and you you think your business will attract more followers by um having many followers that i mean i 'm not endorsing it but that 's one of the reasons why people would engage in purchasing rather than um getting their own organic followers for example if you go to a page and it 's got two followers it just doesn 't seem no matter how good their content is it just doesn 't seem like a page that people like so if you go to a page that has 20 000 followers on face value it must be doing something right because it 's got so many followers so even though the you know the followers can be purchased and you can have a look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's what um what sort of some people respond to that popularity element anyway that 's all we have time for today if you want um further support in this i believe the city of melbourne is offering uh 250 or so mentoring sessions for free so um these you would get it via the business concierge but you 'll receive info on the follow-up email about it um alternatively you can book mentors with the small business mentoring service um and with myself and that 's my profile so that 's it i guess for anyone that 's still on the line if you have any questions type them in the chat box and ross will read them out to me and i 'll do my best to answer it you,"(-37.8146168, 144.9664898)"

actual presentation now there 's a lead in for the recording um so i 'm just going to do a five four three two one and we 're now recording so good afternoon everybody welcome to marketing for small business part one uh where we 're going to be talking about marketing to community needs one of the objectives of today is to help you better understand the needs of your customers and to create appropriate and effective marketing communications to get back on track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiencing in the shortest time possible so you know we 're trying to do this by helping you improve knowledge um and and that 's in respect to the fact that most fail because of what they don 't know rather than what they do also you know looking to help you gain some new skills so that you can apply these uh new skills in a way to you know get improved results to use some proven tools so you know why reinvent the wheel when the design is already proven so the information that we 're going to be giving you and some support that may be available to you afterwards which we 'll talk about at the end is um you know really really important these will give you opportunities to access different tools um from a variety of sources and lastly it 's to help prepare you for your future i mean you know we all know that there 's a lot of challenges in our economic environment at the moment particularly in the greater melbourne area where you know we 've got this enforced lockdown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know but it 's a good time also to be able to sit back and to be able to plan how you 're going to change and what you 're going to do to create the future that you would like from this point forward fundamentally um i think we need to recognize and understand the fact that you know the current marketing models are just well and truly broken um the old marketing models were very much around you know we would promote our products out you know through a variety of different sources and you know shout from the rooftops and everything else but really nobody 's listening these days and there are a number of reasons for that first and foremost is that you know all of our customers and that includes us because we are customers of different organizations and you know we are much more informed you know we have far greater choice we are much more discerning in what we want to buy and you know we also have much higher minimum expectations and i 'll give you an example and i 'll try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this session you know to try and make these sort of images stick in your mind a little bit and relating to high minimum expectations you know it wasn 't that long ago if we went out um you know to a cafe somewhere and we asked for a long white coffee you know the person behind the counter would have gone to the international roast tin scooped out a teaspoon of coffee put it in a mug put some hot water on it asked if you wanted milk with that added that in and told you that the sugar was on the table uh behind you or on the counter in front of you you know in these days if we went to a cafe and that was the coffee that we were given we would be horrified you know if it 's not a barista uh coffee which is you know you 've got the choice of your macchiato 's long black short backed latte cappuccino vienna coffees whether it 's got soy milk almond milk skinny milk or regular milk or whatever it might be you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top of the latte or something you know we would think we were being dudded and you know that is just by virtue of the fact that the world has moved on and things keep on moving on and our expectations grow with us now the reality is it 's not just our expectations it 's the expectations of yourselves but it is the expectations of all of your customers they have grown about what you need to be providing to them now we also have found out through research and stuff that over 60 percent of satisfied customers customers never buy from the same business again so in other words i come into your establishment you know whatever your product or services and we have a wide number of different products and services represented in the audience of today everything from hotels to coffee bars to service-based businesses there 's a lot of different people here but these measures remain constant across all your different industry areas so you know 60 of satisfied customers never buy from the same business again in other words you know i 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me i 'm happy with the price i 'm happy with everything else and i 've walked off and you never see me again and the most prominent reason that you don 't see me again i 'm one of those 70 of customers on the next night who like who do not feel valued by your business so you know think about you know when you go to country businesses and you hear you know people talk about you know country relationships you know you 're going into regional areas you know you 're going to the shops and if you 're not in there they talk to you oh hi how you going they know your name they know what you like they 've actually built a relationship with you and in city-based businesses often because of the busyness and that 's busyness with a why we don 't have time to do those things or we don 't make time to do those things and customers therefore don 't feel very valued and you know with the emerging trends of covert and as we come out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more and more important to your success if you 're not if you don 't have good customer service if you don 't have good customer relationships then those people are going to be part of that 60 they 're satisfied with the cup of coffee or the you know the widget that they bought from you but you won 't see them again and the best value that you can provide making those customers feel valued is what 's going to get those people coming back staying loyal to you and then bringing their friends to you as well see when everybody 's doing the same thing and by that i mean not necessarily doing it very well but i see very little differentiation and when we see little differentiation between products our focus goes on price what 's the cheapest and we all know that focusing on price and reducing our pricing is actually a downward spiral and particularly now you 've been hit hard in terms of your economics of your businesses many of you have been closed for many months many of you have been on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and things like that you 're doing the absolute best you can to keep everything going but it 's really really hard so what 's really cool i believe is to ensure that every customer comes through your door is now valued that they don 't just see price and they don 't choose you on price they 're willing to help you get back on track now one of the key ways of getting people on back on tracks is word of mouth so if they 're telling good stories about you you know people will come into your businesses you know the reality is that last line on this slide says word of mouth influence is 60 plus bias advertising less than 30 now one of the key things that we often think about doing is when time stops i will advertise more well that might work and it will certainly work for some but it is not going to work for everybody and the reality is you know word of mouth if that 's what influences people then the best marketing that you can do is getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers or who have been your customers who are on your database because those are the opportunity areas to start engaging with those people start informing them if you haven 't been doing this already about you know where you 're at what you 're doing to make the your business better and stronger what are the new products that you 're bringing what are the things that you 're doing differently how safe are you from covert and all these things engage with your people now you know get out there talking to them whether it 's through using social media or whether it 's newsletters it 's about building that relationship and keeping that personal relationship going so when the time is right and those people are walking the streets of velvet again then they will think of you and come to you because you 've been in front of their mind so one of the things that i 'd like to just you know touch on in formulating before we get into some of the how to 's about you know customer needs marketing is let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know marketing in my in many many books and everything else is considered to be an umbrella term for all of the different things advertising publicity price product merchandising just location promotion all of these positioning and branding everything this is all part of the marketing mix but i actually think there 's a simpler equation for marketing and i think that that equation can best be described by the following statement and the marketing is a communication bridge between your customer and your business i 'll just repeat that for you marketing is a communication bridge between your customer and your business and the reason that i say that is that everything that you say do or don 't say and don 't do tells a story about how much you care about your customers you know the way you answer the phone the way you say thank you when they give you the you know they pay you the after sales service that you give or don 't give the way you greet customers when they walk into your business you know all of these different things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i worked for a distribution company and i was managing a particular facility and you know our guys in the warehouse they used to use any old box and type it up and send the parcels out with that and i looked at one of the biggest concerns we did some research across our customer base one of the biggest concerns was that their parcels weren 't well didn 't look right they weren 't careful so we just changed it we made everybody use new boxes now it cost us a little bit more money but our sales went up dramatically because it showed that we cared that we listened to our client customers and we made changes you know about how pack parcels were packaged so packaged so that things you know didn 't get broken in transit so it 's little things like that that you can do that can make a big difference between you know what people think give a customer and what your customers think of you as your business and how they relate to you and how they would recommend other people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a communication bridge then you 've got to ask ourselves now well what is it that our customers actually really buy from us and i 'll go back to the cup of coffee example and i 'll use this throughout today 's session if i come to your store to buy a cup of coffee am i buying a cup of coffee yes i 'm physically buying a cup of coffee but i could have bought a water i could have bought a juice i could have bought a tea i could have bought it i could have bought an alcoholic beverage okay see what i 'm really buying i wasn 't really buying a cup of coffee i was buying something to quench my thirst or i was buying a moment you know where i 'm sitting around to have a chat with a friend or something like that those are the things that i 'm really buying so you know by understanding what all customers really buy and that 's not a product or the service that you give it 's partially the experience of how you give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the solution that you 're providing to the problem that your customer has see every what time you go and buy something you know you go to the supermarket to buy groceries well actually what you 're buying is food to ensure that you don 't starve to death you go and buy a house but really what you 're buying is shelter now the different size scale the quality the prices that you pay for all of these different items will vary based on a number of other criteria but fundamentally what you are buying is a solution to a problem so if that 's what your customers are buying what we need to do is to start rethinking our businesses in terms of what are the problems that we actually solve for our customers so the cafe you know provides food quenching of thirst all of the different things like that so they provide sustenance okay so the um the hotel provides a safe place to sleep for the night and food and convenience and all those other things so but what is it that your customers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've identified what your problems are you can then start thinking about well who is my ideal customer now it won 't be just one customer you might have a multitude you know some businesses have three four five different ideal customers you know for different groups of products or different services that they may provide but the core about once you start identifying the problem that your business can solve and then you can say well starting and well who are the people that typically have this problem what are the common things about them you know what is what is it um what are the demographics what are their spending what is their uh where do they go to shop what are the ambience that they like what are all the things that make these people tick what are the things you know are we doing to ensure that whatever we do with our business we 're making it as customer friendly as we possibly can and particularly for those people who we 've identified and the most the largest group of people who actually have the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we run so once you 've actually identified who these people might be then the next part of that is to sort of understand well what is that customer 's journey you know how do they go from no knowledgeable business to about being a loyal customer and what that really means is what are all the different places where they interact with you so it might be through the web on social media it might be through advertising direct marketing it could be emails it could be you know after sales contacts it could be store visits it could be phone contact you know it 'll be different for each one of your businesses but a lot of these places where people connect to your business you know you 've got to then look at each one of these aspects of connection to say are we doing the best to make this really really um attractive to our customers so you either have or you haven 't okay so for example you know a number of the people have got a shop fronts so you know the windows is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of paper hanging all over the window so people can 't see into your business you know you 've got we 've all been on journeys you know to remote areas where you suddenly see yeah you go past the shopping strip and you see that there 's a you know a store which has got you know last year 's christmas decorations and there 's some dead blowflies in the window it 's not very attractive to come into the shop or you know we can see it in city areas where the paint 's peeling off on the outside the you know the sign outside is faded or you know is broken or cracked or something like that now what that says to the customer or potential customer is that you don 't really care about your business too much now the reality is you don 't see this the thing is that you 're walking past this every day of your life probably multiple times and you become oblivious to it we 've all been guilty of that but what we 've got to now do is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our building look at the all of the different elements our website our you know our invoices our papers their cards and our branding and all the different elements of our marketing and so yeah are they up to scratch in terms of meeting the higher expectations of the customers that we 've identified as being our core crew so once you 've actually you know identified who your ideal customer is and you 've looked at their journey you 're in a much better position to understand their needs and the more you know your customers needs the better you 're able to serve them you 're also better able to ensure that you propose a clear solution to the customer 's issue so remembering that people buy solutions to products sorry solutions to problems not products or services and lastly you can actually then come up with the offers that are the best ones to keep your customers coming back now the next thing is very important to do is to have a look at what your competitors are doing the first thing you 've got to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably a lot wider than the you know if you 're in a hamburger bar or a cafe or you 're a hotel or you 're a transport hub or whatever it might be an it business they 're not just the ones that are your media competitors who do the same thing that you do there 's other options around you that also can actually service those customers with similar always slightly different but similar types of product or options so the key thing is to sort of get aware of who your competitors are so and the reason for that is to come up with a competitive advantage and the best way to go and see who your competitors are is to go visit them you know ask friends people to go and visit them get them to tell you the story of what their experiences was because ultimately with competitive advantage the key things we need to do is firstly we need to starting from the left of the screen analyze the benefits of what your product or service offers so the benefits very simply are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's in it for me element so in other words you know i come and buy a cup of coffee really i 'm buying a drink because i 'm thirsty so what 's in it for me is quenching my thirst so you need to be thinking about the various products or services that you offer across your suite of things that you do within your business to analyze the benefits of each of those product services and answer the question what benefit or what problem does this solve for the customer because that 's the bit you need to be talking about don 't tell me about the new smartphone you know it 's got a fancy camera and it 's got 35 000 apps and it 's got you know a six inch screen versus a five inch screen i don 't care i want something that 's going to make phone calls for me and give me at my fingertips the ability to communicate next thing is to identify you know once you 've identified the products benefits and services is identify the hidden secrets now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that over and above the norm that have a value so a lot of the ladies will recognize this one you know you might go to get your hair done and they 'll give you an eyebrow color and wax or that sort of thing as well now you would probably pay 20 bucks for that but it 's included with your haircut now the business owner because they haven 't been they 've been they have been doing this for so long they don 't really identify that 's something that they are doing different to whatever else that has value because when you come to talking your story it 's important to point out the things that you do that have have added value so that not only you know it but your customers know it as well next thing to do is to identify and analyze the competitor office so really what you 're looking for is the opportunity gaps you know what what are they doing and talking about what are you doing and not necessarily talking about so that you can look for those opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competitive advantages you can communicate that out to your you know customers and you implement this competitive advantage strategy but please this is not just a set and forget moment what we now need to do is to set up a bit of a structure so you review and refine those communications however there is a word of caution don 't just review and refine for the sake of doing it if it 's really working for you leave it alone you may be sick of saying the same thing but your customers have only heard it once okay now just as a personal experience my wife and i we used to have a gift shop up in the yarra valley which specialized in products from around the yarra valley area so every nearly everything we had in the store came from within 50 60 k 's of where we were and that was a feature that we really spoke about so when new customers came into our store the first thing we would do is we 'd say welcome oh thank you and say look in case you haven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locally made arts and crafts stuff typically everything most of the things come from within 60 kilometers radius of the store so please feel free have a wander around if we can help you with anything please please ask more than happy to do so and then we 'd stand and go now the other thing would often happen is that we have somebody who come in and says oh no we know the story and say oh yes oh that 's great so i don 't have to tell you about the fact that we do um everything from within 50 cases from here and i don 't support all the local artisans so what have i just done by acknowledging that they know it and repeating it again i 've reinforced into their mind what our competitive difference is so find and craft ways in how you speak with your clients to keep on repeating and reinforcing this in their minds because that will keep them coming back okay the next thing is to understand a little concept called social comfort you will all recognize these brand names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ target best unless reject shop came out what 's the same about all of these brands is the fact that they predominantly sell clothing and household goods what 's different about them is many things it 's the shop layout it 's the color schemes that they use it 's the ambience that they create it 's the quality of products that they offer it 's the pricing that they check it 's the shopping experience that they give see every one of us that 's you and me every one of us has a sense of value that we hold about ourselves now typically the harrods shopper and i mean it would be nice to be able to go to london and go to shopping harrods as i 'm sure most of you would agree um but the harris shopper is sort of fairly elite it 's a very up-market store yeah lots of people go in and buy a bag of lollies just so they can get a hareds bag to bring home so they 've shopped there but you know the real shoppers at harrods you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'll often have a cup of coffee or a glass of champagne whilst they 're waiting for their parcels to be wrapped and carried down to the car now there 's a whole ambience and stuff that goes on there on the other end of the scale the best and less than reject shops you know you walk into those as bright and everything 's you know mass products on shelves of stuff everything 's got mass items in in plastic bags it 's pretty cheap and it 's it 's it 's rough and ready in the sense that it 's you know low cost and that 's the appeal of that particular store now what we know to be true is that the harrod shopper wouldn 't be seen dead in best and less or the reject shop and vice versa the best and less or the reject shopper wouldn 't go to harrods because it 's too toffee for them even if they were able to do so so what we need to do is say you probably ask yourself well why are you talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value system and you choose where you shop and you are attracted to a new business by what you see that is based around your value system now earlier i was talking about you know identifying your ideal customer but then part of that identification of the ideal customer is really really important to identify their value system because then you know how to position the quality the ambience the signage the branding and every aspect the customer service all of those elements as close as you possibly can to the average value system of your ideal customer group okay so you know we 've all been to restaurants at multiple levels you know the cheap running and run out cafe versus you know the you know the fine dining you know and there 's different levels of service and ambience that you know relates to each one of those so where did your customers sit if you had to you know look at them on the basis of not just a retail store but a restaurant or a hotel or some other type of business okay it 's really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set that then you can create all of your branding and marketing to speak to that value system at a level using the right sort of pictures on your website using the right sort of communications and you know the communication tools to help you connect better with your customers because as i said in the very beginning regional customers and regional businesses they know one another because they 're small communities bigger city businesses have lost a lot of that because of the volumes of people that go through but it 's really important to connect and create those uh people connections in your businesses as strongly as you possibly can because that 's what will keep you know create customer loyalty and keep customers coming back and then bringing their friends as well all part of what you need to rebuild your business after code now this thing is you know with before you advertise it 's really really important to start thinking about not only the fact that you know advertising has you know attracts about less than 30 of customers so it 's really important to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's also to go back to that research that you we would recommend that you should have done on your ideal customers to find out where they go for information because it 's not about just saying the right things it 's about being in the right places to say those things so you know in terms of saying the right things i 'm just going to give you a short example so the short example very simply is as you can see on the screen mary smith massage therapist for back pain relief called one two three four five pretty straightforward using exactly the same words for back pain relief call mary smith massage therapist one two three four five now what a huge difference see in the first one mary smith massachusetts we 're talking about mary smith you know i 'm somebody who 's suffering from back pain i 'm coming to your business because i have a problem that i 'm looking to solve i don 't identify with mary smith mary smith 's mate could be absolutely the most adorable person in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i don 't care about that at this point in time because i 've got back pain related so what 's going to grab my attention is somebody 's talking to me about the problem that i have which is back pain relief and oh by the way mary smith is somebody who can help me and this is the contact number of how to get in touch with mary smith so when you 're advertising it is really important to think very very carefully about not only what you say but how you say it and what the focus is on a simple example i did work with a client who had a radio campaign and he was in the natural health industry and he was providing services for people who suffer from chronic fight fatigue and fibromyalgia and he was doing 30 second radio ads and his radio ads went on about you know how wonderful the things that they were doing and everything else and it ended with so if you suffer from chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia book appointment on you know 1 300 whatever the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the advertising campaign and we started and just left most of the copy exactly the same but the one thing that we did differently was do you suffer from chronic fatigue or fibromyalgia at the beginning and then we went through the spiel and then we said you know for more information or you know for an appointment um contact us you know on 1300 whatever it was at the end their responses went up over 250 and the simple reason was that you know when somebody 's got a problem their radar is on whether that 's in a visual media or whether that 's in a sound based media like radio their radar is open for their problem so if at the front of the ad they heard chronic fatigue fibromyalgia they knew they had 30 seconds to go and find a pen and paper to write down the number of the website that was going to come at the end of the ad so that they could contact and find out about that without that being at the front the message had gone and when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't have time to get the information so you know this is why how you say what you say is much more important than necessarily than what you say the other part of it is is where you say it okay so i 'm going to pose a little question for you which i will answer is what 's your number one marketing tool i 'll let you think about that for a moment and just put something in your own heads of what you think your number one marketing tool is i 'd be interested to know at some point how many of you thought that this is a customer service at customer service we have found to be absolutely the number one marketing tool you know we 've done a lot of work in a variety of businesses including places like the queen victoria market and other businesses around melbourne and with all of the different works that have been going on over a period of time and you know what we 've seen as you walk into these businesses and i 'm sure you 've all experienced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ types of businesses there 's ones where the staff are engaging you know hi how you going how 's your day and the the other ones are sitting there in the back of behind a desk somewhere fiddling on their phones you know playing on facebook or doing whatever so it 's quite disinteresting and look up and say are you right that 's not customer service that 's customer neglect see customer service is where you actually get engaged with the customers where you can provide and answers the problems it 's also about saying well look actually we don 't actually have something that can help you with that you know but somebody down the road does this is not about the sale in the sense that yes it is about the sale overall but you will get the sale out of being honest with your customers providing good good service it 's also about providing a good follow-up after a sale it 's having those returns policies things that are clear making it clear providing instructions how to get best use out of the products or service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new skill that they have to learn it 's all of these elements that you know really really important now if customer service is not good in your business and if you 're one of the team then you have a responsibility to make it better but if you 're in the management side of the business then it 's not the team 's responsibility it 's your responsibility if the customer service sucks it 's the owners and the managers who have the responsibility to make it different so what i would strongly be suggesting is that you have a really good look at your customer service look at ways that you can improve it you can improve it make it better make it more customer focused see you and i when we go shopping today we 're looking to be looked after and treated as a little bit special that doesn 't mean say i expect the red carpet and you know you know champagne or coffee every time i walk into your shop that sort of thing that 's ridiculous but what i do expect is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know racing around sort of saying oh yeah i 'll be with you in a minute um i 'm coming and you know i 'm just going to take this phone call or everything else is more important than me guess what i 'm going to leave and most of your customers will do the same remember 60 percent of customers who are satisfied with what you 've offered in their business don 't come back you want to turn that around and by looking after your customers and you know looking after them well is really a key factor now in terms of training set up some standards if you want to know how to communicate that to your team easy all of you got a smartphone it 's got a video take a short video this is how we do it this is how we answer the phone this is how we greet a customer this is how we do an exchange this is how we do whatever we have to do in our business little videos put them up on a private youtube channel um and give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sign off that they 've done it see them practice it encourage them to practice it because that one thing strong good customer service is going to get those people coming back through your door and i can guarantee you out of the whole audience of today and out of we went across all the businesses in melbourne 20 would grab this and say yeah that 's a great idea i 'm going to do that and do something with it 20 will be saying i think this guy 's talking through his hat and the other 60 percent say oh yeah that sounds like a good idea and do nothing i would encourage you to be part of that 20 to do something with this because you know your competition shrinks you know when you 're when you 're part of that 20 are doing it well okay so the next big thing is you know going online why might you go online well the reality is you know i used to think that it wasn 't necessary to be online um i am now convinced that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your business now not every business necessarily needs a website but every business does need a web present presence so that can be through directories that can be through you know social media it can be through local chambers of commerce you know precinct groups in the melbourne metro era whatever it might be but you need to have access online because people do go online you know sorry i 'll just click back people do go online to actually research and find out about businesses and products and services before they go there i would strongly recommend that most businesses now should have a website because there 's a central point to have all of your information it 's like a shop window another shop window but an electronic one and if it 's done well and you incorporate things like blogs and you know other tools within a website then you know you can make it very strong now i 'm not going to go into a lot of detail about websites because we 've got our marketing uh needs customer needs marketing part two which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of weeks time so i 'd encourage you to you know enroll in that one as well so far say sorry i don 't know what i just did there let me just go back to here um suffice to say when you 're looking at um going online is really really important to plan from the outside in and what i mean by that is like i 've been saying to you about your business in general it 's really important to think of it from your customers point of view now i 've been to lots of websites government corporate bureaucratic small business websites and everything else you know the best ones are the ones that are actually naturally intuitive for me to follow as a customer to find the things that i 'm looking for you know a lot of the big bigger organization websites can be very hard to find information and you know sort of government websites often are ones that are the hardest because they 've got a a lot of the good information seems to be hidden and also because there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessarily the easiest to navigate to find what you want so my advice is to really look at your website as if you were a customer going to it from the first point and the same with any of the other electronic tools that you might be using as well look at it from a customer 's perspective do the pictures does the navigation do all of the various elements make it feel attractive to me now i 'm part of your ideal customer group does it invite me in or does it say well i 'm not quite sure whether this is the right place for me to be and when i am there is it easy for me to follow the threads of getting the information that i want so you 're going to probably need help with that that 's fine do the other workshop and then look at other help from from then on next thing is to remember that you know in terms of ranking of websites um and your online activity it 's all now really about quality content and it 's about using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive the search engines to your website which means it 's not a set and forget like you get a brochure printed and you can put it up on the shelf and you can forget about it well a website is something that you 're going to have to be working on or having somebody work on for you every day it 's a major marketing tool okay there 's a whole lot you know writing web copy there are special ways of writing it you know and there are formula to writing it so that will be covered again you know in more detail in the digital uh workshop that 's coming up um but i would strongly get advice because there are key ways of writing it to get the story right but also to get the structure of it right so as it works best for your search engines as well and the last part of it really is about thinking about all the places where you go to actually currently use to actually drive traffic to your business so whether that 's email social networking whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blog whether it 's your website whether it 's classifieds whether it 's links from other people 's websites to yours you know it 's about you know finding all of the strongest things that you can that are relevant to who your business is and what you are and that are complementary to what you do to actually add value through your website and through your market this marketing digital marketing platforms that you use you know to actually drive that traffic and give you kudos to get you further and further up the search engine rankings obviously there 's uh all the stuff about you know the various types of social media and there 's plenty of thoughts about it and that will be covered again as i say in a couple of weeks in a lot more detail but what i want to say about all of your marketing activity it 's not about which tool you use you might be conversant with instagram or pinterest or facebook or linkedin if you 're in a professional service or whatever it 's about okay it 's not about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's all about using the tools that your customers use understanding your ideal customer knowing where they go to get information looking and understanding the information that they 're looking to get the problems they 're looking to solve and going and playing in the space when they go for that information so i know this is some sort of basic stuff but really what i 'm as the key message that i can give you about you know what we 're talking today is that it 's no longer any good to be thinking about your marketing from about what you want to do or what you want result you want yes you 've got to know what that is but that 's not the focal point the focal point now is asking and understanding clearly about what your customers need what your customers problems are and then providing those customers with solutions to those particular problems throughout all of your marketing activity you,"(-37.8146168, 144.9664898)"
AUS,VIC,Melbourne City Council,MelbourneCityCouncil,https://www.youtube.com/user/MelbourneCityCouncil,Small business transformation grants – free webinar 2020 _ City of Melbourne,dzDYWSAGzac,20200828,3150.16,"120 Swanston St, Melbourne VIC 3000, Australia",8684,so we 'll get started firstly we understand completely that grant writing is a daunting activity it is a skill set the more you do it the better you get at doing it and especially for people in small business because you 're all busy juggling lots of different different things at once so we know it 's challenging confusing frustrating mind-boggling and often competitive not all grants are competitive this is a competitive grant round so it 's important that you make the best effort so take your time don 't rush your application so i 've got my little running whatever it is hamster read the guidelines and the facts provided carefully more than once is really good use a highlighter get all those key terms and phrases to make sure you don 't miss anything important think about what the funding body are trying to achieve they will have that in their objectives read it carefully don 't skip over it because this is what you 're needing to meet and if you can talk about those things your grant application will progress further ensure that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the time to do this so we know that you can feel like this at times let 's see it 's maybe something some of you will have done grants before being successful maybe some people haven 't been so successful maybe it 's the first time for some of you we know it can feel like this but we are here to help we really are there 's great mentors that are available to help you with your application so we talk about that a little bit further into the presentation so who am i and why should you listen to me i suppose so i 'm a business mentor at sbms and i 've also written quite a lot of grant and tender applications as well as developed grant develop the grant processes and assessed grants i have business qualifications i 'm a business owner i 've founded businesses as well so there 's a bit of experience there from the grant side of things which i guess is the most important thing for you guys today i 've actually been trained and endorsed by jared byrne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of the grandfather of grants really in australia he travels the world teaching people how to write better for grants so i 've been very lucky to actually have spent some time with him and of course i work with the most amazing group of mentors at sbms each with a great wealth of experience and it really honestly if you tap into that wealth of experience you will gain so many benefits from doing that so let 's get started because i 'm really aware that the clock is ticking not only on my clock for this presentation but also on your application because you 've just got over a week to get it in so today we 're going to take a really quick look like a speedy look at the guidelines and what the funding bodies are looking for then we 're going to look at the eligibility criteria and check that you meet them now this will be speedy because basically it 's a yes or a no and if you get a no at any point at this point in time then you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grant applications come unstuck is at the next point which is where you 're starting to actually address the assessment criteria so we 're going to spend some time in there tammy and i are going to be doing a bit of chewing and throwing there to make sure that you get both sides of the coin and also we 're going to chat about providing the correct documentation and supplementary documentation there will definitely be time for questions at the end i will talk really quickly i suggest not taking notes as far as i know this slide set is going to be available as a pdf for you to download on the city of melbourne website so be listening and watching you 'll be able to read through it if you want to do that so just a quick reminder that your applications close on thursday the 3rd of september at 11 59 it 's just over a week away so what do funders really want they want projects that match their objectives they want a demonstrated benefit not just to you but to the community as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that there will be an outcome so be realistic in your time frames and in your budget and they also want some recognition and acknowledgement they 'd like some thanks they 're funding you so let 's get to the elephant in the room what is the problem with most grant applications where do they fail in my experience the funding bodies do want you to succeed i know a lot of people feel that they don 't and there 's trick questions and smoker mirrors absolutely that is not my experience at all they tell you what they want they tell you who they 're targeting they give you as much information as they possibly can so where does it all go horribly wrong if the granting body are giving you everything that you require i spoke to a grants assessor and administrator who i may be related to who 's not present doesn 't work for the city of melbourne i promise you and her main advice was that applicants do not read the question and then they tell her as an assessor what they want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question the questions are there for a specific reason and that 's to make sure that your project is viable that it meets the requirements of the granting body the grant has been set up for a reason we need to meet that reason so for example she says when i ask about stripes don 't tell me about polka dots you might like polka dots maybe even i like polka dots but the question is about stripes so be making sure that you read the question very very carefully it may be a great answer that you 're giving but it might be for a different question and i 'm going to be labor this point and i 'm sorry but if i can get this through to you it 'll be the best thing for your grant applications so i actually pinched some slides from her slide deck and she does a tale of two applicants and you can clearly see on this slide you 've got the top applicant i love polka dots i 'm going to talk about polka dots the bottom applicant is you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so they think about something on the other side how the assessors see it who should i fund it 's competitive there 's limited funds available there 's usually these things are over subscribed so they 're looking for the best possible applications so the dots come in where are the stripes is the processor and the at the bottom assessor says that 's a clever use of stripes so you can easily see who gets the money it 's obviously going to be the clever use of stripes so more advice it 's right an excellent answer to the question that the application asks not an excellent answer to the question that you wish they had asked and again i know i 'm repeating this but honestly this is the critical piece of information that you need to be in the money so start by looking at the information that 's been provided to check that your business is eligible so i 've got there a copy and paste of the uh the grant guidelines for you be looking at them very closely making sure that you 're very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a highlighter these are available on the city of melbourne website and the smarti grants platform so we 're just going to talk a little bit about the smarty grunts platform you can download a preview form you can do this before you even register many of you will already be registered i realize that but you can download a preview form or you can preview it online if you like tammy just asked me to talk to you about logging in or read or registering really if you 're logging in you already know how to register you will need to create an account on smarty grants if you haven 't already done so you can access that through the business grants page on the city of melbourne website so go in and you can clearly see here where you register or log in if you already have an account so just really quickly want to talk to you about the smarty grants platform it 's a great platform it 's really user friendly if you have any technical issues please either download the pdf version here of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and later on in the slide set i 've got the actual contact details for smarty grants so it 's really there 's no value in ringing city of melbourne if you 've got problems accessing a page on smarty grants because the guys there can 't do anything for you you need to go to smarty grants and it 'll that 'll just save time for you so very quickly we 're going to go through the the program guidelines and then we 're going to look at the application form we 're not going to spend heaps of time here because i 'm really aware that we 're the clock is ticking away and i want to give you guys the opportunity to ask some questions so this is what you see when you download the the program guidelines and we 've clearly got the objectives there read these carefully go through it highlight the things that you think are important there and i have a list coming up also from that application form from the smarty grants platform you can see here there 's also some information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the application form than what is at the beginning of the guidelines so it 's good to have them side by side it 's probably a good idea to print them off or if you like to split your screen and have a look at them both the information that i have drawn from those two documents are from the guidelines the program objectives and purpose are that they 're for small business it 's to adapt and activate through new innovative initiatives bricks and mortar businesses it 's very clear about that impacted by decreased foot traffic through the covered pandemic it 's this very specific postcodes that this grant is targeting it 's about adapting and continuing to trade through covert 19 generate new revenue streams or build ongoing financial viability it 's about sustainability in that sense and attract new and returning customers to the city so that was what we got from the program guidelines from the application form we could we can see that there are target industries that are significantly impacted by covert 19 restrictions and that it 's up to 5 000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to be thinking does our business meet these objectives because if anything is no here then that is really this is not the right grant for you so also look for definitions terms and really there was only one that i could find and that was the definition of a bricks and mortar business in this particular grant round but often there are other definitions of terms just be making sure that you understand what is meant by that because that could impact your application so from the program guidelines yeah i 'm sorry there is more but there 's the eligibility so who is eligible so if not we now know what the objectives of the grant are now we 're looking at whether we are actually eligible so there 's quite a bit more information here i just want to highlight down the bottom there you will see the australian ethical charter and i 've got my little flash up thing that says attention read me and this is because it will be of value to you in actually writing your responses to the assessment criteria so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to open it up so that you can have a look at it because it will actually help you and i think tammy 's going to talk to you a little bit later about some of that too so the important information about eligibility that i gleaned from the guidelines was that you must have an abn you are eligible for one grant only you have um documented evidence of your business structure obviously you need your insurances in place your public liability and professional indemnity that you have employees at the time of application so it 's for businesses that are employing and that they 're deeming it is up to 50 full-time employees so participating in the job keeper scheme is another point that you must meet physically located in the cbd area and we talked about those specified areas if you are at a co-working space you need to be able to demonstrate that you are there for at least 50 of the year so we need to be ticking all of those things again guys if there 's something that 's a no this is probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming up again so unfortunately as seen are some businesses that are not eligible i 'm not going to run right through this it 's a copy and paste from the guidelines but you can see clearly at the very top there 's non-employing businesses so if you 're not employing anybody you 're not accessing the job keeper scheme then obviously this is not the right grant for you also we can see that hospitality businesses are not being targeted in this surround there are other programs available there are other things there it 's well worth reading through it to make sure that there 's nothing there that would exclude you from applying for this grant what is funded and what is not so we 've discussed already pretty much what is funded and how much funding is available just want to spend a couple of moments talking about what 's not funded to make sure that you 're clear on that so it 's not for operating costs it 's not for salaries so rents for your phone bill electricity bills a stock that you wish to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this grant so just be aware of what 's not funded because sometimes we can slip up put in things that are not eligible for funding and then our our application wouldn 't succeed so we 've jumped through some hurdles now we know that we meet the program objectives and we know that we 're eligible for funding so this is where we get to talk about the place that it tends to go horribly wrong because up until this point is pretty much yes and no and if you get a no you won 't be able to progress further in the form to the questions so let 's have a very frank conversation about where this goes wrong firstly i just love this slide that 's coming up and it is how do you feel when you think you 've done a great job you 've worked really hard you 've gathered all your information and you don 't get funded pretty much like mr fox here doing a head dive into the snow so are the assessment criteria important it 's a resounding yes they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability to deliver to the objectives it shows how you are competitive and always be remembering that it 's a merit-based assessment so even if you meet all of the eligibility criteria it 's still competitive at the end of the day so you need to be putting time into these questions the success of your eligible application lives and dies on the answer to your assessment criteria i can 't be any clearer than that it is so important that you get this part right so from the guideline here 's the assessment criteria there are three main areas alignment with the program 's purpose and objectives the proposal readiness and financial viability and then the other considerations so i 'm guessing oh and also one of the key things is time frames can you complete your project within the time frame because that 's really important and something they 'll be looking at when they 're doing the assessments so the word that i see over and over and over again in the assessment criteria is demonstrate demonstrate demonstrate we need to be showing how we are actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep this firmly in mind as you write your responses it 's really important that you don 't sort of wander off down another tangent keep them very specific and another thing is by keeping that in mind it makes sure that you 're always talking in a very positive and compelling way about your project you are selling this idea to your assessors the other thing we need to talk about is relevance so i 'm making sure that everything 's relevant and this talks back to my assessor friend who says can people please tell me can they please give me an answer to the question i ask that 's what i need to know so there 's sort of that sweet spot what with what you want to say and what it is that they actually want to hear from you so be keeping that in mind and i will be repeating that again and i 'm sorry if i drive you crazy with it but it 's really important so we 're now leaving the program guidelines we 've been looking at some of cut and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work on the actual application form remember that long-suffering grant administrator friend applicants do not read the question they tell me what they want to tell me and they don 't tell me what i need to know don 't talk about polka dots when the question is about stripes read the assessment question really carefully the very first question is the summary of your business and i 'm really confident that you guys are going to be able to write a really good summary for your business i i don 't think i probably need to talk to you too much about that down in the left hand bottom corner there 's a cut and paste from the actual application if you 're wondering what that is down there you can see it 's 200 words to talk about the business i 've got a suggested response in here i 'll just quickly read through it but if you download this as a pdf you 'll be able to read it we don 't want copy and paste and take out what i 've written in there and put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspire you to to write about your business and to answer the other questions so just give a bit of detail where you 're located how long you 've been in the cbd area what it is you sell i 'm selling widgets and whatsapps here i 've been there for 5 10 or 20 years i 've been impacted by covert i 've employed people can you see that i 'm meeting all of those objectives now and i have indicated the approximate drop in foot traffic that i have found through covert why it works it allows the assessor to gain an understanding of your business so you need to be setting the scene telling the story and it speaks about the impact of covert 19 because we know that this that 's what this grant is actually targeting so let your assessor get to know your business and your commitment to the cbd the second question is tell us about your project and tammy 's going to come in here as well because it this is your opportunity to sell your project idea to the assessor but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so i 've asked tammy if she would come on now and just explain to you a little bit about adaptation and activation are you there very much yes thanks very much sally um just very very briefly so the programs itself the small business transformation program has two very key focus areas so one is adaptation and one is activation so your proposal can um can address one or both of these focus areas so it doesn 't penalize you in any way but the maximum amount of money that you can ask for is still five thousand so only tick one of the boxes when you ask which is your primary focus with adaptation i guess a clear a very easy way to think about is actually about implementing any longer term shift realignment of fundamental change in your business operation and one of the key things that these chains should do is will deliver financial viability for the business in a cause a post-covet environment the question i 'll be asking when you 're looking at adaptation is does it generate new streams of revenue does it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the business continue to operate and to grow so these are the questions you should be asking yourself when you 're framing adaptation kind of initiatives or proposals to us wave activation is very simple does it bring customers back to the city does it bring people back into the city how does it bring people back into the city is it bring people back in the city in a safe manner as well so with activation initiative it could be an experience that you 're trying to create um it could be um a campaign that you 're doing but it is very targeted and it will incentivize if you like your customers to come back to your um to your store or to your office so you must show very clear how it is going to bring customers back not just abroad sort of i 'll do some marketing and that will bring customers but we want to see exactly very specific um targeted campaign in initiatives that will incentivize your customers to come back to your store so as i said before when you 're doing your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these little points in there to tell us how that is an activation or adaptation or it could be that it addresses both focus areas thanks that 's great thank you tammy and one thing yesterday tammy highlighted with me is please guys tick one box only so you have that third box if you 're doing both adaptation and activation that 's great but only tick the both box so just be selecting one only so back to my friend the assessor friend and i 've poached another of her slides and this is a not a good example of the question tell us about your project it 's all about the business if you read through this it says all about what the business is we wash and dry and style dogs paws and perms is the business and right at the bottom the last sentence is the new website will help what the assessors want to know is what is the project and how it 's going to help so don 't be deciding what the assessors want to hear from you read the question and answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is saying they need the website for their dog grooming business because it will help them actually generate new income streams and attract new customers and manage their existing customers so i have a suggested response here just going to race through it i 've highlighted in a goldy sort of color i hope it 's that 's how it 's coming across for you the where i 'm actually using the words the key terms and phrases that are already in the guidelines and in the application so that doesn 't mean slavishly repeating questions back to the assessors yes i am going to do an adaptation project you have to be telling them what it is that you 're doing but don 't be afraid to actually use these key terms it 'll make their hearts sing it really will they 'll think that you understand exactly what they 're looking for so i 'm bringing thingamybobs to the cbd as you can see i 've got my thingamybobs in blue i talk about the new and exciting and innovative and they 'll attract not only our previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's again something that was wanted in the objectives and that there 'll be a benefit to the broader cbd community with me doing this why it works it shows up front that you meet the eligibility criteria and it shows that you understand the project of the program objectives so letting the assessor know why it 's important to bring thingame bombs to the cbd so then the third question is adaptation now if you 've selected adaptation then the other activation question won 't come up if you selected both you will get both of these so just depends on what you actually select to answer at that point about tell us about your project so this is as tammy really clearly said it 's about how your project 's new and innovative remember that this can be either something completely new or a new way or a new additional way to your usual business so i 've written a response again i 'll run through it really really quickly because like again i know that the clock is ticking so i talk about why my current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various other outlets the umi bobs take my business in an exciting new direction so i know that 's really basic guys but you 're trying to say how it is that it 's going to change your business make it more financially viable sustainable into the future and also what you will be doing with the business transformation grants and one of the things that jared burn always suggests in his workshops in his books is speak about how the funding body and how this grant will help you so don 't be afraid to mention their names in there too don 't have lots of words but do be making sure that you give them a bit of a mention remember that they like a bit of recognition and thanks so why this works it picks up the keywords demonstrates the adaptation of the project and identifies the new revenue streams keeping very much in mind what they 're thinking about activation is the next question it 's about action how are you going to take action and how here you can describe your intended customer talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given you a very quick response to it why it works the response like this shows the assessors how you 're going to actually function your new product or service to the market and give some confidence that you 're going to take action the other benefits and opportunities so here they 're looking for who else benefits from your project or what are the broader greater benefits of the project that you 're planning to do and don 't forget that other local businesses in the cbd they 're going to benefit from you attracting new customers in it 's a bit of a destination thing isn 't it to go to the cbd so i think that that 's something that you could validly talk about so again i 've given you a response i won 't read the whole thing through but it talks about those sorts of things that i just mentioned to you there it shows the broader benefit of of funding your project the more people who you can identify that benefit the better so be thinking quite broadly think of it like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and your business how does it benefit you then broader broader broader until you can get to that broad-based community and you will find that that works really well for you in your applications it also works in tenders so if you 're ever writing any tenders so now we 're at the budget and funding request page or sorry question so please ensure this is from tammy by the way guys so this is from the other side saying please put the total cost of your project in quite often apparently people will respond by just putting in five thousand but maybe your total project cost is really twenty thousand they 're putting that in here because it 's good for the grant body to understand what the total cost of the project is and what their part in it is and break down the budget items as well so there might be several different things that you 're actually asking for funding for don 't lump them all together break them down now in no way does this mean that there will be a preference given to either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your project it 's about giving that detail there 's also a request for other funding sources and this is an area that applicants overlook sometimes so here i 've got don 't forget to include things like wages as part of the cost of the project so if you are allocating time maybe one of your employees time to actually do things this be putting that in do a calculation the number of hours multiplied by their wages obviously uh and there 's other examples there like over draft lines of credit right can everybody hear me okay ross because i 've just had something come up so my internet is unstable everyone can hear you okay you just drop it you 're okay keep going okay thank you um what the funding body want to know here is that you are able to fund the total cost of the project so they don 't want to be funding something that is not going to get up because all of the other things around it are not in place so that 's why they 're asking this question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your project planning it 's really important so question five is ethical and sustainable business considerations and this is where we come back to these it 's actually optional whether you write something here but i always suggest strongly suggest to my clients that if they 're given an opportunity to say something please do that could be the difference between your application and somebody else 's application it gives just a greater depth of knowledge more confidence to the assessors and that 's really what we 're doing here as we 're going through these questions we 're building a story that creates confidence in the assessors and the granting body that this is a good project that it meets their objectives that it will actually be finished and there will be an outcome something will happen so i 've asked tammy to come back in here again and just talk a little bit about some of the things that you might actually put in here because i know it would be tempting to skip it because it is one of those things you just have to tick a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much so are you there tammy yes um so it 's very important that you read the australian ethical charter before you pick yes or no so we want to make sure that your organization your proposal are aligned with the objectives of the charter the second question which is about current and proposed sustainable business practices there is really no right or wrong answer here and you don 't have to put in 20 points or so on to to make sure that you cover everything it 's really about council trying to sort of think about encouraging businesses to think about what are some of the sustainable practices maybe you can embed into your business operations the council has a very strong commitment again about sustainability and we want to encourage and we want you all as businesses think about how that could be possible within your business operation so therefore things simple things like you know it could be recycling that you 're thinking about encouraging your employees you know to write to work or it could be if you have a product or something making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe sourced locally um they reduce waste they 're not going to create a lot of waste so those are the things that depending on the nature of your business you should try and describe them and tell us that the opportunities you would have to invade this sort of business um uh sustainable business practices into your operations thanks ellie thank you tommy that was great and hopefully that was really helpful for you guys you can always access the recording and listen to it again for those tips and clues so the last question asked is about risk management and it 's very important because funding bodies tend to be very risk averse so you can see here from my graphic that obviously the clock is ticking it 's the final question maybe you feel like you 've said everything you have to say please please be putting some thought into the risk management side of things as well it really is important so be thinking about the types of risk that may be involved and how that might impact the projects your business how it might actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due consideration then we get to the supporting documentation and it is critical to put reporting documentation in you 're selling your project short without them it is part of the assessment process so be gathering that documentation things like your project plans you can have graphics photographs mock-ups you have all sorts of things that you can put in there and upload timelines are great because that shows that it is realistic that it that you 've thought about how long it might take for something to be implemented letters of support they take time together i know i 've had to chase them down right down to the wire people say yes and then it takes them a little while to get round to actually writing the letter of support for you but you 're very aware that time 's ticking by and you need to get that in and they work really well too because they show there 's some substance there and that people are behind your project if you 've done some market research and analysis then be putting that in there it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viability of your project a marketing plan that 's always good that 's your activation so be thinking about those things they are important don 't skip through it so now you 're ready to submit your application and our little otter is doing a prayer to the grant granting gods that we get through and we do actually get funded there 's really good guidance here on the application sorry this is not the application form on the guidelines so be reading through this very clear that they close on thursday the 3rd of september at 11 59 pm don 't be missing any of those critical bits of information there 's a little bit about the process the application process there tammy asked me to put in the application process sheet so that 's also available so that you can see the steps the where you make your application then it goes to assessment then there 's an outcome you 'll be notified of the outcome then you 'll be sent a funding agreement if you 're successful and there will be payment made and then there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have some reporting it 's usually not onerous mostly they just want to hear how the project went if there were any extra benefits maybe that came out of it any surprises any ways that it can be done better in the future that 's what that 's about so just be aware that be keeping documentation so that you can do your reporting really easily if you 're feeling like this still or this or this or even this please don 't we are genuinely here to help there are sbms mentors standing by ready to assist with your grant application they will be of great benefit to you here are the contact details they 'll be available i think on the website is that right tammy they 'll be available on the website yes yes great so to access mentoring please call the business concierge hotline 965-89658 they 're open between 7 30 in the morning and six at night monday to friday you can also email business funding at melbourne.vic.gov dot a u so that 's for the spms mentoring sessions to get assistance with this grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two to talk to you about making the most out of your sbms mentoring sessions it 's not your mentor 's job to write your application for you is simply not the time to do that so do a bit of prep beforehand gather your relevant documentation start to write the responses the criteria even if it stop points at least make a start on it don 't leave your mentoring session to the last minute because the mentor will be able to review and help you refine your responses and maybe even make some great suggestions as to other things that you could put in there or maybe different ways of expressing things but you will need to go away and probably massage that a little bit as well so leave time please don 't leave it till the last minute it just makes stress for everybody so a quick checklist for successful grant applications obviously meeting that eligibility putting the prep into your application researching your project costs considering other funding sources including relevant information and the additional documentation supporting documentation and don 't forget to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vital takeaways for you today read the guidelines questions very carefully more than once with a highlighter demonstrate show what you 're thinking to the assessor so they can understand your project really clearly have confidence in it and make sure of course that it 's relevant you 're giving them the assessor relevant information and tammy asked me to add one more tammy 's hot tip is submit on time your application cannot be assessed if you submit well sorry um can i just uh just highlight that point that um you can write the best applications in the world if you don 't summit on time it cannot be assessed and you don 't have an opportunity to receive a grant so submit it on time and make sure you don 't leave it too late the three key reasons and most common reasons for not able to submit an application are the following one that the mandatory fields within the application form are not completed or they 're not completed correctly so those fields are the ones with the little red asterisk the second one most common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the fields that we have for to put your response in there is a word limit there and you can see the word count as you go because they just track that so if you exceed the word count it will not allow you to submit so you will have to come back and reduce your word count the third one that 's most common is also the internet connection interruption if you have a interruption when you are submitting it will not go through so you will have to resubmit so based on all these points you really need to allow ample time to do your submissions so don 't wait until 11 55 i know you all like to work under pressure but give yourself a little bit more time maybe start at 11 o 'clock at least so that you have the time to amend any errors or anything that you need to correct before you do the final submission but that 's my tip thanks sally that 's great terry thank you and i 'm sorry guys about my alarm going off and telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that so jared burn the grandfather grant writing in australia he has 10 point plan for getting to yes plan ahead read the guidelines he 's a highlighter fine the contact person if you have any queries be realistic realistic in your expectations in your timelines what can actually achieve do that background homework gather all your evidence collaborate where you can look at how you can measure your outcomes because remember you don 't have to be reporting at the end of the period tailor your grant application to the criteria and always have your work proof read because it can be a little annoying if things don 't read smoothly so it 's really good to have another set of advice go over the information so if you 've got any more questions you can ring the business conciliation hotline this is also where you get your svms mentoring session voucher from for information about the application formal process you can email business funding at melbourne.vic.gov.eu remember earlier we talked about the smarty grants platform if you have any issues with them you can call them on nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at smartygrants.com.adu technical issues not like not being able to open a page or not being able to access the platform please go to smarty grants in the first instance so just a reminder this is the slide that i showed you earlier on about smarty grants and how there is a very useful help guide for applicants it 's a very user-friendly platform so we are really hoping that we have helped shed some light on successful grant writing today i 've thoroughly enjoyed presenting it to you creating this slide deck for you i hope that you have really enjoyed it as well we 're definitely here to help we 're hoping that you feel much more grunt savvy writing savvy now like my little fellow looks like he 's doing some sort of dance there so we 're at question time and back over to ross i think it 's going to take over question time very much sally and thank you tammy for your contribution um it 's those that want to post a question you can post it in the chat line to me now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here already and i 'd like to pose them to uh tammy tammy we have a question that we 've a question states that we 've started online marketing campaign to obtain new clients pay advertising for installment um is um is the advertising fee eligible for funding uh yes the advertising fee can be considered for funding as long as it 's directly related to the proposal and it 's very clear rationale and justification to support it just in terms of time in terms of when that advertising fee was paid make sure that any expenditure already incurred prior to the submission of the application will not be considered so please be mindful of that thanks okay so another question for you i know you 've got a bit of an overview of adoption but can you give us a further example of the adoption question well this is in professional services can you give us an example of an interaction okay some good examples i 've seen recently are professional services business adaptation include light moving their services delivery online so whether it 's you know a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of them also work remotely to support their customers others might have introduced some new services or products um to complement what they currently offer the one thing to think about is that make sure that the adaptation is not a business as usual activity so these activities such as operating costs ongoing maintenance will not be considered as adaptation and if these are the type of costs or activity you 're doing you should think about going to the state government business support fund for support for this type of activities that relates to the operation of the business okay thanks tammy number one here how do we address the tangible benefits for other businesses in the city of melbourne and to measure the potential benefit very good question it really all boils down right depends on the nature of the proposal some examples might be that you 're prepared procuring products or services from local suppliers within the city of melbourne for the delivery of the proposal um all others might be that you 're engaging quite actively with the other city businesses as delivery partners of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits that you can provide to the other businesses in the city of melbourne thank you thank you um i was here too queen victoria market traders eligible sorry ross i can 't hear the question tammy are queen victoria market traders eligible for the program yes they are eligible as long as they can address the eligibility criteria such as you know job keepers the participants employing staff has a legal business structure i think it 's best to refer to our guidelines for more details of the eligibility criteria and if you have any doubts or any of the traders have any doubts or anything please send us an email give us a call i 'll be happy to discuss more with them all right we have a bit of a sound problem going on as well so just bear with us um okay thank you for that uh are tour transport and tourism businesses eligible yes they are eligible as long again they can address the eligibility criteria again one of the key things for some of these type of physicists is that they must be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the four postcodes for this program which is three thousand three thousand five three 2006 and 3008. if the business is in this type of industry is only just delivering their service in the city but actually don 't have a business location in the city then they will be ineligible thank you tammy good we have a couple of other questions going through um is i 've applied previously without success i don 't want to waste my time well i think um as steli has put out different programs have different guidelines and different criteria so the main fact that you are unsuccessful in one doesn 't mean that you are unsuccessful in other so what i would do is encourage you to read the guidelines read the eligibility criteria and again if you are in doubt or need some help reach out to one of the small business mentoring service mentor or if you need some clarification with the guidelines send us an email or give us a call i 'll be here to help yeah i agree that uh amy i 've put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in doubt call the concierge area but in the back of that book you 've got the value to talk to a mentor as well a comment is is it um this is a very short time

my cousin 's sitting over here come up for a photo oh you 're our dear lovers great grandson great great great grand nephew so it 's amazing you know the connections that we have all over the country and I was really heartened to see the people that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the council and the the way that the reconciliation action plan is creating opportunities and I was talking about when I first came into journalism and you know there was no one else you know I sort of stumbled you know into this utterly alien environment and incredibly sexist racist places and the newsrooms were hard going they still are hard going but not like this and I was saying to them whatever you did anything right in the newsroom they would always say oh good on you you 're a white man that was that that was the form of compliment you 're a white man so I did he called it white man quite a few times when I was started out in journalism look I really want to talk to you today about this theme of reconciliation week this idea that don 't make history a mystery and I 've been grappling with this concept of history and what it tells us and how it is used who gets to write history who gets to tell us what the story of us is and it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much further in fact than just looking at Australia and Australians Experion but I 've tried to locate this in a much more global framework because the question of history and the questions of identity that arise out of history are in many ways the single biggest challenge that our world faces today I 've gone back to a French historian and philosopher and what he could tell us about reconciliation between black and white in Australia who more than a century ago when Australia we still presumed that Aboriginal people were a dying race ernest renan was wrestling with this question it 's a fundamental question what is a nation what is a nation it remains one of the most profound and powerful statements of identity I think ever written he wrote it in 1882 in the shadows of the French Revolution just a few years earlier Renan said that he sought to look beyond what he called the grave errors of race or language or religion he came to his essay he wrote in an absolutely cold and impartial fashion a nation he wrote was defined not by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts the fusion of the populations that comprise them race he said could be no foundation for nationhood to run on and remember this is 1882 Turin and there are no pure races race he said has always been of diminishing importance no one he wrote has the right to go about the world examining men 's heads and then grabbing them by the throat and saying you are of our blood you belong to us the nation he wrote was a daily referendum a perpetual affirmation of life the search for a collective identity Renan wrote that a nation is a soul a spiritual principle it was born of a marriage of the past and the present one the past the possession of a rich trove of memories the other the present the actual consent the desire to live together the will to continue to value the undivided shared heritage critical to renowned was the question of history history could bind a nation or tear it apart the study of history he wrote often poses a threat to nationality Rijn and then laid a challenge to us that resonates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ error is an essential factor in the creation of a nation to hear those words today it 's almost the antithesis of what we think today when we look at history as a roadmap to our present but we do it all the time we forget we choose those aspects of our history that we believe tell us most about ourselves why do we celebrate Anzac Day over many other battles why do we erect monuments to certain figures why do we not tell other stories about ourselves because it doesn 't fit a narrative forgetting is crucial to nationhood it is as I say a challenge to our age do we endlessly prosecute grievance or do we set aside the past define true unity today history can often be used as a weapon we define ourselves and divide ourselves along historical lines history is to identity what carbon is to steal the journalist and philosopher David riff was inspired by renowned for his 2017 book in praise of forgetting I would urge anyone to read it it 's been one of most confronting but profound books I 've read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it and he turned it on its head instead he wrote thinking about history is far more likely to paralyze than encourage tarrif we risk turning it into a formula for unending grievance and vendetta an ending grievance and Vendetta so I 've spent 30 years as a journalist almost two decades of that outside of Australia we often call Journal is in the front row seat of history and I 've seen the world turn I 've seen the return of division and borders and hatred along ideological political and religious and racial lines and I know that the great conflicts of our world have at their core this unending grievance this failure to reconcile that so often rooted not just in our history but how we perceive our history think of the conflicts that have scarred our world and how they are born out of these wounds of the past Catholic versus Protestant Hutu against Tutsi in Rwanda Shia and Sunni Hindu pitted against Muslim Israeli versus Palestinian cestlavie moulage the Polish Nobel prize-winning poet once said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Indian philosopher and economist Amartya Sen calls these identities solar tourists identities they are exclusive they divided the world into us in them identity he says at its worst can kill there is a difference of course between identity that nourishes us and the need for identity which is crew I walk through the world as a indigenous Australian as of a Rhodri person of gamma Roy person a person of Irish heritage and Australian all of those things make up who I am most things provide the contours of my life identity that 's best can be an extraordinarily uplifting and inspiring thing but at its worst as we 've seen it can kill and we have witnessed now the rise of what 's become known as identity politics a political tribalism that has infected both the left and the right of politics it is instinctive it 's hardwired a tribalism that leads us to cling to our own and reject those deemed as outsiders it is a 21st century law of the jungle look around our world right now this was meant to be the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the Berlin Wall coming down in an end to the Cold War said that Western democratic liberalism had triumphed that this was the end of the great ideological battles indeed he called at the end of history what we have seen instead is the return of history we are putting up new walls we are militarizing our borders we are shutting down debate the politics of identity is winning at the ballot box the strong man is back Derwin in Turkey uber in Hungary the tert a in the Philippines Sisi in Egypt Putin in Russia see Jinping in China and of course in his own way Donald Trump each riding a wave of resurgent populism populism that divides us into the real people and the non people populism that requires enemy each in their own way is stoking fear and suspicion promising to return people to a more certain golden age somewhere in a past that never really existed the American writer Mark Villa has condemned this growth of identity politics as he says a cancer on democracy to him we are sacrificing the idea of what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the product of what he calls the shipwrecked mind the shipwrecked mind it is the mind of the reactionary it is the mind of the person turning away from change who sees as he wrote the debris of paradise drifting past their eyes the shipwrecked mind is nostalgic for the glorious past lost as Lilla writes hopes can be disappointed nostalgia is irrefutable things were better back then this is the world sketched by the American Lawyer an academic a.m. each one in her new book political tribes professor twice how identity politics is remaking our world and has already triggered a revolution in American politics tribal instincts she said is not just an instinct to belong it is also an instinct to exclude the u.s. she says is in a perilous new situation with nearly no one standing up for an America without identity politics for an America that transcends and unites the identities of all of the countries subgroups it is a threat to America 's place in the world already people are talking about the post American world which has enormous implications for all of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it 's very pulse this is history as betrayal a narrative of loss of innocence robbed in America Donald Trump says he wants to make America great again as if there is a lost America in Russia Vladimir Putin laments the end of the Soviet empire in his words the greatest catastrophe of the 20th century China 's see Jinping speaks of the hundred years of humiliation at the hands of foreign powers to fire a sense of Chinese nationalism Turkey 's president erdogan speaks of the lost Ottoman Empire nostalgia has a powerful hold it is the most potent political force in our world today mark Lilla has called this the apocalyptic imagination as he writes the present not the past is a foreign country all that was left was the memory of defeat destruction and exile and this in so many ways is my history as an indigenous person the story of invasion dispossession racism segregation these are the stories passed down through generations of my family I sat at the feet of my parents and heard the stories of us rounded up and sent to missions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen in some dim dark past my mother could tell me the story of her father chained to a tree like a dog and left in the Sun all day by the police but the police arriving at another time and putting a gun to his head or they bulldozed the teen humpy that they called home running over the graves of three of his children who were buried there but my father told me about beatings that he 'd taken in police cells I was raised on these stories painful and vivid and they have marked me and I felt at times marked me indelibly history is where we locate ourselves it is the foundation of identity and it can be a seductive narrative the story of our loss speaks a great truth but it also presents a dilemma at what point do these stories this history cease nourishing us and begin to poison us it 's been my struggle it is the struggle of all of us to move beyond it not to ignore it or to airbrush the worst aspects but to lift the weight of history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a history of misery worse to revel in it and what is history what is truth when we seek to examine the past what can we really tell about ourselves historical truth can be elusive especially when it is filtered through memory the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche warned us to tread warily he said where remembrance is concerned there are no facts only interpretations memory as we know is unreliable and selective and as we 've seen it can be a powerful and of times destructive political weapon in the words of the French historian Jacques Rogge off memory seeks to rescue the past in order to serve the present and the future is this the role of history do we seek to retrieve history to rehabilitate ourselves our historians moral guardians is it their tasks to redeem us can the actions of the past be seen through the values of today an Australian historian Greg mallesh recently wrote that history is a means and imperfect means to understand the past but it is not the past itself and think about that what does he what he is saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past from fragments the shattered pieces of lives long gone it is a delicate and forensic tasks like sifting through the ashes of a house fire to his to assemble a story of those who once lived there it will always be incomplete the French Astoria michel de certeau once spoke of history as is hit as a story of absence a story of loss history was like tracing the footprints on the shore of people long gone he says that we arranged our past like artifacts carefully assembled in a shop front window how do we tell the story of us what monuments do we erect what events do we commemorate which historical figures do we celebrate how do we assemble our artifacts these are confronting questions for Australian history the unresolved legacy of the past as we are being reminded this week lies at the very heart of reconciliation there are calls now for a process of truth and justice to finally end what the Great Australian anthropologist bill Stannah once called the Great Australian silence but in many ways we have already pierced that silence new histories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the margins and we are confronting critical questions how do we commemorate a figure like Captain Cook how do we remember the frontier Wars was this continent settled or invaded critical questions with no easy answers in fact we may find that all of those things sit alongside each other that all of those things can be equally true most critically how do we have this vital national discussion without tearing each other apart how to make this story all of it our story how do we build a nation out of the pieces of the past ernest renan speaks powerfully to us forgetting is crucial to nation-building yet forgetting can too easily slip into denial this year as I said the theme of reconciliation week is don 't make history a mystery history can tell us who we are but as we are seeing throughout our world historical grievance can so easily become a battlefield I 've written of all of this in a recent essay for the Griffith review and in my search for answers I went in search of a man from another time what would my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this age of hyper identity I doubt he ever uttered the word identity I doubt he ever considered what it meant to identify with anything sessile William Henry Grant was an Aboriginal man he would have said a were a dream and he lived among wretched people he married a Jew a woman and raised his children to know what it was to be of a rancher a person he was also an Australian and proudly so defiantly Australian at a time when Australia was telling him that he wasn 't when war came he signed up a rat of Tobruk my grandfather fought not to prove his worth but because he already believed himself worthy he came back and he told his children of the world that he 'd seen he told them that this world was their world and that no one could shrink their horizons but themselves he was a Christian his faith founded in a belief in justice and equality as so many of the original Aboriginal political pioneers were who emerged out of those missions with a strong belief in their faith and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have heard that same message in the words of a black preacher from the segregated south of America who dreamed of a day when we will be judged not by our color but by our character when I think of Martin Luther King jr. I think of everything my grandfather was yes he was Aboriginal that was who he was to the core of his being it was his heritage it was his family to be Aboriginal was his natural as breathing but it wasn 't all he was like the great majority of our people he was what today we clumsily call mixed race he had an Irish grandfather he found a world beyond his own in books and a love of knowledge he wrote short stories and poems I 'm told he kept by his bed the works of Shakespeare and the writings of our own bards Lawson my father still has my grandfather 's old Bible with his handwritten notes inside nearly half a century since the old man passed away my grandfather lived the words of the ancient Roman playwright Terence a man himself bought and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is human is alien to me my grandfather was a man of courage and sacrifice a man born on the margins of Australia who endured harsh poverty bigotry and state enforced discrimination but never wavered in his dignity or his hope for this country a man locked out who looked for a way in in 1966 toward the end of his life my grandfather nominated as a candidate to be elected as the aboriginal representative of the Aborigines Welfare Board this was the organisation that had so much control over our lives and I found his campaign pitch in an old edition of the welfare board magazine dawn it was distributed to Aboriginal communities across New South Wales it is an extraordinary document to read a document that speaks of an unflinching belief in basic human dignity when I read those words now I can hear him speak them he said anyone claiming that Aborigines are not humanly equal to other people seems to lack the knowledge of the common ingredients of which all human beings are made all mankind is blessed or played with egoism irrespective of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements of physical natural and divine influences all these things he wrote are evident in men thus far he said we are human lead equal and should be regarded by all as today those words can seem almost quaint there so at odds with the spirit of our times these are angry times while he campaigned for equality and justice today throughout our world were just as likely to hear more about resentment and vengeance he fought for inclusion and today we so often hear about exclusion us and then we are more likely to define ourselves by what we are not who we are against rather than what we share in common this reconciliation week as we look again to our history we need to ponder its place in making a nation nation-building is at the heart of reconciliation it 's what we have seen on stage today it 's why all of you are here in all the divided diversity to make this a nation and we should look again to the words of ernest renan from a time of revolution in france and how they speak to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race his language his religion the course of his rivers nor the direction of his mountain ranges a great aggregation of people insane mind and warm heart have created a moral conscience that calls itself a nation thank you so much,"(-37.8146168, 144.9664898)"

Louis peeler am a proud and passionate Yatta Yatta and were under a woman whose family hails from CAMRA ganja mission Archie Louis has dedicated much of her time over the many years and much of her energy for the betterment of all Aboriginal people and indeed her own local community right here in Victoria spending many decades of course working tirelessly across the arts working passionately as an educator also working across many sectors including tourism the public sector education and Aboriginal community developments that have a covered everything there but there 's more isn 't there auntie I welcomed this evening to the history salon our fourth one indeed I will start at the very beginning as we do with all of our lovely elders you 're from Tamra Danza mission from the Briggs family yes my family were on como ganja Aboriginal Reserve which before becoming an Aboriginal reserve was Malaga mission on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother 's ancestral homelands and on my father 's side I 'm we run tree but at the age of 15 he came under the government policy of the day where if you were of mixed blood then you were required to leave the Aboriginal reserve and so what he did was go to to cover ganja and so there he met my grandmother who was Yoda Yoda woman and they married and had the biggest family so yeah I 've got the biggest mob so how many children do they have they had 10 children and so they all they all had big big families all of the you know all of their children indeed you grew up at camera ganja mission with your mother auntie Jerry we have some beautiful photographs here to share and like all our mothers who was strong and lead the way for us in our lives don 't they what influence did your mother have well I actually come from a very strong line of very strong Aboriginal women and my grandmother whose traditional name was hammock she was a presence in herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation and she never gave up hope and she followed eldest daughter around early March Tucker who went on to write a book but my mother was the youngest child so she wasn 't taken away at the time because the government policy at that time was targeting teenage girls and my mother was only six so she escaped being removed but that had an impact on her and of course my grandmother so my mother went on to be a very strong woman and was very much involved in Aboriginal Affairs and was actually awarded an AO for her work in Aboriginal community passionate about Aboriginal rights in aboriginal health and was actually part of an average long Islander women 's movement that started the Victorian Aboriginal legal service and the Victorian Aboriginal Health Service because they were services that we needed in our communities the impact of all of that removal of children poor health lack of access to services that are open to the broader community they were really the things that you know drove her I think to get that deep involvement so that 's how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this strong women who were very active politically who here in Victoria of course what was it like growing up and watching your auntie 's and and Nana 's of course and sisters work around you in in the political movement when I look back it was you know the very formative for us all but at the time we didn 't understand because my my mother and my sisters and you know they 're all involved in Aboriginal Affairs and often because we were living in the country would have to leave to come down to Melbourne or to go to Canberra or whatever and in those days we didn 't have the services that we have today you know the indigenous services so they were actually the fighters you know that we were struggling to bring about better services for our people so whilst we didn 't understand it you know I guess it just became part of our life indeed and of course a beautiful photograph here of your mother and with the students teaching them culture at school well before the days before cross cultural awareness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into schools back then a they would do it off the off their own aren 't back auntie you know I 'd like to go back to the camera ganja experience because this is about the arts and on karma ganja there was a very strong movement around what you call the arts that you know for us mine and song and dance and that 's all part of how we tell our stories and that was a very strong culture at karma ganja and then we had concert parties and choirs and the concert parties would go around to the hospitals they 'd have a pleasant Sunday afternoon at the churches where Aboriginal choirs would go so there was this strong arts movement from the Aboriginal people that were on the mission and so song and dance were always really important and indeed when I was growing up we used to have concert parties because you know that was before the days of television or mobile phones and all of this and we were we were living on the riverbanks of after walking off camera ganja Aboriginal reserve a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way that people were being treated and the threat of the removal of children from from them but so they settled on the on the fringes of the towns and so my family went to Shepperton root in the area and we 're on the banks of the Goulburn River and so in you know there was also very little work and so the concert parties were a way of I guess fundraising which would then be distributed amongst the families that were participating and I can remember me and Ida Pam had as Hedison who many of you will have heard her name I 'm sure well we used to be doing dances and things like that but all of us had a role so the arts is always you know we 've always been sort of involved so when when we 're washing dishes or scrubbing floors would be singing and all of that so it just became natural I suppose natural which brings us to our next slides of course your time spent working across the arts in an amazing career in which not many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an amazing modelling career of course which began at the Glenda Marshall model Brenda Marshall actually yeah was that here in Melbourne yeah in Collins Street at the time I was living at the Aboriginal girls hostel in Cunningham Street Northcote working at Hilton hosiery over in Brunswick I was and so you know I guess that was a prompter for me to say you know and I want to do something else so I enrolled myself in the Brenda Marshall model College and did all that and that 's the night of my graduation there and I was offered some amazing opportunities as a result of that one being I was offered a position at GTV knowing working with Hal Todd on the breakfast session I was also offered a professional modeling job with the Australian War Bureau as was known at the time to tour with the gold-medal garments I think was the 1961 Gold Medal garments so that kind of catapulted me into professional modeling and tell me about the time when you were studying to be a model in the school of course you were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what were the other women like towards you of course the modelling industry to this date is still very not very diverse and there 's still lots of black people that have kept out on the international catwalk so I 'm wondering what was it like back then for you auntie oh I took it in my stride I mean I think I 've always that 's one thing that 's handed down to from a big family of girls and strong women you know I was able to you know hold my head up and say I can do this which helped me immensely I mean I think being proud of who you are your identity that that 's always been something that you know helped me but also being able to pass that on to the young people of today I 'm very impressed that you signed up for the modeling school yourself no one else told you to get get along or you should go eat go and sign up for the modeling school no I know I did that I 'd go after I finished work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take myself off to modeling school you know I guess it was a an exciting new experience for me and I enjoyed it very much and we do have something in common that not many people know here but I did pay for my way through school modeling as a young girl as well I was so shy that I used to walk with me it 's hard to believe but I used to walk with my head down so my mother you know thought I can 't have my daughter raised like this so off you go to modeling school and mom created a monster but it was an invaluable experience that paid my way through school and it was only amateur modelling nothing of the international level that you know the success that you have seen auntie what are you some some of your best memories from modeling back in the day well when I was working with the Australian War Bureau it 's now in Australian wallboard but at the time it was Australian War Bureau and when they invited me to be part of the gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may remember Harry dougie quintet and there was a an opera singer called estrellita so it was a big production and they actually made garments especially for me for my skin tones and everything and I thought that was wonderful so some of the images that I 've got now from that day and the models that I worked with when we were moving around but a particularly great thing for me was that when I went to the country towns or you know two other states the aboriginal people that I met would always come out and you know make me feel welcome and and I guess you know it was nice for them to make that connection so it was the really unifying thing for me to be proud of who I was and saying you know they were promoting me like first Aboriginal model and all of this and I was but it it I think what I 'm saying is that other Aboriginal people were celebrating my success which was really important to me and that 's a wonderful thing and we 'll continue to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photograph with your sister tell us about this photograph of course the sapphires we come to you now in your career well you know I 'll just say something here because I was a freelance model so that meant that you would take jobs when you could you know what I mean about that and sometimes the jobs were few and far between so you had to have something else to do so that 's when we would be performing you know that 's when the singing and everything came in and so that 's my sister Laurel and we we toured Vietnam in the 60s and that was great because we got a lot of attention in Vietnam was on you know the height of the war and everything we thought well this is pretty alright you know but when we got there you know we didn 't think too much about it I don 't know if anybody 's seen the movie the sapphires but one of the women I think it was Cynthia said yeah that 's Vietnam where Vietnam you know I 'm it was kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saigon Airport was hit that afternoon that was the airport that we came in on so we 're kind of says hey this is real and it was like that from from there on we were there for three months and toured all around South Vietnam and it was quite an experience I mean you know in those days I think people were drafted and so forth so we were very pleased to be able to bring a little bit of joy to the lives of the young people that were over there at the time and some scary experiences would have cropped up in your time touring as well there were many because we were always escorted when we were travelling around so it might have been in a convoy of trucks and we 'd be sitting in the back and you could see the tracers going over the back and and the driver would be putting that the lights on and off so they couldn 't track us through the headlight headlights and you know sometimes we 'd be going through villages where they 'd been skirmishes during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that and then you know it was it was a strange kind of war and this is very well depicted in the movie the sapphires because there was the clubs in Saigon and restaurants and markets and all of those things were still happening but you didn 't know who was the you know the enemy at the time and so that was one of the things in the movie and so when you 'd come out and say that if there was a restaurant they 'd be you know surveying underneath the vehicles to make sure there wasn 't any explosives attached underneath so you always had to be on your you know on on the ready but we didn 't we didn 't really think about that when we said we 'd go we just thought it was a big adventure but you know being in a war zone was really a very rude awakening I can tell you what was it like when you came back home to Melbourne after touring with your sister you would have had some yarns to tell the family around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to go and see the sapphires if you haven 't seen it oh you don 't have to go you can get it on Netflix now so lazy or a day that is very well you know it 's of course it 's a story but it 's based on true happenings and so at the end there was this celebration and there was romance and everything and yeah and that happened indeed which just brings us to that the part before the the film of course it was laurels son Tony brings back in 2012 who wrote that play yes the sapphires what was your first reaction when he came to you and your sister to propose this theater piece you know for years I don 't think Laurel and I really thought about it we 'd often talk around the kitchen table or do you remember that remember that and I think Tony was fascinated by some of the stories and he started to record them and when Laurel told me I said who 'd be interested in that and then he told me after the the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big hit and it paid he had played at the Belvoir in Sydney at the Swan theatre and elsewhere and then Tony said oh they 're going to make it into a movie and I kinda said oh yeah I 'll wait to see you know when that happens and we only did you know and of course it was a very successful production and still remains I think quite a popular movie so what was opening night like for you for the opening of this oh this fabulous and that was that was in that was here yes you 're in Melbourne mm sorry I 'm just trying to think as we had one in Sydney as well and yes it was here so those the original sapphires there as well even though the two of you who only went to tour there was Naomi Mayer 's Laurel Robinson yourself and Beverley breathe so yes we 're we 're all all involved in Aboriginal Affairs whilst I 'm in education the others were all in health and worked at the aboriginal medical service in Redfern and one still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course I love what I 'm doing in education but so that 's how we started and yeah speaking of education auntie we come to our next slides of course you are currently the executive director at wah wah wah aboriginal college which is out at Healesville it 's a beautiful College for our young women from right across Australia and of course this school was started by your own family by your late sister yes I hold the position of executive director and principal and the school was started by my late sister Alice Morris who was also in the arts so Hillis was the co-writer of women of the Sun she was a poet and she wrote many you know many poems and stories so she had this passion about education and out our passion comes from our lived experiences that we wanted we feel that and I still have this belief that education is the key for our people and unless you have access to education you know you know our young people are not going to be able to make it they might be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that education is very important for our pathways so helis and I shared that belief and what we found and helis experiences living remember I said we lived on the riverbanks the Goulburn River in Shepparton Meru burner after the comma ganja walk off and when the aboriginal people tried to access education in the mainstream they were rebuffed they could not go into these schools and then later on when they did it was always that the kids were sitting at the back of the room they were you know the the curriculum was inappropriate and it 's for you know there 's no recognition of First Nations people and so forth and so Hiller 's determined that we would have a school that met the academic needs the health and well-being needs and the cultural needs of our young people and that 's what Warwick College does today so we still hold true to those values and we practice culture we practice and we do that through the arts so we 've got a very strong arts program at war oh I got a very strong academic program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our children so this year we introduced a V Cal program where the girls are actually going off and doing work experience in all sorts of you know the different industries and so forth and so it 's it 's it 's about you know how I said before about identity and self-esteem which is so important for anybody really but there was a gap in our education in that in that regard so we place a lot of emphasis on Aboriginal being proud of our identity knowing who we are knowing where we are as First Nations people in this country and that photo there is actually me at because I also have a role with the the regional regional Aboriginal justice advisory committee of which I chair so I invite the girls to come along to learn about the issues that are important to us as a country what are particularly affecting our young people and so you can see that some of those girls I think are sitting there in on this Rajic meeting and that brings together government agencies police magistrates everybody so it 's good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so forth the good coffee makers too because we have a barista course so they serve everybody with the coffee and what some of the feedback that you get from the young women after going to such a meeting well they really like the opportunity because they 're getting to really understand what are some of the issues I mean I always talk about Aboriginal issues and contemporary issues and I and about the past because that 's part of our our history our shared history and I think it 's only important that our young people have that understanding but they really because many of these young people are going to go back into their communities wherever that might be and they will become the leaders in the future so I want to prepare them so that they have an understanding when they go on to do that but well yesterday we were at Government House and they were singing because we 've got a singing group again singing in Aboriginal language and saying our poem written by Hillis Morris our founder as the the flag the Aboriginal flag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government House so I think that was a pretty special occasion so they get to understand the history about that and you know here we are all these years afterwards and they 're just raising the flag and properly acknowledging the Aboriginal people so I thought that was pretty special just beautiful and important to that these young women are experiencing issues around justice because they 're issues that are australia-wide aren 't they that concern Aboriginal people the incarceration of Aboriginal people is at an all-time high and understand recently you did go into Port Phillip prison I spoke to Robbie up there rockin lovely Robbie West is the aboriginal liaison officer who said that you 'd popped up there for NAIDOC week as well how important is it for you to keep the links with the brothers on the inside well my passion is about early intervention and diversionary measures so that we we don 't continue to have these high numbers of our people particularly our young people in incarceration so I 'm working with government and with you know the judiciary and so forth to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pilot but I think it 's important to understand that Oh with my school the young ladies that come there come from across the country now we 're an independent school and we cater we 're one of two schools in the whole of Australia that caters for the social and emotional well-being of our young people so we 're recognized by government for that so what does that mean it means that if children are coming from a traumatised background if they 've had gaps in their education for whatever reason they can come to our o 'er and have the support and the focus that they need to be engaged in their education and so giving them exposure to things that you know impact us as a community on justice issues but also celebrating things as we did yesterday I think that 's extremely important and speaking about celebrating of course you do have a debutante ball coming up oh no please show everybody the beautiful invites well let me tell you about that because we have a program at war were called pathways to womanhood so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transition to adulthood and most of if not all of the young women that come there do come from compromised backgrounds so they would never get the opportunity to learn some of the things that we you know the experiences that we provide and that all culminates in debutante dreaming as we 've termed it and you know it 's a very special occasion so we kind of bring in some traditional aspects but along with the contemporary things and it 's something that it 's a rite of passage you know for many of the the mainstream schools do it and we do it that we do it with an Aboriginal twist but it 's not the first year that were Aboriginal college has done this in fact the very first Aboriginal debutante ball that took place and it 's a beautiful photograph here 49 incredible this year I chose to use that because we we 've just come through NAIDOC and the theme was because of her we can and these young women were the in 1949 by the way on in that they were made coming from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so this was the very first time that was held at the Collingwood town hall and at that time there was no acknowledgment I think that was a huge step for them and they did it with a lot of training and I understand that the girls were always there to do the rehearsals but they had to go and get the fellows out of the bush I 'd be writing but you know there 's fathers my father was because I 've got three or four sisters in there so you know it was a real community event so it wasn 't the kind of debutante that we have in most of the schools today it was really a community event and it was making a statement and I do it because I can and to honor them and to give our girls the opportunity to have that experience after they finish the pathways to womanhood program and we do recognize my beautiful mother-in-law Lillian Tamara in here as well thank you for bringing that in tonight my apologies I don 't have that on the slide for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's going to be held at Pullman on the park on the 8th of September and if anybody is interested in coming along I can assure you you 'll have a wonderful night so you can go to the war our College website or give the college a call and buy your ticket get in early what 's some of the feedback that you get from the young women when they go through the debutante process of course as young women it 's an important rite of passage isn 't it but I think particularly as Aboriginal women to do this together which is very unique that doesn 't happen across Australia you know that 's true there 's there 's various it 's a experiential learning and so there are different modules of their learning but for some of these young women for example we take them to lunch at a restaurant or breakfast and I 've taken them to the Sofitel for that kind of thing I don 't pull punches yes but you know the thinking is cuz we get so what 's the word you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these young women they 'll say I can 't go in there and I say why can 't you you know so it 's giving them the experience that they would never have had and then when they 're going to a place and they they can feel comfortable and relaxed it makes such a difference and that 's what I try to do to say yes you can do it you know give them all those opportunities because they keep thinking some of them I 'm not saying all of them but many of them or think that that 's not for me I can 't do that well actually there was just something at the Melbourne Museum about you can 't do that and I was in it so I says yes you can you can 't do that and that 's so important what you have the young women go through just everyday stuff isn 't it which is really important auntie of course brings us now to the rest of the work that you 've done in the community so much work Archie Lois peeler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a decade what did you love about your work there working with Aboriginal tourism I loved I loved that the diversity of indigenous Australia was you know you know it 's just amazing but actually going out and working and meeting with people because it was about building capacity to run a tourism business and we were an association Aboriginal tourism Australia was an association for all of the indigenous operators and so one of the things that I did which I 'm very proud of I initiated a tourism Expo at the Sydney Opera House which brought all of the tour operators you know the indigenous two operators in together but all of their buyers and so forth and now they 're doing it you know on a regular basis at the Sydney Opera House so quite proud of that just one of the areas indeed in which you 've paved the way do you see yourself as a maverick in what you 've done in community development across the public sector in education now I see myself as a facilitator beautiful what 's left for auntie Louis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm working on a very important project at the moment which is on the warrior property and for those of you who are aware of the history of korndog Aboriginal station that 's where the school is located and my grandfather was born on Caron Dirk and there 's a sad story about that it wasn 't a happy place none of the missions were by the way so I 'm working on a project at the moment which honors all of the Victorian Aboriginal tribes there were 38 of them that many came through the mission movement and there was this dispersal and disconnection from country and from family because the children were taken away and they were put in dormitories and then they had to go out and work for the the landowners new landowners and they worked as domestic servants the girls or farm laborers with the boys so this is another reason why I and my family have been passionate about education because that 's part of our experience and you know when they went they took the girls away to CUDA muncher girls home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were just taught to look after the children or look after the jokes or whatever and cook and all that so they were never given the opportunity to have an academic education and in fact my auntie Marge Tucker was also awarded that 's my mum 's sister the oldest one that was taken away and she wrote her memoirs in a book called if everyone cared and she tells about her experience and then her her daughter Molly Dyer went on to be the founder or you know a member of the founding group for the Victorian Aboriginal child care Association so I 'm very proud to say that you know those are the experiences and those are the the women that have been in my life and I guess you know they 've been the very strong role models for me and yes so what else can I say exactly you just mentioned they 're an aboriginal controlled organization one of which another organization the Aborigines advancement league in Thornberry of which you did work back in the day what year did you start working at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came back from America because I lived in America for a number of years what you did raise your two children but I 'm here tonight and grandson oh that she 's she 's got an accent American accent she grew up in America so I I started work I was working with Hillis my sister because she had this vision when we were living in America Hillis came over and told me about her plans for the school which really excited me and I think that was the thing that says you know what I want to go back and be part of this and it wasn 't long before we found out that Hillis was quite ill and I was going to RMIT to do Business Administration and healers was supporting me to do that and then she became very ill and I kind of I went into the aborigines advancement league as assistant director to aunt Elizabeth Hoffman who was there another one of our elders it was the leader in her day and I had to drop out of that and take on the role working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed some other amazing milestones in your career in 2013 the centenary medal you 're awarded for your work in tourism mmm were you proud of that honor bestowed on you yes the the tourism industry particularly an indigenous tourism was minute minuscule you know we were trying to grow it and and at that time trying to provide the aboriginal operators interest rate islander operators with the business tourism business knowledge and skills and exposure to the industry and that was incredibly interesting because you got I got to go around to you know all states and every state was different and and get to know all of the the operators and and the communities and so forth but it was pretty hard going because we were trying to grow the Association as an indigenous organization and it wasn 't fully supported because the government then took on the role of being the indigenous tourism operators we 're always in that kind of situation I think what do you think at the current state of play of the tourism landscape across Australia well I do keep an eye on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved and I 'm very pleased to see that there are so you know there 's so much growth in the sector and that they continue to have events at the you know places like the Opera House but also are involved in the Australian Tourism exchange and all of these things where it 's it 's absolutely critical to be part of if you 're going to be in the industry so yeah I 'm pleased to see that it 's still developing in 2014 auntie Lois you 're made a member I am in the general division of the Order of Australia medal for significant service to the indigenous community as an educator advocate and role model can you take me back to this evening to that evening back in 2014 when you were awarded the well I am first of all I couldn 't believe that I was being awarded you know and you know nominated and I went along to government house with many Australians who had been nominated and now I was just amazed when oh no that 's the other one sorry that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep track sorry where are we lost you but still let 's talk about last 2017 of course you were named the Victorian senior that 's what I 'm talking yeah that 's an incredible that 's honorary I was telling you about but there were so many amazing achievers in that you know cohort and I really couldn 't believe that I got it so I was very honored indeed and went up to Canberra and was part of all of that wonderful experience as well and last year of course you were also conferred as a honorary doctorate role in education dr. Louis peeler mm-hmm that 's right doctorate of Social Sciences and that was through RMIT so I 've been honored indeed very blessed I [Applause] want to go back to talking about whare aboriginal college it has a ethos that approach holistic approach to education so how does that play out in in real terms on a day to day basis in the curriculum aunty you mentioned earlier there 's the Art Gallery of course that you have yeah I love talking about where are we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education the health and well-being and a culture and all of those are equally important because with without you know calmness and you know well-being you 're not going to be able to learn and you know we we see that so the all of that it 's a full boarding school so all of the girls that come to us board at the school and right now we 've just returned for term three and there 's always a bit of a transition because the girls are coming into a very structured environment so we have to look after the the well-being now every we 've got sorry we 've got a qualified nurse we 've got pastoral care we 've got services through Eastern Health and other service providers I mean now I 've got an itch dental van that 's sitting up there in the school grounds and they 're just examining every student 's so they 're getting well looked after and I think that 's really important because if you 've got worries as we call them or you know something 's troubling you they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine so that 's our firm belief that we have to look after their social and emotional well-being and sometimes there are things that might be troubling them from their family or from their you know back home so we have a lot of communication with the families and and the families are able to bring their child to the school at the beginning of term and then come and pick them up at the end of term and at the end of each year we have a big family forum where we work for two days and the families tell us what the aspirations are for their child and for their community and we that helps us to develop a personalized learning plan for each child so that 's what our team works to and we take a multidisciplinary approach so every Monday morning we all sit around and look at every student and how they are progressing in class in the boarding house with the pastoral care worker with the nurse so it 's a very caring and very supporting approach you must have seen countless success stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women there were some of those young women who have inspired you who have come through your school under your guidance well I can go back even further than that to be honest because we started out as a co-ed school and many of the young people that came through our school and our leaders in the community and hold high positions in government services and some of them have been in the arts is in radio you know in ITV and taking up leadership roles in community development or in social work and so forth so and you know what they all keep in touch with us at the school Facebook can be a really good thing it can be a bother but you know it 's a it 's a good way and so you know we we like to be able to have contact with our alumni and more recently when we changed to being an all-girl school in 2010 we 've had some girls that come through there now we were only catering for the middle years so that was from year 7 to 10 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to go on in juvey Cee we would establish a scholarship with the partner school and they could go on so right now I 've got some girls that are in in university that are just you know the alumni so they went to schools like Melbourne Girls Grammar to Jenna Sano MLC so those are some of the things we and we continue to have partnerships with those schools but since we 've now opened or extended our curriculum to include VCAL so that 's years 11 and 12 and it 's vocational learning but the students who wish to do VCE we can still find scholarships for them that want to do that very strong academic program but many of them are quite happy doing the VCAL program which will translate if they wish to at a later date I 'm wondering what some of the young women think out of you of course being a member of the sapphires and a film star of course your well they don 't the gear dating to film do they humbug you about that or what well there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all we don 't use a bell to signal signal change of class or beginning of class because the Bell has some negative connotations for many of us who from a mission life so what we do is play music and we like the sapphires come up to where you 'll hear the sapphires now look the girls love it and and there 's been occasions when teachers have you know done something on the quiet maybe it 's to celebrate my birthday but I 'll I 'll walk into the Performing Arts room and we do have one and here they are all in their blue sapphire outfits you know so it 's very cute and sometimes you know they 'll just come in and sit down in front of me and now um and my door is always open so they 'll come in and they 'll ask me things and one little girl today was sad she 'd been to come regard you and I just really can 't she 's from house Bluff or some way you know so she was telling me about you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling me about being to the camera ganja school and everything so anyway that 's just another story but no the girls I think really liked that they like to hear about my time as a sapphire or my time as a model and fortunately I 'm able to show them some photos so that 's kind of reality and not gamin as we say that 's it yeah absolutely not gammon we got proof of that right here from this conversation this evening Annie Lois peeler continuing the narrative how do you move into the future and continue our current narrative well for me that 's very important and I think I feel I have an obligation in passing on our knowledge and keeping alive our culture and we do that I think very well at were aware that I 'm also involved in as you 've heard you know in government and so forth and you know things like the Aboriginal justice forum and the regional Aboriginal justice advisory committee in education sector so I think history is really important and that 's the true history so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiences and from both you know there 's success the achievements and things but also I feel our young people don 't need to know the true history of why things are the way that they are why do we have many of our families suffer from intergenerational trauma the lack of access to education so there needs to be some understanding about why that is and so I feel obligated to be able to tell everyone that but also to celebrate our achievements and we celebrate the achievements big or small so that 's one of the things that you know I feel that we need to keep telling the stories the history celebrating culture and giving the the young people the opportunity to know who they are to celebrate their culture wherever they might come from be proud of their identity and just you know because I think being proud of your identity and builds your self-esteem and that it 's another way of you know growth I feel I absolutely applaud you for the work you 're doing with our young ones as we know the statistics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to commit suicide than non-indigenous children in this country so we need these programs and Ernie Louis I want to wish you all the best into the future with Warwick College and thank you so much for joining us for history salon to see I think you very much thank you everyone oh they 're beautiful aren 't they just gorgeous and thank you to our beautiful audience for coming along on such a cold evening as well how is that only alright for you nothing compared to what our needs done in her lifetime thank you so much keep up the amazing work and I hope we can be on again soon interest in in my story and so I appreciate that thank you all very much [Applause],"(-37.8146168, 144.9664898)"

our respect and thanks for having me here today thank you for that great introduction it was wonderful before I was led down here to speak I got to meet some of the people who are working here and as

over here come up for a photo uh your Rd Lola 's great grandson great great great grand nephew so it 's amazing you know the connections that we have all over the country and I was really heartened to see the people that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the council and the the way that the reconciliation action plan is creating opportunities and I was talking about when I first came into journalism and you know there was no one else you know sort of stumbled you know into this utterly alien environment and incredibly sexist racist places the newsrooms were hard going they still are hard going but not like this and I was saying to them whenever you did anything right in the newsroom they would always say oh good on you you 're a white man that was that that was the form of compliment you 're a white man so he called it white man quite a few times when I was started out in journalism look like I really want to talk to you today about this theme of reconciliation week this idea that don 't make history a mystery and I 've been grappling with this concept of history and what it tells us and how it is used who gets to write history who gets to tell us what the story of us is and it is treacherous terrain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact than just looking at Australia and Australians experience but I 've tried to locate this in a much more global framework because the question of history and the questions of identity that arise out of history are in many ways the single biggest challenge that our world faces today now I 've gone back to a French historian and philosopher and what he could tell us about reconciliation between black and white in Australia who more than a century ago when Australia we still presumed that Aboriginal people were a dying race ernest renan was wrestling with this question it 's a fundamental question what is a nation what is a nation it remains one of the most profound and powerful statements of identity I think ever written he wrote it in 1882 in the shadows of the French Revolution just a few years earlier Renan said that he sought to look beyond what he called the grave errors of race or language or religion he came to his essay he wrote in an absolutely cold and impartial fashion a nation he wrote was defined not by any one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fusion of the populations that comprise them race he said could be no foundation for nationhood to run on and remember this is 1882 Turin and there are no pure races race he said has always been of diminishing importance no one he wrote has the right to go about the world examining men 's heads and then grabbing them by the throat and saying you are of our blood you belong to us the nation he wrote was a daily referendum a perpetual affirmation of life the search for a collective identity Renan wrote that a nation is a soul a spiritual principle it was born of a marriage of the past and the present one the past the possession of a rich trove of memories the other the present the actual consent the desire to live together the will to continue to value the undivided shared heritage critical to run on was the question of history history could bind a nation or tear it apart the study of history he wrote often poses a threat to nationality Renan then laid a challenge to us that resonates still today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an essential factor in the creation of a nation to hear those words today it 's almost the antithesis of what we think today when we look at history as a roadmap to our present but we do it all the time we forget we choose those aspects of our history that we believe tell us most about ourselves why do we celebrate Anzac Day over many other battles why do we erect monuments to certain figures why do we not tell other stories about ourselves because it doesn 't fit a narrative forgetting is crucial to nationhood it is as I say a challenge to our age do we endlessly prosecute grievance or do we set aside the past define true unity today history can often be used as a weapon we define ourselves and divide ourselves along historical lines history is to identity what carbon is to steal the journalist and philosopher David Rev was inspired by renowned for his 2017 book in praise of forgetting I would urge anyone to read it it 's been one of the most confronting but profound books I 've read in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it and he turned it on its head instead he wrote thinking about history is far more likely to paralyze than encourage tarrif we risk turning it into a formula for an ending grievance and vendetta an ending grievance and Vendetta I 've spent 30 years as a journalist almost two decades of that outside of Australia we often call Journal is in the front row seat at history and I 've seen the world turn I 've seen the return of division and borders and hatred along ideological political and religious and racial lines and I know that the great conflicts of our world have at their core this unending grievance this failure to reconcile that so often rooted not just in our history but how we perceive our history think of the conflicts that have scarred our world and how they are born out of these wounds of the past Catholic versus Protestant Hutu against Tutsi in Rwanda Shia and Sunni Hindu pitted against Muslim Israeli versus Palestinian cestlavie Lodge the Polish Nobel prize-winning poet once said perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian philosopher and economist our March ascend calls these identities solar tourists identities they are exclusive they divided the world into US and them identity he says at its worst can kill there is a difference of course between identity that nourishes us and the need for identity which is crucial I walk through world is a indigenous Australian as of a Rhodri person of gamma Roy person a person of Irish heritage and Australian all of those things make up who I am most things provide the contours of my life identity that 's best can be an extraordinarily uplifting and inspiring thing but at its worst as we 've seen it can kill and we have witnessed now the rise of what 's become known as identity politics a political tribalism that has infected both the left and the right of politics it is instinctive it 's hardwired a tribalism that leads us to cling to our own and reject those deemed as outsiders it is a 21st century law of the jungle look around our world right now this was meant to be the end of history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Berlin Wall coming down in an end to the Cold War said that Western democratic liberalism had triumphed that this was the end of the great ideological battles indeed he called at the end of history what we have seen instead is the return of history we are putting up new walls we are militarizing our borders we are shutting down debate the politics of identity is winning at the ballot box the strong man is back Derwin in Turkey über in Hungary deter Tay in the Philippines Sisi in Egypt Putin in Russia see Jinping in China and of course in his own way Donald Trump each riding a wave of resurgent populism populism that divides us into the real people and the non people populism that requires a permanent enemy each in their own way is stoking fear and suspicion promising to return people to a more certain golden age somewhere in a past that never really existed the American writer Mark Willard has condemned this growth of identity politics as he says a cancer on democracy to him we are sacrificing the idea of what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the product of what he calls the shipwrecked mind the shipwrecked mind it is the mind of the reactionary it is the mind of the person turning away from change who sees as he wrote the debris of paradise drifting past their eyes the shipwrecked mind is nostalgic for the glorious past lost as little rights hopes can be disappointed nostalgia is irrefutable things were better back then this is the world sketched by the American lawyer and academic a.m. each wah in her new book political tribes professor Trotter a sees how identity politics is remaking our world and has already triggered a revolution in American politics tribal instincts she said is not just an instinct to belong it is also an instinct to exclude the u.s. she says is in a perilous new situation with nearly

erdogan speaks of the lost Ottoman Empire nostalgia has a powerful hold it is the most potent political force in our world today mark Lilla has called this the apocalyptic imagination as he writes the present not the past is a foreign country all that was left was the memory of defeat destruction at exile and this in so many ways is my history as an indigenous person the story of invasion dispossession racism segregation these are the stories passed down through generations of my family i sat at the feet of my parents and heard the stories of us rounded up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it didn 't happen in some dim dark past my mother could told me the story of her father chained to a tree like a dog and left in the Sun all day by the police but the police arriving at another time and putting a gun to his head or they bulldozed the teen humpy that they called home running over the graves of three of his children who were buried there of my father told me about beatings that he 'd taken in police cells I was raised on these stories painful and vivid and they have marked me and I felt at times marked me indelibly history is where we locate ourselves it is the foundation of identity and it can be a seductive narrative the story of our loss speaks a great truth but it also presents a dilemma at what point to these stories this history cease nourishing us and begin to poison us it 's been my struggle it is the struggle of all of us to move beyond it not to ignore it or to airbrush the worst aspects but to lift the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be bound to a history of misery worse to revel in it and what is history what is truth when we seek to examine the past what can we really tell about ourselves historical truth can be elusive especially when it is filtered through memory the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche warned us to tread warily he said where remembrance is concerned there are no facts only interpretations memory as we know is unreliable and selective and as we 've seen it can be a powerful and at times destructive political weapon in the words of the French historian Jacques Rogge off memory seeks to rescue the past in order to serve the present and the future is this the role of history do we seek to retrieve history to rehabilitate ourselves our historians moral Guardians is it their tasks to redeem us can the actions of the past be seen through the values of today an Australian historian Greg Mellish recently wrote that history is a means and imperfect means to understand the past but it is not the past itself and think about that what does he what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story of the past from fragments the shattered pieces of lives long gone it is a delicate and forensic tasks like sifting through the ashes of a house fire to us to assemble a story of those who once lived there it will always be incomplete the French historian michel de certeau once spoke of history as as hit as a story of absence a story of loss history was like tracing the footprints on the shore of people long gone he says that we arrange our past like artifacts carefully assembled in a shop front window how do we tell the story of us what monuments do we erect what events do we commemorate which historical figures do we celebrate how do we assemble our artifacts these are confronting questions for Australian history the unresolved legacy of the past as we are being reminded this week lies at the very heart of reconciliation there are calls now for a process of truth and justice to finally end what the Great Australian anthropologist bill Stannah once called the Great Australian silence but in many ways we have already pierced that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indigenous story from the margins and we are confronting critical questions how do we commemorate a figure like Captain Cook how do we remember the frontier Wars was this continent settled or invaded critical questions with no easy answers in fact we may find that all of those things sit alongside each other that all of those things can be equally true most critically how do we have this vital national discussion without tearing each other apart how to make this story all of it our story how do we build a nation out of the pieces of the past ernest renan speaks powerfully to us forgetting is crucial to nation-building yet forgetting can too easily slip into denial this year as I said the theme of reconciliation week is don 't make history a mystery history can tell us who we are but as we are seeing throughout our world historical grievance can so easily become a battlefield I 've written of all of this in a recent essay for the Griffith review and in my search for answers and what in search of a man from another time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would he make of this age of hyper identity I doubt he ever uttered the word identity I doubt he ever considered what it meant to identify with anything sessile William Henry Grant was an Aboriginal man he would have said I were a jewelry man he lived among wretched people he married a Jew a woman and raised his children to know what it was to be of a rancher a person he was also an Australian and proudly so defiantly Australian at when Australia was telling him that he wasn 't when war came he signed up a rat of Tobruk my grandfather fought not to prove his worth but because he already believed himself worthy he came back and he told his children of the world that he 'd seen he told them that this world was their world and that no one could shrink their horizons but themselves he was a Christian his faith founded in a belief in justice and equality as so many of the original Aboriginal political pioneers were who emerged out of those missions with a strong belief in their faith and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have heard that same message in the words of a black preacher from the segregated south of America who dreamed of a day when we would be judged not by our color but by our character when I think of Martin Luther King jr. I think of everything my grandfather was yes he was Aboriginal that was who he was to the core of his being it was his heritage it was his family to be Aboriginal was his natural as breathing but it wasn 't all he was like the great majority of our people he was what today we clumsily call mixed race he had an Irish grandfather he found a world beyond his own in books and a love of knowledge he wrote short stories and poems I 'm told he kept by his bed the works of Shakespeare and the writings of our own bards Lawson and Patterson my father still has my grandfather 's old Bible with his hand notes inside nearly half a century since the old man passed away my grandfather lived the words of the ancient Roman playwright Terrence a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am human nothing that is human is alien to me my grandfather was a man of courage and sacrifice a man born on the margins of Australia who endured harsh poverty bigotry and state enforced discrimination but never wavered in his dignity or his hope for this country a man locked out who looked for a way in in 1966 toward the end of his life my grandfather nominated as a candidate to be elected as the aboriginal representative of the Aborigines Welfare Board this was the organization that had so much control over our lives and I found his campaign pitch in an old edition of the welfare board magazine dawn it was distributed to Aboriginal communities across New South Wales it is an extraordinary document to read a document that speaks of an unflinching belief in basic human dignity when I read those words now I can hear him speak them he said anyone claiming that Aborigines are not humanly equal to other people seems to lack the knowledge of the common ingredients of which all human beings are made all mankind is blessed or played with egoism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influences of the elements of physical natural and divine influences all these things he wrote are evident in men thus far he said we are humanly equal and should be regarded by all as such today those words can seem almost quaint they 're so at odds with the spirit of our times these are angry times while he campaigned for equality and justice today throughout our world were just as likely to hear more about resentment and vengeance he fought for inclusion and today we so often hear about exclusion us and then we are more likely to define ourselves by what we are not who we are against rather than what we share in common this reconciliation week as we look again to our history we need to ponder its place in making a nation nation-building is at the heart of reconciliation it 's what we have seen on stage today it 's why all of you are here in all the divided diversity to make this a nation and we should look again to the words of ernest renan from a time of revolution in france and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said neither of his race his language his religion the course of his rivers nor the direction of his mountain ranges a great aggregation of people insane mind and warm heart have created a moral conscience that calls itself a nation thank you so much,"(-37.8146168, 144.9664898)"

Swanston St, Melbourne VIC 3000, Australia",3112,"[Music] [Applause] all right let 's talk about Melbourne it 's not one story its main stories its your stories we left other countries why we are here now why we really wanted something what what excited me to do this project is that international students are an incredible cohort of young people with bright minds from diverse cultures that come and live in this city in what way do they enrich our identity what do we learn from each other I mean that 's why I do this work so we can figure out what we don 't know very very very shy when I started these acts of translation I thought it would be just a workshop for people was struggling with the English I come to the workshop because Lee introduced me because my usual life is so boring the food was part of the reason I stayed I won 't lie but after the food came to people very important is building that fun dynamic workshop of connection and conversation and building the trust without the trust I 've got nothing so that 's a process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happens through storytelling I got the early we 're doing weird stuff they were yelling in the beginning it was like because word men like doing the weird expresses but then I understood like through those weird exercises you can easily connect with the others okay so that 's a driver class that 's not translation at all but then I understood not the translation of language is the translation of culture the intention of this work is to build your confidence so it 's not about I 'm not being some I 'll be bossy but I 'm on your side the work is ultimately about transformation you start in one place in a journey and you end up somewhere else well you don 't know what to say you 've all told me that a hundred million times that that 's the big issue now is the opportunity say something Oh what 's your job uh how much money do you make each math students want to step out of their culture they didn 't leave their country their family to come and get that exact same experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasn 't the dream they had in the first year of my study I only mingle with the trying student now try to make friends with the local people but I don 't know how we are forced to be silent sometimes and why we are silent it can be explained by the hope because of the fear of failing exams or something like that back in China that 's why most Chinese students do say that they prefer to choose business subjects we will threaten that we have to get great marks so that 's why we want to choose something that we good at we don 't want to risk being a good daughter must be a good girl follow the routine yeah I 'm expressing in English my thoughts are very superficial one it 's tangible one but one expressing the intangible concept I not capable of that for the study here I think it 's more about thinking much more than you just memorize all of the stuff I always like behind because not only the English is a big problem the whole context I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm still not compared with my angry so every time when I speak something I will review like to revise in my mind off its the tense right or it 's the correct if I know where the pace of all my classmates their benefits will be affected so I think I should be the one to work harder I just put more times than I have imagined I think it 's my own problem from Monday to Friday I cut a train from Norwalk to City it 's a collective story so whilst it might be this person 's individual monologue how does it relate to you that helps us to think beyond the immediate response to people of other cultures it 's also about racism or something like us oh do you do you think Australia is a racist country [Laughter] whoops two Australians used to call anyone from Greece Italy melts anyone from Europe now we can laugh about it but back then get back up later on the Aussie in the production I just I loved learning about all the different cultures and you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives yeah lemme talk to each other in English I want to be rude this way the locals you see them around you you know you polite and stop and be friendly but there 's no real connection yeah they 're not part of our course so like there 's no contact at all it 's very very hard to meet locals here super hard as I imagine like you had your high school here you already have your group of friends so you don 't want to meet other people try asking your international students about their lives but not just the good things yourself how are you what do you study try like really knowing them I don 't think I could do what they have done like to move country you know I spend a lot of money to come here that 's Australia most of my friends are from Brazil but I 'm trying to change this Brazilian not all of us of course you can generalize but we are very warm people what love people we love hugs when we meet you we try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of religion change my stereotypes Asian people for me we 're like very cold and not too close and not too open to other cultures but when I met the people in this group they are different you know you have to have the chance to met people in a deeply way to before job in Chinese culture we found that when we say thank you to your clothes one means you show a distance to them so that 's what we don 't say thank you when we don 't say thank you it means that we 're close friends we have a specific word it 's called cut out we don 't we don 't do this it 's to unfriend we do you have a word to describe these awkwardness but you don 't you guys to how to not have so this is really interesting that when you learn a language you also need to learn the culture always for some people is reliable in terms of student s like one entity everybody including international student have different uniqueness you don 't need to hurt anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are different yet we are the same we are human being now I could go to Australia see if I can survive Bruno you must be really really rich to study in Australia is that true no I actually got poor to come here because it was a very big investment now I have no money so I came here to steal jobs there 's no such a thing as a student visa where you 're just studying you gotta work here I work it as eating hang dishwasher and cleaner I don 't understand why they put the need of everything doing what Here I am in Australia study working traveling doing everything and you can imagine all the jobs that I have born I don 't mind if I need to thing but back home I was in India to face some work in my home but I never lived like this and vomit I know it 's hard this is not our country but just think about it a cleaner waitress in our countries can have the light that we have here that 's my mum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell her the things that I have to do here to get money and to survive I 'm always happy for him you can 't even tell your parents if you are feeling betrayed or stressed because they will be worried for you they would know that for my voice you know so that 's why some of the time I don 't even call which side Peron side or French side it depends you know do you tell your parents how are you here your life in Australia do you tell parents do you tell parents I love them the fear feelings and your study your girlfriend relationship two years living with the local Ozzy is really change a lot of perspectives we share we share a lot of our emotions and then I think this is a really very weight you you know you connect with your family in China we have a lines between children and parents I 've only really sweet and also a bit jealous okay if I said I love him my mom would say okay just tell me what you want wisdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Chinese culture we don 't like each other so frequent yeah so we 're well I 'm still opposed to meeting Catherine hug me and I feel so warm and the source of hardhead it 's adventuring into the unknown the unknown of identity a new identity my story is about my coming out to my mom I thought I would hide myself forever when I was in China because in Chinese society people just they can 't accept the the gay issue each adoption Imam who are fashionable shushing Madoka en doing I 'm sorry mom I I 'm not interested in boys I like those I need to show you someone do you want to see a doctor a dementia will create you so well worth the money into engineering it has been more than one year since I came out to here and I think my mom has changed a lot because she loves me so she she 's trying to accept that she doesn 't push me too hard to find a husband or something but my dad 's do ask me all the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free here I can be Who I am and I can live the life I want my mom already texting me that do you have a boyfriend yet we have afraid comment down who do it means we 're gonna be match finance aspect social aspect parents aspects I 'm not money [Music] oh yes I do but that has always arranged for a prospective bride who just pops in slowly and slowly I realize that this is a place which gave me a very safe secured comfortable environment to be what I am I had a very good job in India and very loving family why did I move here sometimes I feel I should just say it just say it it helped me to open up do you know come out to blossom my individuality to felt accepted putting yourself in an entirely new situation you know that opens up your perspective towards the Walden maybe widens it or maybe changes it completely it 's greatly rewarding the question is don 't you have a university in your country thing is we do have universities at that country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a huge hype in India about getting into the most prestigious universities the IITs I started coaching from year 11 but these days people to start it from you 're annoying I should get it luckily the net internet internet on a Facebook then if Sonam at la idea that a karuppu to study study on a study that one way about 1.2 million students set for it every year and out of those with 12,000 you get to study in varieties my father would come in say Josh come on go to sleep you studied enough there 's a lot of pressure on the kid but I guess that 's pretty universal isn 't it speed one but I 'm here I can 't understand what they say I was all the time in my own City which is now so when I came here it 's totally new experience for me and it 's like you know a new word for me the idea to keep around it so Chris what are we killing was in our culture from childhood to until you get married everything is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help you but here you are on your own in everything Confucius said if your parents our life don 't go too far away from what 's that oh yeah yo yo P your fault if you do decide to go let them know where you are I 've got this social efforts I decided to it 's kind of a personal project because you know as international students if you don 't really make an effort and reach out you can 't end up feeling isolated and learning because we don 't have our families and friends here I try to come here once in a week every Saturday or Sunday is this not mushroom guy every time I get a chance I no matter their men or women Yano oat I will initiate the conversation and just ask them questions and you know have some small talks every time I do that after I come back I I would show a line so as you can see in May I had 22 social events by looking at these calendars I know that like in this month I focused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my English test and then another month I didn 't do much because I was merely in the library I only got maybe two or three so Shepherds yes so this is my assignment calendar I don 't want to live a life like this anymore too boring yeah too intense I study here I 'm doing interpreting and translation in RMIT probably my coordinators here living in Melbourne is totally different experience for me I don 't have to be worried about my religious background my nationality like originally where I am from I am covered or not so I just feel like I 'm a human and free and protected that 's the most important thing for me I was doing volunteer work interpreting for Syrian refugees it helps it all of us as a human to know more about each other by listening to each other stories theatre is a visceral art form and when when the students connect to their stories which is my job to get people connected to their own stories connected to each other then connected to the wider community when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to connect your locals I have to learn how to use Facebook and amazing Mustafa share our personal stories that 's what our friendship it 's deeper the participants the students don 't recognize the power of what they 've done until they 've performed and particularly this kind of work because it 's it 's you be putting yourself out there you 're telling your story it 's your personal narrative and you 're exposing your vulnerabilities your strengths students don 't realize the power of that until they 're witnessed in performance and when they witnessed in performance then it 's like for me what makes me feel confident is like you are enjoying it and this is true this we are not lying we are not acting we are these are our lives what is you know it 's like challenging challenging thinking in English under in your life which are they so I feel very very proud well that was amazing the miracle of story is this you can only tell one story your own story the other side of it is that when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to overcome prejudice what does paid you gets me it just made prejudge dispelling myths you 're overcoming prejudice and this show should be seen a very boring person sometimes I think myself like that I don 't have much passion in my life in the past if you ask me and try and perform and I would say no what 's that a lot of confidence not only in the project or one of the guys that 's that 's all I am watching we have a lot of connection between the local and the students I missed a lot of friends they encouraged me it 's amazing in my life I think this is the best memory in the Melbourne it 's more personal to me since doing the project like I 'm just like really proud to just be a part of something like to get rid of that ignorance sometimes I think I fall into the trap of and are seeing overseas students and others groups rather than individuals they all opened my it opened my perception and made me think I will think differently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the connection between us all the workshops that we had dealer amazing the mirrors connect with everybody else and obviously beauty per day after day there is a reason for me to in Melbourne and the reason is to find myself to connect my truth me why shouldn 't storytelling be a major action it should be a major action it helps keep works that 's why we do this if we care about people if we care about the community that we live in if we want a more peaceful world if we want the world of understanding then that 's why this work is such an intervention [Music] you [Music]","(-37.8146168, 144.9664898)"

's a very important day for us it actually starts the process by now where we will go to market with Monroe will start to do the work on the rest of the market and we 'll get in in the first couple of years to the substantial refurbishment of this wonderful facility I 'd add though that it 's not just about Queen Victoria Market this is a game-changer for our city this is something like 12,000 jobs

Victoria market this day has been driven by the traders at the Queen Victoria Market and the customers of the Queen Victoria Market where they 're saying to us help us modernize a facility so that we can continue to trade not only for today but into the future and it 's made possible because of the support of the Melbourne City Council so invest the sort of money that 's being invested make sure that this market remains a market for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred years we are giving the Queen Victoria Market a future we will remain open for business throughout the whole of the renewal cycle and

market through renewal we will relocate some of the traders but the great thing is as part of that relocation will be providing some updated facilities that will make the Queen Victoria market even more contemporary than what it is at the moment which means we 'll have some exciting new ventures some exciting new areas for customers and traders alike to come and experience the best thing is in five years time we 'll have a larger market will have the ability to host more traders than what is there today the ability to host more customers than what is there today alongside some brand new facilities that will make the market not only a contemporary market but it will enable us to balance our history and our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the future thanks we 're happy to take your questions and i thought i 'd ask greg there 's one of our our traders to come along if you want to ask a trader a couple of questions and i wanted particularly to ask greg along today because it was Greg along with a group of other traders who came to me back in 2012 group they were the traders who came to me to say unless you do something with this market it will close we will go out of business and and it was a real call to action from the traders themselves that started this process now nearly four years ago so we 've tried to work closely with traders because it was prayed or driven from the start any of us are happy to take your questions hey through the that 's where we were all there 'll be about half of the cup we promised the traders that will have over 700 cow spaces because that 's the amount that that 's on the the the astral part up here now about half of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will go under sheds a 2d originally we purchase Monroe so that we could provide that underground car parking we 've actually found it 's cheaper to split it and do some underneath sheds a 2d and some at Monroe that also helps with traffic flow and the traders actually asked us to conceive underground parking underneath sheds a 2d because of people just pop up straight into the market so we 've been listening to what they 've been saying but there 'll also be services under there to provide for deliveries for chill for storage you know all of those things that the traders don 't have at the moment which by the way by putting those services underground frees up space that 's currently taken up by pretty bulky temporary service facilities on the ground level so we 'll be able to get more traders into those sheds a 2d those instructions well there 'll be some but it 'll be really not so much disruption you know like a major infrastructure project but you 'll find smallholders in different places that will be the major disruption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to do temporary markets on

moving around and then back again during the course of the development but we 've made the commitment to them that it will be business continuity for all of them during the entire period and effectively reduce or arrows houses Tower yeah look we have there are a couple of things in play here when we bought the Monroe site we knew that it probably wouldn 't make a financial contribution to the project as a whole because in working with the private sector there were some facilities that we wanted in there we wanted a 100 place childcare center we wanted about seven and a half or eight percent affordable housing in there we wanted some community facilities that will really be of great use to the city and we wanted originally 700 car parks so when you start to ask a developer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to expect a return to the project as a whole from that project now in order to make that work what the proponent will do is look for a retail and residential tower down at the Elizabeth Street end this is a very interesting test by the way of the minister 's new central city built form controls because we 've just had a panel here and come back last week see 2 45 it 's called and it 's on our website now where the panel looked at the present height limit across this whole precinct which is 20 meters and they said that 's no longer appropriate so they 've put in place a 100-meter discretionary height limit now that means you get your hundred meters and according to the central city built form review if you add value you can go higher than that and one of the things they say add value well things like affordable housing public open space community facilities now let 's just take public open space 1.5 hectares of new open space is the largest new park in the city since Bureau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is our our first cemetery over there you know to commemorate the nearly 7,000 bodies that are still there I think is particularly important in a public open space and it will acknowledge that history as part of it it 'll be a very beautiful space rather than just a national car park you look amazing comments satisfy the process talking about the plan development in the hole altameyer is this has been a review what should I survive well as i said i was a little puzzled by the minister 's remarks I 'm very happy to sit down but there when we 've organized at the time to do that to take him through this remember this has been a process an iterative process over four years as we 've moved forward with this design let me take a couple of the minister 's concerns and their legitimate concerns that we do need to meet he will be the responsible authority for the redevelopment the market we 've got to work with the minister and we we intend to he has heritage concerns and that 's fair enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heritage but it 's not as if we 're taking away sheds a 2d they 're being removed restored and then replaced and no we don 't have a heritage victoria permit because that 's not the stage where out but have we worked with heritage victoria unbelievably closely and and they are perfectly comfortable with the direction that we are taking with the market in addition to that we 've actually applied for National Heritage listing of the Queen Victoria Market so we want to enhance the Heritage protections around this market not detract from them so that there is heritage concerns the tower well panel has just come back to say a hundred meters discretionary is perfectly all right and the minister 's own central city built form controls now allow us to argue for a full the tower I mean the last thing I want is 100 meter boxes of glass all over the city you 've got to have some room for innovation in design and I 'm confident that we can make the argument under his own central city built form controls to get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two of the things that he raised I think he also said that the process has been a bit hasty we 've been working on this for four years now you know the latest iteration has been the panel report which came down and this implantation report and strategy that we 're presenting to you today but these milestones have been happening for four years and now we 've laid out what will happen over the next five you know when a project unfolds over ten years I wouldn 't have thought that was hasty so we 're very happy to sit down with the minister and take him through his concerns he is right to raise them I 'm confident that we can we can answer not not in specific terms but in general terms the minister 's always said you know Heritage 's are concerned and we get that he 's always said you know look we 'll need to look at any development and that 's reasonable he 's the responsible authority but remember this we 've actually got a contract with the government of Victoria to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 10 million dollars if we don 't deliver it so we 're kind of in a bit of a cliff stick here now when we when we made the deal first with the state government about the parcel of land that 's down at franklin street I 've said right from the start that was going to be a development site that was always going to be the development side then as luck would have it the Monroe site came on the market and that was just too good to pass up so that was a bit of a game changer for us and it freed up a number of things but although those concerns have been on the table the intention and the plans have also been on the table and we do need to meet those heritage concerns and we do need to be meet the central city built form controls and we intend to so I 'm confident that we 'll work our way through it you know even best of friends have slightest women 's from time to time some new traders protesting yes there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feel for a number of those traders remember there were seven hundred twenty eight of them then we had about 40 or 50 on a protest yesterday okay and it 's not the majority maybe maybe Greg might want to comment as well I understand that as you 're going through change in something that 's as iconic as this where people have been in place in some cases for generations that does create some tension some nervousness about me my family my business it 's our job and it 's the job of the city the market management the board of the market to continue to work with those trailers and they do I 've been very pleased with our new CEO Malcolm who 's you know along with Paul and the other members of the team who are engaging with traders not just in groups but one by one dealing with their individual concerns and that 's the way we want to do it so I think I understand that people are concerned because their way of life is changing but it 's our job to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a look at the number of people that are going to be coming through here and by the way have a look at the fact that we 've got these development sites to protect you against things like Kohl 's rubble worse because we don 't want that sort of retail in the market precinct we can only do that because we 've got the sites and that 's what we 'll do to protect it so I think bit by bit you have to take people through their individual concerns take them seriously and show them how this will benefit them but that that economic uplift that I mentioned before that 1.2 billion that was a completely independent study done by SGS about what will happen at this market at the end of the development so the aim of this is not just to preserve the beautiful heritage and the history of this market it 's actually to make our traders more profitable that 's what we want to do it we want them to be more successful because they were the concerns that Greg brought to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of traders who have remained very supportive of the project I understand it was the trailers that drivers it was a trade as it drove this process now anyone could build a building and the schedge will be returned but it 's a traders ER to the life of the market they create the vibrancy they create the custom they create the atmosphere first and foremost in our thoughts are the traders and that 's why we 've make commitments to be able to trade through that 's why we make commitments to improve the facilities and that 's why when the Queen Victoria market will remain open through renewal at the end of it we 'll have more traders that will be able to trade on this magnificent sight how many more favors that will be determined over the next period of time but as we 've already said the facilities that are currently above ground will go underneath that creates a lot more room above the surface then on top of that we 've got this magnificent 1.5 hectare site which will be an open space that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have to use the new man square prison for bandsaw we blend of everything it should become a community meeting place as it almost or informally is at the moment that will attract more and more people to the market it 'll and as we do that as more people come that we more traders that would be able to trade off that as well so advanced festivals we run a night market here last night it was 25,000 30,000 people here last night in the middle of winter right in the middle of summer we had 50,000 people here imagine being able to do that every night of the week right it just creates a different environment for everybody in and around Melbourne the traders that create that atmosphere the tourists that come into this city and everybody involved with this great city great so just one thing before you speak to Greg I 'd love to see it almost as the fed square of this end of the city except with grass you know so you know fed square is a wonderful meeting place and it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is this market could be exactly that and when we free up one and a half hectares in there with an interface to sheds H and I where you have that dining experience you know i have on sunday i went down to the the south melbourne market and i could see the seafood from the market coming into the little rest being cooked right there in front of me and I sat down with a glass of wine and a beautiful hot pot of fresh seafood from the very market where I was sitting you know that would be my dream here only bigger and better and interfacing with that one point five hectares as an event space as a meeting space just as a beautiful green space in the center of the city so there are some really exciting prospects that sort ask me okay well the faith dive it wasn 't well it 's what 's been happening over the last since the GFC I guess or even practically for them that business has declined in many areas and trade ins generally feel that we need reinvestment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the Lord Mayor back in 2012 and our concern was that there was money being generated from the market going into council coffers but it wasn 't coming back and that was their intent at that time as you gain through oh we 're in a retail revolution it 's it 's as simple as that and right at the moment perhaps you could describe it as a retail recession you many go look at places like Dick Smith and so forth there were real struggles for retailing the big advantage that we have is that up to 250 million is going to be spent on this market and that 's that 's that 's a good positive thing for traders one way is I am Sailor market well I look it looks to the future I mean the markets been here a long time it 's done a great job is still another great job still the best market in the world skews my clients but it 's got to do that for the next hundred and fifty years and the changes are needed and look at their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years I spend a quarter of my trading day packing and unpacking my stock and and it 's quirky it 's quaint customers are fascinated by it but it really doesn 't add anything to value to the customer so there are things like that that I think we need to change and having the money to spend on those things it would be great but kind of a victim of our own success here aren 't we because the retail offer in the city of Melbourne now is absolute world class you know so you can go into the laneways and you can find the quirky sort of retail that you want or into somewhere like the nicholas building you know or you can go into the great boulevards at Melbourne in behind the world brands you know you can find our local designers so retailer in the city is a very competitive environment but overall retailers are pretty tough gig and and you just can 't rely on the fact that people have a fondness or a memory of queen victoria market you know you 've got actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I think that 's what this will do if they 'll actually make this now a destination now to some extent it 's always been that but we 've seen the market decline in terms of turnover and unless we arrest that then that can only go one way and finish up on my and the only way you 'll do it is to bring what we love about the market up to standard particularly the heritage parts but also present it and make the traders as successful as we can this Greek set provides storage facilities provide car parking underneath it provide a beautiful space next to it provide a diversity of experiences inside the market and people will come where you name in rigidly i think it is early next week yeah and it 'll be a very amicable meeting I 'm sure and he 's right to raise the the concerns and we 've got to have the answers and I 'm absolutely confident that we do I 'm absolutely confident that we can you know win his confidence around the plans that we have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many concerned members of the community who loved the market and he speaks of his love of the market and that 's great and it 's partly my job to convince him about why his love of the market will be enhanced by this 250 million dollar investment or if you must be the point of the project I hope it doesn 't to be honest Jane I really don 't I mean the thing when we embarked on this and I as I say I was driven by the traders but how many times we got to the starting blocks on the Queen Victoria Market and either the City Council goes the water or the traders get upset because I don 't like what 's proposed or the state government goes the water this is the one time when we 've lined all of those up although there will be some traders who still have concerns if we don 't proceed with this if we don 't get this project over the line I reckon you can take this project off the list for the next 20 years because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not in my nature to back away from tough challenges but I do understand I 've got a big communication job to do to the wider community to the market community to the traders to all of those important stakeholders to convince them that we have got the answer right and I 'm absolutely convinced that we have I 'm absolutely convinced that the work that we have done and I pay great tribute to the team that 's been led by by Rob Adams are absolutely convinced that we have got the right answer for the Queen Victoria market but make no mistake if we back away from it now then reform is off the agenda investment is off the agenda for the next couple of decades nearly every vision therapy over there so with all right look we get a hundred you know now as of right according to the panel as long as the minister adopts his own panel recommendations what we would probably argue is for you know a slightly higher than that probably another 40 to 60 metres higher but you know that that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that fairly soon as well that will be the proponents design and and that will be to balance the community facilities the childcare the car parking the community facilities we want to get from them and the fact that we don 't want like 3 100 meter towers along the Monroe site I mean the panel decision would allow you to do that but we don 't want to do that we don 't want boxes of glass I would rather have a single more elegant but taller building with the community benefits that I 've described which is what the central city built form controls allow for there 's your discretionary height you want to go higher than that show us the community benefit right one point five hectares of open space childcare car parking community facilities sustainability in the building elegance of design so I 'm confident than the minister 's own controls we could argue for a tower that is taught and that by the way would be consistent with the that are in that precinct down the peoples of the street end never getting rid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a caravan I do not believe it is mobile it has not moved in 35 years I doubt that it will move in the next 35 yeah that 's it because we don 't expect to make any money on the Monroe site in fact we may have to put in a little a little more and that 's because we want to get all of those extra facilities in there it 's relatively easy to say look it 's just a development site do what you want but we wanted something that would complement the market there in terms of retail community facilities childcare in particular and of course car parking so once you start constraining the site by that many considerations then breakeven would be extremely optimistic we probably have to put a little more money into it but we 've got the value of the land and we 've got all of those community facilities you know maybe 40 million 45 million dollars worth of community facilities anything else thank you very much for interest in attendance","(-37.8146168,

Melbourne,KQtKoaAPeWc,20150825,1264.09,"120 Swanston St, Melbourne VIC 3000, Australia",3291,Fiona to me is a writer director and producer based in Melbourne over the last 20 years she 's also worked in a diverse range of leadership and educational rolls across the arts screen literary and disability sectors as writer and director who documentary Holland galas monkey group recently screened on ABC TV since July 2012 fiona has been a mentor in residence on right ability program for writers with disability a partnership between writers victoria and arts access victoria also fiona is currently a creative consultant and writing workshop leader on the dangerous deed history of disability advocacy exhibition for stark collective funded by Australia Council and creative Victoria we walked into town in a stifling dry air the cool change came racing up bourke street behind us out of a dirty yellow sky that 's a quote from Helen Ghana 's book monkey group published in 1977 by maxi Gribble and inspired by advancing melbourne from 40 years ago in 1976 when Helen would write a bike daily to latrobe reading room the State Library to write what would become monkey grip and what she hoped might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very different place it would have been hard to imagine back then that one day Melbourne would be designated a UNESCO city of literature as back when Helen was writing monkey grip our culture was still deeply influenced by British culture local publishing opportunities were limited and most writers who were mainly men would look to have their books published in England first last year is Nelly said I made the documentary about Helen Ghana 's monkey group which screened on ABC TV for me a big party monkey grip is about a particular time in Melbourne when Australia was searching for its own artistic political and cultural identity in the 1970s a new Australia was emerging and when Gough Whitlam became prime minister artists were at the forefront of the revolution and I think given our current context of federal government I just like to say again that 's right artists were at the forefront of the revolution I believe as writers artists filmmakers designers as creative people we can help create in shape the city we want to live in also as Nellie said for the last three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a program for writers with disability it 's a partnership between writers Victorian arts access Victoria and it 's basically the wheeler centre up in little lonsdale street before the advent of right ability writing programs for people with disability in Victoria were few and far between examples of successful Australian Writers a disability or rare and deaf writers even more so consequently the number of authentic voices recording the stories of the lived experience of disability has been limited the right ability ethos has been built around the importance of self told stories disability leadership and peer support and the creating of opportunities for even the quietest voices to be heard I 'm told by David writing who is the director of melbourne city of literature office that out of all of the other international cities of literature I just say Melbourne was a second city of literature but last count there are 11 cities Melbourne is the only city to offer a writers with disability program making our program in Melbourne and international best practice model a big part of the success and sustainability of the right ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature creative hub at the wheeler centre placing an inclusive arts program for writers with disability in the midst of mainstream literary organisations including writers victoria express media the emerging writers festival the Melbourne writers festival Austrian poetry the small press Network the wheeler centre and the city of literature office means many things but particularly that we can try to work together so that writers of disability are not continued to be marginalized at this year 's emerging writers festival I hosted a closed forum on writers of disability and I 'd like to read from our statement just part of it written by Jack 's Jackie Brown we want to change in challenge perceptions who we are as people with disability we are not objects of inspiration or tragedy we are complex and whole individuals leading full and rich and messy lives you want to break down these stereotypes these meta-narratives of disability by having our writing published in the mainstream we want to read and write stories of disability pride parenting of teenage angst of falling in and out of love of the intersections of identities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plethora of other identities one can have we want to reclaim the disabled body is desirable to read and write stories which show disability is a valuable part of our person not something to be afraid of or ashamed of such misconceptions can only be broken down if we are published and published wildly wildly and in accessible formats so that people with a variety of disabilities can can have access to and enjoy text like any minority we want to tell our stories ourselves because that is where empowerment and societal change happens we are tired of others writing about us it 's time to get our voices out there if we happen to be written about others who don 't live the experience of disability we want to be consulted in the same way that the indigenous communities are consulted about how to address indigenous stories and issues this is the stela to nothing about us without us I love Melbourne and I love that we are a city of literature and I wonder who at the moment may be sitting in the latrobe reading room at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novel or who may be sitting there starting to write for the first time I want Melbourne to be a city where all our many diverse voices are heard a city which is accessible and where everyone is included I didn 't get belt ladies and gentlemen is my pleasure to introduce linda roberts who is our second city of melbourne representative she 's the public art program manager at the city of Melbourne recently delivering the public art framework to twenty fourteen to seventeen we get to say fourteen to seventeen hours after said 20 I don 't know and is currently developing a suite of new initiatives including test sites and the biennial lab prior to managing public art Melbourne Linda worked as arts manager and academic at RMIT University and principal of public assembly and art and design practice focused on the social dynamics of public space she brings to the role of background in architecture it 's in the creation of cultural events within the public realm and a passion for collaborative processes and temporal outcomes you are really hard to find a song for but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other things which I 'm pretty confident I don 't understand I 'm giving you a song about anxiety modernity and the city by anxiety modernity and city by then I 'm drawn to but don 't really understand into zone by Joy Division ladies and gentlemen linda roberts I think my manager Shawna Johnson would appreciate that song somehow okay I put slides so I 've got to make sure I get through okay the goal to be a creative city is at the heart of what drives public art Melbourne and we 're very fresh and new we 've only been out and about for last just on a week we launched last Wednesday our new public art program aims to encourage risk-taking celebrate diversity build vibrant creative communities and foster and more surprising an energizing City so there begins but you know we 're embarking we 've got you know pretty ambitious kind of things are we aiming for public art Melbourne wants to welcome debates and lively conversations and public art does that pretty well in this city so we 've got a great legacy that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amuse and to bring new ways of seeing or being one of our newest initiatives test sites is all about this it 's inspired by Mel burns already robust public domain and it 's an opportunity for artists to develop their creative visions and contribute to a public art arena that we hope is set to thrive into the future one of the six key goals of Melbourne arts strategy is activation so if you 've got this book you would see that in there somewhere the goal these goals were developed as a result of extensive community consultation as you know and the public art Melbourne framework which was endorse late last year was a direct response to the goal set out from the Melbourne art strategy so are we really really lucky one of the first things they did coming on board to the city of Melbourne was having the art strategy in all the conversations that already happened to use as a foundation in the writing of the Melbourne the public art Melbourne framework which was really great to have test sites is about artists being supported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about helping artists to bring our critical study spaces to life and supporting this activation we want artists to think of melbourne central city as their own studio with the experiment with experimenting with experimentation and testing of ideas in the laneways streets and public spaces in between the buildings and where you live work eat and shop test sites is a responsive program while developing the new program we heard how hard it is for artists to create works in public domain and I know that myself as a practitioner in the past it 's very difficult it 's and we recognize that sometimes collaborating with the city to create public art can be a lengthy iterative process we 've recognized the city of Melbourne is is in a unique position to make it easier for artists to work in the public domain and I hope to make the city more porous in with this new program test sites is built as a quick response opportunity so it 's set up to open for new rounds every six weeks so it means that artists can apply to explore the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we hope a very simple visual visual essay kind of acquittal each round successful artist will receive up to three thousand dollars of seed funds mentoring from experienced artists and advice from the public out Melbourne team on how to negotiate city spaces and obtain permits and that also includes talking to building owners so being able to install your work and opening up conversations sometimes in a city that seems very difficult to know who to talk to you it 's also about being it 's also about artists being responsive to the city as well so it 's kind of multiple tiers of responsiveness really sites chosen for creative experimentation by artists will be unique to our city and artists will be encouraged to respond to the particular city site that they 've chosen to work with so we 're encouraging site-specific allottee and responsiveness but test sites is not just about funding public up melbourne is here to support artists with workshops information sessions and support to negotiate details like permits to work in the melbourne central city spaces test sites is designed to increase the capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workshops so far have been locked in with experienced artist mentors and we 're really excited to have the these artists on voyage I 'm who already whose work has been featured in this presentation so this includes Cameron Robbins who 's running the first workshop on on this at the end of this month on the twenty eighth of august bianca Hester ash Keating and Jason mailing and it 's just really great to be able to work with them over the program in the forthcoming year test sites is about ideas and innovation it 's about recognizing the creative process by which artist perceive our city enhancing how we all see our city of Melbourne it 's but it 's not about final outcomes it 's about experimentation and trialing of ideas and taking creative risks akin to an in situ micro residency focused on the process rather than the final result through test sites we see a city that crackles with possibility for artists to test ideas interpret spaces and invent you new experiences it 's only launched last week and test sites will be run as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we invite you to experiment in the city so we hope to talk to you further and this slide just gives you and rundown of all the dates so please make contact with us we 'd really love to hear from you Thank You Linda our next speaker is dr. Christian Thompson he is an australian-born london-based contemporary artists back for a week so right still battling go to jet lag all month and her oh you 'll be right now you missed the london heatwave that was hilarious it 's Australian born london-based contemporary artist whose work explores notions of identity cultural hybridity and history formally trained as a sculptor Thompson 's multidisciplinary practice engages mediums such as photography video sculpture performance and sound in 2010 he made history when it became the first Aboriginal Australian to be admitted into the Oxford the university of oxford in its nine hundred year history he holds a doctorate of philosophy and fine art and many many many other qualifications that would take me until that Tuesday to read out um let 's just say he 's a bit of show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works are held in major international and national collections and I tried to find a theme song for you I literally was at a complete loss and googled theme songs about a sculptor and I got someone doing macrame on YouTube to wind pipe music I tried to bring it in I 'm just not good enough at technology so in the end I set it on Picasso baby by jay-z because that 's a great song about all the pieces he wants to buy he 'll buy a Christian Thompson pretty soon ladies and gentlemen please welcome to the stage dr. Christian Thompson thank you I 'm glad it 's not Lionel Richie that hellos that would have been a good one I am firstly thank you for the invitation to come and speak I 'd also like to acknowledge the burner wrong and we 're Andrey people and the greater coordination and thank aunty die for that very warm and generous welcome I wasn 't really prepared intelligible what I was going to speak about and I sort of thought maybe perhaps what I could bring is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who sort of been moving between Europe and Melbourne for the last decade so I think in terms of kind of imagining the future of art I was thinking about that impact there are two kinds of things that were sort of imagining one is the sort of future of of art as a kind of critical cultural commodity but also as the kind of infrastructure to it one is as a kind of form of critical engagement but also the other thing is about the you know as a economic cultural industry it 's something that provides cultural nourishment and it 's a mirror of society that we have used as a tool to imagine in the society that we want to become something that I thought I was recently something that Grayson Perry recently said when he was addressing am Boris Johnson in London and said that rich people don 't create culture when talking about housing affordability and that in fact the sort of inner city by rows of London have become culturally barren will he described them as as deserts to voids of good devoid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operates as a kind of interesting sort of conceptual space to work out of it 's not really as practical as a user-friendly operational space and the trend of you know artists moving into inner city areas bringing the cultural diversity bringing the cultural economy and then people with wealth moving in and gentrifying those areas and pushing artists further and further out of the the inner city Barroso East London was kind of the you know the place that most artists would go and work and now people are moving further and further out source of Peckham dulwich and stratum and so it 's created this kind of this sort of cycle where you end up with the Inner City boroughs becoming like almost ports or sort of shopping centers with no real discernible cultural atmosphere at all but it 's not all bad news and actually i think what eleanii was talking about what your dream is also a program in London called new film guardians where they actually bring artists into commercial spaces to occupy those spaces to care for those spaces but also to give people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Melbourne in 1998-99 if I remember from regional Queensland and the reason that I moved to Melbourne that was because it was at that time a very you know the cultural kind of center of Melbourne I was lucky enough to get into my the Honors Program at RMIT and so that was the kind of appeal of Melbourne at that time and while I think it 's really important to think about the sort of economic gains of having a diverse and rich artistic scene it 's also important to think about how that provides opportunities for inclusion and how it improvise ways of defining what Melbourne is as a city and also in terms of the decisions that we make now will ultimately define the kind of city that melgen will be in another 10 years I 'm someone who 's actually gained a lot by living and working in Melbourne and I hope that the decisions that we make now will actually afford future generations also the ability to benefit from that for having a very diverse artistic community I think artists run spaces such as space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of keeping the inner city burrows or suburbs as vibrant dynamic culturally and critically engaged centers and I know that those spaces are now struggling with whether they 're actually going to be able to say in the in the inner city area so I do think it is a responsibility of the local governments and also federal government in terms of investing not just in art as something that has a cultural return but also an economic return and making sure that we include everybody in that process,"(-37.8146168, 144.9664898)"

dude he is a research fellow at Deakin University 's Faculty of Arts and Education he also writes for the masses or at least those of us on the 112 86 and 96 and his new Matilda 's national affairs correspondent and arts hubs industry column and columnist he freelances in about what a dozen at least other places let 's say a lot a lot of other places and is a fellow at the center for policy development Ben 's interests include culture policy and memory and one thing you may not find on his bio in fact you won 't because I read it and put it in is that he 's uncovered some awesome arts industry scandals over the years and I 've decided he is our Bob Woodward as such I have nominated his theme song as private eyes by haulin oats please welcome him because he is watching you then anthem ladies and gentlemen so any say in his wonderful book land of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fascinating passage land of plenty is his follow-up to his well-known nineties book ganglands in which he not notoriously or famously asserted that a group of baby boomers were holding back younger younger voices and younger generations from Australian culture England of plenty he describes a walk from south bank across the bridge down to Flinders Street through the alleyways I mean into the Nicholas building and he describes the shift in scale the shift in vibrancy that the shift in imagination from the rather sterile environment he describes at South Bank of all of those large cultural institutions testing grounds hadn 't got underway at that point and then the difference or the diversity the sheer energy that experienced inside the nicholas building which at the time was probably at the peak of its in cuba dettori activity of your lack and it 's one of the most interesting passages i think in that book because he uncovers a fault line between the above ground and the underground in Australian culture that is since that Mark Davis wrote that become a very obvious fault line a very important fault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon that when we address a topic like the future of art because it 's an almost impossibly nebulous idea isn 't it no one can predict the future and yet sometimes we flatter ourselves that by extrapolating from historical trends or from the evidence we see around us we can somehow predict what the future might look like I don 't think anyone could have predicted the future would look like or the president would look like the current scenario we face in federal cultural policy it 's one of the most interesting times to be an arts journalist in my career simultaneously at a time when we 've got a number of local and state governments developing really quite sophisticated cultural policies at a local government and state and territory level we 've also had one of the most dramatic retrenchments indeed austerities from the federal government in cultural policy in 40 years last Wednesday I happen to be at the first hearing of the Senate inquiry into changes in Commonwealth arts funding chaired by a noted Australian cultural figure Glenn Lazarus I think what was fascinating about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Australian art and culture are certainly a certain sector of it is it something of a crossroads speaker after speaker at those hearings described the vibrancy just how exciting Australian culture was particularly the opportunities opening up in fields that people wouldn 't have thought possible the efflorescence independent dancing Melbourne for example is something that I think a few people would have predicted 20 years ago and yet there was also overriding sense of foreboding perhaps even of crisis because of the scale the magnitude and perhaps the flow on impact of the Australia council funding cuts so i think we are at this moment at a bit of a crisis of you like at a bit of a crossroads a situation where things could go either way at the same time that we 've seen this austerity from the federal government we have as i said seeing local governments like Melbourne and indeed the City of Sydney developed some very interesting local government policies and I think it behooves us to think about the different levels that culture operates at both at a municipal level on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large institutions funded by our state 's and our federal government 's but also of course in people 's bedrooms on their computers between their heads I don 't know what the future of art in Melbourne is going to look like but I 'm entirely encouraged by the newfound organization and the the newfound voice that the art scene seems to have developed in the wake of these funding cuts from Minister Brandis it seems to me for the first time that the cultural industries in Australia are starting to employ a bit of their political muscle to try and change things on the ground for working artists and I think that 's probably a good place for me to leave off and to hear from some of the other artists that are here tonight well Wow four minutes and 51 seconds the gentleman gets surprised I have small children i am not above bribery thank you so much i 'll comment or not what you said later i 'm sure everyone 's

role she worked as a film director and scriptwriter as someone who literally create spaces for us to work in I have chosen a theme song for you eleni our little room by the white stripes in my case very very little room I think I 've stressed that already please make her welcome l any of us I 'm for any office I manage the crowd spaces program most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our website in fact most people think creative spaces is a website there are hundreds of listings of spaces that people connects us for free which they do they log on they find this phase they move in they start creating art and we pay for it so you know it has been a fantastic resource for us because obviously we understand what people are looking for how much money they can afford to pay and it informs the kind of developments we do inadvertently around 2009 the program morphed into a bit of a not-for-profit development program and we did that initially to demonstrate to the private sector what they could do with their buildings more than what council can do at the time there was lots of vacancy it was the time when people were land banking waiting for building permits to come through so we took the opportunity to develop one of our buildings short term to say you know instead of having a vacant building sitting there populated with artists for very little money and you can be great citizen you can contribute to the creative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit of an eyesore to all our Melburnians what we discovered from that project is that we did it we did it for 28 thousand dollars people artists 23 studios they went to be there for six months we 've just entered our sixth year hundreds of artists have come through established artists to great graduates from vco but the thing that we learnt from that project was the private sector wasn 't as willing to come to the table as we thought they would be they didn 't they kind of a little bit scared of talking to artists they weren 't sure how they would ask them to move out when I needed the building back so we decided to step up and take over the lease of the building refurbish it and sublet sublicense it to artists and a very first project that was mentioned before was river studios and I 'm talking quickly because I want to get to the project of the future which is situated in South Bank where all our key infrastructure is too I 'll come to that in a second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was the first time a government a local government authority leased out three thousand square meters of a vacant building took the risk of refurbishing at becoming a kind of lessee and handing that over to artists we did win an award for it you know we have artists there from established artists from people like Colin Morton and Marco for senato to graduates which also entered our six-year this this year with river but on the the back of that a few years later we were hit with the Melbourne arts precinct blueprint and affordability once again came up now the thing that always comes up with consultation as the creative convention in this axis an affordable space but the thing about the crowded spaces program is it isn 't purely about that it 's about where can we seize an opportunity to embed creativity when the opportunity presents itself so when the arts precinct blueprint came along and yeah it looks it looks fantastic this key infrastructure it 's close to the city the rivers there there 's bars there 's restaurants it was kind of interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feedback that came back from you was you know there 's no space for independent artists for smaller organizations you know the kind of fine-grained there 's no public space that we can really activate so you know we couldn 't eat a bit of thinking I went down to that neighborhood to see what was there and to our delight it was actually a thousand square meters of unoccupied retail space sitting at the bottom of a residential building hidden like from the street it doesn 't look like this this is the building that connects to it through with more street it 's basically students own right and the owner who had established it for retail space couldn 't get the commercial return that he wanted so for a year that space it 's at Mt so when we approached him to say you know could we start a conversation about activating this you know tying creating smaller practitioners in small spaces that connect with the bigger infrastructure here contribute to the precinct he was interested but he was also interested in his commercial revenue targets and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Melbourne partnered with creative Victoria we pulled some funding together and in collaboration with the owner have just managed to negotiate an amount of money that makes the vision for the site possible so we are now moving forward and I just want to briefly talk about that vision because hopefully within the next few months you will see this develop we have run in expressions of interest we have had great response I can 't were a few weeks away from actually being able to disclose who the successful tenants are because there are still boards to be notified and approvals to be made but there is a fantastic mix of small festival organizations national institutions a cafe some creative retail creative space that 's for 30 not five by the way I 've got a special ed okay and um we 're setting up an independent producers hub because we have such fantastic talent and we really want to nurture that and bring them together next to other services anyway I 'm just going to quickly run through the space public space and oh just I work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's an interior thank you and keep moving on to the fabulous Tony yup tony was born in Malaysia and he 's an accomplished dancer director choreographer and visual artist he 's one of the principal performers with IRA a theater and has worked pretty much everywhere as the founding artistic director of mixed company now Tony up company in 1993 he 's made a commitment to the exploration and creation of an individual dance theatre language that is informed by psychophysical research Asian shamanistic trance dance bhutto voice and visual design tony has received numerous nominations and awards including a green room award for best male dancer Tony received an Asia link residential grant to work in Indonesia in 2005 and in 2008 he received a prestigious two-year dance fellowship from the Australia Council he 's the founding director of Malacca arts and performance festival he is of course as you would have just heard a wicked under achievable underachiever I 'm thinking possibly a workaholic so I 'm giving him the same song he works hard for the money by Donna Summer please welcome Tony up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've written something and I 've time it is exactly five minutes well I wanted to introduce a malaka specifies as a model that that we actually recently started that we didn 't know where it 's going to go except that you was inspired by a trip that I went during my Asia link residency and also research into trance practices in Asia and how that affect my work as a contemporary performer and in that process I see a lot independent artists in the region trying to just express and make work and they are amazing rare voices that comes from very traditional very excite our our postmodern urban area and I and I thought about that background that I came from and how the connection came back and so milaca festival started when I was just talking to happen to talk to a manager or a event management company in Malaysia and we 're just talking in Malacca and said maybe we should start a facility being that at that time the UNESCO has given malaika the Heritage status which means that you know it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are just going to go hand in hand and and try to match that crazy which actually happened there were seven years ago so so we started with the idea that we have platforms for these artists this in the independent artists everywhere that actually do not have a space to go to like like if unless you belong to a company you know you probably don 't have a platform like that and and it is a simple site specific kind of idea that actually grew and what it is at the moment is the last festival we had we had 65 artists from all around the world and it 's also a corridor for love Australian artists so it became a festival where where we don 't bring people in for an idea but it actually grew out and so actually like a festival for actors and performers and artists to travel into Asia to the spots where they can perform so it 's so much more also for the artists as it is it is for for the audience and the audience is everybody 's free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sit down and I hear a lady said you know a man who say are you are you in the festivities yes i 'm in the festival is it i watch it every year and it 's amazing I 've never seen anything like that in my life and and they are the people who actually wouldn 't go to to all these prisons that we have so available because they are like like our people who so we bring the art to them and and and we get amazing responses and so we also challenges the artists to think about accessibility and to think about what their or hoodia audiences are beyond beyond what what they already practice and so that 'sthat a great challenge and I think that 's what to me Melbourne is for me and also what I bring to melbourne in a sense of my my background in this bridge between these two areas so malacca festival we have shamans with bullwhips performing with a soprano opera singer from Brisbane and we have you know hip-hop dancer with a contemporary belly to the quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a it 's a really interesting collaborative area soda it came up by itself and so now we actually have created sister festivals in Indonesia any Melbourne become mapping Melbourne which is run on a budget of five thousand dollars and we have 17 artists performing all paid and and also Delhi this year in mapping Delhi which we will be starting and so is now it 's becoming a kind of interesting observation of how things evolve rather than we put an idea on to what things should be so is it is inclusive it is it is you know it is a mixed pot by at the same time it has an integrity it 's not like a like a chaotic place and I think that is because of the integrity of the artists who come to the to the area who want to to work and so molecular thank you very much you,"(-37.8146168, 144.9664898)"

acting freely unhindered and at arm 's length from ad-hoc political interference at the city of Melbourne we do strongly believe that the creative freedom of the artists is fundamental to a flourishing and vibrant arts ecology it 's undoubtedly a difficult time for the arts sector with both the aggressive Brandes cuts and also with changes within the state government 's funding structures the future is unclear but there is hope at a time where things are a little on edge it is more crucial than ever that the city of Melbourne continues to support and work with artists and the arts sector I 'm not here to overstate political positions on the current state of play but I can say that we are in support of artists having more opportunities for support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expense of the Australia Council and the opportunities that they afford to artists and the sector particularly through small to medium organisations although the city of Melbourne can 't pick up the federal government shortfall you can rest assured we continue to believe in direct support to artists to create we have made it our mission that Melbourne arts has a diverse and confident future artists are integral to this city imagine Melbourne without artists and without art and what a desolate place that would be the arts play a special role in the success of any city and in ours more than most as artists we know the unique challenges we face in making our innermost personal creativity for audiences to watch interpret critique or enjoy we consistently put ourselves on display to tell our stories to the world whether it is through a play a script piece of music sculpture or painting the unpredictability of funding bodies and government support only adds to the challenge especially in times of such rapid growth and change but it is the artists who are the storytellers of our city their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead us to places we have never been their creations encourage us to ask questions evoke opinions and instill in us and need to explore ideas further artists allow us to see ourselves and our own community through a different lens and it 's the artist who gives us narratives with moral emotional and spiritual meanings that allow us to understand and keep us believing and enjoying life all of these things are what makes the act of creation so invigorating and rewarding but also why the arts community means firm commitments of support from government through infrastructure funding and policy government cannot discount the power of the artist government inevitably must however indicate how much it will support the city 's creative soul and that is measured by the extent to which it supports its artists as you would all be aware the city of Melbourne works to support artists by providing space to create spaces to present and funding in the form of residences grants partnerships and emissions we produce and program throughout the city and run a number of arts events and festivals our arts programs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program to art play Australia 's only Art Centre for children to arts house a program of cutting-edge experimental contemporary practice to the management and programming of the Town Hall grand organ and a collection of over 8,000 objects in our arts and heritage collection we 've established creative spaces for writers artists and arts organisations to be located in the city for example the meat market has been established as a standalone venue for hire the creative spaces program brokers and creates affordable studio spaces for artists across the city the Dirty Dozen exhibition spaces are offered free of charge to artists and arts house offers development space for performance artists and we continue to advocate for affordable and secure work and living spaces for the pursuit of creativity tonight 's forum is one of the many outcomes of the city of Melbourne 's art strategy and an indication to you the creative sector that we want to hear your thoughts and that this is an ongoing conversation between you and us the forum is a culmination of a series of roundtable discussions with the sector hosted by Timothy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accessibility infrastructure and creativity these lively forums were held throughout the city and they were fascinating we discussed concepts of what it means for the city to stay current and innovative to keep thinking and redefining what creativity looks like one forum discussed the serious danger that the creative community may be pushed out of Melbourne if it becomes less affordable and we delved into the disastrous effects that this would have on our city you shared your views on how the city needs to continue to show leadership by setting high standards and practice what we are advocating for we are practicing tonight with you and I thank you for being part of this conversation so tonight we are looking to you to comment a question and perhaps to debate to help our understanding of the issues opportunities and challenges the sector faces and help advance our contributions to the Arts in Melbourne we are fortunate to have writer journalist and research at been elfin writer and director Fiona to me visual artist Christian Thompson and dancer and choreographer Tony Yap alongside arts Mel burns creative spaces

everyone and within those behavioral change programs we also recognize that we need to make sure where you speak to people with different languages and different cultures within our community some of our hopefully diverse community members have limited access to transport don 't necessarily feel that they understand our the city works or how to get around and the goodwill project has provided them with a bicycle the skills and the knowledge to ride that bike in our community and that has given them and a great sense the google project has been founded and initiated by the city of Melbourne and where 's the squeaky wheel we 're boarding it to devise a program and we 've worked with good cycles the social enterprise aims a refugee placement agency we 've also worked with people here at the huddle and lots of volunteers as well and people from the community who 've helped out getting people onto their bikes helping us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us through the city of Melbourne there or abandoned bikes that have been left for various amounts of times we restore them and rebuild them and then size them up and get them picked out for the participants huddle are around different sport and recreation programs for young people from various backgrounds so to get involved with the good wheel we thought was a really positive experience for some of these students who either may have never ridden a bike before or if they have they don 't have the ability to go out and get their own bikes as a partner of the good wheel project our main objective is to address some of the social and emotional issues our silencing of clients face cycling enables people to become independent and self-reliant which is so important for our clients health and well-being some young people never have the opportunity to get to know how to ride a bike to go out in a group to actually write on the road and certainly by the end of the four weeks to six week course they 're there confidently riding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with other people as part of a group when they go on the ride and I think it just helps them to grow not only in confidence but in skills when they 're out and about about public safety and just about their perception because we do teach them to know about their surroundings how an environment can actually change and it just makes them more aware of that their own personal safety and security as well anyone having access to a safe space which teaches them more confidently how to use cycle is really beneficial I think by and large people are scared of cycling and scared of cycling on the road and to have a space that actually teaches you how to do that safely and at your own pace these are the sorts of skills that you can use for the rest of your life i joined the good workers as i was going to be fun and we read faces and i was really interesting i learn new things many people i really want to learn the rules and how to get around places one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you learn how to ride a bike properly in the road safely now know how to do indicator is can even um look left right two of 10 the thing that I really love about the google project is that it provides a really safe space for our clients to learn road safety real rules and build confidence it 's a great opportunity and for people to engage with other community members other participants and also a really good opportunity to practice their english we 've been coming down interacting with them talking with them about road safety about security of their bikes and just so they can get to know police officers are approachable and we 're there to certainly help them just amazing how much they 've improved in confidence and have actually been encouraging each other as well so it 's been a really positive experience not only from the teachers if those other people here to support them but how they 've actually encouraged each other teacher Sarah good people so every time you don 't know something you just go and ask them on them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to me so I just go to them and us so they really helpful for us this brother I really love young people feeling feeling safe and confident to us you know what what is this part of the bike called or how would I fix this to have a space where those kids can kind of come and cycle and engage with mechanics and engage with their bikes I think is great and certainly having those conversations with young women is just is really powerful and indeed with with young people the most thing I enjoy it is like meeting new people lately haven 't seen before I need new friends and have fun and also getting a free bag giving a child a bike her to cycle on and giving a child locks and and lights is definitely going to have a long-term impact on how they cycle and how often they say I think there 's so many ways which is likely can benefit individuals and with projects like the wheel it sort of provides a step into accessing all of those things which are ultimately beneficial for everyone you,"(-37.8146168, 144.9664898)"

burgeoning population increase and that brings with it much much higher demand for more services and greater use of the public room that we manage the city of Melbourne is engaging its community through multiple ways as part of the ten-year financial plan what 's happening behind me is workshop we 've got people here from community organizations special interest groups like residents associations we 're out in the community in mobile way with eight pop-up events one of the easiest ways we engage people is through this bright yellow Caravan we 've collected over 45 hours of feedback from people the conversations with we 're having are not one word answers they 're really in depth and thought out responses diversity is a strength of a good quality community engagement program we also have a number of smaller discussion groups our indigenous elders and some of our senior citizens for example and for those people who really like to engage online we are using our online engagement to all participate melbourne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a community report and that report goes to the people 's panel democracy is the lifeblood of a fair and transparent and prosperous civic society and so we wanted to embrace this notion of participatory budgeting panel is a unique exercise for the city of Melbourne where we asked about 7,000 people whether they 'd like to get involved several hundred came back saying yes they 'd be interested and then they were randomly selected from that half from a residential background half from a business background and they are people who have agreed to invest maybe 50 hours of their time to give us unique advice on our first ever 10-year financial plan we wanted to hear from the silent majority from the ordinary busy people who wouldn 't normally take the time to engage in a council process this projects iconic because firstly it 's a city of the status of Melbourne and secondly it 's being done with a randomly selected group with a jury it 's normally being done just with self-selected people that come to various town hall meetings but this is a representative group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's view from a planning point of view I expect this process will give us some clarity around direction and clarity of intent about whether the path that we 've chosen to go on in addressing those challenges is the correct path an entire budget a 400 million dollar annual budget was put on the table for citizens and we had a very clear commitment from the lord mayor and the council is that any information this jury of everyday people requested they get the only way that we can really make those very important big decisions is to bring the community with us my name is Jared Kelly I 'm John Bailey my name is Pam being hearty I 'm Linda I 'm the owner of three hospitality venues in the city square with my brother i 'm working the city and i live in the area darren i work in the financial sector and i work in the city by a resident here in the city of Melbourne I also go to uni here and I rediscovered the city as a new mom this year to the experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where we were given a huge amount of information that we needed to digest and then somehow synthesize those various ideas together into some very basic elementary recommendations so the first session particular today starts the deep dive of information where we want to give you as much information as possible that community actually comes together in the city of Melbourne it 's a melting pot if you like the ratio of residents to workers is going to stay pretty much the same both are going to grow there are two things that we have to do we have to adapt to the fact that the climate has changed and these are going to continue to change the way northern melburnians live is fundamentally changing we were a suburban people for a hundred years now there has been a complete turnaround with that embrace of inner city urban grungy lifestyles apartment you if you like there was definitely some very heated moments in the people 's panel especially in the last two weekends when we had to get to a consensus and there was a lot of deliberation and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a jury of everyday citizens citizens not up for reelection citizens with no reason to take a public position that can deliver a solution that becomes much more politically achievable could you teach our capital works for me a little more so I 'm not quite sure what you mean by reducing it by ten percent I think that this was rather than of the other main levers other than rates that we were looking at to try to find some funding did the panel attempt at any stage to prioritize within that full gamut of what makes up capital works what councils priority should be the sustainability and environmental friendliness of the current spaces that you have is a definite priority besides focusing on the reeds did the panel think about other levers no they there was a lot of time actually spent discussing ideas that were raised about other revenue initiatives if there 's one thing in there you want us to do what is it what the panel recommended would be one of the best things that 's come out of this is that the council 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the community because I think it was a very good cross-section knowing that I 'm helping to build something better and for the future was something that was worthwhile I 'm really happy that the whole program of community engagement that we have had at the city of Melbourne for many years now has been confirmed that if you ask people to participate if you create the opportunities for them to do it if you inform them they will be able to help us with the really big challenges that we have to address as a city we 've got to make those changes with the community on board otherwise we 're not going to be able to make those changes at all you have truly given us your own agenda and that in itself is a room both accomplishment and an extremely useful document thank you","(-37.8146168, 144.9664898)"

Melbourne,YFxP4baVhH4,20140606,3250.96,"120 Swanston St, Melbourne VIC 3000, Australia",9993,okay my name is andrew wisdom i 'm the moderator for this experiment i guess is it an experiment i don 't know we 'll see how we go it 'll be great what we 're trying to achieve today is just to explore what it 's like in a heat wave in 2025 but first thing i want to do is to acknowledge that we 're meeting on the lands of the coolan nations and pay my respect to their elders past and present important we do that whenever we meet in melbourne so we 've got a big panel here the panelists are drawn from all sorts of uh different parts of the world different kinds of experience levels of expertise and so on and so forth some some of them are playing themselves as you 'll discover as we go through some of them are playing characters that are not themselves so it 's january 25 we have to start putting ourselves into that space right now in 2025 we 're in the middle of an el nino five years it 's been running and the bureau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major heat wave heating straight towards us and so we 're preparing what 's it like in 2025 well for a start it 's hotter so the bureau of meteorology have has done a range it looks at a range of forecasts this is a forecast they 've made for january 21 2025 yellow is warm orange is very hot red is forget about it very hot and you can see there 's a little blob just over the top of melbourne just to the north of melbourne day one we 're off it 's 20 25. we 're heading towards a maximum 42.8 after a cool 18.3 not too bad anything under 20 i think i can sleep pretty well so it 's clear and hot not a breath of wind blowing dead still so cathy oak premier victoria it 's a challenging time six days in a row over 40 is being forecast um it 's gonna be a real test of the resilience of our systems and of our community and so on and so forth what do you see as the big challenges for us well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have experienced many days of heat this summer but we 're as the bureau has just predicted and we 're about to experience a lot more and they 're going to be a lot hotter we have enacted our emergency management systems we 've coordinated or brought together under the emergency management victoria um controlling body who looks after all of our emergency services they will be in charge of the operation that the operations that may unfold over the next few days it 's really important that over the last 10 years we 've been collaborating with local government with the community sector with individuals to create our own individual resilience plans people should know what to do in a heatwave community should know local government should know and hopefully a lot of that research that work the engagement plans that we 've got in place will will unfold and as a state we should get through this next 10 days so you 're relying you 're relying on a community that is well informed motivated to look after themselves that 's right that 's a key plank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the carlton neighbourhood learning centre and he lives with his elderly mother in a public housing lock okay so the red cross is phoning at risk residents three times a day to check they 're all right okay so that 's a bit of support that 's there and there are extended openings at some government facilities the carlton heat app tells people where it 's hot so we 've got an app that tells us what the temperature is like what 's it like for you what how are people responding to the premier 's drive for personal responsibility and so on oh look we we do what we can um the uh the app i think in terms of where the hotspots are it 's probably um got my place mentioned right on it because it 's bloody hot at my place it 's you know incredibly warm we don 't really listen to the government warnings all that much we just sort of stick together as a community as a family we do what we can we try to stay hydrated and drink a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together as a community and give each other you know look after each other 's kids if someone needs to go to the beach during the day we 'll help each other out and um it 's it 's difficult but we 're getting through and the main thing i 'm worried about is my mum because she 's 80 and um you know it 's really hot and we we nearly lost it last summer so and my wife and i both work so we 're not home during the day and i don 't know what 's going to happen if i come home one day and she hasn 't had that phone call from the red cross okay so you 're okay you 've got a nice community what about you joel joel 's homeless mother she has a three-month-old baby you 've worked in the past with the not working moment tell us about how you cope with today so i do have a three-month-old baby we are homeless so we usually go to shopping centers during the day or we go to the park or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation i 'm i really fear for the safety of my three-month-old because as we know the elderly and and and infants are more prone to heat stress than anyone else so i am really scared and i do fear for my child so what are you gonna do today what 's what 's what are we gonna do today it 's gonna be 42.8 today three o 'clock um i think we might go to the local shopping centre where it 's nice and cool um and if we can maybe to a swimming pool and spend as much time as we can there because um we don 't know where we 're gonna go when it when closing uh when when business hours are over yeah right so premier is it possible that uh the swimming pools could be left open kept open until i don 't know midnight or something like that is that possible oh absolutely as we 've developed we 've worked with um councils across the state um and when we first started experiencing long heat waves you know 10 15 years ago local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's needs for um free access to places like swimming pools and creating spaces that are free to be that are cool and welcoming and so that all of the community can feel safe okay martin dutch doctor in the emergency department at royal melbourne hospital years of experience you 've seen this before right tell us about what do you expect so what we can normally sort of expect so we often have heat waves um what we know is that uh sort of it 's not just the community that heats up it 's the health care service that heats up during a heat wave there 's a structured plan for responding to heat waves in victoria so we know that that basically we can expect to see substantially more workload across the healthcare system when the average temperature increases to about 30 degrees and our first day of the heatwave is the first day that we start seeing more work and it 's not just emergency apartments it 's ambulances it 's general practitioners it 's the coroner 's office it 's birth deaths and marriages recording @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documented there 's there we 'll expect to see more people pass away during a heat wave than what we 'd do uh in another year at the same time of the year and mainly that increased mortality or increased number of deaths almost solely occurs in people over 75 so while lots of people are concerned about young people that the sort of stats and the evidence would suggest to us that it 's the elderly people who are in really significant trouble certainly after 65 years of age but certainly after 75 is when the mortality really increases in that group and the interesting thing uh looking uh looking forward or looking back the 2025 number we 'd be expecting to see double the number of people over 85 years of age than what we have in the current year and we 'd be expecting to see substantial increases sort of 80 increase in in people age 65 so as a proportion of the population our at-risk group is increasing and uh and it 's part of the risk to do with the fact that they 're isolated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that determine overall population health but certainly i think there 's a trend towards increasing social isolation we know that um that during previous heatwaves up to 30 percent of people over 75 years of age have no other contact with another person during that heat wave not a telephone call not a friend or a relative who drops in they sit there in their hot house isolated alone for the duration of the heat wave okay thanks martin so mary faro you are a resident of emerald you 've been given a stay ago advice four times in the last six weeks okay so this isn 't an isolated event four times in the last six weeks residents in the period area have had to decide whether to stay or go right oh okay so tell us what you do when that happens well we 've been listening to the fire fire messages it 's been 10 years and it 's finally getting into our head and i want to know hands up who 's going to be putting us up because we 're coming to your town we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because we 're leaving early so we will be swinging by to pick you up you 'll have to give us your address because we 're going to camp out on the river because and we 're not expecting to be asked to move along because we 're doing the right thing we 're leaving early our power has gone off in the hills because that 's what happens when we have um heat and who can blame sb oznet for turning the power off it causes fires and it then causes lawsuits i 'm from california i know how that works so we have to be careful with that but we understand we have to leave our phones don 't work our messaging is not working the uh towers aren 't working because the the the battery has run out the backup battery so we have to come to town okay ariel 's a researcher at monash university on on how do we describe it actually i 'll give you a full title senior research fellow and director of carbon and energy programs at the monash faculty of information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's 20 25 now how 's it different now from how it was 10 years ago do people have their own sources of power do they have is battery technology there to allow people to keep on operating even when the power goes off and so on and so forth yeah so the short answer is yes luckily for the last 11 years people like terry and his company and the premier and all her colleagues at the other states and the federal government have been working together with the assistance of some independent advice from the universities to try and understand how better to set up the rules of the energy game to make sure that the best technologies the most economically efficient technologies come to the fore that means batteries where their economic will be adopted by people because partly because they think it 's a good idea but partly because it 's affordable in combination with solar and other generation technologies maybe even little wind turbines on top of every house or in every yard radio that 's the end of day one pretty good okay we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two maximum 41.7 minimum over after an overnight 28.6 what a shocking night okay so the fire commissioners warned us about extreme risk of grass fires and bushfires coming up so claire claire johnson 's a new docklands resident her husband looks after their baby daughter in her apartment in their apartment on the level 20 of their nice shiny new docklands tower so analysis from monash university shows that not all parts of the city are equally at risk some parts of the city get hotter than other parts what are the advantages what are the natural advantages for docklands in this sort of situation well of course the reason i bought there in the first place is because i have a north-facing waterfront apartment and um whilst i 'll be working for the rest of my life to pay it off i do have a lovely view and i do capture the ocean breeze and uh and so for me that 's a lovely part of the reason why i live where i live and i also find that it makes me use less of my cooling and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my windows open and has secured that nice breeze coming through okay so that 's one of the good things about docklands so martin was saying before about the effect of isolation and that certainly was the result of research certainly in chicago isolated people tell us about isolation in docklands well it 's funny because you can be on your own or you can be in a community of you know 15 000 people so where i live at victoria harbour i live in a 530 unit building and some on the 20th floor and i have at least 12 apartments on my floor and so i can not see anybody for days or i can see anybody i want to and i 'm lucky that we do at docklands have the community forum so we have quite a tight-knit group of people of course there is a substantial population down there and people like the anonymity but people also like to be part of a community so it is um it is a choice that you make but there are all sorts of problems when situations emerge and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building okay so um ian shares uh manager urban landscape city of melbourne you 're responsible for the um for the uh urban forest just tell us about first of all just tell us about the urban forest and tell us about the its impact on the urban heat island effect well the urban forest is is is something that has been recognized as as being incredibly important for the city and and you know earlier the millennium drought and other heat waves sort of you know enabled council to recognise that responding to these challenges working with nature rather than against it was a really smart thing to do we 've worked out that trees are incredibly effective air conditioners for example and that having really good tree canopy cover in combination with open space and permeability is is a significant way to to reduce urban temperatures so the city council in conjunction with a forward-thinking state government has has worked with surrounding councils to establish a series of of cool parkways throughout the city and and probably the the jewel and the crown of that is the elizabeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually removed all of the asheville we 've daylighted the creek and so we 've got a wonderful linear space that that is cooler by you know up to 10 degrees than surrounding areas so when we have our how we welcome our country cousins down to the city to spend time we 've got a space that 's cool that 's nice that 's inviting and it 's a it 's a communal space so people don 't need to feel isolated in their apartment buildings they can come out and and then the recognition of the open space strategy we 've got a cool space within 300 metres walking distance of everybody throughout the city so it 's a it 's a fundamentally important green infrastructure approach that it recognizes the environmental service benefits of of what nature can do and uses that to respond to the heat island so how many degrees difference does it make you got any idea of what you know what the temperature would be out in the asphalt versus underneath in this elizabeth street look a minute you know we we put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting the data right and our thermal imagery indicates that beneath the shade of a of a healthy tree that 's transpiring well it 's half that about in out in the asphalt and and you know and and further to that the cities recognize the dark black asphalt absorbs a lot of heat during the day so we put a lot of research and development into much cooler colors so that we 're not sheeting blackness everywhere where we 're actually putting a lot sort of you know better albedo effect and reducing it so it 's not only the the grey infrastructure the green infrastructure is all working towards reducing urban temperatures and you know responding to the health and well-being of the community i love i i you know one of my favorite places now is that elizabeth street creek remember when the trams used to run down there no lovely creek trees growing over so we 've been in drought for five years right so has that had an impact on how the the urban forest has been developing look and and certainly the water 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want and for and for the transpiration and we recognize that the cooling is is a much uh you know an effect of the evaporation the transpiration that that is part of that natural forest process but like like natural like natural forests we 've recognized that that we need rainfall and we need to actually grab hold of that rainfall when it falls so we 're moving away from that past practice of rainfall falling onto an asphalt or paved surface going to a pipe and being pumped out into the bay we know that more rain falls on greater melbourne than is used by melbourne 's throughout the year so we 've moved away significantly from that reliance on potable water from our dam storage and we 're now using stormwater harvesting systems to capture the water clean it and have it available throughout our urban spaces so two young children die in a car in a car park they are locked in there while the parent was inside shopping it 's such a stupid thing to do right but people stand to panic now like things are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now how can you calm people down and tell them to reinforce that idea of self responsibility and so on and so forth yeah obviously it 's incredibly sad that these two children have died and unfortunately unfortunately every year that we have a heat wave there are these deaths and unfortunately they do seem to still occur but i believe that we 've done a lot better in our engagement processes with the community and acknowledging that there is an individual role a community role and a government role to play in in managing our our response to heatwave i know that um that the state is sweltering right now and that we are at buckling point we 've been in this heatwave for a few days now but the emergency emergency management victoria is coordinating our response incredibly well our the office of living victoria is managing our how we 're offering how we 're managing our water resources and our transport facilities whilst they are at stress we have invested a lot of money in the infrastructure and we 've invested a lot of money in making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'd like to stress that the state um is with the community um but to follow the community our individual and our community heat response action plans would be a great way of of making sure that we 're all working together and coping in this heap okay well my comment is i 've i have a three-year-old and she 's in child care all day every day because i 'm working so hard to pay for my apartment and what i 'm interested to know is we talk about old people and people who are of disability or who have housing issues what about children and how are we going to help our children and our child care centers for all those people who are working and traveling is what i 'm interested in i 'd like to at this moment thank all of our schools and our child care providers for their assistance in managing um our city in this in the in the heatwave um we have contributed through our community facility facility funding program money to many child care facilities across the state to cope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of money in schools um to design them so that they 're cooler with ventilation and and the buildings are not as hot as they used to be and and a lot of those buildings are coming into play and hopefully your child 's um childcare center has been a recipient of one of these grants well i think actually the issue is that um when everything gets too hot in the generator is shut down we 're asked to keep the children at home and so the issue doesn 't really get resolved and so you know i 'm interested in making sure that our plans address those issues and so that we keep those institutions open for for children who may not otherwise have air conditioning units it 's day two everything 's kind of under control still it 's okay martin i 'm glad that everything 's under control for for you guys but i 'm working in a busy emergency department i can tell you things are almost never fully under control so so just to give you a feel for for it day two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was was busy and and we were seeing perhaps 12 to 20 more patients than what we normally see in in hospitals that are designed to to sort of normally run at 100 capacity um today is even busier than than yesterday because every day that you 're exposed to heat from it from a health point of view it 's not just about how hot it is it 's about how long you 're exposed to it and this is yet another shocking day on the back of the day before um fortunately i 'm i 'm very happy that that about 15 years ago the government decided that it would start purchasing hotels next to every public hospital with the idea that they run sort of for-profit to offset the hospital commercially but at the same time they could be used for for discharging members of the public who didn 't need health care but needed sort of air conditioning and social infrastructure because the the problem was in the early 2000s every time they had a hospital a heat wave the hospital would fill up with elderly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there was no safe place to send them to because their house didn 't have an air conditioner and so they would sit round in a cute hospital bed back then it was about 500 a day costing the taxpayers um now you know it 's probably fifteen hundred dollars a day costing the taxpayers um now we 've got a we 've got a more appropriate temporary piece of accommodation until this heat wave breaks to shift people out of public hospitals as a discharge destination so that 's working well for us sounds like a really great investment that 's good now it 's day three day three maximum 43 day three 43 degrees after an overnight low of 27 another stinking hot night followed by a stinking hot day and what happens terry jones sp osnet after a few days tell us what happens after a few days of super hot temperature yeah so our job in the network is to keep supplies on for lights and more importantly air conditioners so by day three we 've got our integrated plans for bushfire and heatwave responses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the emergency council response organization and we review at least twice a day what we 've done in the day and what we 're going to do the next day so day three things are warming up our big problem is heat in the cables in the assets the transformers and when they start to get warm we start to have problems so the key response to that that we have is demand management so we 've already issued three critical peak price days which encourage encourages commercial and industrial customers to reduce demand which allows the cables to run cooler we 've probably got about 50 to 100 megawatts of demand reductions from the cpd calls and we also have on standby another 50 to 100 megawatts of demand management on one on one calls so we can actually target where we achieve the demand reduction and that could be a building that could be a chocolate factory wherever in the network that we find things are getting hot on our assets we can actually target further peak demand so day three we 're still cruising everything 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not true because and i 'll just as i tell you that i 'll do this sorry there you go that 's not true because actually you start shedding load on day three you thought it was okay when you got up this morning it was a bright sunny day right you 've got air conditioning so you didn 't care you woke up you 're eating your cornflakes out on the balcony birds were chirping then you got the call saying we are rooted yes we 're gonna have to start load right now what does shedding load actually mean yes well that could probably be caused by a failure of an asset like for example or a cable with an unforeseen fault on it that goes out of service brilliant that 's what happened so in those circumstances first option is switching around the problem so we have a automated distribution feeder response where automatically within a certain number of minutes the feeder will find another route for the electricity around the network and typically in a city like this it 's a highly interconnected network with many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next response is we 've already stopped planned maintenance we don 't do any work on the system so we have crews ready to do repairs nobody 's working on the system at all we 've got crews ready emergency response they go in isolate the problem and start to fix it third level of response if we 're into emergency type supplies hospitals police stations public services they already have their own generation in many cases so they can start up their own generation and run probably for three or four hours we ourselves have our own generation on 20-foot trailers that we can mobilize and put into a problem area so third day everything 's cool if we have a bad event or an asset failure we can still respond and keep the lights on whether we can keep the air conditioning on is a match of how much demand is created by that air conditioning okay so wouldn 't you know it everything goes wrong you are shedding load now what is shedding how does shedding load actually work stop you know obfuscating tell us about shedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pre-programmed rolling cycle across different feeders within the city it would deal with non-essential loads first and we have all those scheduled we would not touch essential loads so probably a building would go out for a day another building would go out for the next day so it would be part of our emergency response planning that we have the scheduled running load reduction okay useful okay so luckily martin you work at royal melbourne one of those essential services that is not affected by a rolling thing you want to just tell us about how secure you feel with your power i want to make it real what load shedding means if you get residential load shedding what that means is that you can 't run your air conditioner and we know that if you we know an air conditioner reduces the likelihood that you 'll die from heat related illness by 70 and so when they 've done population studies where they 've talked about load shedding and the health impact we expect to see a 50 increase in the number of people who die in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ load shedding means people will die and that 's a balance that you make about a small group of people in an isolated geographic area being exposed to that increased risk versus the whole state falling over so so that 's the reality that the second the second reality is that you know my hospital is not an island my hospital relies on all of the same infrastructure that the rest of the community does now sure we have some very special uh you know wires that run into our place that are a little bit isolated from from others but certainly you know it 's my experience that i 'm aware of multiple hospitals in in metropolitan male melbourne that have had to evacuate because not only has their their normal electrical infrastructure off the grid failed but concurrently their internal hospital backup generation has failed and and that 's happened you know in the 2000s um in in at least two hospitals that i 'm aware of and i 'm also aware that that even brand new hospitals that are recently built sometimes their internal uh power infrastructure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can fall over as well so tell us um tony murphy fire what 's what 's your title hang on what are you your deputy fire commissioner tell us about um the risk to drinking water supplies from fires in catchment areas for reservoirs well there 's definitely a consideration to you know ensuring the you know the risk and consequence that goes with any fire you know in the catchment or beyond the catchment where you 've got rivers you know like such as the big rivers um around in the hume area where which feeds um you know our supply chain to reservoirs but because we 've been very effective and very efficient with our burn our planned burns programs they 've been very much based around risk and also community protection we 've reduced the risk significantly we 've also got technology that will immediately identify through satellite and also through through other infrared technology where we 've got fire in the landscape and make sure that we 're immediately on there with a very very rapid attack okay so dean now things are getting pretty crappy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an ac right so you have to go and stay with some neighbors to do that so people are out on the streets the whole time it 's 27 minimum overnight right it 's a hot day in the middle of the night so people are getting pretty grumpy and crabby now so street violence is starting to break out uh problems with drug use on the streets it 's not really a safe place to be tell us how you cope with that well what we do depending on early in the evening if it 's you know we 've got no air conditioner and the place is unbearably hot if the power is still on at northland we 'll go to the movies so we 'll spend time there out of the house and go and see the lego movie three that 's coming out at that time um geez it 's pretty slow yeah um and then we would gather together a few families and with no power we 'd just head to the beach and just spend the night at the beach and actually make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rely on our own resources try and find some food and make a bit of a night of it take mom with us and actually just left your numbers good yeah and just go to the beach and actually try and have a sort of turn turn the adversity into something where we can actually build the community what about you joel i just hear chaos and being homeless and being in the homeless community i know that there 's 22 000 people homeless in victoria on any given night and a thousand of those um over a thousand sleep rough so they 're sleeping on the streets um being homeless also includes people sleeping outside or in improv impoverished dwellings sleeping temporarily with friends or relatives staying in boarding houses staying in government funding crisis or temporary accommodation and living in severely crowded dwellings now people living in those sort of conditions we 're the local community we 're a big part of the local community 22 000 people in in victoria just victoria so it 's chaos we are losing it we don 't know we 're scared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of kids as well that are homeless with their mums and with their families what do we do what do we do okay martin you want to say something i would i would just like to say that uh society gets a bum rap during uh disasters and crises in terms of how we cope in fact like you read the newspapers and stuff and everyone says oh everyone there 's panic on the street and everyone 's murdering everyone and rolling everyone for everyone 's pension check just doesn 't happen it 's it 's it 's media legend that 's that 's promulgated because it gets front page news most of the time most communities any time in history or actually act resiliently in the vast majority of times so so well so so my recommendation to my patients that throw flow through my my front door and stop reading the newspaper um and don 't listen to sensationalist stuff um the other the other thing just about the homeless people they 're a good example of the people that that in the early 2000s we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their intercurrent stressor which in in this case is a heat wave um certainly back then accommodation options christ accommodation overflowing ridiculously over capacity and uh and these people would either take up literally in in camp in our waiting room or alternatively uh be taking up a acute care hospital bed uh which is a precious commodity back then and and still i expect now yeah okay that 's the end of this day so things are starting to get a little bit you know tougher right on to day four now okay another really hot stinking night 25.6 degrees overnight 43.5 degrees maximum on day four really tough so premier i open up with you again i 'm sorry giving you well you know you get paid the big bucks so public transport we haven 't talked about that much yet it 's getting more erratic now trains are running on a reduced schedule of course they are because you know for a bunch of them their ac doesn 't work anymore power lines starting to to sag a little bit and so on and so forth there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 10 years ago after after we had those pictures of people watering the railway tracks in the middle of a heat wave pretty scary thought anyway so that 's pretty bad so things are you know we 're running about 75 but then disaster strikes a transmission station in south marine explodes at 2 pm and power to the city loop is lost trains are and passengers on the trains are marooned in the middle of the city loop there is no evening rail service there 's no rail service for the rest of the day buses are put in as well as the rail problems that extensive amount of heat in the some roads are affected by continuous heat and the top surface of the road just gets rolled up on the wheels so that 's happening all the way across melbourne you have to close roads now so now there are traffic jams everywhere over to you i 'd first like to thank the emergency services for getting the people out of the loop and and thankfully um no one was hurt um i acknowledge that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for for assisting their their neighbors getting up through that system um and of course we have implemented many things to uh to make our transport network a lot better but it is um under stress right now and um we 'll get through today um and this evening we asked um where there is space available in our hotels where there is space in the community facilities where individuals can help their friends or relatives as they are stuck in the city this evening we ask that they they do what they can tomorrow i would ask that all employers enact their their heatwave response plan which means that a lot of their employers will need to work from home if possible or from one of these community hubs with a lot of calling if they can 't work at home due to the heat but we 'll need to make sure that the roads are clear not only for replacement buses for for priority transport but also for the roads for our emergency services and our emergency vehicles so we will be implementing a ban on cars except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priority needs so you 're establishing some clear arterial roads that are available for uh critical movement okay that 's really good so um turning to you gary stickland how can you help uh i was feeling pretty comfortable on days one two and three but i 'm starting to get a bit worried now um and so all my great plans have sort of gone out the window to a degree but a couple of things have happened just to set the scene for the tourism and hospitality industry we 've got a little bit smarter a number of facilities or particularly hotels have rooftop gardens which are somewhat self-sufficient so we 're able to grow some of our own food particularly vegetables that time of year is one of our busiest times it 's where our international visitors are probably in their greatest numbers coming into the city particularly talking about the australian open tennis period in january um the grand prix has moved on but uh our major events department has uh been particularly good and they 've actually got the tour de france to come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the city at the same time so the capacity uh of hotels uh might be quite restricted um so we want to be good community citizens we we 're going to have a six day earth hour event but sb osnet has made sure that they 're not sure but not without them trying to do it we don 't really have a supply to really worry about that much so we 've got a few challenges going on what we what we would do though there is within the cbd of melbourne there 's certainly a restriction on supply of accommodation but in the inner uh suburban areas number of motels that generally aren 't as highly occupied so we 'd be calling on those members to to do what they can to assist on any given day 20 of hotel rooms in melbourne are probably vacant so there 's capacity there to take up some of those areas maybe it 's assisting with um housing from a hospital point of view so there is that out not outsourcing but outpatient type care we have events and function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this that is probably being pulled through a central cooling system already in place assuming we 've got enough power to do that it can house people accommodate people temporarily possibly some of our homeless community and other people have come in from from regional areas as well so there 's a few things we could do so joel and mary would you you know if would you take up that offer would you go and and um spend a couple of hours chilling out at the alto on burke we might do a little bit of time share there and kind of swap it around to get through the whole community what about you joel would you take up his opportunity his offer yeah definitely i think it 's a really good idea um and i think we need more things like that so even if homeless services had um connections to real estate agents where homeless people could go to a first point of contact and you know they have a relationship with real estate agents and get us in the suburbs and in hotel rooms and motels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to or what 's available so i think that 's a really good idea yeah okay so it 's the issue of how you actually tell people this is happening right well getting communication out there 's one thing and i think you know business is very good at uh taking from the community in the way of taking their money and it 's a time of crisis that you know we probably need to see what we can do to put back it you know there 's no immediate return there 's it 's it 's part of being part of the community and and doing what you can to assist it 's not going to be the whole solution a bit of it okay so that 's great unfortunately nine o 'clock your power goes off so it goes off from nine till two you can promise them and it will come back on at two what do you do now in our case not from panic apart from that yeah no apart from well i survived the well we decided was the 1994 gas crisis survived through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite challenging um certainly one way to upset hotel guests and that 's given cold showers but at this stage we 're struggling to give them a shower at all um so i guess from that point of view we 'd be ensuring that our guests are informed about what 's going on that they 're able to move around the hotel obviously lifts being out of action so similar issues to what you have in high-rise residential accommodation as well so trying to manage those sort of things would certainly be a significant challenge we 're a fairly low-rise building so a lot of that is taken away but in high-rise hotels which many are that 's a significant issue just moving people around okay that 's the end of day four so things are still going okay day five maximum 26 overnight still stinking bloody hot 44 degrees maximum day five pretty bad pretty bad okay gary it 's taking you all night to get home you get there the power 's off yep one of your um one of your neighbors on the 15th floor elderly lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hasn 't got anybody so she 's by herself uh there 's no power on the thing she can 't walk she 's got arthritis so what do you do um well i 'd pop up and visit her um and uh from there given she looked in in a lot of need i think get some of the supplies from our place some of the tin goods that we could probably give it to to have a meal and then probably call an ambulance and see if we could get some hydration into her is an ambulance going to come you can say yes so so look there is some redundancy in the system uh you there are emergency ambulances and there are non-emergency ambulances and there are a number of private companies um and that 's probably even more common in 2025. so it 's likely that that the state will uh will have shelled out some of these uh transport responsibilities even further to the private sector so someone will come at some time but how many hours you have to wait in a really hot room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say the good thing about our apartment block and i 'm not sure what it 's like in docklands but um because we 've all lived there for a long time we all know each other so we can quickly sort of get up there and visit mavis you know spend an hour on hour off 24 hours so you know for those families that have stayed in the building we can actually hang around and give her a hand and keep her hydrated and have a chat to her um okay okay joel your baby 's getting a bit unwell now heat affected what do you do take the emergency room i think i would have to but no day or night really oh it 's day it 's day i would definitely have to take her to the emergency room but like you said i 'm not sure how long we 're gonna have to wait but it 's our only option and you 're gonna have to walk right there 's no way of getting yeah we 're gonna have to walk if there 's a bus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running trams public transport yep definitely okay so that 's you so you want to say something here yeah just to let you know at the end of day four we fix the cable fault so supplies are back on good if it 's a transformer failure that 'll be in the morning day five right we 've either taken extra load off or we put our mobile gen sets on so day four if it 's a cable for we 're back on day five in the morning if it 's a transformer full we 're back on anyway so you haven 't slept for five days you 're you know it 's relentless right the poor old lambos same thing they haven 't slept for five days so they 've got to be out in the sun so how 's it going with you how 's it traveling well you get help is there anyone can help can you get some the short answer is no right um so so the hospitals probably by this stage we 'd expect that we 'd well and truly exceeded our maximum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that people will be sleeping in the emergency department waiting for a bed for more than 24 hours the hospital will have stopped all of its elective operations there are some beds that it can staff but staffing beds is often contin uh contingent on nursing staff uh coming to work and if the nursing staff can 't drive on the roads or catch the public transport or are busy defending their house from a bushfire then it makes things a bit difficult um we just have to to battle on with the fixed resources that we have okay so that 's the end of day five i think should we move on to day six now people getting pretty tired now day six this is the last day forecast for the for the thing 21.5 quite a cool night overnight but then back up again to 41.8 for the last day of the of the thing so mary you 've got social media going all sorts of really nice community getting going there 's a risk of course that you 're never going to move out the premiere has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of melbourne there you are you know in a bushfire we become part of the homeless yeah so what about people who don 't aren 't social network people you know what are people they 're elderly members i mean a lot of people living up in the period are going to be absolutely but you know in our experience with the social media that they always know somebody who 's got the social media right and that 's the way it works that we get that information out so that if we use our phone that somebody else who doesn 't understand the phone or understand how to work it or doesn 't have an iphone because that 's you know of course by then it 'll be the i don 't know what kind of phone we 'll be we 'll be just thinking it 'll just be happening but um you know you always know somebody who 's got it and that 's the way it works in the hills so it 's about having a tight-knit community that 's right it 's all about communication in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are pretty settled right we 're part of melbourne now sweet you just gotta get used to it okay martin last disaster for you but it is a big disaster this one a large retirement home has lost power at midday i know you fixed it but i don 't know bam it went again and the resins are in mortal danger so this hospital takes the unprecedented step and perhaps illegal i don 't know of sending you and a team out there to provide on-the-spot assistance to them you haven 't slept for a week the emergency is bulging at the seams what do you do how do you respond to that so you might be surprised to know but we 've been doing that since the early 2000s because nurses homes haven 't been coping for some time now so we 've got actually a crack team of doctors and nurses that routinely visit nursing homes to assist them with managing their sicker patients in situ so i 'm expecting by the by 2025 that everyone has had a sensible discussion about how their medical care would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life and back in the early 2000s we knew that sort of 80 of one 's total lifetime health care expenditure was spent in the last year of their life but it 's now 20 25 and people are going this is this is a bit unusual and a bit inappropriate and there 's a more measured approach to managing patients in the community with less people being transported by nursing homes but your scenario does flip our understanding of who 's at risk because studies have previously shown that when you live in supported care you 're actually protected during a heat wave a nursing home is a great or a retirement village is a great place to be because you 're a community you 've got people overseeing you and you 've got good air conditioning and health infrastructure it 's the people living alone who are elderly who are at the greatest risk but now we 've got a whole cluster of people who are overheating and they probably need to be evacuated and how do you evacuate a nursing home you get a bus company to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up onto a bus and you take them to a community area that 's got air conditioning in it and then you get community services like uh like st john or the red cross to provide basic simple medical care in the makeshift environment so premier back to you to close okay it 's the end of it 's coming to the end of day six now cool change sweeping across the city we 'll throw our doors open you know breathe that cool air thank god for that tomorrow is australia day holiday today 's a sunday tomorrow is the holiday on monday and bizarrely we 're going to have fireworks maybe we are we are it 's called change right that 's not hot anymore no problem and you luckily have the bully pull but you 're you have you 're giving a keynote speech to open the set the fireworks on the era in front of our 10 000 new residents and everybody else who shows up what do you say what do you reflect about the last six days what do you think about how we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is australia day tomorrow um it is appropriate that we acknowledge the tireless efforts for of everyone across the community our emergency service providers our hospitals our local government our community for it for working together through this incredibly trying time australia day is a great opportunity to reflect on that and with respect to the fireworks given that we have um despite the best efforts we have lost too many victorians once again during this heat wave um as a mark of respect we won 't be having fireworks um this australia day but um we will be using the time to to um to gather our um our energy to to work towards rebuilding our businesses and and getting our lives back on track in the next few days but i would like to acknowledge once again that the efforts of the community and of our services and we will be reviewing our heatwave responses and our heatwave action plans and our resilience plans um in the coming days and and looking forward to investing a lot more in climate adaptation as we move forward i believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know the city of melbourne is obviously proud to host the event that we just did tonight one of the the key parts of our climate adaptation strategy is about community engagement and awareness and raising these issues that are that have been raised tonight and so thank you to all of the panel for being involved and providing your insights of what the future may or may not look like i mean not that long a time in 11 years the city of melbourne is involved or has instigated some many many award-winning um strategies and plans that are going to help the city deal with climate change and the effects of extreme weather and dean and dean griggs and and ian cheers have have already gone through a few of the the responses that we 'll be looking at in community and also in the ecology of the city with through the forest and our water sensitive urban design and programs like that there 's lots of information on our website um so so go to the city of melbourne if you 're interested in what we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of climate in the future tonight has been a collaboration i 'd like to thank obviously maura from green cross for working with the city on this and andrew for hosting tonight 's hypothetical um again i think the panel i 'd like to thank beth and matilda from the city of melbourne and the sustainability team for coordinating all of us getting us ready and so thank you for doing that and and as it 's already been presented we 're very proud that we have been selected as as one of the inaugural resilience cities um through the rockefeller foundation and and i know that there 's workshops over the next couple of days and we 'll we 'll learn more because we know that um as a city we definitely can 't do this alone there 's a state you can 't do it alone and as a community we can 't do it alone so we need to collaborate and work together um not just in the hypothetical but in the reality as well so thank you again for your your attendance and hopefully you 've enjoyed it you,"(-37.8146168, 144.9664898)"

Swanston St, Melbourne VIC 3000, Australia",1702,I second speaker to come up and speak about what does the bold inspirational and creative City look like and that is the wonderful Louise Adler Louise Adler is the CEO of University of Melbourne publishing she 's the president of the Australian Publishers Association a board member of the Melbourne festival deputy Chancellor of Monash University and if that wasn 't enough also the chair of the board of Methodist ladies college please welcome Louise Thank You Leslie and thank you to Geoffrey for initiating this discussion so the question we 've been asked to reflect on is what does the bold an inspirational creative City look like so here are some of my thoughts in no particular order of importance a creative city is safe but also not safe a creative city and I have to thank my colleague the editor of me engines aura Sanders for this idea a creative city is open it doesn 't close down at 7pm maybe when you 're her age you want an open City but Tim I 'd be happy nine o 'clock 930 but anyway that 's a generational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the CBD and i hope the bureaucrats all the well-meaning people at the Melbourne City Council don 't take this amiss you wouldn 't call this a thriving and throbbing place after seven o 'clock at night forgive me and a creative city offers first-rate art and cultural institutions it offers affordable art as Alice said under-30s we need to nurture the next generation of artists and arts consumers by giving them access to culture and I think about the pricing of tickets and I think we are making sure that no one in the next generation will be either able to make art or actually go and see art being made I think that 's one of the key issues we 've got which is access and affordability we need experimental arts organizations that are publicly subsidized to take risks we have in a creative City a vibrant film and television production environment and when I wrote all this you know this list cut was coming to me I was thinking no no no no forgive me I know I 'm not allowed to do any buts so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way to go sneaky sneaky cutting-edge fashion if a creative City hasn 't anything it has creative at cutting edge fashion it 's home to a broad range of educational institutions as Gideon discussed before universities are incubators of innovation but those universities also have to make visible by their public engagement the dynamic engagement and relationship between what happens in universities and what happens with the research they create in universities into the community and into industry I have had the privilege of working with Monash University for the last 14 years I 'm dazzled by the kind of research and the impact that research has on my own and our everyday lives from the seat belts you know the kind of manufacturing and testing of seatbelts through the protection of children against child abuse sexual abuse it seems to me there 's a myriad of fabulous work and research going on in universities that 's never made public and never made visible to us the general community that actually supports that research I think we need to urge the universities to make that work public it helps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urban design that encourages rather than discourages community I think Federation Square is a perfect example melbourne some of you are my age and know this we were a lot melbourne was always a city in search of a meeting place we tried again and again and failed create the city centre the plaza but within days of Federation opening it became our natural meeting place I think that 's really interesting to reflect upon I don 't know how it happened I 'm not an architect but suddenly you want to meet someone in town you meet them at fed square cutting-edge architecture always creates debate always creates a sense of community alive and engaged with the spaces we inhabit and I think of a fabulous story hall and many people might not agree with me I think it 's a dazzling building still or I think of the debate we had with the goddamn shards at Federation Square sorry god damn I know he 'll strike me down but however that debate alone about one shark two shards one shot two shots created a sense of a lively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create the conditions for creativity and I think and I think we 've mentioned it already but the question of funding is the white elephant in the room I think for people who are engaged in arts and culture and want to support it if we don 't and yell and scream from the roof roof tops to say that the Arts need public funding we are missing our and you know people who want to go to the arts whether you 're kind of you know a venerable or you 're you know you 're Alice Poong it seems to be really really important for us to demand that the state funds culture it cannot happen without it it can I don 't and share the view the current current view about crowdsourcing and how wonderful is I think that 's like volunteer like that and rattling the tins at the traffic lights that 's all very well and good but that doesn 't get art made and that gun doesn 't get it seen so I think it 's terribly important for us to do that and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that the state can help us create the conditions we can encourage clusters of activity I think of Silicon Valley is such an obvious example clustering of technology and technology businesses created creativity or Hollywood for the film industry so what clusters do we have in Melbourne I certainly think straight away because I 'm an addict I think of the coffee clusters we have I mean if we have an example of a creative and innovative culture it 's certainly and coffee would certainly be one idea that we could think about and how that percolates forgive the pun but how that percolates through the culture we are obsessed with coffee we know every new place that opens up we know where a good copies we have fierce arguments about it on social media we have apps that actually tell us if you 're in and you can get a great coffee here and if you 're in northcote you can get a great coffee there and how that happens and how that creates a culture of innovation and there is innovation and coffee in the coffee culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really interesting example for those of us who want to think about it creativity is both an individual and collective activity but activity but connectivity is vital are we convinced that access is available to everyone or is it still the domain of the rich as this lady down here said at the beginning of this conversation not everybody has access to the digital environment so I think that support for public digital infrastructure will do much to encourage and create physical and online community engagement I will finish in one moment preparing for tonight I read an essay by Charles nandri Landry who argue that great cities have contradictory elements they offer places that are stimulating and vibrant but are also places of calm and refuge they offer a sense of possibility but they also the opportunity and the ability to close in on oneself they offer the feeling of being at home and in the wider world they acknowledge the values of heritage and they celebrate the new and the fresh so I think that we have to separate the preconditions for individual creativity and those for social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing I 'm sure the people at the Melbourne City Council have looked at the British Council report recently on creative cities they made a distinction between the view that creativity is an activity for special people of special talent in special places in the studio in the garret for the boffin or the Bohemian they made a difference a specific tour difference in view of your like between those people and those people who can work in collaboration with others if you want that I 'm quoting from the report if you want more creativity you need more special people in more special places bigger and better cultural quarters and bigger and better research parks but they finish creativity doesn 't always come in a flash from an individual it comes from the recombination of two ideas to create a new one new ideas that emerge from intense conversations between people so I think about that and I think about that proposition I think yes or no and I think about Alice pong and the writing she does she needs her time in the garret but she also needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a writing begins in private sure once the books written and published the connection to her readership is vital by via electronic media or print media or in person in a dazzling array of meet the author events so the production though remains private but the dissemination is highly visible and public to finish I would argue that public funding for the creative city is vital but creativity can 't be mandated the state can enable the preconditions for innovation rather than inhibit it but it will be us as citizens who work out how to live together creatively thank you you,"(-37.8146168, 144.9664898)"

such an incredible opportunity to be in the room with so many colleagues so many other creatives this is what melbourne 10 years from now looks like it 's it 's opportunities like this that are regular where we come together and we shape what the future is we build on some incredible achievements in the arts and we have affordability we have artists who can choose to live closer and closer into the city whether it 's in a vertical environment or some other way we have institutions like the Victorian College of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are able to be free from the constraints of the kind of pressures of funding that the universities it 's just a necessary process I guess and that we can harness the potential of the generations who are there in our schools right now who are longing for arts education and it 's being eked out to them a little bit by little bit you know when I could spare time from my pursuits as a busker on the streets of the southern suburbs of Sydney developing my I guess professional persona of the future I would go to the Opera three times a week I would have changed from fifteen dollars the kind of affordability I guess it was the 80s and it was an extravagant time but it formed the person the artist than I am now because I was able to immerse myself in my what became my religion I was able to see all of the great artists here all of the great artists and learn from them you know when I made our melbourne my artistic home seven years ago now i 'm looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that tells me it was seven years but i don 't know what three minutes is but i 'm really determined to try tonight when i made melbourne my artistic home seven years ago i had come from sydney where you know the outward looking sydney are the international sydney the began of town Sydney but Melbourne just felt like home as an artist there was so much connectedness here and maybe the accusation that is leveled unkindly at times of parochialism is actually a great strength of being able to look inward as well as outward but looking in and understanding yourself and I found a community here and I found an opportunity to create here that I don 't believe I could have found in sydney i had done other things and my whole career had been built there but the kind of things i 've been able to achieve here and because of this city or more particularly because this city sits on land that has always been creative for Aboriginal Australians the arts are not an optional extra they 're not the elective you take in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the serious subjects they are essential to knowing your world and giving meaning to everything in it and i know i 'm i 'm preaching to the choir tonight but i 'll leave you with this thought that there 's a way of looking at how essential the arts is and connecting with aboriginal community will give you a greater sense of that that your very existence is dependent upon the Arts that if you don 't know your song then you don 't know how to get from A to B and you don 't know how to survive it is way of knowing for Aboriginal people so I encourage you I encourage you to take up the aboriginal lens and view the Arts and this place this land of the war andriy people who 've poured their knowledge through their songs and their dance the visual art into this land layer upon layer upon layer it is still there it is not lost and to me it 's not even faded in any way it 's there to be drawn upon but I would level one sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the right end because it for some people is so distant and so remote and yet it 's not it 's right here and there 's an incredible energy to draw on I drawn at every single day and I thank the laundry and the burner on for the Welcome that I 've received to this city and beyond and I pay respects to them and my old as the yada yada people to to my colleagues who 've all joined in the conversation this evening thank you for the inspiration I abandoned much of what I was going to say because I wanted to be fueled by what you all had to say and I see a Melbourne in 10 years time that has this kind of occasion where maybe we 're even patting ourselves on the back for shaping the affordability and all the other things we 've spoken about tonight the inclusiveness and we 've built on this great tradition of creativity that 's been here for some 50,000 years thank you","(-37.8146168, 144.9664898)"

Melbourne",RuugJUPu-VM,20140116,318.55,"120 Swanston St, Melbourne VIC 3000, Australia",981,when I see somebody in need I actually get pretty passionate because I see it as an opportunity to make a real difference in that person 's life I actually feel from the time to time that what we 're doing is literally saving lives it 's not just the homelessness it 's the isolation and the loneliness that 's a really significant issue for a lot of people that we see and when our fan goes out at night some people make the mistake thinking it 's just about the food or it 's just about the blankets and they 're important but it 's actually about the conversation because some people that we meet haven 't had a decent conversation right throughout the day and they actually some people actually say to us they feel like they 've disappeared from society so our van going out is an opportunity to actually remind people that they 're not forgotten what are the really good things about Melbourne is people aren 't ashamed if that other side of the city they 're not always aware of it when they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we see that right across the board Melburnian so we see ourselves as a bit of a conduit for melburnians generosity as well there 's the possibility for people to slip through the gaps and I think that 's there 's something within me that drives me to make sure that we do everything we can to sort of get people out of those situations and try and get them back on their feet but in the process remind them that they 're never on their own this happens five nights a week that 's been going for six years and it happens because AXA as I were known then and now a MP had been incredibly generous in their support of this youth bus and the youth bus came about because there was a young girl 13 who fell through the hole in the floor of a three-story building and she died and there was a nine-year-old ninten year old an eleven-year-old that were with her at the time and they were looking after her waiting for the paramedics to arrive and unfortunately she she passed away and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just complete mess and that 's where we decided that we had to do something to help prevent that from happening in the city again we wanted to have something where we could take our services to young people put it right in the middle of where those young people are and give them something to week give them a safe place to hang out give them some interesting things to do so there 's xbox is on the bus and there 's computers and all sorts of things what do you normally use your facebook for to keep in touch with the family or free and home yeah it 's mainly the family thanks it means that we 've got workers here and volunteers that can connect with those young people and develop trust and then work to get them back on their feet and get them out of the difficult situation so we 've had some pretty amazing stories come through the door of this bus I think I mean your last couple of months there 's hope we do sum up how rough Tom got out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to my partner that is partying around here somewhere babe is over there and without me sure getting go go through the steps of that and saw the stuff they 're actually good group to actually talk to what we 're trying to just make sure we keep it a nice safe space and inside something like that tonight the street seems funded by the city of Melbourne they 've been up and going since october two thousand to ten and it 's actually about getting young people who were trained and supervised by qualified experienced workers to actually get out on the streets amongst young people and it 's its peer to peer relationship work it 's actually about saying the young people she 's had a little bit too much to drink tonight don 't you think can we reconnect you with your mates or do you want to get the van and we 'll get you home safely be Melburnian of the year was it was a shock i actually thought there was an administrative error and i 'm still waiting for the letter to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would make sense because i think um she 's on just part of a an organization and a whole range of people that all work together to make a real difference and I I really see that the award is I 'm a fun person to the award but i think it 's recognition of our fantastic team that just worked tirelessly to make need across the city and it 's in the acknowledgement that this city is not just about people looking out for themselves but they actually acknowledge people that are in the business of looking out for others and I think that 's a great reflection on the city too the mantra for me has always been whatever it takes if we see someone in need or we see a significant social issue it 's about whatever it takes to resolve that issue whatever it takes to get that person back on their feet whatever it takes to help that person understand but they 're not on their own that there are people there that care you you,"(-37.8146168, 144.9664898)"

promoted our natural competitive advantage something that provided services provide infrastructure providing opportunities for our community but I looking at that our first project together as a council I think the key type in our first budget is securing Melvin 's future and some pretty tough decisions in this budget which are outlined to you through the coasties presentation and we 'll also see you of course that we have done that for thinking to the forward four years of the term of this council to look at what Melbourne might look like at the end of our turn first could I I commend all of the counselors were some promise but over to this council will spent 1.5 5 billion dollars in product and services that 's an increase of 200 million compared to the last council term and that 's a historic amount for us to spend on programs and services and what we 've tried to do is invest in the future as you will see if it were that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next four years on infrastructure on key investments in our city 's future and it comes on top of the highest investment in the city 's history in infrastructure over the last millions we 're projecting very modest services over the 40 estimates over the last four years we were able to make 46 million dollars worth of savings which we put back into infrastructure now you often hear state and federal governments talking about how they integrate services in terms of infrastructure but we can actually demonstrate to you as you know how we give that the last previews this budget of course has no game and there are no bottle one of the things that we wanted to do it 's very important to us is maintained the livability of the city and will spin 360 4.3 million dollars on our programs and services there 's around 50 million dollars for programs and services for youth the aged children families services for people with disabilities on community health programs and odd supportive and recreation programs will invest 14 billion dollars in arts and culture programs the strengthening reputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events there are four major events in which we have a sole investor he is a member though between Fashion Week more musically we spend around nine million bottles on those form of premium festivals alone but of course we also measure the economic uplift of those festivals and the measure up there is 53 million dollars to our city 's economy for that experiential about nine if you look at our total investment in events tourism promotion of the city city business for that 's 40 4.4 million dollars overall we will plan thirty thousand trees over the next ten years at 3,000 ppm that will double the number of trees in our city we 're completing the water harvesting projects got big ones in fitzroy gardens in pure omar and queen victoria divers we 're introducing a solar panel lot by scared residents and we will work with businesses and institutions plays that they can purchase the technology but during the course of a privilege will also like to see Melbourne become one of the world 's leaders in advanced solar panel technology we 're spending 1.5 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the biggest challenge the new faces in business planning to our growth where we 're renewing our streets we 're very proud of the beauty of Melbourne and the way it looks but you can 't just let it run down you have to be invest in it like you do in any built for so we are investing in reviewing those streets to reflect the way people live and the way they use to see I said earlier about some tough choices in the budget and we do it 's not easy but it 's you know City Municipality state and federal we 're all facing pretty tough choices we 've got some structural problems and some cyclical challenge of some unforeseen and something long and I refuse overall I doubt and want to pretend otherwise we drew down from our reserves nine million dollars to cover the shortfall in the divine benefits of regulations me there 's a 10.5 billion dollars short for imparting living you basically caused by compliance people of following rules so our projected finds did not reach what we thought we were going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time last year and we 've done about 3.7 million dollars in revenue because it reduced interest rates because our cash balances have been live at we do we look forward we 've got some sort of mixed economic signals we forecast 5,300 visit in two minutes when we were looking at building activity and year ago the answer will be will be three thousand eight 24 day it 's still a large number but of course is slumming on a very fast ravenous ability but not as quickly as we thought from a driving ninety two years ago and that has an obvious impact on our rates office completions are about the same quantum that they 've been some ultra lights on one slide down and there were a projected great reviews it down on hourly forecasts at the same time we 've had upward pressure on expenditure we are the fastest growing capital C in Australia but we want to make sure and that was the rigor and the discipline of this budget that we do let growth in expenditure run away from about all revenue and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an importance of services and not one of those been just a little bit of time on because I said before we don 't expect those lights and made 46 million we made our a squeeze you know that they 've finished up at our services but in this budget I can point you to about 10 million dollars where there has been really fine groaning work to make savings throughout the entirety of the organization that we 've kept the rate rise to 3.75 percent and that will be among the lowest in Victoria of about 40 or 42 councils that I know of that have announced their rates or the below four percent we 're going to increase parking fees in the CBD I won 't result from that it is my intention as a tag last time to raise at once and once only return no one likes it but few revenue leaders we have you 've got to look better if you want to meet your budget so parking fees will increase by a dollar fifty inside the CBD which takes up to five dollars duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't like those rises in party lacks the rises outside the that we just fell asleep if they were much more moist between 26 and eighty cents this year we 'll spend ninety six million dollars on infrastructure significant infrastructure and these investments are the powerful signals about confidence in our city about enhancing about infrastructure about providing for our community and it is that really mess with tenacity that I think is very important well appoint four million dollars in violence the librarian community center the Boeing Academy services have the DA plans in place planet refurbishment works on the walls in marina you can work on city we 're investing 15.3 million dollars in carbon particle that Kathleen sideline in 1.8

nerve-wracking it 's definitely something that I really don 't know if I look good but whatever it is we are not professionals we are just people from the street and then trying to show what we are

the society we are in so we meet 100 people that actually represent the society we can play a game with them using statistics to source people was something I had never done in my practice or had seen others do I treated it like a game and the rules of the game were using the search criteria to find people that actually matched the demographic profile of Melbourne and then we had 24 hours to find each person luckily the first person was actually already predetermined and he was found by Rimini protocol and the city of Melbourne working together to nominate that person and they thought let 's

something that art can do it can literally connect people in that way people that I never thought I really speak to you before I know really exciting we have met a lot of new people from the different backgrounds everyone should be involved in some things that 's part of the community it 's a good way to meet people and just part of feeling like you belong we try to be very sort of mirror to what the city does and then the rest of it is a sort of visible democracy I want the audience to hopefully also make this experience that you project yourself down there that you think oh I would stand here on yes I would stand there or not who feels as though we represent you guys pretty much everyone should find someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and every one life stories how they came and how they settle down you through them it 's been good ringing having people that you wouldn 't normally think having a lot of the questions I tend to be on the opposite side of the room to everybody else the death sentence I find really interesting I 'm generally not in favor of things like that but there 's a proportion of people who obviously are as it comes together in in place of representation even more here so here in Melbourne in the Town Hall it becomes a political reflection I guess about it I 'm good for now is a fantastic way to show statistics I just really love statistics so it appeal to my nerdy side but it was done really visually beautiful they went on for too long and they 've been a few little occupies there but it 's very interesting with great demographic you never get to know

birthplace of our marvellous city during the nineteen hundreds there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Melbourne these days there 's around a hundred bars and about fifty pubs but where do you go to find traditional pub fare with a twist well the wool shed is a good place to start the wool shed pub sits on the water right opposite Etihad Stadium and if you have a taste for the good things in life this is where it all comes together all right Chris so how does the whole beer and food masterclass work look when it 's a fairly simple concept we talk about the three C 's of beer which is to compare contrast and then cleanse you didn 't match that to various flavors in the bit looking to have one of those two elements with your food and this is what you get Asahi super dry Japanese lager with cured kingfish pure blonde white wheat beer with sea scallop big helper Munich style lager with pork sausage baguette fat yak Pale Ale and beef and red wine pie and to finish a dog bowl dark lager

as a collection of amazing event and function spaces called Central Pier while it 's a pleasant stroll from the city to harbour Esplanade today I 've taken advantage of the free city circle tram that includes Docklands as a stop in its tour of Melbourne ski tourist attractions the old shed 14 was built back in 1916 and it 's on the Victorian Heritage Register as the oldest large single dock remaining in the world Atlantic 's 31 million dollar redevelopment has well and truly brought it back to life fusing Industrial pass with sophistication and cutting-edge design Central Pier is

stylish sophisticated edgy and vibrant events every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pier because it 's one of Melvin 's largest waterside event spaces with design inspired by London 's Tate Museum tonight Jerry

porterhouse with fondant potato and beef cheek with sweet potato and horseradish skordalia for tonight 's lucky guests meanwhile at the neighbouring mayor there 's an interesting union of old and new the design of this function space has been heavily influenced by shed for teens industrial heritage as a cargo ship so there 's a bar that resembles a shipping container and the original loading dock doors have been retained next door to Mayor sumac is an intimate middle-eastern inspired event space complete with metal lattice work and traditional hanging lamps there 's room for 140 sit-down

quintessential British brand is always a favorite for gifts whether you 're buying for someone else or treating as though now Carolyn to use the word royal in your business title you have to gain permission from the king and queen is that right absolutely do we were actually given the real warrant back in 1905 by King Edward the seventh excellent now do you have any special pieces in the store

range from fashion to home wares and entertainment to electronics there 's also a food court with plenty of options the other big attraction in harbour town is the Medibank Ice House a new state-of-the-art facility that has not one but two Olympic sized ice rinks don 't get me wrong I am a total water baby but I am a little bit more comfortable in the ways that I am on this rose and stuff fortunately we 've got Kristen here with us can you give me some pointers absolutely well the first thing we want to do is make you feel a little bit more confident on the ice and the best way to do that is with a basic skating stance so I need you to bend your knees very good keep the get those arms up almost like they 're laying on a table and keep your chin up now once you 're in this position all you need to do is March your feet up and down very good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you start moving forward without even trying anything how do you feel like a deal but oh yeah well you want a

public and it was a great opportunity to really enhance this lane and to improve the quality of the thoroughfare it 's a great location it runs between melbourne 's most prominent shopping retail area and laneways that are closed for pedestrian access at lunchtime so really a great area for the general public to interact with the artwork so when union lane was chosen the first step was to contact the owners of the buildings of the walls and to seek them out to see if they would consider allowing a street art permit process so the two sides of the lane david jones and the walk arcade both agreed to having the murals painted on the walls we filled out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of melbourne and then we had to give an idea of what sort of thing we would be painting on it and then had to wait for the process to begin before we could paint in union lane we had to get permission to remove a 30 year old mural that had been heavily vandalized sought permission from the artist and that was fine and then before we could start putting our new work on it we had to have the wall buffed and the department of justice has teams of graffiti cleaners working in conjunction with the city of melbourne and a crew came over two days and painted the wall sort of neutral shades to give us a basis while all this was going on we were putting the word out to participants to see who would want to come in we were aiming for young people between the age of 13 to say 30 and we did this in various ways we went through the sort of formal city of melbourne youth services network where emails and talks were given at forums so that people could tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come along to that and also we created an artist 's blog beyond the cctv.blogspot.com and through the blog we advertised the project and what was going to happen and for those people that wanted to could simply come along down to the lane during the informal workshop sessions register in and start to paint i came to the project due to my experience in street art and having done another street art laneware project just recently of little lonsdale street i mobilized my network of artists and sent an email out to everyone targeted certain artists to act as mentors for the younger ones that we expected to come along over the eight days we painted we had probably up to 50 different artists that came along and participated in terms of paint we decided to go with belton molotov 's because artists prefer working with that because it covers nicely it doesn 't run it is a good quality paint the rule of thumb is one can per square meter so we had quite a large area to cover the trick really was on the day to kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first of all was safe for the artist to work secondly also that it would be safe for the general public he came around to have a look one thing we wrote up on the blog was a set of codes of behavior rules of engagement which was a list of really obvious things but uh we made that apparent before everyone came down on the wall so obviously no drinking no substance abuse and then to do with the nature of the artwork nothing that had you know political sexual or racial implications and then there were the sort of unwritten rules which you know don 't nick the paint and equipment um don 't go over each other 's work and respect each other when you 're working in a small environment like that and generally um over the time we had no problems with these things it was great lots of people found us through the uh emailing networks and the blog and so on but quite a few people found us just by word of mouth and just coming past the project we had big signage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew what was going on the public were free to walk down through the laneway and watch the artists working and quite a few artists came down to check out what was going on and ended up staying we had quite a few people from interstate and international artists who just ended up working with the young local people so it was a great opportunity for the artists to meet each other see each other 's styles and to network and talk about other street art projects i think one of the great things that happened was because we chose not to restrict the laneway to public access we ended up having a huge amount of the public coming down through the lane and we had nothing but an interesting dialogue going on between the artists and the public we had nothing but a good response and it was an opportunity as lots of people from the public pointed out that they don 't normally come into contact with street artists and being able to stand there and see how they applied the paint and how they actually built up an image many people from the public found fascinating,"(-37.8146168,
