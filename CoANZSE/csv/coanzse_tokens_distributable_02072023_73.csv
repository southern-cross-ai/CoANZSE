2013,rj7ymc-L9vY,20130923,2551.709,"State Route 41, Queensland, Australia",8187,"I please in everything i say i want you to appreciate that there is no hidden agenda i 'd like to think of myself as a community leader i 'd like to think of all the things i talked about as being from my professional background as an urban planner with an MBA who has studied cities and is passionate about the future of cities so Mackay is beautiful spot I 've really enjoyed it today but there is no question that it both has challenges and certainly opportunities you know some of the observations I 've seen in terms of opportunities you know you have this incredible grid pattern a really well-planned city just like a delayed with wide streets 30 meter wide streets gives you this fantastic canvas this opportunity to actually create spaces and create a public realm that that 's going to be a really attractive destination eighty percent of all public space in cities are roads now we always think about parks and those sorts of public spaces has been the most important spaces but the truth is in a downtown district it 's actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that interface with the businesses that interface with the residential and the commercial opportunities that are actually going to create the unique point of difference that is about people come into Makai and leaving and saying I loved going to Makai and so we really need to start rethinking our public realm and the streets and you 've got a wonderful opportunity there and i 'll get to that in a minute you also have beautiful heritage buildings I 've gotta say a really really interesting range of high quality heritage buildings and certainly I feel very confident that we are finally moving from heritage versus development to heritage working with high quality new contemporary architectural designs to actually amplify the character of our CBDs tell me a great city on the face of the planet that hasn 't embraced its heritage as a strategic asset and a branding opportunity to make it a world-class international brand of excellence cities do not demolish their heritage now they create those opportunities and I 'll be honest you 've got some beautiful heritage buildings that can create Main Street environments where as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demolished most of its buildings and so to a certain extent and I 'm going to be bold here and say it 's kind of lost some of its heart and soul it 's lost some of its character and so that is why Adelaide actually has more people in its downtown district than Brisbane all Perth to a certain extent because we 've got this character we 've got a nice environment where people want to spend time and I think that 's something that 's really exciting your climate is a great opportunity no I haven 't seen it bucketing down with rain and you get three times more rain than us but certainly your winter is beautiful and warm your summer is hot but I think there 's some really exciting opportunities there and also I think you 've got a really exciting opportunity with your mare and your council and the fact that Deidre 's invited me here today really says that she is too is passionate about cities and she too wants to make a difference and everyone I 've spoken to has talked about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council that you have right now now I 've got to pinch myself and I want to pinch you and say that 's a really exciting opportunity it 's what you 're not reading in the paper that you need to celebrate are you reading in the paper that the council is divided that it is fighting that it doesn 't have a shared vision I from what I hear the answer to that is probably no and that 's a really important opportunity and a opportunity in time that you as a community also need to embrace and work with the council and finally the other opportunity that I see is everyone in this room the fact that you 've bothered to come and listen to a guy from Adelaide talk about makybe really is inspiring for me and it gets back to that point that cities are all about people you are the opportunity and I also appreciate the viral nature of communities of this size and every single one of you knows dozens of people in the community and you have the power to spread the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a shared vision about the future of Makai so you are well and truly the opportunity the fact that you 're here inspires me as well there are some challenges and I 'm going to talk a little bit about them i 'm going to cover what i call urban myths certainly you are like every australian city a car-dependent society and i 've spent the whole day hearing stories about how people in micaiah think about car parking and how frustrating it is that you can 't just drive into the town park outside the bank do your business and drive off and I 've even heard a story of people that have driven just three kilometers or three minutes by walking distance to go to a meeting instead of actually bothering to walk and that is going to be a challenge and I want to explain that and my challenge to you tonight is to have a light bulb moment that understands that the globally competitive cities country towns regional centers aren 't going to be obsessed by cars it 's not going to make you guys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not going to bang on about the environment I 'm going to talk about how important it is to you in terms of cold hard cash and it is a challenge and certainly the heat could also be a challenge and you need to look at the right infrastructure for that and also clearly the economy everyone says it 's a tough time in it in retail at the moment I speak to my own small business traders thank goodness the federal election is done and dusted we 've got a state election coming up you don 't and I really do hope for all our sakes that we build that confidence back and i have seen empty shops and i did visit Kaneland and it is a great retail environment and it does add some value to the community but it also adds challenges in terms of revitalizing the downtown district and I want to mention those as well before I get into my three urban myths I wanted to just maybe comment on a few quirky things some things that you might not often see as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town I 've ever seen where there 's been no writing symbols on the on the footpaths I kind of find that a little bit strange well Adelaide 's got some strange things so please don 't think I 'm criticizing you but I 'm a big believer in designing in solutions rather than putting up signs saying what you can 't do if you had a really good quality bicycle lane next to the footpath you wouldn 't need a sign on the footpath saying no writing because people would ride on the lane and not have to ride on the footpath and so there are cities around the world that are now banning signs that say don 't do this don 't do that because you can actually provide the solution instead for example I know that you 're talking about some urban development in the town centre and I 've read your strategic plan and the local area plan and you proposing to put up a whole pile of signs especially I think of Canberra where you drive in and it says welcome to the city centre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put a sign up to say that you 're in the city center you 're kind of missing the point of having a city centre and the idea of actually having good development at those gateways or just excuse my French but bloody big trees that makes you feel like you 've arrived in a place is actually much more important and a better outcome than putting up signs telling you what you can and can 't do I also will talk about this a little bit more but you do have some very sick trees in this city and you need to as a community rally behind that and I 'll talk about that a little bit more the hills figs that are in good condition are the ones that have tapped into the sewer systems the rest of them are about 50 years old apparently they 've got another 70 years if they looked after but they 're all dying and I can tell you if all of those trees die at the same time you 're really going to know all about it and it 's going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in a little bit um I you love sunbathing your cars I tell you what the parking through the middle of the city you 've got lots of parking but it 's all in the middle of the baking Sun and there 's very little shade for the cars or I find that a little bit curious I wouldn 't want to get into a car when it 's been 35 degrees and if coming downtown means parking going and doing stuff and getting back into 35 degree car wouldn 't really want to come downtown too often would you so it 's some food for thought that I 'll get into and another one too is I sort of we 're walking along the riverfront and I said where 's the playground now from this point you know how far is it to a decent playground if you want a family friendly city it 's something that I really think that you need to sort of seriously think about it 's just just a kind of thought I said where 's the playground at everyone 's at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes that way but if we want family-friendly if you want people to come into the city just little things like a playground might be a good idea now three urban myths before I get on to this I want to leave some time in because I 'd love to have a conversation I 'd love to find out what 's interesting to you what you don 't agree with me on what you think I 'm totally crazy about or what you do think is a good idea so I 'll try and get through this but firstly three myths you know that cars are the solution to cities now it 's very hard to explain in a few minutes but the truth is that a total 100% obsession on cars will kill your city and it 's proven again and again and again now i 'm not anti car my last car is a portion right now I Drive the 2012 world car of the year it 's an S and leaf it 's fully electric you 've got one at the airport and once you 've driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and i highly recommend that you give it a red-hot go but the problem with being a car-dependent society is it 's a feedback loop now if all you do is drive your cars you become so dependent on driving your cars that alternative forms of transport become non-existent so if you all drive your cars who wants to use public transport because the bus is going to be caught in a traffic jam if you all drive your cars who the hell is going to ride a bicycle because it 's not going to be safe and if you all drive your cars you 're all going to want to park in the in the downtown district and so if you build more car parks to support that no one 's going to want to use the public transport or ride because you car park and in doing so you actually then induce more people to write drive their car which means that you fill up those car parks and then ultimately those car parks are full and you need more car parks and that then induces a process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire world now if you really don 't believe me and you want to find more you can google let 's go to town it 's a General Motors Holden video that goes for about half an hour and it explains the difference between driving a car and a metropolitan area versus a CBD okay and the point here is that in Adelaide where it is bigger we can 't widen the roads in the central business district so once they are absolutely chock-a-block we can 't widen the roads because that would mean on North Terrace demolishing Parliament House and Government House and the universities or you might have a 30-story building or a 20-story building it 's just not possible and one day you get to the point where those roads are completely full and you 're sitting in traffic jam thinking why the bloody hell didn 't they fix this earlier well the truth is that if you just focus on alleviating cars by car congestion and parking by building more car parks and making it easier to drive and everyone comes into the downtown district @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 10 or 20 years from now you 're going to have the same problem that every city on the face of the planet has the difference between people who get this stuff and people that think that I 'm crazy is that you would think if you don 't like the idea you 're thinking about tomorrow next week and next month I 'm thinking about 5 10 20 years from now and in 10 years time when you 're sitting in a traffic jam thinking why the bloody hell didn 't someone fix this before well they 're trying to do it now and generally receiving resistance from people now it 's not about auntie car because not everyone can use public transport or ride a bicycle if you 're old or if you 've got kids or if you 're disabled or if you 're a businessman who has to drive around the city all the time you need to drive your car I absolutely endorse that but if you live in the downtown district and you can walk all you live just across the bridge or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ healthy and you can ride your bike that 's one less car in your way when you need to drive into the city it is actually good for alleviating congestion it actually makes your driving experience better if ten percent of people rode their bicycle and ten percent of people use public transport that 's twenty percent less people that are looking for a car park when you drive into the city and you want to find a car park and what we 're doing is now talking of having a conversation that it 's not anti car it 's an integrated transport system it 's about having a range of choices that makes the city more accessible so Adelaide 's got 200,000 people coming into it now when we get to 300,000 or when we get to 400,000 if we just focused on inducing more cars we would be screwed everyone would be stuck in a traffic jam and that 's not going to be productive in fact the nation is expected to lose 20 billion dollars of lost economic productivity from sitting in traffic jams by 2020 we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drive into the city but we also want them to have choices so they can do other things and so that the people that need to drive are going to have a positive experience now there is so much freaking out and absolute madness associated with people that think that cycling is going to kill the city or that people dare not walk because it 's actually all about needing your car but the truth is it 's about a sensible conversation about providing integrated transportation that 's going to move people efficiently I want a productive city i want my walk is to get from work to home from business to business and then business back to home so they can see their family have a relaxing night and not be stressed out when they get home because they 've spent 45 minutes stuck in traffic jams so it 's a sensible conversation that I 'd really urge people to be calm and cool about and really understand that what 's you most of us have spent our entire life growing up looking out of a car window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the planet and it 's going to stop us being a productive city and being a productive nation and we need to start looking at that and also we spend fifty eight billion dollars on obesity in this country bit of physical activity will actually mean that your glucose can absorb through your muscles and you won 't get diabetes you won 't be overweight you 'll be fit you 'll be healthy and I 'll tell you what if you do exercise in the morning you go to work my goodness the mind is sharp and the data says you are happier and you live a healthier longer life and you save this nation billions of dollars so you might think that it 's all about being greenie but the truth is we are the second we have the most codependence country in the world and we have a second most of beasts country on the face of the planet who don 't actually encourage people to be physically active as mayors and leaders of our community we are actually doing our cities and our state 's and our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think a little bit more about encouraging people to work a few more minutes maybe ride their bike occasionally they don 't have to do it all the time more bicycles are sold in this country than cars eighty percent of Australians own a bicycle but only twenty percent ride them because it 's not safe you know how many of you got a bike in your shed that you haven 't ridden in the last week month year we all buy them that 's what we did as kids and we still buy them and we don 't ride them so it 's about just encouraging us to have that modal share and that transport split it 's it 's also an amenity conversation you know a downtown district that is full of cars isn 't exactly the nicest place so we want residential development in our CBD so that we can have a vibrant downtown core hands up who wants to live next to a freeway okay we 've got one well that means fumes that means noise that really actually actually increases your stress levels and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a freeway now also we would love to have a more vibrant downtown core full of people and that means restaurants means entertainment it means outdoor dining who wants to have a nice romantic meal with their partner next to a traffic jam so it 's about building a downtown district that has a high quality amenity once again it 's not about getting rid of the cars that 's just rubbish and if you think that 's what I 'm saying you 're not listening it 's about creating an environment that is a really nice place to be doesn 't mean getting rid of cars it just means making it a nice place to walk around the cycle around an easy place to drive around and making the city accessible you know it 's it 's also about creating a shopping district so people don 't really want to go shopping in a really high density car orientated environment they often do surveys about what people fear the most in cities and during the daytime the single biggest fears statistically of people that come into cities are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they get hit they 're gone in South Australia for example nine percent of all serious accidents with pedestrians and cyclists that happen in the entire state of South Australia happen in the central business district nine percent happen in this little bit of the city of Adelaide now that 's 170 people that are seriously injured and one person that gets killed every single year now if that was your child your sister your brother you 'd be really worried about it and we 've got to change that conversation another urban myth council will solve all of your problems it 's not true council should be here to be a co-creator it 's like being the the the manager of the art gallery where the businesses the residents are the artists we 're actually there to get everyone to reach their potential so it 's about supporting businesses reaching their potential it 's about residents defining what they want in their communities and council actually assisting in that process it 's actually about co-creation it 's about the fact that every dollar council spends should actually be reinforced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know if a business wants to be proactive and maybe put outdoor dining it 's not actually the council 's responsibility for paid pay for the tables and chairs it 's their responsibility to make that process as easy as possible and to actually help and provide that assistance and I 'm a meeting with the elected members tomorrow and I 'm going to talk about some place making processes that we 're working on it 's about motivating the administration and the culture of the council administration to think differently so instead of the administration providing rules and regulations and making you jump through hoops to actually get stuff done it 's about them being there to assist you in what you want to do so it 's about backing winners it 's about supporting believers and doers and it 's about getting the community on the front foot and I always go to you know when I do get a chance to go to a pub on a Friday night I 'm into my second pint of beer and a guy comes up and says are you the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you should do this and you should do this and you should do this and I live in a 300 kilometer an hour information wind tunnel and I can 't do it all myself councils not going to build an aquarium we 're not going to build a swimming pool in the middle of the torrents lake what about an entrepreneur saying I want to do this or people saying can you help me make this happen and that 's the sort of culture that you build and once you start building it and changing the culture of your community so that it 's not all about the council solving your problems it 's about you getting them to help you solve your problems you actually create a feedback loop once again that 's about providing culture of getting outcomes and getting things happening and I think it 's really important that is community you don 't just expect the council to make things happen because they have a limited budget and better it 's an opportunity for you as entrepreneurs to make a buck to make a name for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people you want to work with in your community the third one is that you know it 's all about for me not competing but collaborating so a great example for me is that we 've put food trucks in the city of Adelaide and we 've had some challenging experiences where we 've put food trucks in our squares you know places places that were designed for people and we 've had one or two small businesses around the square complain and say you can 't do that they 're taking away from my business now I get it and for those food businesses I 'm sure you 're thinking well that 's true but then again you don 't create a food street and eat street like gujjus street or like on the street with just one restaurant what you 've got to do is get businesses to work together to actually create a community that has a reputation you know at the moment some people might not come to downtown Makai because I don 't feel like it 's got anything to offer if you could fill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to work together who are going to mark it together who are going to collaborate and cooperate and actually share information you actually create a vibe that more people want to spend more time in and I think it 's really about knowing that ultimately you 've got a big shopping center with a single marketing tool and a single marketing employer and they own all the shops and they 're able to levy those shops to create a single unified message they can advertisers as Cain land on television you 're all as small businesses individual businesses competing by yourself with limited resources now I know you 've got a business improvement district and I commend you for doing that and we are now very much moving into that space New York has a great example and that one of my big challenges in terms of collaboration is the media you 've got to get the media on board Times Square Alliance which is a business improvement district was started by the New York Times who decided that enough was enough they wanted Square to be a destination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the businesses to work together and actually realize that collaboration is going to be your strategic asset and that teamwork is going to be part of it is really important so it is about creating your point of difference and it is about you working together as a team and not seeing other small businesses in your street and the next street and the entire downtown district is your competition it 's only when you work together the great things will happen so um you know if I was I can 't turn up and not give you some tips I did say I 'm not here to preach but they 're there through the myths that I guess I really really wanted to share with you if I was to provide you know a suggestion of what I would do if I was mayor of Makai and by the way I 've got to say I 'm having this same conversation in Adelaide you know we haven 't got it all right there are some people that think I 'm wrong and people have said I 'm not going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a lot of people we do a lot of consultation i was saying this is the right thing to do and frankly you know these are the things that are happening in cities all around the world so you know if you don 't believe me please make an informed decision and bother to read up and have a look at the same conversation because you know i can 't be experts in how your business is a run and I can 't be an expert in mikhay but what I can say is that you know I 've dedicated my life to this and I do understand some of the trends that are happening now some tips well it 's kind of simple and I think ultimately what the city of Makai needs is a really simple message to unify everyone and I really think you should all Keep Calm keep calm and enjoy Makai now I say that because I think there 's some key message is there firstly in terms of keeping cool I really think you need to do a massive personally a massive tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 've just come back from Taipei it was there two days ago and they have gone on this monster campaign of planting trees everywhere their main streets and main boulevards are starting to look like forests it is absolutely stunning and they 've got roughly the same climate as you and you walk through those streets under the shady trees and it 's cool and it 's calm and it 's nice it 's a very very nice environment Singapore has done the same thing they have transformed their city over the last 20 years as a garden city city of Adelaide is surrounded by parklands and so we 've parted ten thousand trees we 've doubled the number of trees that are going into the new rundle mall development we 're improving the number of trees in all of our squares and I personally am obsessed with planting more trees in our downtown district there 's a whole pile of data that 's about the urban heat island effect now you know who really wants to walk through a city centre that 's blisteringly hot no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's why people go there because it 's aircon now you can 't aircon the streets but you can cool them down really significantly and the data says that you could actually decrease the temperature of a a macro environment in a street by by five degrees just by planting those tree by planting more trees and those hills figs the ones that it look beautiful are absolutely stunning you have some beautiful trees in this city but the other half or two-thirds are dying and I 've been told it 's because you 've put bitumen all around them and put car parks right next and now cars parked right next to trees compress the soil and then compress the roots and kill the trees now those trees around 50 years old if they all die at the same time it 's going to really be ugly people but also they 've got about 70 more years to go and you really want to keep those trees because it takes 30 or 40 years for a beautiful tree to grow takes seconds to cut it down and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees to lower level staff or at least middle management or senior management the city of Adelaide it 's a full council decision now I 'm big on delegation that 's how you motivate people to come up with good results and actually you motivate entrepreneurialism but when it comes to the life of a tree every life is sacred and it takes years for a tree to grow and you need to now it 's some got to get this right but it 's victoria street and woods wood street that is a great example of a really beautiful Street in the city and if every street looked like that you would have a city that people went wow it 's a really beautiful city and that means that people who are walking around shopping are going to be shaded and if it does rain no it 's not going to stop the rain hitting them but it 's going to screen it to the point they 're not standing out of bucketing rain if you 're standing at a traffic light for seven minutes to cross the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridge along the riverfront you 're actually going to be standing under a tree not standing under the baking Sun and so it 's about increasing that pedestrian environment you know if you leave downtown mikhay and it 's boiling hot and your car has been sitting out the baking Sun and you 're hot the cars hot you know I 'm so glad I 'm out of here but if you park under a tree go walking around a beautiful green environment you 're actually going to leave st. that was really really nice and as I said you know Kane lands aircon you know the best you can do is plant as many trees as possible and be obsessed with it I think it 's a good thing it 's a it 's a it 's a legacy that you will leave future generations that they will absolutely thank you for and I think it 's something that can really make a difference to this city so simple the other one is relax so it was all keep cool relax and enjoy McCoy the relaxing one is about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need cars in a city absolutely but if we did actually just calm the traffic down it would be a nicer place again now it 's six decays along the main streets I think 50 in some parts and 30 and others now i 'm having the same issue so i can 't preach because city of Adelaide 's 50k is an hour in the downtown district but Perth is 40 Brisbane is 40 Sydney is 40 and Melbourne is 40 kilometres an hour in the downtown district and if you 're if you actually timed driving along gordon street from sort of entering the town centre to the main intersection doing 50 k is an hour or 60 k is an hour and then you did it at 40 k is an hour i bet you 're only going to lose about three seconds now is that really a bad thing if it means you 're improving the amenity of the city and also if you get hit by a car doing 50 kilometers an hour the chances of dying is seventy-five percent if you get hit by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dying are twenty-five percent goes from 75 to 25 I 'm not saying 30 kilometers an hour is even safer again or even 20 and don 't think that I want to stop the traffic or get rid of the cars or go to two kilometers an hour or anything crazy the science from around the globe says if you go from 50 to 40 the chances of dying by being hit by a car are slashed astronomically outdoor dining improves you get more development in your CBD because it 's a nicer place to live people will like shopping in the main streets they like walking along and it will be a nicer place and people might lose three seconds also if you 're driving along the street at 40 k is an hour and you 're a small business owner what are the chances of them seeing your sign better or worse if they 're going slower what are the chances of them seeing the display in your window if they 're going a little bit slower better or worse and if you 're driving along at 60 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're doing 60 k 's an hour you can see a car park what are the chances of being able to stop and pull into it if you 've got a truck doing 60 k is an hour what about being 40 what 's the chances of being able to see a car park slow down and pull into it it has been proven to improve the retail amenity of a street the data says that shop owners know the names of more customers in a street with calm traffic it actually works it 's good for business it makes dollars it improves residential development it improves retail opportunities it creates a nicer place and once again it 's not anti car but what it says is instead of a sign saying welcome to the town center you can go through it really fast it says instead if it 's needing as iron you put in a 40k speed limit and says welcome to the town center relax and enjoy because this is where we actually pride on being a nice place for people to hang out and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at the European Union is saying 30 case I 'm not going to say that don 't put it in the paper don 't put it on TV they 're saying 30 I 'm saying cities in Australia should be seriously considering for TKS an hour and it also means that all of a sudden pedestrians can cross the road and there 's a whole range of benefits I can 't see too many benefits of going at 60 kilometers an hour in an itsy bit environment and at the moment because it 's a car orientated environment there are more cars on the streets than there are people but Melbourne Sydney Adelaide Brisbane there 's about five people to every one car walking around the downtown district so when do we actually start saying people are more important than cars in a place that 's the cvd where it 's actually people walking past your businesses that buy stuff people in cars don 't buy things yes they need to come in yes they need to find a car park but you want to create a nice place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don 't actually spend more time and they 'll come more often and they 'll spend more money and that 's all been proven as an absolute fact so it 's just some food for thought as well so I was actually about taking a photograph as the lights were green the pedestrian lights grant got beat dads that egg grow that just does my head in about driving you know if we all just relaxed the downtown would be a really nice a place if we 'll just chilled out and thought hey this is where people want to be this is about people and your strategic plan says pedestrians are the highest priority then cycling then public transport and then vehicles there is one more and that is delivery trucks they 're more important than cars because you do need the businesses to operate and I was in Vancouver and had the bus driver driving me around and he was a bus driver as a contractor and he said I 'll we got this thing in Vancouver where pedestrians are one cyclists are second public transports the delivery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew it and it means that in their downtown and they 're the second most livable city on the face of the planet it 's actually about saying you know it 's a safe place to be and we respect people and by then you get a place where people want to spend more time and more money they enjoy that is about for me about you as a community getting out there and saying I want to have fun in this town I want to do good stuff I want to make things happen I want this place to be a great place it is about that place making that I 've talked about with the elected members tomorrow we Adelaide City Council of money aside for co-creation we 've basically said we 've got a million bucks we want people in the community to stick up the hand and say I 've got an idea movies in whitmore square a lemonade stand outside a business you know closing a street to have a street party where all the food businesses actually put trestles out on the ball and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why are you doing this street party and I said to have fun but it was more than that it 's about engaging the community and having that co-creation and actually saying this is our city we want to make a difference we 're going to work together with the council to do some really good stuff you know it 's not up to the council to create a market councils aren 't particularly good at doing street markets it 's actually going to be an entrepreneur who 's got the savvy got the connections got the knowledge to make it a sustainable business model outdoor dining is another one you know I 'd really going to put the pressure on the council to actually think about waiving outdoor dining fees for the first two years to get businesses to put tables and chairs out on the street why on earth are you going to charge them to activate your street and bring it to life you want to create that environment the city of Adelaide has increased outdoor dining by thirty percent in the last three years and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great place where you can go to a food court in air-conditioned comfort and have a great choice of food but you can 't sit outside on a nice day with the Sun on your face and bump into your mates walking past and actually really relax and enjoy have a few beers have a coffee and actually in sin under a shady tree and say I love living in Makai i love the tropics how 's the weather in the middle of winter tourists want to sit outside tourists don 't want to sit in in a food court in the middle of winter it 's 12 degrees in Adelaide I want to come up and sit outside under in the Sun and enjoy some outdoor dining so it 's about creating it 's about doing it 's about saying I want to enjoy the car and I want my friends my family my children my parents and tourists to come here and enjoy it and so you can create the quirky you can create the difference you can create that uniqueness that makes you different to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a shopping center that actually says we can do arts we can do interesting things there are also opportunities to talk to the business owners of vacant buildings why not provide a really cheap rent for a bunch of young people to sell beers to their mates with a temporary art gallery for four bucks to sustain an arts hub or to sustain a new young group of people who want to actually create vibrancy you know this idea of renewable aid which came out of her new Australia actually originally came from a renew Newcastle and if they can do it you guys can do it and so it 's that exciting opportunity finally it was all keep calm relax and enjoy Makai I think the key to it is all and that really is that you have the opportunity as a community that 's big enough to get things done but small enough where everyone knows each other and that is exciting to see you all in this room tonight as exciting and for me it 's about a shared vision it 's not about the council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whinge about how they 're not actually getting on and doing it that place making I talked about is about the doing now to connect into the future and I think that message needs to be really simple and I think it needs to be owned by everyone it needs to be taught in schools it needs to be a poster that people can put up in their shops it needs to be something that the residents can explain to visitors in one minute you know this idea of we all need to keep cool relax and enjoy Makai for example short sharp and shiny if all you remember from tonight is I want you to be cool be come and enjoy Makai you 'll actually be able to remember that and you 'll be able to have a conversation maybe with two or three people tomorrow about the sorts of ideas that I shared most importantly I think that you 'll always have your knockers and you 'll always have cynical people you are the people that have bothered to come here tonight because you care about the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community you are the champions you need to work with the council you need to support them because frankly I spent some time with the staff today and you know I learnt more than I contributed because cities around the world regional centers around the world they 're all facing the same things I 'm not a guru I 'm just a guy that sees patterns and this is a pattern that is repeated in cities and regional centers around the world and your staff are great they know exactly what they 're doing they 're really dedicated they 're really motivated they 've spent their entire life dedicated to the good development of communities and cities and you 've got a great counselor wants to support them and you need to be champions so you know I do know that change is is really hard everyone wants progress but no one wants change and you 've gone through a lot of change over the last 10 to 15 years whether it would be a shopping center whether it be the mining industry whether it be a whole pile of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I know that a few of you feel sad and you know lost about the past but we need to as communities really feel much more confident about the future because you know we are the lucky ones we live in a great country you know five of the top ten most livable cities are in this country and we are all working as a team to make our country an absolutely fantastic place we 're in a good position you know everyone gets good good quality water plenty of food everyone gets looked after with education you know we are the lucky ones in this country we need to pinch ourselves need to roll up our sleeves and get cracking because there 's a great opportunity there for our city for our state and our nation 's and we need to be a part of positive change in our community I hope you 've enjoyed it and are more than happy to have a conversation with you and once again did reach thank you very much for the opportunity that has been a true privilege","(-22.81728, 147.636891)"

talk about wastewater treatment harm they 're probably structures that people don 't see because they 're hidden away and these hidden structures are our nation 's treasure kilometres of pipes the lifeblood of our community out of sight but by far the most capital intensive of all services provided by local authorities such as Mackay Regional Council the Makai water recycling project is one such initiative that provides a creative solution to the ever changing environmental needs of one of Australia 's fastest growing regional centres get the city 's growing this part need to have a treatment plan in a white flag as a security cooperation when we start for the infrastructure like this in the charge detecting for the economic crisis the city and you talk to for the next 20 I guess there 's hard for people to understand what are you going to get out of it what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing something to fill in our community and it is a hard sell former mikhay city mayor julie boyd was a passionate believer in the project many didn 't share her vision though but I have to say that I flew down to Canberra meant we see the director of the National Water Commission and I literally threw myself on my knees I said please we need this money we really need to get this project going and he said he couldn 't believe how passionate I was about sewage with a price tag of 154 million dollars back I Regional Council the Australian Government and Queensland Government jointly funded the Makai water recycling project it reuses on average about ninety percent of McKay 's wastewater providing liquid gold for a productive sugarcane industry and protecting one of Australia 's greatest assets the Great Barrier Reef it removes 250 tons of nutrients every year rehabilitates groundwater resources and the most tangible benefit of all the closure of the 45 year-old mount Bassett wastewater treatment plant ending the need for an ocean sewage are for the average person there 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that drive into work every day more than happy this whole thing ties together to create a very large scheme that is quite unique and is going to to agriculture literally a hundred percent but with change comes apprehension some urban land owners weren 't convinced of the projects merits particularly using recycled water on sugar crops because we were saying to people we think that this is a resource that could be used there was all the fear about all free users for irrigation other kids going to come out with two heads will they all get hepatitis to me it was a no-brainer it was environmentally sound it was great for the cane farmers it was good socially economically you name it it had all the right things going for it and yet trying to sell it to people was extremely tough and people worried about their own and drinking water supplies out of the aquifer and things like that but you know in in the long term that they had a far greater threat from salt water intrusion into their drinking water supplies than than anything else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go through extensive planning for about six or seven years I just secure the funding from state and federal government so the benefits of the community is going to get your varmints going to get and so league leading projects in Australia and we must pay tribute to to our previous councils if they had the foresight to firstly applied for funding and then plan this cleaning this project right through so I think not only this council and this current council put their previous council I 'm sure they 'll have notched to put in the belt and so we 'll look I was part of that the project included the construction of 27 individual storage dance by local contractor Ogilvie constructions and of 2200 mega litre damn to hold the class a recycled water it was liquid gold to farmers like Ross Williams a guaranteed of water because we just don 't know what 's going to happen with the underground supply in the next four years we 've lost three boards out of six the salt water intrusion Ross Williams and Steve Young are just two cane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slashed to their properties salt water intrusion creating additional uncertainty as the aquifer becomes unusable now as they access class a recycled water their future is much brighter it 'll service a big center pivot which will irrigate 250 acres and it 'll just get service it only and we can run the water to the rest of the family I was going to have to do something and this is sort of open the door to to make it more simple even though of course it isn 't free that tongue dad like no matter how you go about things that cost a lot of money and and you gotta weigh up whether it 's viable and this this is viable likened to a complex jigsaw puzzle the multi-faceted project awarded to the 10x alliance John Holland joint venture covered seven different work sites at the height of construction what the fellows call boundary writing if you like but where they 're actually out there just going around making sure that each crew knows what it is that 's happening for the day so there 's the communication side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

destructive forces in nature all terrifying sound and awesome fury in queensland we live in a paradise and queenslanders are envied all over the world for our lifestyle and our climate now it 's this same climate however that brings the real risk of cyclones generally between the months of november to april now here 's a fact for you since the 1800s nearly 200 cyclones have hit the east coast of australia and guess where the majority of those ended up you 've got it right here in queensland many of our coastal towns are well overdue for the next one and it 's these situations where something as humble as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right it 's basic food but it 's the basics that may just save your life so we need to become cyclone smart we need to become aware we need to become prepared and we need to be safe be aware of the risks and be prepared for the unexpected the area response policy is for people to shelter from a cyclone in their own homes unless they 're in low lying areas susceptible to storm surge if so then evacuation before the cyclone might be the best option the storm surge is a dome of water produced by a cyclone which can be many kilometers wide and several metres higher than a normal tide to find out whether your home is at risk contact your local council in the event of a cyclone emergency services will be stretched to the limit so create your own cyclone smart system to keep you safe before during and after a cyclone include a cyclone preparation checklist emergency kit first aid kit evacuation plan and emergency contact list examples are available from your local council and emergency services aside from you and your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water food personal documents and up-to-date information drinking water 10 liters per person is vital you can live for weeks without food but not without water many coastal towns only have one road in and out so during cyclonic flooding you could be housebound for several days estimate how much food your family would need for three days pay particular attention to the special needs of babies the elderly and of course your pets as well as the inevitable baked beans stock up on a variety of canned vegetables and meats since cooking facilities may not be available choose foods which can be eaten cold straight out of the can and don 't forget the can opener be smart and prevent danger by creating a cyclone smart system start with a cyclone preparation checklist take a good look at your house and your yard and imagine gale force winds is your roof in good repair and the gutters cleaned out are there any overhanging branches or potential high wind missiles in your yard ask your local council if your house is built to any cyclone standards and locate the strongest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurance policies are they up to date and are you covered for wind storm surge and flood damage if you have a digital camera take photos of your household and personal valuables and store them on a cd in your emergency kit an emergency kit and store everything in a designated cyclone cupboard or wardrobe the kit should include a portable radio torch or lantern spare batteries in different sizes food for three days sturdy water containers personal and property documents masking tape for windows candles and waterproof matches combination pocket knife money emergency contact list sealable plastic bags a change of clothes portable stove with fuel sturdy gloves work boots and overalls medications and sanitary supplies you should also include a comprehensive first aid kit your local pharmacy will have suitable kits in stock be ready to respond with your cyclone smart system when a cyclone approaches your region the bureau of meteorology will update its progress through radio and television announcements there are two types of updates cyclone watch updated every six hours when gale force winds are expected from 24 to 48 hours time and cyclone warning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in less than 24 hours time when the cyclone is less than 12 hours away each update will be preceded by the standard emergency warning signal which sounds like this during a cyclone the electricity will probably be cut so keep a portable radio tuned into a local station not necessarily the one with the best music abc radio is the official emergency information provider prepare an emergency contact list keep it in plain sight and store a copy in your emergency kit the list should include phone numbers for emergency and medical services insurance companies relatives and friends local councils and service providers if a cyclone is severe enough you may be required to evacuate so be ready with an evacuation plan the most important part of the plan is to identify where to go to higher ground preferably to stay with friends or relatives and how to get there yep it really does pay to have friends in high places the plan should also ensure that your vehicle is fully fueled evacuation kit is packed and arrangements made for your pets an evacuation kit should include cash for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emergency kit documents and valuables emergency contacts list be safe and recover when a cyclone is imminent tape up all the windows to minimise breakage and set your family up in the strongest part of the building this is usually somewhere with the smallest or even no windows such as the bathroom or central hallway keep the portable radio mattresses and blankets emergency and evacuation kits with you the aftermath can be almost as dangerous as the cyclone itself keep your portable radio on at all times for updates it is vital that you do not venture outdoors until the official all clear has been advised the eye of the cyclone is quite deceptive as it produces an interval of total calmness but as the eye moves away the gale force winds come back with a vengeance in the opposite direction once the all-clear is given dress appropriately for damage assessment and clean up this does not mean thongs or bare feet cover up and wear sturdy footwear and gloves don 't wade through or play in flood waters sharp debris bacteria snakes and even crocodiles could be lurking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings and keep a lookout for fallen power lines use your emergency contact list to notify friends and relatives of your well-being report damage to insurance companies and contact emergency services for assistance if required and lastly learn from the experience and see what you could have done better to ensure the safety of you and your family so be cyclone smart be aware be prepared and be safe follow the basics and don 't get blown away you,"(-22.81728, 147.636891)"

service center for the mining industry a lot of the big industries are based here that service the actual minds and it 's grown significantly probably in the last five years there 's no doubt that the mining and engineering sectors are largely responsible for mkhize good fortunes but one of the growing pains of rapid growth and wealth has been a shortage of workers in all areas and the demand on housing this region is literally crying out for people to come here and enjoy life ages nothing to me if someone comes to me and they 're physically able to do the job when I got the mental attitude and the skills i don 't care if they 're 20 or 60 doesn 't bother me greg anderson started his working life as a 16 year old school ever who scored an electrical apprenticeship fast forward 27 years and he now runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns over 70 million dollars a year he pays above award wages offers numerous employee incentives and is begging for people to pay him a visit I want to see me my

welders diesel fitters fitters and turners underground miners underground supervisors site-based diesel fitters yeah that 's probably range at the moment up to about probably 40 positions we have available it 's the same story everywhere you look this place wants anyone willing to work regardless of whether you 're a school leaver trades person professional or academic there is something for everyone with jobs everywhere regardless of what it is whether it 's town planners or engineering just purely workshop Foreman 's in right across the field any industry lated to mining or and those service industry is job 's pretty much in every field whether you want to you know work in a coffee shop or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether you want to work out of the mines yeah they 're certainly that there 's work here and to be done there 's a shortage of workers and just about every you know every step through the economy as you go every type of business and speaking of business according to Martin Lambert anyone who wants to establish a business in this region is almost guaranteed success from day one because of the huge demand and buying power of the community the current climate in mikhay means is that businesses can be successful either even if they haven 't got some of the basics right I think it 's just gonna continue crime Glen crisp moved here to work with mikhay infrastructure alliance it 's a partnership with the local council overseeing the delivery of major infrastructure to cater for the region 's growth why wouldn 't you come here um you know there 's nothing wrong with living in Melbourne and I like it but it 's lovely here and there 's good salaries there 's good opportunities and and it 's not a I don 't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and you could you know if you had families and things like that i think you could come here nine that you dare to to see your kids through school as we 've seen mkhize good fortunes are here to stay more

percent a year all this activity within easy access of the capital cities from Melbourne it 's a direct flight rizzy very simple to get to in fact we were just flew down to Adelaide last week so no it 's very simple lots of flights in and out of my car ya so now it 's very easy to get around I say look at moving to the region look at coming up and having a holiday and actually get to experience what the region has to offer as we said plenty of opportunity so we welcome all colors tourism has actually helped the region as it tries to solve its worker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year people often come for a holiday and liked it so much they decide to stay there 's opportunities here our endless at present yeah yeah the morning it 's great money it 's great you know the cultures out there are good the the work is good you can you can actually have two lives you can do your job and then if you want to come home and pursue sporting careers or whatever you want to do you get that as well the message is out there anyone wanting to work in a good industry there are job vacancies so it 's easy to see why the makai region is a great place for a sea-change tree change bordered by pristine beaches and hinterland rainforests brimming with economic activity good quality housing great shopping and modern infrastructure and of course the laid-back lifestyle of the tropics but most of all it 's the people that have turned this place into paradise makai is going to be wonderful and look I 'm still here and then love it very much but I think that it 's it is growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that

we resume the meeting uh moved councillor kirkland second to council neighbours all those in favor and that 's carried thank you we 've just got we 'll just go back with after this a little bit of a technical hiccup so we 'll go back to uh each of the interests that have been declared um go back to the top so i 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're a patron of an organisation technically you don 't have to declare an interest but i 've been um leaving the meeting over the last quite a number of years and i just believe because that 's the precedence that i 've said that i would sort of do that again so i have a declarable conflict of interest i believe in council item uh 9.2 of the council discretionary fund rockhampton horticultural society and that i propose to leave and stay away from the place where the meeting is being held while this matter has been voted discussed and voted on so i 'll do that when that item comes up next councillor smith oh yeah thanks mr chair i 've got a conflict a declarable conflict of interest in item 10.1 um because my nephew rep mckinnon is employed by tennis queensland and that 's has a close association with what campton tennis association so i propose to leave and stay away from the place with the many as hell while this matters being discussed okay next council latcham you online yes thanks mr mayor uh yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family trust that owns a tennis complex for item 10.1 community assistance program that involves the rockhampton tennis association so i 'll be uh logging off during that time council wickerson yes mr chair uh you hear me okay yes very clear yes i 've got a declarable conflict of interest with item 10.1 this is round three of the community assistance program uh my brother-in-law mr mark tobin is currently chair of the capricorn helicopter rescue so obviously there 's conflict there and i will be leaving the meeting for the duration of that conversation thank you council rutherford um thank you mr chair um i not a declarable conflict of interest the items 10.1 but i just wanted to make the table aware that i 'm an honorary member of the golden mount shooters association but i don 't believe that there is any any conflict of interest the ceos advise that this membership does not uh constitute a conflict yes thank you so we move happy do we got to move on those no okay so we move then on to our business outstanding there is none @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presentation of petitions there is none so then we go on to um item 9.1 and this is where i will actually leave the meeting while this has been discussed um my council made us would you like to oh okay sorry okay item 9.1 discretionary funds central queensland animal society incorporated and this is uh councillor uh mayor tony williams fifty dollars myself fifty dollars and five hundred dollars from councillor grant mathers um any discussion on that if not someone happy to move councillor smith second and council mathers all those in favor and that 's carrie okay 9.2 now this is the one i 'm going to leave the meeting councillors i 'd like to move that council mate has just chanced that maybe for that moment that 's councillor smith there all those in favor and that 's carried i 'll leave the meeting now thank you very much deputy yep all right we all good to go all right thanks very much everyone everyone just looking at uh item 9.2 um which is the summary of councillor neil fisher is seeking approval from council tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rock and horticultural society um has anyone got any uh questions or discussions about that if not happy to move council smith uh senator councillor rutherford all those in favour uh that scouted unanimously thank you very much we 'll get um get councillor fischer back in and move on to get a cover um thank you everyone okay move on to item 10.1 community assistance programs round three and uh alicia welcome back oh so mr chair will we given that there 's a number of conflict of interest for this item do you want to move um the emotions separately um i was going to ask mr ceo if actually that we could pull those items at councillor smith council latchum and council wickerson all at the same time so we 'll do it in two parts if everyone is happy so okay so speaking generally then councillors so this is round three of the community assistance program we had a total of 19 applications received three were ineligible the remainder applications are recommended for approval for sponsorship today just noting councillors that there 's uh the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applications um which are obviously the greater amounts the minor uh sponsorship scheme which is the smaller type events and then our community grant scheme which goes towards the improvement of the facilities i 'm happy to take any questions around the individual grants or maybe at this stage we might actually split the meters but uh so that the councils who have a interest if you will leave the meeting now you know we 'll do the bulk first do the first lot okay and then we 'll do the different ones association okay so uh yes sir we 're dealing with this one is uh everybody that we are dealing with the funding for round three excluding the rockhampton tennis association and the racq capricorn helicopter rescue service back to you alicia yes so happy to take any questions um i have got information here so we 'll be thinking on the spot but happily happily to answer the questions okay council rutherford uh if there 's no questions i 'm happy to move okay i 've got a question yes counselor yeah look first of all um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you know congratulations to these people for putting the applications in i 've probably never seen such a wide variety of grants i give an answer that 's really wonderful just the question uh and i 've got no problem with it the dance festival that would that be mainly um the higher of the pilgrim theatre the last one of this um let me just check that counselor yes so sponsorship sorry the sponsorship there says it is towards the venue higher the organisation contribution yeah so it goes towards the higher of the facility correct yeah that 's good because it um involves a lot of children like hundreds of them yeah and adults as well for the yeah speaking generally i think now we 're seeing the return of these events sort of post-covered and people have some confidence so it is a great outcome council kirkland um thank you mr mayor um my question does overlap slightly into those that we 'll deal with out of um thing but it 's the same question should i ask it twice ask it twice so it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this same motion um i would like to i mean i 'm happy and i trust in the process and everything i 'm i too like councillor smith was very pleased with the variety that we 've seen there for those that are not so much for those tangible things you know such as ovens and and the likes i would like to ask about those that are more around events and fairs and festivals it was my understanding that these types of program this sponsorship scheme is is almost like a seeding and over the years we would peter back with uh slowly peel back the amount of sponsorship dollars that we we 're issuing so my question is how many years have um and it 's a long one you may need to take it on notice and get it back to me each of these how many years have they each been continually receiving the same funding and um what that funding was each year okay so i have in front of me so again speaking generally a lot of events are annual events so other than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been that expectation that some of these major events certainly will continue to apply um responding to your question around cutting back these grants um that hasn 't actually taken place yet i think it 's naturally happened from covert but um there was a resolution that will find some money and shave some money from the community assistance program for the next coming year so that then we 'll see these these sort of grants becoming more competitive um but individually i 've got sort of various details or can actually provide that information to councillors sort of outside the meeting if it 's not part of that decision making process thanks alicia yeah i just i want to make sure that we 're not by continually giving to the same events we 're not excluding newcomers to that field people who have got events that they 're wanting to actually get started and make an annual event it 'd be great to see our event calendar continue to grow and i 'm just making sure that that we 're making an allowance and and and making it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's an expectation that they would generate some way of covering those costs moving forward for the sustainability of their own project so speaking generally then as well councillors we had kick-started some review around the criteria for this community assistance program i 've sort of got the next three months to bring those matters to a close so you will certainly be be discussing it at the table around what criteria we want moving forward for these types of grants in the next three months yeah i think it 's it 's timely to have that review so yeah yeah thanks so much for that elise right thank you council kirkland any further questions been moved by oh sorry council wickerson my apologies thank you mr chairman i 've just uh just put my hand up uh following on from what alicia and councillor kirkland said look i agree that uh i was going to mention about the review coming up but one thing that i 've often thought with events particularly that yes it is seed funding so that maybe we consider over a period of time whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry is probably right that that funding gradually declined so that it gives these organizations a chance to get their event up and running and standing on its own feet but then over that period of time the funding declines down to a minimum amount maybe just zero and then that frees up some money for other organizations to deceive their brand new projects so by my own view is that these events should eventually become self-sustaining and if if they are going to keep requiring our funding to to survive well they 're probably never going to be successful so i think that 's one thing we should feed into the mix when we look at that review thank you thank you thanks councillor wickerson so um no further questions asked being moved by councillor rutherford seconded by councillor smith oh oh councilwecker said my apology i should have asked first if you would like to to move but were you happy to second yes so i 've been moved by councillor rutherford seconded by councillor wickerson all those in favor and that 's carried unanimously okay we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like um councillor smith council latcham and council wickerson to leave the meeting will we have you will have a forum okay alicia back to you so councillors the only thing i would like to add in respect of the two separate items is just in respect of the racq capricorn helicopter rescue service so this is something that um again sort of suffered with covert the sea this i 'm talking about the cbd christmas fair so this is something that they 've applied for traditionally they have got assistance from advanced rocky but now we 're seeing the support move across into the community assistance program whereas previously it was provided from advanced rocky so just additional information for for you but otherwise we 're still as a council looking to support this event um that 's it okay council kirkland answer the same sort of question um slightly different it is actually with regards to the capricorn because the other question was answered in its entirety thank you mr chair the capricorn helicopter rescue i noticed that that had moved across and there 's a legacy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work that that they do and it 's all charity so it is again another element of a challenge for them to make their events sustainable because they don 't necessarily make money out of it um i make a lot of money out of it my question is with a lot of these applications they are meant to give you a report post event aren 't they certainly uh they are and in terms of the acquittal of the funds there is an expectation that report as well as um some actual costs been received yes yeah so my question is have you received those reports from from these larger uh grants that are being handed out today including cab helicopter so i can 't speak so generally yes because that 's so as part of the process counselors that that 's required to acquit the grant and they don 't actually or they 're not eligible to get any further funds until previous grants are acquitted so that 's a requirement in respect of the cq helicopters service i 'm just not sure on that one because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given from advanced rockhampton previously so there should have been some sort of report but it may not have been received through the acquittal of our community assistance program remembering that it 's moved across okay perfect thank you thank you councilman thanks very much deputy deputy mayor um just through you to elite your leash i just wanted to ask in regards to the racq helicopter um for the christmas fair um you know you 're saying previously that 's been funded through um at ar um just wanting to ensure that obviously if we 're now using the cap program to uh fund that for the 15 that they they won 't be going to advanced rocky and then putting in for more funding for that that 's certainly the idea is that it 's clear and um advanced rockhampton i guess are refocusing their funds into um the events and that doesn 't include this so to answer okay thank you i mean they can ask the question but yeah okay okay if there 's no further questions someone happy to move cancel kirkland council rutherford all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invite councillors back to the meeting thank you alicia yes okay well we might while it 's happening tanya oh no sorry amanda thank you amanda yeah is that on yes yes um council at its meeting on the 13th of october approved a development application from interior change use for a special industry it was the one located at 162 middle road gracemere powerpoint there let 's go to the next slide so yeah that 's location now the applicant now wishes to negotiate on the conditions of approval the following changes are proposed so condition three they want to um payment of a contribution as an alternative to constructing the road work so we 've negotiated that outcome with them condition 4.4 on the western vehicle access to be constructed at the stage where road train use is required and condition 10.3 the removal the requirement for a concrete block wool as the site is already bunded and bonding is in place so um i 'll just take you so there 's the proposed oops um the proposed site plan um so they 're not making any changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they wanted to negotiate some of those um changes to those conditions as i mentioned so therefore the applicant 's change representations are considered reasonable and um is recommended for approval okay questions councillor smith is the councillor for that division uh yeah i mean i was just a little bit concerned about moving that wall because in the description it says to it 's mainly to stop diesel from next door coming in to the site because as we know diesel another product shouldn 't mix and i just was a little bit concerned about that you haven 't got a there 's no um like plan of artist 's impression of that wall of i suppose through the chair yes so you you 're referring to the yeah we we put an additional condition on there about putting the extra concrete wall in um however they have got funding already in place plus the adjoining property um falls away from their site as well and that adjoining property should also um have should not be obviously there shouldn 't be any risk of their you know offside impacts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be managing um yeah and as i said that property falls away from this property so the risk is low plus there 's already bundling in place so it 's already bunded so it 'd be basically having it double bunded for no reason um an additional cost to the applicant we just asked through the chair um the height of the bundling is that the meter um within the shed i 'd have to look up um because it was in one of the reports provided by the um and see it 's an era so all those um there is an era involved with this one so all that is um conditioned and monitored by state government as well so just through the chair against obviously the wall wasn 't a requirement of the authority no um through the chair the bonding um obviously the bundling they have in place was a requirement yeah um but we the additional concrete wall was something we proposed but as i said the applicant has come back to negotiate saying look they 've already got bonding in place it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an additional concrete wall because there 'd be no purpose for it okay just uh through the chair what 's the time limit on coming back for um for negotiated decisions um through the chair yeah 20 business days um we 've been in a very lengthy which they did come back within that time period um this has been a very lengthy process mainly due to the not regarding the bonding but due to the condition around the construction of the the road works because it was um you know they had to do a design up and we had to come back and backwards and forwards and negotiate on um the works and the costing of that okay well that 's good that something 's been decided then because i think a lot of the trucks are turning in there and the street is not in not in a good state because it was never built as a industrial road it was like minimum standard seal okay thank you council smith council rutherford i got a couple of questions if you don 't mind okay deputy mayor amanda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well and you probably touched on it just a little that the condition was put in there so why was it put in there i i wasn 't um the assessment manager at the time but um it probably was put on at the time having concerns for the neighbouring adjoining lot yeah and the reason i ask um if tanya just one minute i cause something 's triggering me that this was quite a um it was controversial and and it was quite yeah tough table and that that concrete wall may have been one of those things that you know we put in place to try and um yeah i guess find that that happy medium and that 's by taking that out you know are we going against something that we had put in place to try and appease um concerns does that help tanya yeah through the chair um i was the one who actually put that condition on there yeah we weren 't aware of the topography of the emerald carrying company side at that stage but i 'm confident that it actually drains away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chances of having a spill from emerald carrying company going into the proposed site um i don 't think that will be an issue and that 's why we 're happy to remove that condition that had the extra wall there because it is bunded um where the chemical manufacturing is so even if diesel did come in it wouldn 't actually get to within the property okay and then the other one is um when we do the work when when there is a contribution paid and we do the work do we ensure that that contribution is um enough for us to do the work yeah through the chair um [Music] when they yeah they will do a costing up and then and the engineers would review that costing to make sure that money covers the cost of those works all right and then the follow-on question from that is why do they pay after we do the work and not before we do the work well um through the chair they will be paying um prior to the work so we 'll be taking the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that um section of of roadworks and when obviously that road works is undertaken then council would use that money then to go towards it so sorry i 'm just a little confused now because the report says that the payment must be made blah blah blah in full um made at two years from the date of the approval or when the works are completed whichever is sooner yeah so um if the works is completed um prior to the two years then we ask for the payment because obviously we need the money to untape undertake the works and the likelihood of that works possibly occurring within the next two years is probably low and that 's why we 've given them that two year period to give them the option to pay it at the end of the two years um but if yeah as i said if the work is undertaken prior to that then we would we would ask for payment jamie would you like to come in morning councillors so just to reinforce what amanda was saying we did get a detailed design for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantities for those works and that 's how we 've come up with that cost assessment so that 's why it 's taken such a lengthy period of time to negotiate those bits and pieces out there 's a significant drainage catchment on the northern side which had some cross drainage across douglas street that is a point there has been a point of negotiation where we 've removed that component from those those frontage works because we thought that was an unreasonable imposition on the developer in this instance because it just so happened that that catchment came across in that exact location where those frontage works work but for the remainder of those frontage works so the road wide and curb and channel drainage all of that has been designed and we 've got a detail bullet quantities and that 's where that cost estimate has come from and as far as the timing goes for those works i cannot see within the next two to three years we 'll be doing those those works all right thank you councillor kirkland um thank you mr chair actually um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the answering of some of her questions have crossed over with what i was wanting to bring up as well and it was definitely around the costing of that particular those those works i 'm concerned about the cross escalation of construction costs that we 're seeing in the climate that we are in right now and whether there is um you 're saying that the chances of that that road being delivered within two years is slim there 's a couple of questions in the sense that if they 're wanting that for b double access and they might transition to those vehicles starting to come to the premises what happens if that happens before you 've delivered the road through the chair well the access um the upgrade of the access is separate from the road work so the upgrade of the access will happen when those road trains um so those road trains won 't be able to enter the site until that access works is undertaken um so that covers that bit off as far as obviously the cost um yeah i 'm not really is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jamie yes so as far as the road trains go they would physically be able to enter the site via the eastern access they wouldn 't be able to exit hence the the western access needs to be constructed for the road trains to be able to be safely enter and exit the site if they tried to use the eastern access yeah they wouldn 't physically be able to do it safely um as far as cost destination goes um yeah good good point and that probably hasn 't hasn 't been built into the to the condition package it is something we could give consideration to um we do have another development on the northern side of douglas street on the corner of macquarie street similar process for them they 'll be required to do frontage works we 'll get a contribution from them um the the tricky bit for us i suppose is we don 't know when we 're going to deliver those works um so we could do a simple cpi or a ppi addition to that condition that would would help in that instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prudent especially given you 've suggested that the delivery might not even come in within the two-year period and we i 'm we 're all very much aware over two years we 're going to see an escalation in construction costs so that would be prudent to put that in there as a condition i 'm do we take their the the contribution i 'm concerned that the business continues to to go ahead and i think we should be encouraging business can i just say that i absolutely agree that we need to be encouraging business in our region and we want to make it that they 're not feeling that they can 't move forward with business so i i appreciate that negotiation is a really great position for us to be and where we can negotiate these things when we 're talking periods of two years five years ten years now we 're running into that risk we 're putting ourselves exposing ourselves to a risk are we not if the business in fact doesn 't go ahead or go you know um goes ahead even greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said with these trucks they need those that access in 12 months but you 've put into your plans that you 're not going to deliver the road for three years how do you how do you bring forward those that road and still fit it into your planning is it possible to do that no well through the chair obviously um it 's a bit of a it 's a bit of a balancing act we can 't um we don 't want to if council um haven 't got that works is scheduled for another for example say three years time we don 't want to restrict or not have the ability for these for the developer to negotiate um on the condition we don 't want to stop their development from occurring due to that every application there is an element of risk because we go to conditions of approval there 's always risk that that a applicant will won 't comply with those conditions of approval that 's you know there 's that there 's always that risk however we have obviously we have the ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of approval so we we have you know they are bound to these conditions and we and there is a process and we 've got a team and council that that can take action if the conditions aren 't complied with so we 've got that avenue but all approvals will have conditions in place that that um that an applicant will need to comply with and yes there will always be a risk as i said that some won 't do the right thing but that 's as i said we 've got an avenue to go down that path if um if those conditions aren 't met okay so my last question if i may mr chair is in that regard then do we have a review process with all of these uh when you 've got conditions you 've got roads that are going to be delivered or infrastructure that 's going to be delivered in xyz years do we have a review process set in place that we go back to the to the business and say where are you at where are you at with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you at in your business as far as being able to afford the infrastructure that 's going to be necessary through the chair well they would this is why we 're getting a contribution in the bank guaranteed to cover all that so um [Music] all that all we would do then at the end of um obviously once they 've i mean they 're already operating this this place is already operating we would do a review of the conditions of approval and to make sure they 're in accordance with with the conditions of approval um the road works obviously we would the contributions for example the payment of the contributions we would have that in our system um and that there would be reminders and and and so forth tasks to follow up to make sure payment is made yep so just written reminders no no it 's all um electronically um recorded in the system so they won 't be written reminders they 'll be actual um they 'll self-generate reminders from our system to the to the person responsible for making sure the contributions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate to see businesses contribute this type of money and then for it to the road to go five or ten years it still hasn 't been delivered that 's all just wanted to make sure there 's a review process in place did you want to answer it yeah just just through the chair further to what amanda was saying we 've got a number of developments occurring in douglas street so it is something that we 'll monitor and keep keep an eye on as far as how that is functioning from a safety and efficiency point of view so whilst there is a process as far as um pathways might go um it 's more an informal process as far as monitoring how that that network is function functioning it 's something we can give consideration to oh yeah just with uh condition 6.3 about um must be connected to council 's reticulated water network and they want to give a contribution rather than do the work but in the conditions it says that when the liquid comes into the yard it 's mixed with potable water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meantime like where are they getting the potable water if if they don 't have water to the site and i think when we were discussing this um when it came to the table the risk of a fire and you know they need the water for for that purpose through the through the chair we will be um so we have requested that condition isn 't being changed so they will be um required to connect to the articulated water they 're actually going to speak to a neighbouring property i think there 's some negotiations happening there i 'm not sure what they 're using on site at the moment [Music] at the moment as i said because they are already operating but we have got that condition in place to ensure that they do get connected to reticulated water yeah just through the chair i know some houses in the special management area used to be precinct k at the western end of douglas street have requested to be connected to water um they badly want it and i just but until we if we haven 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do any of that to help the whole street sorry is that yeah yeah it 's not related to this application so i can 't yeah i 'm fine i 'm fine with the application i 'm happy to move it deputy yep okay any further questions to counselor wikison councillor latcham no if not okay it 's been moved by councillor may the second council smith all those in favor and that 's carried unanimously thank you thank you thank you amanda good morning brendan this should be a powerpoint as well sweet all right good morning councillors so this is a change application to grow smear shopping world um which is a two stage land disapproval um let 's go next this week so like i said it 's broken into two stages so stage one includes that eastern portion of the site which is being constructed stage two is yet to be constructed and primarily goes over that western portion of the site and i 'll touch on shortly you 'll see there 's two additional lots included on that western side which won 't include in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this minor change as part of the expansion so the proposed changes like i said include an expansion of those two lots to the west um there 'll be a slight increase in the gross floor area of the shopping center by about five percent or about 857 square meters um there 's a revised internal layout for the food court introduction external dining areas landscaping and landscaping to the bus stop and an increase in car parking which matches the increase in gross floor area so this is the original development approval the site plan so the the yellow shading reflects proposed stage two um and if we go to the next slide you 'll see this proposed change on that um the far side of the screen and the kind of pink gray shading that 's a revised layout so it 's an improved orientation to a chancey street um and a slight encroachment into those lots to the west um there 's no proposed changes to the to the access the access arrangement so we 're recommending the minor change be approved so the the conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parking and elevation plans the proposed changes satisfy the minor change test comply with the fitch voice shy planning scheme which is the playing scheme which which the original development application was says assessed under yeah so we recommend it for approval okay um councillor uh kirkland do you have a question yeah i do thank you mr chair um it 's really just around the the project not around the change in in essence um just wanting to ask how do we do does council normally pass this through to tmr when there 's things going on the major works and everything that are happening there at the moment so that there 's no replication or interference even with the works that are going on there do you pass this information on to them and they work in collaboration with you so in this case there 's a referral agency response from the department of transport and main roads but these changes don 't have any consequence on the works being done by tmr if there was an instance where the changes were going to affect those conditions from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and seeking those changes but there 's no statutory trigger for us to refer it back to tms within the actor there is a number of triggers that will refer or triggers that create referrals to the state agencies and then the state agencies they 've got a stupid sarah does the coordination of their response back to so the act actually triggers those referrals okay yeah i was curious about that so i thought i 'd take today where dtmr come in though they 've got a number of triggers um and it can extend quite a distance into our network than they do the applicant is part of the change application also provided the traffic impact assessment which looked at whether the increase is going to have any impacts on the local road network and the intersection works and demonstrate there wasn 't so councillor smith oh just to comment mr chair great to see this happening hopefully the the community wants stage two to happen and i 'm glad to see all the car parks because i 'll guarantee you can go there on a monday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i think councillor kirkland had that problem um so yeah really good good good news thank you council wickerson well thanks mr mayor mr chair through you probably jamie i think um i know it 's probably outside the this particular application will change to the application but i expected there might be some more pedestrian traffic enticed over from the school to the uh to the shopping center with this development and then it goes back a few years but are there any considerations of putting in a controlled or signalized crossing there to get people across a busy road to to the shopping centre uh through the chair councillor wickerson so um lorry street old capricorn highway intersection is being upgraded by tmr um that 'll be where all the crossings are going to occur um there 'll be no other um signalized crossings um proposed so is that is that at the roundabout itself that 's right yeah so that roundabout is going to be signalized so there 'll be a signalized intersection there and that 'll be where the pedestrian traffic will be um positioned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's no further questions um chair council maters you 've got any questions or you haven 't moved no i 'm fine with this also so happy to move thanks deputy mayor so you can see the council of smith all those in favor and again that 's carried unanimously thank you thank you brendan yes thanks good morning deputy mayor and councillors through the chair for your consideration this morning i present a proposal received from the local government association of queensland for council to opt in to a mutual access arrangement for use of facilities at parliament house and likewise for members to access facilities here on council premises the proposal is on the back of an arrangement the the lgaq has with the speaker of the queensland parliament and approximately 45 councils in queensland have opted into the agreement so far the benefits of the arrangement are outlined in the report and the details of the arrangement are also attached happy to take any questions any questions counselor kirkland oh yes thank you mr chair i was just wanting to ask how do they actually charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brisbane no so there 's no cost involved with with this agreement no pre-prior to the agreement though through the chair my understanding is there is no cost involved previously when we have gone we have been um accompanied through one of our local members i can perhaps through the chair indicate unless council were to engage in this mutual access arrangement we councils don 't ordinarily have access to parliamentary facilities um they 're at queensland parliamentary house so there 's no charge but we don 't have access so ordinarily where we have excuse me where we 've previously looked to conduct meetings there in brisbane there have been either higher of other facilities or otherwise conduct meetings in public spaces coffee shops things like that so the benefit of this particular arrangement is that if mayor or councillors are undertaking official council business there in brisbane we do now have access to facilities there at parliament parliament house at no charge to council obviously the flip side of that is making available where it we have vacancy and availability similar meeting spaces here at council for mps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah no thank you for that damon thank you emma i was just curious because the wording in in the document led me to think that they must be charged they must charge money so council smith 's agreeing that that was the way it read so i was curious i thought oh that 's interesting they charge money my um this deal was um struck and set up i see through lgaq last year um late last year um it 's taken a while to filter through to us is was there a delay for any reason or is that just normal i believe the um actual proposal came through to a council around two to three weeks ago i have no recollection of us previously receiving a similar proposal from lgaq i did note that there 's obviously with 45 other local governments that have already signed up and this has been somewhat dated whether or not there 's been something that had been sent to cancel it somewhere along the line and um has been missed i can 't probably comment on that remember last year i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the airport been a very popular uh request for a meeting spot with the state mps i think that 's one asset that we do have that uh quite often there that members could could actually have access council wickerson uh thank you mr chair i had a question um and i was happy to read in the the actual documentation around caretaker period both our caretaker period for local government election but also when the state government go into that caretaker mode because i 'd imagined without that proviso he could get a little bit out of control around about that that time uh but one thing i wanted to to clarify i see clarification on uh is the intent for when for example mayor and the ceo go down to parliament house to meet uh with with ministers or senior staff of of the government or is it and and vice versa when state members might come to rockhampton to meet with us but does it also include meeting with other external parties you know a state member might want to meet with the rumble enterprise or something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the equal represent representatives you know what i mean mr c or emma yeah through the chair so um the in the agreement it outlines that the members are able to access council premises for to undertake any of their duties as members of parliament and then likewise for us as local government representatives to undertake any duties within parliament house previously when we have gone to parliament house we have had meetings there that may have gone across a number of hours throughout today and this sort of enables us to have a facility a space to use rather than relying on our local member perhaps to be waiting in their office we do have our own space to while we are in brisbane and it is based on on what we would what we would require as reasonable access so there are rules there around unreasonable access so they would not be requesting to use chambers for example or undertake events for which we would perhaps not normally hire out council premises for and if they were to do so there would be the normal fees and fees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good arrangement and um i don 't think it would supersede any other normal security arrangements or a range of other things it just gets rid of one little clumsy hurdle that we 've had and i know getting access uh particularly parliament house in the past has been difficult i think you need to be hosted by a member whether it 's your local member or someone else so i think it sort of makes just the process a bit more cooperative so i think it 's here to be supported thank you okay no further questions i 'm happy to move seek a second uh councillor kirkland all those in favor and that 's carried unanimously thank you emma okay move on to item 10.5 workers memorial day and ross isn 't here evan yes we 're looking for ross um so council the report is pretty self-explanatory the combined unions of rockhampton um approached myself to whether or not um two parts would we participate and allow our workers to participate now in a memorial day for um workers who have queensland workers who have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a fairly good message for our employees around safety side of it to get that message across so there has been a thousand dollar donation for that one and that 's mainly towards um a small um get together on the way through the other one that they did request was a thousand or a small memorial um be erected within kershaw gardens and i do recall that over some time there has been many a discussion around what is kershaw gardens and memorials and that so that 's hence why it 's come back to the council table for that discussion around so thank you mr ceo um mr chairman of parks council rutherford it sort of kind of crosses into your portfolio area um yeah it does and i guess i hadn 't thought of it in that regard and firstly can i say i um i applaud this and i think it 's it 's good that we support it do i think kosher gardens is the place for it no no i don 't um i actually think the grounds here is probably the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um i guess the organization it you know it it represents the heart of of council um so i to me this is where the memorial should be not at not at kershaw gardens it 's um it 's just to help kids to see it it 's it 's through the chair it 's just not the council workers it 's for the workers generally from across queens i understand that yes and i and i get that but i think the council probably if you 're looking at where represents you know workers as a whole then you know city hall is probably probably it um so i think here is a better location um than kosher gardens can maybe i suggest we move suspending suspense standing orders so that we can um just maybe have a chat about this because i 'd be keen to hear other people 's opinions so procedural motion so one to do mr chair i 'd like to move the procedural motion that yes suspend stand in order move to suspend standing orders so all those in favor and that 's carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other people 's opinion on that well councillor i 'd be keen to go around the table but start with councillor smith oh yeah thanks mr chair um yeah i thought kershaw gardens but then i thought it 's it 's such a lovely space and you 've got plenty of room for people to go there park and go to a certain place that 's away from the playgrounds the other place i thought of was the botanic gardens there 's already a memorial there for anzac day um that was sort of another thing i thought of but the parking there is not real good i wouldn 't wouldn 't imagine there 'd be a lot of people go at the same time but i was sort of more worried about the small amount that we 're giving for this for something that important like we 've just given away a lot of money in our community assistance grants and i can tell you that a thousand dollars won 't buy much of a um i know it 's towards the memorial but i 'm not sure if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as big as that white outline there uh to put over not to upgrade a grave that we 're doing at the moment is is fourteen hundred dollars so the thousand dollars they 're not going to get much of a memorial yeah i think so probably to help council smith it 's uh just it 's not a memorial for our workers again it 's and so yeah the in discussions that ross has had with the unions they 're very very appreciative of the amounts that have been given okay i just thought that they were a small amount you don 't get much for a thousand dollars each month okay cancel kirkland um thank you mr chair yeah i i looked at this and i thought okay so it 's that we 're crossing over i think uh mr ceo you said to me that council touches on at least 10 different um union um affiliations and and so it is that council as council or other fed has pointed out truly is a heart of representation for that and i i hadn 't considered that moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea i also think if the messaging that we 're wanting to send is for the broader community to have access an opportunity to go there maybe families of connection somehow or people passing through the region who want to acknowledge that that there has been that loss of life in in their particular sphere of influence it might be more appropriate to be in a public park facility i was a little like councillor smith thinking that the botanical gardens would be a better place for that but again um reflecting on the size of of kershaw and there 's heaps of spaces there where you could put a uh a plaque is there any directive as to where they 're wanting exactly where they 're wanting to be a couple of parts sorry council kirkland i didn 't inform this we have stated back to the combined unions that we won 't have time this year to actually go through and actually construct a wrecked uh memorial or be contribute towards that and that would be a discussion from the 23 for the 23 event not the 22 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would like to have the event at kershaw gardens and i think probably if the event for 2022 goes ahead as they planned i think there 's further the discussion for the 23 memorial can continue over the next six months to find out what suits them because they 're happy to have that discussion with us but we just won 't have time for this this current year we 're not running it so the combined unions are running it so so we can go back them in relation to discussions around where where we can put that so that 's not a yeah well i 've had i i know from when we did the kershaw gardens redevelopment there was discussions around there was i forget the vietnam vets for veterans there was another memorial down in the end of the slab hut that was coming down there yeah i think it 's one of the shelters down further is um is for the veterans yeah and so it 's probably the broader discussions around memorial sites it 's probably what needs to be a broader topic for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got concerns every you know where do you place them what is the park meant for do people want some solitude to sit there and think you know it 's all these other type of things we 've got to think about as we go through yeah i think that definitely people like they 're having the the actual meeting this year or the the mum of their own um gathering memorial this year at coastal gardens it kind of sets that as in the minds of the people who are engaged in that that next year when it comes around that that would be the same space they would go back to and i agree with you that when people go to a memorial they do like to just sit there and reflect and think so it does it 's more conducive to have a nice park type atmosphere i don 't think that it 's crosses over anything we 've already established memorials in kershaw so why not i think it 's a perfect place council maters thanks very much deputy mayor yeah look i totally understand where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here but i sort of also feel that in regards to getting a large group of people to maybe come and have an event um does i 'm not sure whether the grounds is you know has the area to do that um but also once again i agree the fact that you know if it is a memorial there will be some people that may actually want to stand there and have some solitude and once again i don 't know if the town hall um you know offers offers that um i 'm i 'm i 'm happy to to look at other options when the time comes okay now um dear council wickerson and then councillor latcham council wickerson yeah thanks mr chair though i support councillor rutherford i think the intent or the purpose of crucial gardens wasn 't to become a memorial side um so we need to be think carefully about that but also that she said that the city hall is the center of our government so it 's uh places that are higher the importance i think as far as representing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i think when people go off to work or their families seek after work the last thing you expect to hear in some tragic circumstances that you 're you 're not coming home that day so obviously to um to remember those people that that have had that is terribly important honorable couple of things together on thursday last week through friday last week i happened to run into a man called gordon sue who used to be the principal groundsman landscaper the city hall but also hague park and a number of other high profile places and he was um nothing counselor fisher you know gordon very well as as well through horticultural circles he was heartbroken at the state of the city hall grounds when he was here many many years ago now of course uh it was one of our premier uh landscape areas as it should be being city hall so perhaps we can weave these two things together uh that we look at over time when resources allow of course uh to to probably properly landscape city hall back to its former glory there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a really special place then so maybe in time to come we can do that landscaping propose again and incorporate a special area that can have this memorial and maybe others as well uh to for people to come and reflect i agree with those sentiments and just to go back a little bit to the the memorial for vietnam vets at their commercial gardens isn 't it it 's more of a memorial reflective space than a um but a public space so this is where vets can go on their own generally and just have a quiet moment more so than a public memorial so just to clarify that but yeah absolutely support um city hall as the location for this fitting memorial thanks council latchum thanks mr deputy mayor and um i do support and i think castle rutherford does give a compelling uh argument as to why it should be city hall i guess i 'd probably also suggest given the association with the unions and stuff maybe labor day is it stapleton park that they they assemble maybe that might be a consideration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ option wherever the labor day assemble and then do their march so i 'm just a consideration then okay well i might i i too sort of uh share council rutherford sentiment but i actually was wondering about frankford park it 's actually a very attractive park area parking parking the union movement and that as well it 's a park i 'd love to see upgraded to a something be fitting of a prime minister through the chair um just today 's the first day back and i 'm not completely across the request but given that this is a contribution towards could we perhaps nominate that or generalize the resolution because have you just changed it oh good on okay um because the other aspect that is coming to the table is our plaques and memorials policy okay and remembering that we 'd gone through you know what parks would be applicable and all of those things so i just wouldn 't like us to jump into a particular site or nominate the site here today being mindful of that because i 'm sort of wrecking my brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy as well yeah thanks mr chair i think if we 're saying you know people are going to come and reflect uh probably will be a lot of parents of people that have lost their lives if they live here in rockhampton they 're elderly people we should think about seating around even if it 's just one seat at the memorial and probably if you 're going to put the memorial at city hall we 'd probably need to think about the seating might be not appropriate for there but i think we need to think about that in our future budget to put something there so people can sit and reflect because older people just can 't stand there forever they 're always looking for somewhere to sit down i was just going to move that we resume standing orders and if i could move the alternate recommendation please yes thank you council weaker wickerson councillor latcham can you hear all those in favor just yes yeah that 's unanimous thank you okay um move on to a next one is a notice of motion sorry can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they no they don 't so that might have been why they councillor fisher you might just like to read it so they know what they 're voting for councillor um latcham and wikis in the uh resolution is that council was retrospectively approved to support the conduct of this event of up to one thousand dollars in addition council will contribute a thousand dollars towards a memorial for the 2023 event a further report should be will further report be presented to council on the possible locations for a permanent memorial okay both this okay move on to the next one notice of motion um i think this is fairly yes there um and i think when the mayor 's back we 'll have a bit of a uh talk one of our upcoming workshops with with sort of the proceeds of of that meeting as well it was something that happened fairly quickly happy smith i have a couple of questions if that 's yes um i think mr chair understanding that this is retrospective and so it 's really um it 's a little bit hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is fine i just wanted to ask a couple of questions around this moving forward so that we we all are on the same page so i 'm expecting that as per policy ceo would have granted approval to this before um you embarked on your journey uh that 's my first question just looking at the ceo to say yes or no to that yeah i think it might have been roxas right um my second question is when we 're having a roundtable conversation with the likes of of bravos mining and resource management when we 're a roundtable meeting as you 're going is it is it anticipated that you 're representing all of our perspectives and our point of view at that or is it that there needed to be a officer present was there an officer with you no it 's just the mayor ourselves uh mayor uh myself and the mayor okay and uh look with with some of these it 's more uh of retaining those relationships it 's also there um is there anything in this one there should council be doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually do to assist us as well so there 's a number of ones but some of these uh probably this is not the right forum to actually discuss in detail as what was sort of discussed but there were some sort of key areas and probably the one that i can sort of say is the recruitment of rockhampton-based employees is very very much a problem and as we know they are just one of probably a dozen major businesses at the moment that really need more staff and uh struggling with that so um that 's that probably with the policy if i may say mr chair uh mr ceo it does sometimes say where the mayor has sort of requested a meeting and at short notice uh with the deputy mayor does sort of have there 's a couple of those difficulties that sometimes these happen so quickly that we don 't have uh have uh the meeting time and that 's why this one or where this one sort of came from yeah yeah thanks mr chair i didn 't realize that um mr mia was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around um you know if there was a representation of some promissory type information back to these groups that it needed to be there there needed to be a consensus from the table of whatever you might be promising to them you know with when when it says roundtable it 's like oh what does that mean what does that constitute is there an agenda so whether or not you know because each one of us go away to things and we we go to different meetings and it is always that we would represent our own personal perspective rather than all of the table no that 's probably quite the opposite there when you 're going like these you 're actually representing council so first yeah mr chair um effectively when council appoints a councillor to a an organization or representations of it it is to take the perspective of the council along to that okay uh right uh that that meeting so for example the mayor um at cq rock yes tries to take on all the boards of the i won 't say the interpretation generally speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point in time uh law mac would be the same cp b and g yes so it is that it 's not all not your personal perspective you 're appointed i understand that mr ceo yet with all of those things there 's been a there 's already been a consensus at the table for that representation to be had so we 've already said yes we acknowledge you 're going to go and represent whereas this was a spontaneous thing and i was just curious around that um and i did have one last question just around expenditure because it is retrospective it did say that there was 95 there but what was the total expenditure at the end of the day was there an amount um diamond maybe 95 the whole thing cost 95. so the event and the travel and the meals was paid for by yourselves what uh uh there drove up from the maize car and drove back in the mess carol in the one day um so on my behalf there was just the luncheon and that so it was sort of something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't quite read that way thank you council maters thanks very much deputy mayor i 've just yes quickly got a question in regards to the way the report was actually written i didn 't quite understand whether there was a round table taking place but is there another round table taking place just that it says that um you know a round table meeting with bravo 's mining and resources management would be of value to uh rockingham regional council the topics of discussion are as follows so is that just been written in past tense and that is the round table or is there another round table that is happening that that is being spoken about um the mayor did invite um david and uh ali and kate to uh to to rockhampton but like what uh the meeting they held about two years ago um just giving an update on where bravos is you know there is the rockhampton regional council has worked very closely with bravos for some time i have to admit the discussion was very very good and and very productive on those topics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a a chance to actually sort of talk one-on-one okay so it was very productive from that probably just adding to that straight after this meeting the mayor of makai also came and met with us as well and uh just talking about a number of uh areas as well so in that day we fitted in quite a bit uh mr mr ceo we did exceed that eight hours there i think was probably closer to uh 14-hour day that we we did sort of uh participate um just in that including our driveway a drive but it was a very productive day okay all right so thank you so just yeah to be clear that the what 's been talked about in this report is the meeting that has already taken place sorry if i could through how i interpret this is the invite to have a meeting me okay that 's yeah yeah okay thank you so no further questions so i 'm happy to move council smith give me sorry second council maters uh council rutherford did you have a oh no okay uh all those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh questions on notice neil any urgent business nil oh councillor wickerson yes thank you mr chair probably more of an ad than a a question but uh council through communities facilitates the homelessness connect event every year in the last couple years we couldn 't do that because of covert and we 've made alternate arrangements where we delivered care packages or food pampers around to very needy people in the community we don 't advertise this broadly because other than to send direct invitations out through the 40 or so community agencies that um have these people that say clients we don 't want people turning up there that that don 't need that service or that bit of a hand up so uh council contributes i think it 's five thousand dollars towards basically a makeshift or pop-up grocery store and we we package up food hampers i would like down the track next budget maybe to review that amount but in the meantime of these 40 agencies because we can 't give cdf money to ourselves but these agencies i 've encouraged them at a meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cdf monies if we have any uh uh monies left to contribute to this very wealth uh worthy uh event these are people that are homeless or vulnerable in our community as i think councillor kirkland has raised a number of times this problem is only continuing to grow with the current situation we find ourselves in so i just want to encourage councillors a couple of things on the day uh absolutely welcome to come along and give a hand on one of the um the various uh stalls or council stalls to uh to make the job easier but also when you see uh an application come in for cdf funds towards this project just to uh to give it uh the appropriate consideration please that 's the end of my ad no thank council wilkerson can you see that you know when um these days where we can assist uh that our uh support officers actually get those dates so

council we 've moved to the 15.1 the consideration consultation for the proposed closure of the smart hub officers recommendation is that the operation will cease to the smart up friday the 24th of june uh there is another alternate motion or another proposed motion that the council will cease operations at smart up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh operation model operational models up until the first of june 2022. cancers mr council officials can i i probably need to move in a second i just need to work out which one we 're moving in second first you know i 'd like to test the meeting that that council will cease its operations of the smart hub on friday 24th of june 2022 just at that i move seek a seconder take a second second and cancel the um speakers for the recommendation councillor fischer yes thank you mr mayor look i think this is something we 've been going around in circles for quite a while i believe that go this is something that we have made a very very strong decision that this was one of the areas of savings it was a luxury that we it was a luxury there that when we had the funds to be able to do it it was it was something that was achievable losing the federal assistance grants um meant that we had to make a lot of tough financial decisions so in doing that i believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we move on as part of this budget and i therefore seek the support of councillors for this uh resolution thanks council fishers uh speaker against martian councillor i 'm not sure whose light went on first there councillor kirkland um thank you mr chair the i think that council have certainly made the the right decision as far as needing to cease our funding of the operations of the smart hub however i believe that out of respect responsibility and because of our reputation it is that we should continue to extend the courtesy to those who are currently in the capacity and in the facility operating as the smart hub right now to present to us some other options i foreshadow an alternative motion if i may and if we could put up that alternative motion should i do that here defeated first this one needs to be defeated first before there 's a proposed foreshadowed motion uh another speaker for the motion council maters uh thanks very much mr uh mr mayor uh look i just basically wanted to repeat what councillor fischer has actually said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to um you know see these operations cease but you know it 's the costs that are involved and we have to uh find the savings wherever we uh wherever we can i understand what council kirkland was saying in regards to maybe some self-self-managed options uh but i am of the opinion that um you know we put a smaller working committee together who spoke to the employees and spoke to the um the tenants that are there and they have had our opportunity to come back to us with some other self-managed options i think there 's been 10 replies made and in amongst that there was only really one uh one that was stated uh you know that was an option put forth for self-managed so i would have thought that if that was what was what what was wanting to be happen that we would have uh received multiple more applications um thank you any thanksgiving there 's another speaker against councillor rutherford uh thanks mr mayor just to echo what councillor kirkland said you know um we 're not disputing the savings of the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternate motion would still see council step away and save that money but it does allow further discussions with the tenants the opportunity for the tenants to come together and come back to us with a way of of self-managing the operations there 's no skin on off and off our noses to to give them that opportunity and i think we you know as much there 's been some really really good things achieved by the smart hub and if we can continue those achievements via self-managed operation then that 's a win-win for everybody okay thanks councillor rutherford uh another speaker for the motion then no speakers uh tend back to council fischer as the mover to wrap up the boat yeah thank you mr mayor look this has been sort of something that we 've gone through a process the uh after the council made a decision that this was one of the areas that savings were going to be made we actually went to consultation we formed a subgroup that had sort of gone through and evaluated those feelings from the consultation and it was something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that even responded this is sort of something that i think in that alone showed that there was only a small core that were even keen to respond we have been sort of faced with an economic uh challenge and sometimes say we 've got to make those hard economic decisions so i 'm urging that councillors their support uh this motion though just i did sort of say that motion there is the council will cease its operations not that it was which yeah when i when i moved that just there and there was seconded by councillor made it was its operations and that it 's uh that this is one of those hard decisions that we 've had to make for economic grounds and that just urged council to support this motion okay thanks council fischer i think that 's the wraps up debate so i 'll put the motion those in favor those opposed the motion is it 's lost lost and uh there 's a lost on your vote nine would be four sorry five yeah merchants lost our alternate motion is that council will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friday the 24th of june and that it will consider self-managed operation models up until the first of june uh 2022 move councillor kirkland we have a second council of rutherford speakers for the motion thank you mr mayor i think that it 's it 's probably already been said and i i again emphasize that we we owe the courtesy to the those people who are currently operating out of the smart hub with that that model there to come back to to council and we 've given them a date until the first of june to come back with their respective alternative self-managed model and we are continuing to honor that the three hours that council needs to stand forward on responsibility respect and reputation at the same time affording us the savings that we do desperately need to be to be uh realizing right now question counselor no can you read that because i 'm not sure councillor wickerson and um councillor latcham can actually see it okay um i 'll read it again though that the uh this is the uh recommendation the resolution is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friday the 24th of june 2022 and that it will consider itself many job operational models up until the first of june 2022. uh move councillor kirkland second to council rutherford speakers against the motion council of fisher no no oh sorry oh sorry um any speakers against the motion council of kirkland there 's no speakers against motion uh would you like to wrap up or you 're happy to put okay councillors i 'll put the resolution those in favor those opposed motions carried unanimously thank you councillors uh we 'll move on to the next item oh sorry okay um councillors if there 'd be no further business i 'll declare the meeting closed thank you one for your attendance and um [Music] fine everybody joined the fun ain 't nobody left behind everybody [Music] [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] taking the good with [Music] blue [Music] hope it is [Music] you,"(-23.3786203, 150.5088889)"

islander people whose land is in the torres straits but who live and work on aboriginal land thank you councillors uh do we have any apologies now we have a full compliment um confirmation of the previous minutes councillors could i see you can move in a second to the accuracy of those move councillors smith second and councillor mothers i 'll put that those in favor against carried declarations of interest in matters on the agenda councils we have quite a few there so we might walk through those as we as we do uh first one there councilor rutherford would you like to speak to that one uh thank you mr mayor it 's item 8.3 and it 's money from the councillor discretionary fund i 'm requesting money to be given to the victoria park gymnastics and trampoline club for lighting of um a spotlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in that i coach voluntarily at the club and i will leave the meeting for the discussion and the vote okay thank you uh councillor smith another conflict of interest it 's regarding 9.17 which is in the additional agenda now morgan water supplies security and it talks about cutting water to mount morgan in this one and my nephew 's got a contract he 's a partner in the business contract to supply um to cut the drinking water to mount morgan and my brother 's actually driving the truck so i just like to deal with it by leaving when we talk about the matt morgan water supply because there 's money involved yep okay thank you and cancer that brings brings us on to my uh conflict i have a conflict with uh item 9.16 local government association of queensland uh the 25 to 27 october annual conference i received two complementary tickets to the local government association queens from the local government association of queensland for myself and my wife to attend the 2021 beef gullible on saturday the 8th of may are valued at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a civic role but i 'll ask the table to determine whether i participate in the decision on the matter about the conference allocation so if that 's okay um well i need to step out i 'll hand over to i 'll stay in the meeting i 'll ask the deputy mayor to um to adjudicate on that on that role that 's okay councillors look uh personally there i don 't believe that the mayor has a conflict with that particular issue and i would seek i would like to move that the mayor doesn 't and remain in the meeting seeker seconder councillor wickerson uh although anyone opposed i think all those in favor and that 's carried unanimously of the councillors so councillor fisher mathers wickerson rutherford smith kirkland and lachlan all voted ah in the positive council kirkland um thank you mr chair if i may just make comment this is another illustration of just how ridiculous and complicated um and and grey the areas of our conflict of interest are this is definitely something that comes into a civic duty and i don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would think that the mayor 's attendance at such a significant event is something that should be gauged by whether or not he receives complementary tickets i i think that it 's just the fact that we 're sitting here voting on this is just yet again another demonstration of of of a system failure yeah thank you council kirkland we all probably feel the same way with the frustration okay well thanks very much uh councillors that uh we 'll move on with the uh with the agenda items and uh move on to public reputations and forums as nil presentation petitions nil councillor and delegates reports will move on to item 8.1 leave of absence for councillor neil fisher from the 7th to the 20th of july 2021 inclusive i 'm happy to move as recommended and councillor wickerson second i 'll put that councillors those in favor gary thank you uh move them on to 8.2 council discretionary fund application for councillor saying council election uh the rockhampton horse riding for the disabled um i 'm happy to move as recommended secret second councillor smith i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ councillor discretionary fund application for oh sorry council rutherford you 're out of this one i was on a roll there [Laughter] okay um moving on to that one now councillor discretionary fund for council rutherford for the victoria park gymnastics trampoline club can i have a mover move against the wickerson second in council election put that those in favor against carrie thank you we 'll invite council rutherford back to the meeting mathers oh unanimous that 's right okay we get rather you 're right it wasn 't unanimous anymore it was um uh item 8.4 discretionary fund application again from council rutherford for the ridgelands and district sporting agricultural association incorporated uh have a move in a second with regards to that application move cancer rutherford second and councillor mothers put that days in favor against carried inflation was carried item 8.5 uh councillor kirkland um donna kirkland uh with an application for rockhampton relay for life for the cancer council question councillor kirkland um yes just wanting to flag there i 'm not quite sure whether it 's a conflict or not that i 've had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four years ago i was the president nope no not currently a no no no committee member no i don 't believe there 's a conflict there again it 's a great uh and worthy cause that um move councillor officials second in council election i 'll put that those in favor carried thank you moving on to item nine officers reports advance rockhampton 9.1 sponsorship of welcome reception to the nebc 2021 greg would you like to speak to that report please morning mayor and councillors so i engaged an opportunity for us this being a national conference and very much our focus uh being on economic development going forward we held this conference in 2018 i believe in rockhampton so we won 't get it back for a little while yet so i gave this as an opportunity for us to make a bit more bang for our buck in the region within queensland to continue as you know on on the journey of putting rocky on the radar out there across multiple markets so uh i thought there were three exclusive opportunities one being the platinum sponsor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was ten thousand and this one which i thought was a better bang for our buck and also less bucks at five thousand dollars for this i feel with an opening ceremony it was closing ceremony i 'd be worried opening ceremonies you do tend to get a large number of delegates attend uh those and i just felt because of the style of conference with the economic development professionals sitting mostly in sessions that a trades actually a trade exhibition other than having to staff that as well uh was just a better value for our money being part of this but also making sure that we 're on the on the national stage as a serious economic development player so i hope the rest of the report explains itself excuse me yeah uh thanks very much greg and yes the strike while the iron is hot i believe all uh well there 's great uh economic movement in the region i think it 's a great opportunity there to promote the rockhampton and uh our assets are what we have here and their capabilities and may i add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us to sponsor the welcome ceremony in makai but they welcomed that with open arms uh when i when i spoke to them recently so they like the regional collaboration side of it i think that 's uh yeah it goes a long way of the the positioning of council with that uh collaboration and i think that we find that there is a greater acknowledgement now when we we approach uh those other councils and regions uh see a couple of lights on so i 'll go to some questions councillor kirkland and council wickers and councillor kirkland um thank you mr chair uh through you um greg i just want to say congratulations on choosing this particular option i can see your thought process around that and agree 100 better bang for buck and congratulations on all that you 're doing i know that we 've had some feedback filter back through to us about some advertising that you chose to do down at a particular airport and well done so i look forward to having field feedback coming to us that rockhampton were well represented at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if through you mayor if i could uh that one pilot didn 't add as well it does include a a conference delegate registration as well uh which obviously we would have attended this conference anyway so uh you know you sort of factor that into the budget equation as well so yeah yeah reduces it when when there 's a ticket included there uh councillor wickerson question yep thank you mr chair through you greg does this also include a presentation by you like you get a speaking gig at it as well as is that part of the package formally no uh council wickson but i 've already started to work with the committee to uh convince them that one pull-up banner uh some videos uh and a speech is not really enough that i want more than that so by the by the time we get there i 'm hoping we will have our videos we 'll have multiple pull-up banners and a speech from me as well to make sure represent us as a region okay well well done thank you okay thanks again no further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regards to that recommendation councillor smith and secretary councillor wickerson i 'll put that those in favor against carrie straight over to you and greg 9.2 the amendment to the tender consideration for plan for the billboards and digital signage yes thank you mayor and this one is this is the third time this has been to council chamber we continue to grow this list uh so it came in 2018 and again december last year uh so the list of names you can see there because you don 't have the formal reports basically right down to georgie marketing were already approved by this chamber anything under stockland trust and down have been added this time around what this is about is i 'm sure you 're aware that billboards can be very unique in their style certainly very unique in their locations along the way council kirkland 's comment on the previous report is very relevant what by having this set up from a tender consideration plan has given us the flexibility to quickly move into canberra airport because i knew estimates were coming up and i quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in in the face of decision makers whether those be politicians or businesses in general that were there down there for estimates this month it also allowed us to move quickly into the makai market for the resources conference and it also allowed us to move quickly into the townsville market uh when we got a sniff that they might get the origin so i suppose i 'm embellishing probably the the benefits of this consideration plan but that that did allow us over this last couple of months to to achieve a lot by having that plan approved by you okay thanks so greg questions council smith oh just to comment mr mayor i remember when bishop billboards came to rocky the first ones that ever wanted to put a huge sign up on the corner of pittsburgh and east and it caused a lot of discussion and controversy and main roads didn 't like it but our planners put it through look look what 's happened since all the different ones have come on board you know and i think it 's great it looks we look like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can 't get enough of them yeah i have to agree with councillor smith look it was worth going through the process at the start but it does actually work really well probably the other comment i 'd like to make warren inch probably will not send you a christmas card this year he is so upset about being trumped at canberra airport i 'll leave the christmas cards for you guys i 'm here to make a few friends but uh along the way i 'm sure there will be people like that uh question counselor kirkland uh just a comment thank you mr mayor uh just to say that with all of the the exclusion of newspapers and those types of advertising that we 've previously capitalized on to get the message out there these signboards are becoming even more important for us to to direct people to the platforms where they can get the information that they need so absolutely support this that 's right it 's quite prudent um as uh as our demographics and things change going forward within that space i think we still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the changes but uh uh this is this is one of the pieces to that puzzle for sure okay council if there 's no further questions can i seek moving in a second with regards to the officer 's recommendation second and council of fish move council officials second and councillor mathers i 'll put that those in favor carried thank you thank you council moving on to item nine the officers report 9.3 or is it nine point one nine point three sorry uh yeah um counselor wickerson did you wanna talk to it at all are you happy for the officer oh just briefly mr fma uh absolutely support this application um if you look at the the report there this is uh i think eight or eight or nine events over a period of two and a half weeks so celebrating our south sea islander community um [Music] if you 've been down to to josh gilley and that everything to see it 's a vibrant community and also within rockhampton itself too so um this is a great way for the whole community to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to the recommendation i believe we covered the full ten thousand dollars for this uh application i think it 's one that um really uh shows the support from our council with uh with the csc island community it 's one that uh building those relationships and and partnering with them in such a special occasion for them would be seen as a great step forward on behalf of the council so i believe that we change that to it the fuller man um alicia would you like to speak to the report please thank you mr mayor and councillors uh this application uh has been made i think council because then just mentioned it 's a celebration that 's over two and a half weeks um i believe the nature of the community and the celebrations will be that there 's significant travelers that do come to town and enjoy our region so that sort of heavily awaits this application to get it over the line um happy to take any questions um really yeah happy to take any questions mr mayor thanks alicia um cancel i 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a second with regards to this report move councillor kirkland second and councillor wickerson i 'll put that those in favor against kerry thanks councillors uh moving on to the next item it 's 9.4 community assistance program a major sponsorship application for the women that fish barra classic and corp incorporated uh alicia did you want to speak to this one yes thanks mr managers quickly uh so this is a fishing competition for women which is excellent um but it 's the nature of the event that it should draw in people from around the country to do that um there was some concerns yesterday that um the purchasing for this event was all outside the region which is not the case i just had a review of the applications or sorry the quotations this morning and some of those certainly are local um again our our waiting criteria is heavily weighted around you know the promotion and how widely these things are promotion for our region as well as how those people that are coming into town to participate how many nights they 'll stay so this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the ten thousand dollars okay just before i go to questions i 'll just um make a comment there though we 've focused in through the recreational fishing development strategy to promote recreational fishing in uh in the region since their removal of the the nets and part of that strategy is about encouraging fishing competitions on the river and highlighting the fitzroy as a fishing mecca uh not only through those competitions but through the infrastructure and the whole strategy that we 've been working towards and part of that is supporting um supporting these groups as well so just put that out there before before we go to questions but um in due due concerns or any issues there i 'm happy to hear councillor rutherford um mr mayor a question to alicia and and then comment if i may alicia have we got any idea how many people from outside they 're saying will come because it says 120 participants so there 's there 's no indication at all from numbers of visitors uh back through the chair i would have to take that on notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comment while i 'm looking yeah there is uh council election did you want to make a um question thanks mr mayor um i guess it 's it 's about the the application itself that if uh if council was to approve the ten thousand dollars then overall they make a five thousand dollar profit and i 'd probably like to suggest that we just change it to a five thousand dollar amount not the ten thousand dollar amount so it balances and they can still hold the event i think the event is very significant um but i 'm not sure why council would need to give money to make five thousand dollar profit i don 't think that 's in the policy to say whether there 's a profit made um prohibits it um again no it 's a question yeah just to respond back to that council action uh what part of the consideration is around value for money it 's not unreasonable for these organizations to make some profit out of events because that then gives them the capital to work and to set up those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruled things out previously that um events would make a profit um also mr management sorry just further on that and that 's that 's the whole the idea is to to help these um events be alone without any seeking support if they can um generate enough revenue to come back then why do they need to come to council full support just supplementary for male mr man have we sponsored this previously like last year or the year before yes that goes against that argument you 're just talking about yeah yeah they have we have um i 'm not sure what the balance is at the at the end of the day um sorry lisa did you have something more uh yes mr mayor just in respect of the numbers so they have made no reference to um how many visitors they 're expecting from out but they have sort of made mention that it 'll be from northern territory new south wales having said that um there 's considerable variability at the moment with the way covert is i know everyone 's a bit uncertain to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah council rutherford so mr mayor the matrix assumes um at the minute you put something in a matrix about knights accommodation it it alters the amount so i 'm guessing that there 's been some assumptions made on very little or no information on our matrix system there i have absolutely no issues with the event i do have a concern the fact that we have sponsored this before and yet there is no money coming back in from that organization to this event so it 's totally on entry fees and money from council i also have an issue when an event in a budget charges a hundred and twenty dollars entry fee but gives away a hundred and forty dollars in free gifts and that 's not including the tinny that can be won and the awards so there 's something very very wrong and registers a five thousand dollar profit so that budget to me just doesn 't um it just doesn 't stack up in the one that 's been previously cancelled it 's the one same same process as what we 've done supported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but this it 's it stood out to me this time and and you know well i mean the matrix is wrong we 've all clearly uh understand that that 's the yes but you still should look at the matrix still talks about whether the budget stacks up or not alicia we 've there 's four independent people independent people that do an assessment on the um applications if it 's been able to get through to support how does how is that the case if council rutherford 's issue yeah so just to respond to that uh back through you mr managing counselor rutherford we do take these applications at face value um we 're not you know the when you say about assumptions for the ninth stage that would be the same for every application that comes through because there 's not always you know and we have talked at workshop about actually having some clothes out in terms of the acquittals to see the success or otherwise of these events so just being mindful counsellors that this is i guess the last as i see it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ click over to the financial year so none of the discussions that we 've had in workshop about how we could change this program has yet flowed through to the actual assessment panel so um they have done this assessment based upon they have done all other applications to be consistent and again it was the direction of the council to attract more more events to the region but yeah council rutherford well just a question because it used to be that um and i don 't recall it changing that there were parts of applications where council considered what in that application what they would take um as things they would cover and things they want wouldn 't so equipment they wouldn 't cover uniforms they wouldn 't cover so there was things like that in the policy when when the assessment was done they would go well that part that expense counts that one doesn 't that one doesn 't that does that does so that 's what used to happen is that not happening anymore yeah just to respond to that one mr mayor so those items @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the uniforms which is not the case where we consider um i think there was an application where we were paying for team uniforms that were teams that were outside the region so that 's in terms of um a something that was picked up previously for an application but there is no wrongs or rights around what is um not covered versus covered so that 's within the policy the other aspect just in this one is if we actually get our promotion on onto these shirts you know that 's good promotional material that will continue to promote rockhampton as that fishing spot um so it 's kind of this form of advertising that you get and it 's not just similar to a lot of conferences that you go to in terms of that promotional gear that is given it 's you know ongoing advertising yeah mr man i 'd like to move that council considers the major sponsorship application for the women that fish barrow classic incorporated for funding to assist with the staging of the women that fish barrack classic 2021 from 30th of september @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of five thousand dollars towards the event council election um now it 's been moved i 'll seek a move speaker for the motion um mr may the event um is a good event and i certainly don 't have an issue and it will go ahead no matter what um and i think the five thousand dollars will allow it to go ahead um equally as professionally as it was there 's nothing in here that that won 't allow this event 's been held before they 've not contributed anything back this year so whatever was made last year if anything was made has not been reinvested into this event and when you talk about promoting things you know ten thousand dollars in signage or whatever will do far more for us than having a logo on a a t-shirt on 120 t-shirts you know and so when you weigh up value for money um i don 't think giving people 140 free um stuff from 120 entry uh there would be very few other sports that would ever run that way i 'll speak uh against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this this one is where we realize that the matrix is flawed and we look we 're going through a workshop to to try and make it more uh more of a a system where we get a better understanding or rather than just trying to make assumptions but that said i believe that trying to do this one as one of the last ones of the financial year um is should shouldn 't be in that case but what i believe is that 120 it 's only a 20 difference if you 're paying 120 entry fee and you 're getting 140 in return then it 's only a 20 um increase of what you 're paying but also that the reputation of the fitzroy river as a fishing um destination is the thing that goes out far and wide and it 's the facebook um posts and the the the the stories that continue on from those uh events that um build the reputation of the area as a fishing destination so it 's not only this event that you see the benefit for and we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wider scale and the benefit that that brings to the region and as far as a fishing destination and to all the businesses and motels and hotels pubs and restaurants that all benefit when people come in here to to take a fishing expedition uh separate to these so i believe it 's a great promotional one not only just it 's a as and it 's not a sporting event it 's a it 's a sport in itself but it 's a one-off it 's not a club that uh that operates it on a regular basis compared to other ones so it is a unique in in that space really so that uh on that term i 'd i 'd support i i 'd support the full amount but uh that 's my speaking uh against the recommendation another speaker for the recommendation councillor latcham thanks mr mayor and yes i do support uh the motion that council rutherford has put forward basically on the basis that we 're all in support of this event and the five thousand dollars will still enable it to to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's no justification for the additional five thousand dollars um so as council rutherford said to possibly pay for t-shirts uh shirts etc which i 'm not sure that we get good value as a for the rate payers so um the end of the day i still believe we all support it we 'd like to see it go ahead and by reducing it to five thousand dollars won 't stop it from happening thank you okay another speaker against councillor fisher yes mr chairman i understand what has been put up as suggestions of why to cut this back but also understand the these events are more than just those that are tending every recent fishing event in the petrol river has seen national media you know we find that we 're getting those promotions that are setting the petrol river up and above our competing uh barramundi fishing areas you know the kurumbas the makai 's all of those who have got plans as well i believe if we we support this event like a number of the other fishing events this brings these as a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just in those attending not just those that are taking motel rooms but it 's also there our presence in the natural on the national stage and i think we need to keep that momentum because we do have communities like makai who are eagerly wanting to actually take our clan our crown and there are still the communities like in darwin that are trying to regain their uh crown as being the the best place for barrett so i urge our support um to vote against this motion and uh go back to the original motion okay another speaker for the motion now for the speakers council rutherford you 'd like to wrap up yeah thank you mr mayor and and i appreciate what you 're saying but both speakers against the motion have spoken as if we 're talking against the event and we 're not the event will happen it will go ahead and we 'll support it and it will be you know a very successful event but when a budget comes through that gives away 14 239 dollars in free souvenirs to the participants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's coming from out of town what this is going to do for us rather than having a great event um in town that that 's not right the money we give is to run events and to try and attack attract people here that additional five thousand dollars if could go to any other event that brings people to the region so this is not against the event it 's against the fact that there is items in here that i don 't believe the rate payers should be covering um and that the profit that 's been that 's this year if that had been the same as last year hasn 't been reinvested into this event okay councillors there no further debate i 'll put the motion those in favor those opposed councils will revert back to the original motion and then again we have i won 't and can i seek a move in a second for the original motion uh move council wickerson second and councillor uh made this councillor grecklin question um may i make a comment or is it too late to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that time i actually spent quite a deal of time looking at this particular application and i was at first at first glance a little along the lines of council of rutherford and latcham as expressed today but when i sat down and appreciated the existing matrix putting out of mind the fact that we will be coming back and changing that i felt that this was an appropriate illustration of how it 's so important that we get feedback from the events that we 're actually sponsoring to get some kind of gauge as to whether the money that has been invested from from the community was returned to them uh both from an economic importers as much as as as just to social input so looking again from with those eyes at it again i looked at the fact that it 's been pointed out that creek to coast fishing show the the um magazines naffa and bush and beach and fish and boat as well as the normal social media and and win news 7 news and social media would be covering this particular event i felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some kind of feedback with this particular 10 000 grant it it validated itself if those magazines deliver advertising and promotion of this event in our area i truly believe it 's going to come back to us tenfold it 's also an event that 's predominantly to promote women fishing it is an it 's a it 's an uh something that previously for many years has been a male dominated exposure and it 's it 's lovely to see that there is an opportunity for women to get this exposure uh in the community and and certainly encourage young young women fishermen to get out there and be involved so i 'm looking forward to the feedback from this event that will validate whether or not it receives any any contribution from us in the future thanks councillor kirkland um can we move have a move in a second for the oh sorry oh yeah sorry we 've got to move in a second so um council rutherford question uh yep if this if the money had been used for fishing rods to give someone an opportunity um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been to higher extra tinnies for people to do that i would not have had an issue at all canceled yep councillor wickerson thanks mr major just underscore what uh councillor kirkland said to uh this highlights why we need to review that the process and tighten it up where it needs to be and we 've raised this a number of times now how many of the visitors are from out of town because there 's a different multiplier for that um can we see the the data that comes back from the events rather than just the supposition that 's going to be successful so there 's a range of things and we think we 've covered that so this being the last one is is a good thing i think and from now on we 'll uh i 'll tighten that process up yeah and i 'll get that it 's probably a good example of why we need to need to fix it um probably last one before we go to the vote just um yeah we we do have other competitions as councillor fisher mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think the prize money there is quite quite substantial and you look at that as one of australia 's major um major events it gives you all things that are in when you pay your purchase ticket you get a lot more in return than what you do for your ticket um in my understanding but again we 're in competition with other areas for those those types of things so it 's about the reputation that we 've got in building that reputation anyway that said we 've uh we 've got to move in a second with the recommendation i 'll put that those in favor goes against who would you wish to record record kenzler rutherford and cancel latcham report their vote against the motion when i first read this and thought well how we might we might move on cancel we 've done that it was actually a side issue to that but not actually the boat as i wonder if we do we actually had a challenge as part of that of sort of makai and rockhampton or gladstone and rockhampton and actually have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the the lady councillors of mackay and gladstone as part of that tournament um that 's a real conflict of interest okay council we might move on to item 9.5 the contract for the operation and management of the mount morgan rail museum and visitor information center councillors uh john did you want us mr speaker that good morning everybody um here we 've got a report recommending um the on the reissuing of the contract for the mount morgan rail museum and visitor information center in summary in 2018 rockhampton regional council contracted the operation management of the mount morgan round museum to a community based organisation this contract 's due for renewal the recommendation you see is that pursuant to section 235a and section 235b for the local government regulation 2012. council resolves that it 's satisfied there 's only one supplier who is reasonably available and that because of the specialized nature of the services that are sought it would be impractical for council to invite quotes for the management and operation of the site and two to end to enter a contract for the operation the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centre with mount morgan promotion and development incorporated for a period of three years commencing on the first of july 2021 as detailed in the report i 'm sure you 've probably all read the commentary there part of the background is that this relationship commenced in 2003 and as it 's moved along there is recognition that the mount mpad was also fulfilling the role of visitor information center out of the one location which is nice and central and i think a good um i guess it provides economies of scale for that one side um you can see that recently that action and where the victoria where they were doing the visitor information center was formalized in a letter about a year ago and the intention of this contract here is to continue that relationship where they act as both the visitor information centre and maintain the mount morgan rail museum the fees we 're recommending just to move forward with cpi as the most recent fees and take questions if you would like thanks john uh questions ken saw election thanks mr mr mayor thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a what a marvelous facility is and and the service it offers in mount morgan as a visitor information center and you 've you 've supplied some attendance numbers that i 've had privilege to see and and it really stacks up it 's really such an asset to to the council and to the region um to have this facility and and i 'm fully supported by this thanksgiving election council wickerson um thanks mr mayor yeah also fully in support of this uh it 's such a diverse range of skills that the whoever manages the place will need to possess not only running a very interesting museum with a range of artifacts and history there but also concurrently running visual information center so i think the the likelihood of finding anyone else who could possibly do that is unlikely so absolutely support has moved yeah thank you council smith oh probably just a question and a comment about it um absolutely support this recommendation but i probably talked about this a few years ago need exciting signs to show people where the tourist information center is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there 's two turn offs to it and i know the second turnoff doesn 't have a very exciting sign so if they missed the first one they could see the second one i think we need to spend some money and put some really good signs up there because i see caravans going past my place all the time and they 're going up there obviously but i think like we know where the railway station is but they don 't where the information is and i think a few people in mount morgan would prefer to see it in the main street but i think it should remain where it is because it 's nice and secluded place where they can you know walk their dog or have morning tea if they want to etc it 's a great place but i think we 're not selling it to our tourists enough okay thank you okay council wickerson happy to move uh yes mr member but also to adam councillor smith said um we now have heritage as part of the community 's portfolio title and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to maybe put a promotional package around not only council assets that have a heritage theme but also some of our commercial activities you know dream time and uh maybe even the caves of capricorn caves outside area but just to to let people know that there is a range of things that they could do a whole heritage tour and pick up these places yeah when resources allow that 's right and uh also that the driver revive is up there as well so it 's another key component of it again making people aware that that facility 's there okay we um have a move at council wickerson to have a second a councillor rutherford i 'll put that those in favor against carrie thanks john i 'll move into the next item item 9.6 thanks john um to the chair thank you um here we have another very similar report um requesting that we contract the archer park rail museum to the archer park station and steam museum incorporated friends um same clause again that the council satisfied there 's only one supplier who 's recently available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and management archer park rail museum in with the friends of archer park station and steam tram museum incorporated for three years um you know i 've got there 's a slightly different in this commentary here there 's one thing to note that we 've been in communication with the committee and they 've asked that their fee be increased annually not quarterly up to a value of fifteen thousand dollars per annum the information that they 've supplied to us is it 's becoming increasingly challenging for them to maintain their services but also maintain the office the national office of rail safety accreditation one difference between archer park and mount morgan rail museum is that archer park rail museum association maintain certification as track operators and rolling stock operators in order to operate the perry steam tram which is the asset that we 've got there that does take very significant work to undertake they employ a part-time staff member to make sure not only are they open the hours that they 're open but also to ensure that they 're able to keep that certification it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the operation of both these sites council was very keen for both sides to have this certification the only one that was able to achieve that was archer park rail museum and it takes serious commitment from our workplace health and safety and operational standard in order to achieve that you 'll see in the content of the report i 've said that we 'd be granted permission to negotiate an increase of up to fifteen thousand dollars a year per annum my intention in that wording is that if there 's opportunities for us to provide a reasonable amount of support that may be alternative to cash it may be for this site not passing on electrical costs it may be not part of maybe not passing on water costs i would approach that in consultation with the rest of council who manage tenancies and sites to make sure that we can come to something that 's reasonably consistent in the way that we approach that so um and look they 've done a they along with archer park have done a very good job they 're also very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as possible they 've run the place as a small function and training center during other hours so i 'll just leave this report to the table for consideration thanks john councillor 's questions cancel election thanks mr something i miss right i 'm thanks mr mean um this is one of those ones where i 'm a little bit concerned and um i guess when we see reports coming in days before the contract expires i have concerns about that where we should be given a lot more notice and give them a lot more options to consider having said that one of my concerns is it 's only open 24 hours a week to the public whereas the mount morgan ones double that it 's 49 hours a week the costs are different between mount morgan and the archer park one the ones at archer park are significantly dearer than the and is that stopping people from going i know the attendance numbers are fairly healthy um but they 're the two concerns i have in particular we 're only open half the time compared to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to to look at do we put in a position a council position a paid position would that be a cheaper option or a more affordable option a more viable option um i 'm sure the the coordinator there does a great job um but should it be a page of it at 100 over 100 dollars a year surely a paid person uh is is a more a better option i would have thought ceo did you want to respond to that one it 's not a cheaper option not a cheaper option for us to cancel that okay no even though it 's only 24 hours a day or 24 hours a week council matter so just a bit of history this is a fall out from the dm album ocean so we used to have a paid position up at mount morgan and we had a service down provided down here as a part of the amalgamation cost we lost both of those positions out of council it would cost more than that to actually put a staff member in there and have that on cost in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services please correct me john if i 'm wrong so they 're providing both the experience through the mount morgan rail museum plus also the promotion whereas down this one is just the rail so there 's two different two different parts so through the chair um certainly i take your comment about the timing of it so certainly there the other thing to note is when you have a look at the um the contracts council took has i guess took a reasonably light touch about what reporting needs to come back what the expectations are because they 're not-for-profit organizations the other thing to be aware of what works so well and i guess at the perception there might be more activity at mount morgan rail museum is mpad the organization that we have that with also run the argus or their newsletter out of there so i can certainly understand what you 're saying one of the things that you might notice that i 've worded within the reports is that i 'm going to put a little bit more we 're going to put a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our historic collections which are part of that process so i 'm very happy to i guess raise your concerns about what we can do to get as much value as possible out of the two sides there counselor good through the community yeah help counselor would the um friends be able to do more than that the 24 hours john they may be able to do that and that 's sort of and i guess the why i 've put in we can negotiate to negotiate um the potential increase that 's one of the things that we can work through i mean within the past six months of everybody i guess coming back on board from a covert perspective there is a lot of uncertainty particularly in those areas and can they be maintained being open but always i think the balance of trying to get the best outcome for the income that we 're spending is will certainly be what we 've worked for yeah council miss three years john it i guess the the missing link i guess was we weren 't aware that there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after stuff so i just got the impression it 's just a paid coordinator and the rest are all volunteers they 're all friends of the village um friends of the of archer park yes it 's a paid part-time coordinator they 're not full-time and because it 's their relationship and their i guess their books and their business you know we you know be guided as to how much direction we need to give them for their operation okay thanks chancellor wickerson and councillor kirkland thanks mr chair just just some comments um john correct me i respect even if the place is open 24 hours a week that the volunteers would spend a lot more time there when it 's not open to the public there 's a huge amount of maintenance to be done and as we pointed out in the report the difference between there and mount morgan is you 've got that that live track element which in its own right is adds a lot more complexity but then on top of that again it 's live steam which is another thing again it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a whole lot of other ticketing and um and qualifications to keep up so that just the skill set involved in that is is a whole different thing compared to that that is true that is correct and my understanding when we withdrew when council had to with pull out of the services there council made the decision that we would not from a cost perspective undertake the work of being certified for rail and track operation so i guess this mechanism and this process has been through the flexibility that a not-for-profit organization has and the commitment of their association supported by a part-time paid coordinator they can achieve that outcome to have that tram running so and they take that very commitment very seriously and council through this relationship do have the benefit of that stem tram running so that 's the way it 's working at the moment yeah councillor kirkland um thank you mr chair i i think what a wonderful facility that we have here that 's run by both volunteers and of course as we 've established a couple of paid um members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to look after all of this equipment and to maintain it and to to meet the requirements of of that within the current management agreement um to balance those dollars out and still want to do all of that hard work i applaud these volunteers and i think it 's a fabulous facility um i do just want to ask though i note that you 've highlighted within your report john that there 's that request from uh the the friends of archer park to to see if we can negotiate that operation and management fee to the tune of around 15 000 extra per year per annum um what type of uh change to the to the admission fees would that reflect can you help me out no idea don 't i 'm not aware of that at the moment we haven 't worked it out but we can certainly negotiate that i believe the intention would be certainly not for it to increase okay yeah that 's that 's that 's yeah and through the chair my understanding is the the information that we receive without revealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delving into their retained earnings in order over the past couple of years to maintain the level of service okay thank you um through you mr chair if i may then is it necessary for us then to reflect in in the motion somewhere there about that dollar figure or is that open to negotiation i think we could have a further report that comes back and i believe it 's an opportunity for councillors to to do a inspection do an on-site inspection just for the new councillors to look at both morgan and archer park uh as part of a uh on the bus tour so it 'll be one that 'll give us a great opportunity but then from that a further report come back about how that what what options were available through that other uh funding mechanism there so we 'll just add a further dot point that uh that we do that as well sure okay that that 'll accommodate that then council smith oh you 're just a comment mr man i know we went through a lot of pain to hand it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know and i think well if they don 't do it who 's going to do it exactly who 's going to pick it up and they 've got the passion they 've got the knowledge now and they just live it you know and i think gee we we owe them a lot more than what we 're paying them really but um for the tourist part of it you know and it 's advertised like i go into baldy locals and and someone 's put it on there you know they they 've got people or that they they 're doing it themselves they 're promoting themselves all the time and half the stuff that they talk about i didn 't even realize that they did yeah cancer we just added a further um point or item there not uh two that uh the site inspection will be undertaken by cancers and a further report provided on the additional operational options so that 's something that we consider at that time council i think that no further questions to uh to john i 'll seek a move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of kirkland i 'll put that those in favor against carried unanimously councillors we might take a 15-minute recess and come back at quarter past thank you [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] do [Music] [Music] let 's go [Music] is [Music] [Music] do [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] now that we

there it 's good to go all right i canceled we 'll resume the meeting and move on to item 9.7 and ask bevan to present the report on the development application for a material change of use for the keeping of animals horse training for four horses thank you bevan so yeah like you said animal keeping for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our 24 murphy road cabral the proposal includes construction of a unenclosed shade structure it 'll be approximately 1200 square meters in size and access to the structure will be via an existing driveway to murphy road so the application was required to be presented to today because the nature of the use is rural but the zone is medium impact industry land in the surrounding area east and west is also in the zone that 's along boone gary and murphy road however land north and south is in the rural zone despite the varied zones though existing land uses in the area predominantly houses with separate associated rule uses with only a couple of small scale industrial uses occurring so the site is designated in a future industrial area in the strategic framework in the playing scheme however it 's known the existing industrial area of gracemew around the township still has a number of unutilized parcels which unlike the subject site these passives have access to council infrastructure services such as sewerage and water so from a sequencing point of view it 's anticipated that these sites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a viable option the development doesn 't involve a sensitive land use it 's not anticipated to be detrimental to industrial development establishing expanding or intensifying in the surrounding area or even on the balance of the subject site itself which is over 46 hectares no submissions were received against the application therefore the application is recommended for approval subject to the conditions outlined in the report okay thanks bevan councillors to comment uh mr mayor normally these types of activities are carried out on a rural property anyway and if you look at the map it looks um close to houses in in canberra but there 's actually a big hill between them and and those residences but um yeah i can see their point in getting the application through because it isn 't it is uh industrial area and they had to do the same to actually get their house as well but i 'm sure that it will be done professionally and look pretty good okay thanks cancer smith councillor rutherford um yeah once again i i support the application i think it it makes sense in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that um are the applicants aware that it is a medium so and so in the future they could have something beside them that um maybe isn 't compatible to horse training and um yeah they are aware but they actually got a house approved there a few years ago before this um so that was them setting up the site and they had to go through the same process through council as well so they are aware of that and i guess the way they could look at it as well like it presents opportunities down the track for them when those you know future industry area does go there and presumably you could even repurpose this um structure you know you could have trucks parked there and close it maybe make it you know so it has that ability as well so i guess in the intro for them it 's going to be tricky they 're going to have to go through these processes but it down the track it may present opportunities to them as well so yeah all right thank you mr may okay thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rutherford i 'll put that those in favor against carrie thank you uh moving on to item 9.8 the local uh authority waste management advisory committee lawmak membership michael would you like to talk to the report and cancel out him as a portfolio chair thank you michael yeah thank you mr mayor and good morning and good morning councillors so the purpose of this report is just to provide council really with an update on the status of lawmak the proposal to transition lawmak to an incorporated association uh and to also seek endorsement for council to continue to be a member of lawmak once it becomes an incorporated association so currently lawmak is actually a subcommittee of the northern alliance of councils which based on a decision made late last year by those member councils in the northern alliance of councils they 're actually changing their their name and constitution and looking to become the regional queensland council of mayors therefore as a result uh lawmak sort of finds itself in a position where it really has no uh legal existence once that change takes place so uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that exec um you know have had many conversations on how they 're going to ensure that lawmak has a has an ongoing existence um and it becoming an incorporated association is currently the uh the the preferred uh and suggested uh approach um so still a little bit to do in terms of going down that far uh currently reviewing the draft rules that lawmak would operate under which are currently which would be based on the the model rules under the association 's incorporation act and i would expect that at a later date we would come back to council once those rules are final and before uh accepted happy to take any questions um thanks michael um councillor 's question i am no comments just to support um mr mayor what michael 's talking about so um at the cairns meeting this was discussed and afforded to get to the next stage um under the association 's incorporation act and it 's just a progress through it so um lawmakes very very informative it 's it 's uh it 's very vital for where we 're heading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all the other northern uh alliance councils um and i 'd still like to add on just if council officials got anything added further he 'd like to add to that dancer fisher yeah i was probably just because i was chairman of the group i thought i wouldn 't make comment but mr mayor if that 's okay i 'm happy to um look what some of the benefits that uh being part of lawmak has sort of seen is even just some of the opportunities that rockhampton regional council has had with funding opportunities and and trials and and just like our organics trial at the moment but even just some of our smaller councils um at the last meeting paint back which we 've embraced here in rockhampton our neighbouring council livingston banana cannot even access that and we 've taken that on board to actually go to paint back into their chief executive officer and to say well look this is something that has benefit to all local authorities and cq rock local authorities gladstone rockhampton are not cq rock there are other councils so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to where they have admitted that they hadn 't been doing as to what their charter and their funding agreements with um the federal government so we can actually do a lot of good not just for the ratepayers of rockhampton which we are definitely getting a lot of benefit we 're actually doing a lot for our region which in turn has a lot of benefit for our region and this is happening you know in the makai the towns or the cairns areas as well so it is a lot of benefit not only for elected members but also there for officers so it 's been sort of something that i have to admit um is you know kind of got thrown under the bus after the last election i was the last man standing on the executive of lawmak so that 's why i kind of ended up as chairman and then we had the changes of the northern alliance of council so this next probably six months as we get lawmak as a standalone entity and a organization that actually their champions uh waste management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ queensland regional queensland we will actually uh see a lot more uh opportunities for our council and the future so you know it is sort of something that i 'm quite passionate about and even though my intention is once lawmak stands as a stand-alone organisation i actually intend to sit down as chairman and let the new organization then sort of go forward but at this stage it is sort of something that is a lot of value okay further questions councillor smith then councillor kirkland probably just say comment i just thought the annual membership fee 1862 was fairly cheap to remember they 've got 54 members so they don 't employ a so it 's all voluntary or secretary or treasurer or whatever the secretary 's actually uh is funded from that membership but only on a part-time basis and uh one of the successes and this is part of that restructure is we didn 't want to go to a group that became too top-heavy that we 've kept it very lean that is one of the reasons why a bit later we 've got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the executive and the members there part of it is that when a lawmak meeting is hosted the host council provides um those opportunities to to host the meeting and and that that the executive members actually do have to uh you know sort of impose on the uh the mayor and councils to actually have have to sort of uh travel to those meetings but at the other end it 's not like uh whammer there were thousands of dollars every year to be part of like some of the other organizations that we have in local government that are you know 20 30 50 000 this is very very lean but it does come with that little bit of pressure there that uh there is an expectation that you know those members do contribute uh in one way or the other and so far it 's been very successful over the many years and many at the early days um i i did attend a lot of the lawmak meetings just as an observer but it was just to uh to actually learn and and those networks so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i think the future is looking great particularly as we go into this whole new world of waste reduction and a circular economy thanks again councillor kirkland um thank you mr mayor yes i just wanted to make a comment if i might i think that these industries specific advisory committees are are actually quite valuable uh certainly uh when we 've got other points of view coming in as well as the opportunity to make that as you 've pointed out council of fisher industry specific lobbying that can can occur from such an organization so i support this motion okay if there 's no further questions could i seek a mover in a second with regards to that move council election second and councillor smith put that those in favour those against emotions carried um moving on to item 9.9 the fitzroy river water specialized item salt supply request thank you jason and councillor kirkland is the portfolio chair good morning mayor and councillors uh this report should be fairly self-explanatory some of you have seen similar reports from pittsburgh water in the past essentially we 've identified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we would seek to have council adopt as specialist suppliers for those items listed and the justification for that decision is provided in the table as well overall though the the reason why we do this is to streamline some of the procurement process on the basis that either we 've typically exhausted the known options of a similar type of supplier or similar type product elsewhere or we are on the side of trying to standardize to make decisions that essentially improve our ability to have the safe and reliable services that we 're charged with delivering so i 'm happy to answer any questions you might have about those um but um yeah thank you very much jason and to the portfolio chair council of kirkland um thank you mr mayor yeah i just wanted to make a comment really about contract renewals and um tendering processes that we 've got policy in place that where we will be reviewing annually i 'm that that is the case with this that this is not a permanent ongoing um fixed option here that i 'm wondering whether in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because we 've got the policy around it it might not be necessary to put it in there it 's got to come back to the table some of these so every year every year roscoe sorry he 's not with us ross oh sorry sorry i 'm just through the chair um council kirkland once you 've resolved for a sole supplier it 's just the one time once off for for these particular ones just for 12 months no no you 're for the for the life of the use of that supplier or the term of the contract that you agree to so if you agree to a if the term on that supply is three years then that a renewal process would happen in three years time that they would come back again but you know generally if you 're looking to standardize particular technology you really stick with that technology until a new you know a renewal process comes up for that okay thank you okay thanks very much cancer there 's no further questions i 'll seek a move in a second with regards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'll put that those in favor opposed carried thank you moving on to item 10 9.10 annual policy review purchasing policy acquisition of goods and services drew thank you good morning mayor and councillor so um this is the annual review of our purchasing policy under the regulation we required or council is required to adopt a purchasing policy and then we 're also required to review it annually so you can see the policy there with the proposed changes using track changes what the in summary what they are are just the addition of sustainable procurement whole of life cost and supply definitions reference to sustainable procurement in environmental protection as part of 5d which is the something that comes out of the regulation which are the the purchasing principles and then all the contracting principles and then there 's some other minor updates you can see in there with track changes happy to take any questions man uh originally straightforward that one drew any questions councils if not i 'm happy to move seek a second councillor mothers i 'll put that those in favor post carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk checklist annual presentation casino [Music] good morning christine would you like to present the report please good morning i remember to turn my mic on this time so good morning mr chair councillors presented to you today is the final risk register in the series required to be presented annually for adoption the fraud and corruption risk checklist has been reviewed by management and any proposed changes have been identified in red text one new risk has been identified this period and added to the register with the majority of the other changes relating to documented controls being minor owing to operational changes so happy to take any questions okay christine questions counsellors cancer rutherford not a question just to say thank you for a really good report yeah okay that 's probably an indication of a good reporters when you don 't have too many lights on and uh again i 'd echo those comments by council rutherford and uh could i seek a move in a second with the officer 's recommendation move councillor smith yeah second and councillor kirkland i 'll put that those in favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to item 9.12 fees and charges 20 21 22 amendments and hand over to mani thanks very much manny thank you mr mayor and good morning everyone um so you will recall councillors that we presented the fees and charges in its entirety uh to the 8th of june meeting there has been some subsequent changes that have been made to some of those fees and charges as were identified in the report mostly to do with the heritage village and also to do with the regional cemeteries these were detailed detailed in the background of the report just identifying what those changes were as well as a summary attached in the following pages so happy to take any questions in relation to those okay thank you i 've got councillor uh wickerson and councillor latin and cancer rather than council wickerson thanks mr mayor um i 'd like to propose a uh an alternate motion especially with uh heritage village fees now we did workshop this um a couple of weeks ago i think and some councils had to leave so they because it was a longer workshop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end of that um five dollars per person for adults did come up and i think there was a range of opinions around that so just going back a bit it 's my ambition to make the place a lot more activated uh and activation needs a lot more people uh we 've tried at 15 and i think we were making a profit of 24 000 or so with 6 000 give or take visitors uh per year which is fairly poor a range of reasons you know marketing um a range of reasons so i uh sometimes get a bit envious i look at the the zoo with you know uh 40 000 visitors a year um free to get in it certainly doesn 't devalue the product at all and and we 're very proud of the botanic gardens and the zoo but while we 're charging even five dollars to get in it sort of limits what other uh optional uh costs or so optional services we could offer down the track you can 't charge even a minimal fee of five dollars which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't increase the numbers of people it will just cut the the profit at the end of the day which wasn 't much to start with so technically got from twenty four thousand dollars down to eight or so which isn 't going to achieve what we uh want in the the long run so i think uh to to activate it to get hopefully you know ourselves 40 000 people through which not only is great to activate the village but it also gets the attention of well this table as far as future funding goes but also other levels of government too if it 's if it 's busy uh we we know that you know more people gets the attention of politicians when we 're looking for grants and funding whereas maybe six thousand visitors a year uh does not um the difficult with making um some fees and charges for these optional things at this stage is that we don 't have that product uh ready to go we have some things and uh just looking at uh what um other rates were on there uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right this minute we 've got guides out there we need to sort the volunteers out and work with them to make sure that that 's a consistent service but you know we have volunteers there now that can can run costume guided tours around we have vehicles that we could have optional uh rides on so if it 's free to get in uh right this minute we could put a price on how much a ride on the coach or the a vintage car or a bus or whatever uh would be other things we still don 't know what they are yet there 's some a lot of opportunities the low-hanging fruit if you like that we can get online very quickly uh with minimal uh costs for that you know not huge infrastructure things um just a bit of tidying up we could do that but there 's other things we probably haven 't identified you know i 'd like to have some time to work with volunteers and what that might be into the future and that 'll i hope continue to evolve so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this stage uh we 're looking to open the village uh very quickly i think it 's uh monday week john might correct me five weeks five days five minutes the fifth place today we should have rehearsed that uh so very certainly uh so we need to initially establish what the adult entry is so i like to propose that that is uh zero uh so free entry for for adults um the the line feathering is line seven about school group tours with a guide and the trend i think that 's a bit cheap just just with a guide ten dollars per person but if you 're going to throw in a ride on something or other out there maybe that should be 15. i don 't think we should undersell those option lectures but we want to get as many people as possible through the gate to activate the place there was a comment made earlier on that if we if we go to free now it 's a high risk because you can never go from free back to a charge if that fails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've done that before we 've done that with our garden waste uh it 's never popular to do that but it 's not impossible either so i think it 's worth trying this we 've tried it with a charge for a number of years i don 't expect that five dollars is going to achieve what we 're setting out to do so i think let 's have a go at making it free and then be really creative and put some effort into what those optional things could be to activate the place yeah wickerson would you think a trial of that would be uh review it in 12 months time to to see how happy mr mayor to make that a 12-month trial and and that 'll put some motivation back on on to me and the volunteers and staff to uh to really knuckle down and come up off some creative ways to value add to them yep and uh are you suggesting that the other minimum with ten you know a tram and a guide increase as well did you mention that then yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us if it 's freed again you can 't very well charge just because there 's more people that was there and i think that 's an attractive to get groups through so free is free uh but so uh line seven maybe make line six uh a school group uh with a guide certainly ten dollars but if it 's a with a guide and a ride so change everything yes seven to ten and ten to fifteen and three otherwise and i think it 's a bit premature yet to be talking about optional things i think that 's what we need to put a bit more work but but that said i think those those extra things if there 's going to be some sort of ticketing you need to have a bit of um uniformity so that it 's a bit like the show you buy a ride ticket a ride ticket thing that has the same value and some things might be two of those i don 't know but that 's that 's some of the nuts and bolts we need to work out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light 's on so councillor kirkland were there any questions to council wickerson 's man or do they have further yes uh councillor kirkland uh yes i do have a question and probably through you mr chair would need to go to uh someone from advanced rockhampton so if greg 's able to respond to this that would be great i just wanted to ask if not having an entry fee excludes us from being able to advertise or um any any funding applications it 's been commented before that we can 't make applica we can 't apply for certain things because we don 't have an entry fee up at the zoo so so i 'm just asking if that same thing would apply to heritage village okay greg can you answer that one yes mayor and councillors uh council kirkland i 'm not aware of of that uh the conversation i think that i 've mentioned it a lot is more they paid product and working with travel agents from a paid product point of view they won 't advertise the product or take the product on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a commission from that paid product as far as applying for grants not necessarily one that i 've come across that unpaid product can 't get grants because we 've gotten grants for for the zoo in in the past okay thanks cancer kirkland um council election and councillor smith and cancer rutherford or cancer oh mine 's probably okay council election did you just a quick one just to say i do support the the notion of free entry and the user pays i added added services just like the zoo has um as for the numbers that you 've suggested that 's here or there i guess so fully supportive of it cancer yeah just ask the question mr mayor um just below that it says note all prices exclude special events school holiday activities etc so we haven 't set a price for those at all like is it a separate price or um and what do we mean by special events i think that 's to do with wedding money is that to do with weddings and yes that 's right that 's where there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a bar 21st or heritage festival or something or something yeah there 's a special special prize for that yeah and so school holidays yeah thanks mr man just another question uh with uh councillor wickerson um what you 're saying to have it free and then you get the money out of rides but before say the middle of the week and you have a couple of tourists turn up they get in free but we wouldn 't be having rides all the time in those circumstances are you really talking about school tours or you know group tours well on those days ideally you would have a consistent service provided so we would need to get more volunteers on top of what we 've got now but ideally you 'd have those optional things available consistently if they weren 't available well you 're still free to get in and you have a self-guided tool you can walk around all day for free but if you wanted to have a ride on something or or get your photo taken in costume or or whatever that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd have it available when the museum is open so just another questions to me um just when i went to that volunteers um talk um the gift i got was that most volunteers only worked for lunchtime so is that what you 're saying we need more volunteers maybe for the afternoon at all you know yes we need a lot more volunteers you know through you mr churchill um because i think in in tourism which it is it 's also a cultural place too you 've got to have that consistency if we 're marketing or say someone comes through and they they get the best day of their lives you know they get a ride on things they get their photo taken and you know go and watch the blacksmith working in a range of things and they tell somebody and then the next person comes back and they don 't have that well but then we get some negative feedback so that 's a challenge that we need to get enough people that we can consistently offer that ended we don 't want to bite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to grow that so that we can sustain it yeah okay and i didn 't have a chance to look back the opening hours what we were proposing can you remember yeah i think that 's a different report i don 't think that 's on yeah we 'll take that on a note counsellor yeah councillor rutherford um different issue if i could please and it 's just probably um to make sure it hasn 't fallen off but we were also going to look at the standpipes um there was a change in the cost of the standpipes for the water and we were going to look at that i thought ross through the chair we got a workshop next tuesday to go through all the fees and charges and we can certainly jason might have some information for that but um that was following what we understand was council wanting to look at all the just have refreshed everything but and through that process there may be some others that will be raised as well which we can then come back to but now they 've already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay i just didn 't want it to fall off full off because it was one that was raised along with these and we were addressing these but it didn 't come up yeah yeah this one 's more about the due to the factory opening before that workshop counselor okay council latching thanks mr man just uh to address um councillor smith 's concerns about the the availability of rides and stuff if we look at archer park train museum they only have it on sundays from 10 to one i think it is is all they actually offer the rides so it just shows that obviously you work out when you 're going to make these these rides available and obviously ideally if it could be open all the time great but it may be that you lock in certain days and times yep and um put a review in after 12 months okay right um right then councillors if there 's no further questions i 'll um seek him over in a second now move council wickerson second and cancel election we 'll put that those in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oh yes yep sorry um yep um dave 's opposed cancer rather than awesome yeah sorry cancer wickerson speak to them mr thanks mr mayor and i i certainly understand um where councilwork isn 't is coming from and um his passion here my concern is that you know our budgets are really tight um and we compare this to the zoo i 'm not sure if we were ever doing the zoo nowadays we would have made the same decision to have it have it free um it 's historically that that way and it works well that way and and i support that i 'm just not sure that it 's the model that we should be copying um often it 's difficult when something is free whether you undervalue that product i do have a concern the information i have is that the likes of tripadvisor and bookings.com those types of sites where a lot of tourists actually go to prior to leaving town to see what what 's in a place to visit will not advertise something that 's free because they get no commission from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um to advertise outside of the area and i think that 's really important for the heritage village i also think that once something is free it is really really difficult to come back from i would have preferred maybe to trial a five dollar one and see if that had an impact and then um you know in a year 's time look after after that but yeah that 's my thoughts okay thanks yes rather another speaker for the motion uh council watching thanks mr mayor um your monday markets is probably a clear identity uh event that is free and i 'm sure it wouldn 't exist if it wasn 't for free it 's here it 's life as it grew um other other things that council does which are free of libraries and the what and the like and it 's just part of what some things there 's some things that council does that just has to be free my concern is if we if it 's not free is that um the market days you make it five dollars for the market days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go down that pipeline so i 'm very concerned about a five dollar fee for market days i 'm concerned about a fee at all but i think we should be looking at trying to work on the positives and trying to find activities and experiences that that people will love and be happy to pay five ten dollars for if it 's a morning tea with a billy damper and and billy t and damper if we could do that consistently that might be a product um amongst other things that people are happy to pay for but to get into entry into it free is is where i 'm heading with that one thank you okay speakers against councillor kirkland um thank you mr chair uh acknowledging what you 've said there uh council election but also noting that each of those examples that you gave are very different from the product that we have at the heritage village in mundy markets is certainly a market in its own right it 's not necessarily and you know opening up the opportunity to explore and and go through and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and picking up there on what councillor rutherford said about the value of the product i used the illustration once before about if we put a couch outside our house and we put free take it away it sits there for months and the minute we put a dollar figure on it it gets stolen because it 's all of a sudden valuable and that is no different to to this product we need to make sure that we put a value on it to of course be advertised in those trip advisor and other magazines we want to make sure that we 're reaching all of the the people who are touring through our city to have already looked through those magazines and targeted the heritage village as one of their stop goes the other thing is i 've continued to advocate and i will continue to do so that to provide everything for free for our communities is not sustainable we need to obviously look after those assets and manage those assets those ongoing costs involved as we need to augment them when they 're you know popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're seeing the pain of that up at the the zoo and the botanical gardens so we 've got free facilities we 've got free kosher gardens there 's so many other wonderful places that people can visit for free certainly mount archer and it goes on and i think that just a five dollar fee is is a nominal fee to pay it just sets that precedent which i think is important i 'd like to go back to the original as it were um proposed by our officers and another reason for the second points there that you 've pulled out with the schools i 'm concerned that we 're going to ostracize the smaller schools from making this an affordable event that they can go out and and enjoy by putting that price up per person putting that price up just that little bit is going to to stop the schools from being able to continue to enjoy the facility it previously has been a very big capture of the schools and i don 't want to see that get less just because we 've tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree that we want to activate this area we want to see more people come to the village but i tend to agree more so with councillor rutherford here that we need to trial that that five dollars and keep keep the precedent of a charge for the heritage village moving forward okay thanks councillor kirkland any further speakers for if not i 'll go to the mover councillor wickerson to wrap up yep no thanks mr chair um the other three places that we 've mentioned kosher gardens and and mount archer and and the library and botanic gardens and zoo again i look on and just see how popular those places are um with envy you know all council facilities of course but i would love those same even to get close to those numbers at heritage village um i take your point that councilor kirkland that um you know we can 't give away things for free and and i agree with that notion uh but i think this is probably more clever marketing that it 's the only thing that we 're making for is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead now i 'm i 'm confident and it 's going to take a lot of work and comment on that too that we could at least match that fifteen dollars per head in other ways and probably exceed that if you 're getting if it was ten dollars that we get on each person but you double the number of people uh the math works out that we 're still going to be a little bit better off but a lot better off so i think if we 're aiming to activate it and uh to make it busy and and attract funding from other sources i think that 's why we make it 3d in the gate i do take the point about triple guys and other marketing and it 's always been a bit of a sore point for my view that you know we spend considerable money on uh one-off events you know i won 't mention my number major festivals that we have lots and lots of money whereas the marketing budget heritage village has been 20 or 25 thousand dollars so it should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gates so obviously we need to look at that other than just a free entry to get more people through and i think the um the cost recovery will be there but it 'll be in a different a different form so uh you know stand by my first recommendation okay councils uh that concludes debate i 'll put the recommendation those in favor those opposed nations lost are you in favor say casting vote i 'll have to support the original recommendation cancellers so that motion 's lost and we 'll revert back to the original officer 's recommendation um my um thoughts were that we we review this in 12 months time give the uh get the village open again and then work on some of those proposals and how we can better utilize that going forward um and the comments were coming back from a moving tour an entry fee from a free proposal something there do you want to register against here we 'll record the uh the vote so it was uh could i just get those sorry just to clarify that original one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay because that 's actually that original motion is referring to the schedule within the report so when you go down into the report yep gone too far it 's actually saying that the adults are 15 is that correct how i 'm reading it amani five sorry sorry definitely sorry we 're back to that so we 'll just go back to the uh to the to the emotion uh that was lost uh and people have voted uh in favor uh myself cancel the mazes again in favor for the first one the first one yeah sorry yep myself councillor wickerson our councillor oh sorry having one of those days uh both those of you in favor were councillors fisher councillor wickerson councillor smith and councillor election sorry councils and uh those that voted against were councillor mothers uh councillor kirkland council rutherford and myself and i used my casting vote to so technically we didn 't call a division so there was no division called no so recording all the names so you yeah no no sorry so it 's just that people wanted to record that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a division has been called so sorry cancer is a bit uh confusing then um okay so we move on to the original officer 's recommendation and can i seek a movement um i have a question yep please um so i i just not sure why um where number six says group minimum of of ten with transport no guide is seven dollars so why are they paying extra than the five dollar per person so can someone yep john would you be able to answer that one please yes through the chair the premium from five to seven dollars per person so a premium of two dollars is we actually provide transport around the site oh okay and the next one about school groups is the reason that we don 't with school groups is it a tram and a guide they 're then paying a premium of five dollars over the just standard entry price of five dollars okay all right so that transport is basically the tram yeah or and then it and then if we needed to get something else we would do that as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side thank you thank you okay councillors could i take a move in a second with regards to the original motion um move councillor kirkland second and council matters i 'll put that those in favor those opposed opposed council election you want to record it chancellor smith record council official record there they voted against the original recommendation thanks council sorry for that we had some confusion around that but we managed to get there thank you we 'll move on to item and councillor smith sorry yeah um item 1 9.13 the budget summary management report for the period ending the 31st of may uh thanks very much manny thank you mr mayor so presented to councillors today is the summary budget management report for the period ended 31st of excuse me 31st of may attached the income statement and the key indica indicated graphs total operating revenue was sitting at 97 of the budget compared to a result of being around 91.7 on the monthly basis and this is contributed by the rates and charges being at 99 of the budget grants and subsidies uh behind budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial assistance grant which is has now been paid in june the interest revenue is ahead of budget at 98 as well operating expenditure is eight at 86 of the revised budget with employee costs and contractors and consultants both under budget at 85 and asset operational under under budget at 84 percent as councillors are aware we have run through the monthly the main monthly budget review as well and we 'll be presenting that to the special meeting of council on thursday for the budget to adopt some amendments to the 2021 actual budget so that will impact on where the where the results end up for the financial year our capital income is sitting at 80 percent of the revised budget and expenditure is at 65 we saw um may reach spend levels of 9.6 million through the month and as we discussed last week with think we 're forecasting that our capital budget will end the year at about 120 million in spend which is a reduction down from our original budget of over 170 million and our revised budget of 1015 million that was adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the end of may and our loans are sitting at 121.7 as we communicated last week the loan borrowings for this financial year have been drawn down as of last friday so that balance will now change and it will show a very different amount for the june figures happy to take any questions okay thanks manny um very confidential report and up-to-date information cancels any questions through the chair tomorrow if not i 'm happy to move seeker seconder councillor i 'll put that those in favor those against carried thanks money uh item nine point one for the regional council of mayors membership invitational um pretty self-explanatory council it 's one where there 's uh council 's been invited myself in as a as the mayor to uh join an organisation that 's looking at um somewhat trying to challenge what the southeast corner of mayors have been doing for a number of years and basically looking for opportunities to work in collaboration to advocate on behalf of the northern queensland so we 're stepping out of another number of other organizations so um funding wise it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's just uh one that i 'm supportive of and i believe it 's something there that we we need to be in the tent rather than being out of it and it 's something that we 've as a council has been um uh that direction of more collaboration and advoca advocacy uh taking you know our region forward the best way we can so on that i 'd um take questions or um counselor rutherford happy to move mr happy to meet second councillor fisher there are no questions i 'll put that those in favor against carrie thank you moving on to item one 9.15 uh council delegation of the ceo thanks very much alyssa good morning mr marin councillors this report is seeking council 's approval to delegate various powers under the land act 1994 to our chief executive officer essentially it 's been triggered by an update that has come out from lgaq and you 'll see an attachment to we 've marked up in red the differences to our existing delegation register under that piece of legislation and the changes that that review has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're quite procedural in nature such as registration of leases and the like i 'm happy to take any questions should there be any council 's questions no lights on happy to move councillor smith to seek a second council of kirkland i 'll put that those in favor as opposed motions carried thank you thank you moving on to item 9.16 the local government association uh queensland annual conference 25th to the 27th of october 2021 makai councillors the recommendation is that we take two councils with voting rights to the mccoy entertainment centre and that the council 's the delegates with voting rights at that on behalf of the rockhampton regional council there 's no oh there is an application for certificate of service submitted to council fisher which is a great achievement council official i suggest you be one of the delegates that we uh that we attend the meeting and uh submit the conference motion um prior to the animations prior to the 16th of august councillor fischer lights on yes mr mr chair i think that uh this conference is very important to rockhampton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that when the conference was on in gladstone it was only myself and councillor swarton that didn 't attend but i think this one there i think it 's really important that yourself uh as mayor and myself uh attend but also the the offer to other councillors to attend i think it would be very good just visually to see that we 're in support of our neighbouring council our council and also there just shows that that that support of uh regional queensland and i think with that i know as mayor you will be whisked off to that many sub-meetings during that event and i think it would be very very good if fellow councillors even if it 's not for the whole conference but could actually attend today 's conference but i think this one is very very important for just being part of regional queensland and being one of the key players so i 'd like to sort of move that uh mayor and myself um to attend plus also the opportunity for other councils um i would would attend but i 'm keen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in i 'm very mindful of our budget going forward um i think we probably need to to look in-house a little bit more um this upcoming year um i understand that the local we spend a lot of money in the local government association space so it 's it 's prudent that we do have good representation there but uh just being mindful if there 's other other conferences or things there that we may normally go on if we can start to lead by example uh and and start to look in house a bit more as we go through with this budget into the end of the year so um if another council wished to attend this one then they may need to step back from from other other conferences so to speak but um look i 'm happy to to be nominated and councillor fisher councillor smith uh yeah i would like to go and i think i don 't put my hand up for once far away i think we sent four last year to gold coast uh with mackay we can actually drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the dialogue we 've opened up with last bow and basin mining club lunch we actually sat with mackay councillors and opened up a lot of dialogue and discussion which was very interesting in a lot of ways so i 'd really like to go and i think being so close that we should really support it as well if we had a function here in rockhampton we would expect to see mackay councillors as well councillors the uh you know i understand we 've got three um new councils on the council as well and these the this conference the lgaq one is very um important to to both network but get an understanding of local government and the the issues that we 're dealing with so it 's one that i wouldn 't oppose new councils attending councillor kirkland um thank you mr mayor as soon as i saw this come through some months back i ear tagged it in my diary regardless of whether or not there was an opportunity to have my name quit here today i fully intended on on a tent on ongoing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a great opportunity to see the new innovation that 's being introduced by other councils right across the board it 's a great opportunity for networking and meeting people so long as you you take the time and make the effort to do that so i was more than happy to pay for it myself if i needed to i was just putting that out there that i was going yep sorry sorry counselor yes and again i think with the portfolio from councillors it 's great understanding of what improvements are in other councils that we could possibly introduce into air region as well so especially in the areas of water and waste they 're uh they 're big big cost items and we need to be mindful of the innovation and technology changes going forward in that space as well but learn from other councils about what 's happening in their regions as well about how we can position ourselves going forward with regards to that uh council of latin and councillor may this cancel election thanks mr mayor fully agree with what 's been said here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go to the old gaq last year and and i do believe it was very beneficial it was a starting point to understand more about local government and uh and fully supportive of that i i guess i 've had to in the last 24 hours think about what 's important and we do only have a limited amount of funds to go away for the full 12 months and obviously i 've got to prioritize what is going to be more valuable in my role of waste and recycling portfolio and and there will be something that comes to the next council meeting that i believe is probably more i know is more important than the ldaq as much as this is very important i do and obviously i 'll be presented at that time i 've obviously had to work out what 's what things do i have to i have to make compromises and what 's going to work and what 's not while this would be ideal for especially there 's going to be a lot of challenges in waste and recycling in the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levy in next year but possibly in in to add on to what council fisher said maybe there 's an opportunity to to at least represent the region at the gala dinner it might be if that 's something that meets the appetite of the table um where at least i 'm up there with with the rest of the councillors who are up there um i 'll leave that one to the table at the time but um that 's something if we 're looking at supporting one another in the in the regional councils then and more than happy to have that considered councillors put through the chair you 're right worth it would be ideal to have all the council who will be attending no matter what part of the conference it is to do it today so you get early bird registration and also the bookings can be known yeah just as the change the policy from six weeks ago eight weeks ago it requires the council approval yep and again council we have your your budget so just be mindful we don 't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduce that i 've especially made an effort not to uh to step outside the region as best i possibly could as the mayor but i believe there 's some times when we need to represent our region and this is probably one that um we will be recognized if we can have more people down so council election for you but as i said i had to make compromises i won 't be able to attend the full conference but if the table um if the table it meets their appetite too thanks very much mr chair i 'd just like to say as a new counselor i was in uh interested in going to this just to get a lay of the land unfortunately i 'll be unavailable to attend all right thank you again i think that 's probably uh next year 's one um if your only advice is probably worth extending that opportunity to go to one at some time in the next couple years uh councillor fisher i 'm happy if there 's no further debate to actually move as okay move councillor fisher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put that those in favour i suppose carried unanimously thanks councillors movement tonight just ask a question um council is councillor kirkland had the opportunity to actually be appointed on one of the the water uh advisory committee uh as with lgaq because i haven 't seen anything come through council officials it would be worth like for maximum enquiries it would be really worthwhile because i know that at this conference there 's going to be a number of streams of sub meetings and it was sort of something that i was i was on during my time and i think it would be very beneficial for us if council kirkland will um we 'll make uh make those arrangements if there 's possible to uh in the background there about that it 's uh prudent though and uh thanks for raising that cancel fish it 's worth worth having a look okay council of moving on to item um 9.17 of mount morgan water supply security thank you jason oh you have a conflict in this one councillor smith this this is one you have the conflict with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ councillors um i know you haven 't had a lot of time to read this report and apologies for that but i 'd like to take a bit of an opportunity to step through the content of the report with you it is fairly simple and self-explanatory but if i start with just the commentary section first the first paragraph is very self-explanatory we 're at the point now where we need to increase the water supply security for mount morgan it 's it 's just an important part of ensuring that that community community can actually be sustainable the evidence of the last few months has indicated that that even that is potentially at risk let alone whether or not there 's potential for that community to grow and develop so that 's a really key part of that that first paragraph uh the second and third paragraph step through the reason why the reasons perhaps why we 've gotten to this point and we really haven 't seen significant rainfall up in uh that catchment area really since sort of in the second part of 2017 when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've slowly worked through the provisions within the drought management plan and eventually reached level six which is an emergency supply level of water restriction we 've then moved on to implementing a contingency supply arrangement which is the use of tankers to deliver water from greysmir to mount morgan some information is provided there you can see the expenditure to date it 's a very significant amount of money as you are aware we 're working through quite closely with the queensland government the relevant water department as well as the queensland treasury corporation in terms of seeking some degree of financial support for that expenditure so we 're we 're working through that process and uh that that will continue as long as is required to ensure that the community has a supply of drinking water for their needs so the final paragraph there of the commentary section again you 'll all be familiar with the fact that we met with the community and some representatives of the community back in april it was actually a very positive meeting in many respects it gave us the opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community representatives um and they made their thoughts and feelings quite clear and obviously post that meeting council made a commitment to move forwards and complete some work which is is generally in line with what you 're receiving today so the background information there in this report again i 'll just step through that really briefly it 's important to actually capture some of this context some counsellors won 't be too familiar with the regional water supply security assessment that was published in 2018 that 's part of a i guess a suite of very very similar analyses that the queensland government championed and those analyses were done in collaboration with the various different regional council water service providers um and so we had quite a close level of involvement in that the outcomes of that regional water supply security assessment are quite clear and i 've actually included some information there for you uh that some in this instance based on meeting demand of approximately 380 mega per year the historical data and the modeling associated with that analysis indicated that the likelihood of a water supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was less than 100 years so again that 's a statistical analysis it 's a theoretical consideration the reality is we 've we 've seen a water supply failure happening now and it 's certainly longer than one month and it could be obviously several months which simply means that again those statistics are a guide we 've got a real-world situation now that we need to to manage um the contingency could i just get a take a question first sorry just before you go too far um on then so we 've basically had two failures in 20 under 20 years do we know when pride we have records when prior to that there was a failure good question councillor the the records that we have are really very scared and part of that is because that when the dam was raised in the late 1990s that was probably really the first time that we actually managed to get hold of really reliable storage level data and you could almost argue that in part the supply failure that occurred in the early 2000s was was in part due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity to fill the new larger dam capacity up to the extent that might have might have helped get through those years nonetheless that was an extremely dry period all around most of queensland and so the likelihood was that there potentially was always going to be a water supply or very close to a water supply failure back then as well yeah it 's a very difficult question to answer based on very limited data yeah yeah i just i 've figured you know it 's a bit like floods we 'd had sort of one every 20 years and then all of a sudden three um in ten so i i just yeah what was curious and through the chair what that does indicate though is that it indicates the reliability of that statistical analysis is probably quite poor because we 've got a limited data set available so yeah okay thanks jason thanks mr chair uh look in that regional water supply security assessment and uh in some other reports that council may or may not be aware of the contingency arrangement of tankering water was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emergency water supply scenario and again we 've known that was the case which is why it 's proven to be relatively straightforward for us to implement that however and as you see in the text there in that paragraph you know whilst this might be an acceptable option uh for a very short term basis it 's clearly not something that can be sustainable long term and again touching on council rutherford 's point if this ends up becoming slightly more the norm rather than the exception then you know it 's certainly not an acceptable arrangement for mount morgan so i guess getting to the the main part of the report itself um counsellors we 've we 've discussed and have previously workshopped some of the options for increasing the water supply security in mount morgan the table number one there in the report lists those in quite brief detail you could probably write a very long separate report on every single one of these options and i think the purpose of today is not necessarily to go there but i want to make sure that councillors are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table one generally represent because it 's important to just get a little bit of that understanding now so that when we move to the next table and then the final table associated with the multi-criteria comparative analysis that you then are looking at that analysis with some reasonable understanding of what those six options actually entail it 's very easy for me to stand here knowing probably much more in-depth detail about those six options and be thinking that you 're aware of those as well so what i would suggest is that if there 's a need for some a little bit of clarification or questioning of any of those six options now it might be worth spending a moment or two on that perhaps you do understand them very well i hope that 's the case probably one question um to jason is the the number one the nine-mile dam would would i know there 's a huge cost to to do that one but would the catchment be a wider catchment and more reliable than than what the number seven team is yeah uh mr chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the catchment and the numbers do escape me but it 's it 's significantly greater than the upper d catchment it 's i think maybe in the order of five to six fold larger i would add though that it generally is a fairly similar catchment with respect to the climatic events that then influence the rainfall that falls in those catchments and part of that catchment is what supplies water the fletcher prequel here and so we generally have a fairly good understanding of the if you like the frequency and the volume of flows that pass down fletcher creek suffice to say that yes it 's a larger catchment area but again it 's it 's likely to be limited with the respect of you know those broader climate events and drought conditions that 's essentially going to make that catchment behave like all of the catchments in that near and local area thank you cancer rutherford ah thanks mr jason i i think um the fletcher creek area is high alkaline if the dam was built at nine mile creek would it be likely to be high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not best placed to answer that completely at this stage however we know that some of the water quality that 's prevailing as fletcher 's creek is is interrelated with the ground water quality there as well so and obviously the prevailing geology of that area immediately around fletcher creek might be slightly different to some of the other upper parts of that catchment area i don 't think anyone 's really looked too closely into that but when you do construct a storage dam if it 's mostly filled via surface runoff typically that water will be a slightly better quality than if it 's significantly influenced by groundwater but again it 'll be a function of whatever that geology is upstream of any new dam site thank you okay council kirkland thank you mr chair jason just with whilst whilst the water levels are down can i just ask a question is it is it going to be dredged and cleaned out whilst whilst that 's at its low level um i see you nodding so the answer to that is yeah councillor copeland through the chair we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably might not realize is that the um even the scope to do that right now isn 't as significant as as you might realize partly because whilst the storage itself is perhaps down around that six to seven percent mark at the moment there are still some areas which aren 't particularly easy to access and so the the best value for money in in digging out or excavating the dam is to do it around some of the lower levels which again are still quite wet and still quite difficult to access that 's where you 'll get the best value for money from removing additional material that 's accumulated or simply has always been there so we 're certainly looking at that opportunity we 'll be once this decision is made i guess then we 'll be in a position to consider exactly to the extent that we go ahead with some of that work it won 't essentially bring us new water results because again that 's that sort of becomes redundant if it rains significantly in the dam filter we might see some slight improvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incremental that it 'd hardly be worth doing thank you jason yeah just if i may throw you mr chair yes i acknowledge that it 's not going to necessarily give us any more um any more water however i just wanted to highlight it whilst we 're here with that conversation it 's a question that 's come up in the community and it 's good to have you answer that today and and i can see looking at what you 've presented here to us that there 's a clear indication of two options and so i 'll let you continue but just to say that i think this is a discussion here happening today that i 'm i 'm excited to be having i think we should have had it a long time ago uh thank you council rutherford um mr may just to follow on from the dredging of the damn area there and you said you 're likely to go ahead with with that if it 's um completed it 'll actually probably more along the lines of clearing out rubbish or built up vegetation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were to flow through and fail up some of our existing infrastructure or accumulate in areas where we don 't want it so there 's the opportunity to actually do some sort of cleaning up and overall maintenance of some of those areas now that they 're accessible which is fabulous to hear that in itself but i was just curious given that i think our quote for murray to clean up murray and yepen was a million dollars um have we got that budgeted for i 'm not sure i 'm not sure cancer and um through the to jason that what what type of dollar figures were you i don 't anticipate it would cost anywhere near a million dollars but again that 's something that we 're not um we haven 't been focusing uh strongly on that at the moment but i suspect we 're going to get plenty of an opportunity in the coming months as the water storage level continues to decline to get in there and survey and work out exactly what we can do once um some of the some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks jason back to the report please yeah thanks mr chair again just for the sake of of the exercise um you can see those six options the nine mile creek dam the augmentation of number seven dam which is associated with some potential modifications to the the dam structure itself which would be normally done and will be done as a part of our dam safety compliance requirements or albeit the deadline we have for that is 2035 so it 's not something we 're required to do immediately augmentation of fletcher creek wear the use of treated mine pit water to augment number seven dam the construction of a drinking water pipeline or the construction of a raw water pipeline with or without a hydro electricity inclusion so council is the the next part of the report talks a little bit about the multi-criteria comparative analysis methodology that 's been used in this instance there are a number of different ways of doing this but it 's essentially a way in which you can try and as much as possible create an apples with apples type of comparison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered and based on a scoring methodology that tries to treat those different criteria consistently so as you can see they 're in table two and this is by no means an exhaustive list of criteria but you can see that in in general terms we 've captured ten of probably the most significant criteria that that would be part of an overall decision-making process or that would be significant factors to be explored for the development of a detailed business case but already at this early stage it 's quite clear that if you use some sort of a scoring system and in this instance it 's a simple one to five scoring scale where one indicates a strongly negative rating and five indicates a strongly positive rating that you can score each of the options with respect to those ten different criteria that are listed so there 's a little bit of a description of what those criteria relate to i won 't step through all those in detail but i 'm happy to take any questions perhaps at this point prior to moving on to the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jason on that section that 's all right thank you wonderful thank you okay councillors um there 's just a brief bit of commentary around some of the previous decisions in this respect and there have been a number over many years um but but i guess in part this is is perhaps the most important decision that um i think we 'll make today with respect to this matter budget implications some brief summary there as some of you be aware there 's a line item in the proposed 2122 council budget that is some money allocated to progressing this work the legislative context again is is reasonably simple from the point of view probably back to the budget one though um jason that 's allocation is only for half of that amount in their budget or is that for the full allocation are we seeking some uh assistance with a business case yeah through the chair the latter there i believe we 'll be seeking some matching funding if we can so i think there 's a one million dollar contribution from council at this stage with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that amount so yeah and that 's that 's obviously something that um as soon as we get through today we 'll be communicating with relevant agencies about yeah yep uh see peter 's come online there peter did you want to make comment on that yeah look i i was just gonna make a comment that we do need that we will be seeking state government funding and we have to do it in partnership and to align with their framework requirements for this kind of infrastructure this money will allow us to start the strategic assessment component but we will need additional funds to do a full business case okay okay thank you thank you very much jason yeah and look just listen to the context and and again this is not just my view this is very much the queensland government 's view is the way they see it um you know we are the water service provider we have the overall perhaps the final responsibility for ensuring um you know water supply meets requirements for mount morgan a little bit of commentary on staffing implications which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the corporate and operational plans are you know full of references that relate to um to this matter and the conclusion speaks for itself i think so if if we may then if perhaps it 's time now to just turn to table three and uh happy to step through this again counselors the the point of this is not just sorry jason just canceled right no it 's uh my question was on the table um so i 'm happy to wait for jason to step through um i thought i 'd missed it but if we 're coming back to it that 's fine uh can we put the table on the screen if possible it 's it 's a bit um fuzzy oh there you go look at that okay well uh thanks very much jason that uh lady to walk through that now all right thank you thanks mr chair so counselors probably uh the first point to make here is the scores that have been entered into the various cells in the table here they 'll always potentially be a little bit subjective today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ degree to make sure we 're entirely happy with them having said that the purpose of today is to glance at some of those scoring and see the comparisons between the scores for some options versus others it 's at the end of that it 's the total score based on those 10 different criteria for each of the six options that forms the basis of as much as possible using the methodology to determine which which are the preferred or which is the preferred optional options okay so it 's easy to look at the total scores listed in the far right hand column and see the outcome but if you do then just glance across you know for example for criteria number five environmental impact or benefit you can see that the drinking water pipeline and the raw water pipeline have achieved quite positive scores now you might be thinking why is that aren 't we going to rip a big trench through half the countryside to get a pipeline up to mount morgan well generally generally speaking that 's not an activity that creates a significant environmental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a drinking water pipeline or a raw water pipeline actually has the potential to totally change the way in which number seven dam and the d river work right to the point where the dam as it is right now essentially has killed off stream flows in the deep river it doesn 't flow even if it gets significant rainfall up there normally it does it puts a meter of storage on the dam and there 's very little flow downstream of the d river that alone reduces the potential for further remediation of some of the acid impacted parts of the river it obviously limits the amount of water that 's available for water holes downstream so there 's all sorts of environmental outcomes of the positive nature that are related to trying to return some of that stream flow that the construction and then the raising of number seven dam has you know deteriorated council rutherford yeah thank you because i 'm a little confused now sorry jason in that i thought the drinking water pipeline would feed the reservoirs it was not going into the dam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dam storage is that if we 're let 's say we 're pumping a megaliter of water up from grace mirror each day then that 's water we don 't have to take out of the dam from the dam which means the dam storage level will generally stay higher and then with any inflows due to rainfall events it 's much more likely that there 'll be spilling events and there 'll be downstream flows in the d river okay so that because because my original question was how come they got the same four and four when the raw water pipeline on the face of it would have given a much better environmental outcome but i see i see where you 're um you 're coming from there so thank you um just one more question and it 's about the number seven damn um augmentation because it scores very high but i thought we said it didn 't actually solve the problem while it made it better it didn 't solve the problem and yet when it 's scoring at 27 it makes it look like it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why that is is because again it 's as simple as comparing criteria 10 which is about the likelihood of long-term success i think that 's the point you 're alluding to which i agree because all it is is simply just providing some improvement on our ability to increase the storage volume and therefore slightly increase water supply security even with that did we really think that it 's likely to be a successful long-term solution no because it relies on that same climate dependence of the current dam storage yeah but all those other criteria are relatively favorable well i 'm sorry no you 're right except that um community recreational it 's scored the same basically but if there 's no rain then there 's no recreation in the dam as it goes down correct so i don 't see why it scored the same why it scored high well three is a pretty neutral score on a scale of one to five so it 's not it 's good for one oh sorry where are we looking the seventeen so number two oh okay yeah so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because if you let 's say the solution for that augmentation option was to actually raise the height of the spillway or the dam wall ever so slightly that meant that essentially the full supply level in the dam is higher it just means that there 's more likelihood that the dam continues to have water for a longer period of time so that 's a that 's a beneficial outcome for the recreational users of the dam just means that more of the time the dam will have more water in it than what it currently does now and that 's partly because as the dam 's shaped like this that little bit of an increase in storage level right up at the top of the width of the dam is worth as much as that much in the bottom of the dam so it 's a potentially um you know very large improvement in water security and just um an increase in the amount of availability of that recreational reserve mr mayor one more because i 'm not sure we 're comparing apples with apples with that that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one really only works the same as the damn now as long as that there 's rain in the catchment area so and it just extends the life um and so sorry sorry could i just say we have to do that work anyway isn 't that part of the dem management it 's not really an option to be considered so really no but i 'm worried when it scores so high and if if state government or someone is looking this at this and they go oh well there 's an option and it 's scoring only one point below the others um that it becomes an option when we know it 's not a viable option it could be and sorry to interrupt but it 's as simple as this so right now um let 's say the dam 's at six percent that equates to about 200 mega liters if the solution to option number two meant that by raising um you know the spillway crest by three or four hundred millimeters we got another three or four hundred megaliters of water all of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold 500 mega liters instead of 200 which means that we still might be actually using that supply and it still might be more availability of water for recreational users so it 's it 's a positive improvement rather than just a neutral one three is a neutral score four is a positive improvement it 's just for that reason that there is the likelihood that there 'll be a greater volume of water there for continued use for recreational activities counselor kirkland um thank you mr chair i i tend to all of those those things are great the most important ones are community growth and development and the likelihood of a long-term success not discounting community recreational at all because that 's part of going to contribute to the growth and the development of the community i come down to options five and six jason and through mr chair would like to ask jason if the both of those options have also got benefits of perhaps water reaching other areas other than mount morgan out there and what who those people would be and what those areas would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth and development is specifically left generic so yes absolutely and no doubt this will be probably part of what 's included in any detailed business case is to assess what those opportunities are for the um the two different products that are listed there one 's drinking water one 's raw water there are obviously different implications of different potential uses of those two products and no doubt that will include whoever else might or might not be interested in gaining access to that new infrastructure so i think that 'll be a key part of the business case preparation just in the same way as you cast your mind back to the rookwood weir project for example it was all about well okay who 's going to use this water who might be interested in you know buying it and so on so yeah thanks jason thanks council kirkland just probably one for myself is on the risk project risk for number five um being much higher than the others is there a reason around that jason yeah so the reason why and let me just explain that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated with the design and the construction of the infrastructure the reason why the drinking water pipeline has actually scored us a slightly lower level of risk high level higher level it 's a three no no it 's it 's less negative one 's on the ones on the worst side yeah good side oh right oh okay i 'm thinking i was in the but the reason why i 've put that in that regard is that maybe from a slightly selfish point of view that 's what we do that 's what we 're familiar with we have some significant experience when it comes to the design and construction and operation and maintenance of relatively long pipelines pumps you know pump stations reservoirs and so on yeah it makes sense sorry my bad no no that 's fine yeah thanks uh council election thanks mr mayor i guess um just looking at the whole thing i guess the big thing is going to come down to cost as it always has and i just fear that if the cost is going to be way too prohibitive what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just keep cutting the water until it rains let 's see you know and continue with that if the costs aren 't become too prohibitive and there 's no support it 'll be that 'll be the end result but i mean that 's that 's why we 're going through this process and in the report it 's saying that you know that the longer these dry spells continue and is transporting water bulk water a long-term solution which obviously it 's not and having this report gives us the ability to be able to advocate and lobby to to look for a permanent bulk water supply thank you mr chair there 's still the possibility or the though i don 't really like to say it but the detailed business case could be prepared and prepared in collaboration with the queensland government and despite our best efforts of trying to seek you know funding from different tiers of government they may simply just say no business case doesn 't stack up either council needs to work out what their preferred option is on their own or the um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a possible outcome although i think i think there 's enough potential in certainly the two higher scoring options for there to be some genuine genuine value created in that new infrastructure yeah and that 's the process we 've committed to the community to uh to undertake and but you 're right jason there is that real real possibility that that could be a potential outcome at the end of the day okay uh thanks jason did you want to holla anymore with uh that report at all i don 't think so i think the recommendation is is quite clear and um yeah thanks councillors okay thank you councillors uh kenza fisher yeah and well i 've got no issues with what the recommendation is there 's still probably the elephant in the room is what is going to be the end cost per kiloliter to those that reside in that area and that i think is something that we 've got to take into consideration as well you 've got a a very very poor community and the cost of providing that water and the impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the impact that it could have on the whole of the rockhampton region and it 's probably the one area there that i i think we should also be balancing that 'll sorry if i hook the answer to the chair that will come out of the business case that 'll be involved yep and just briefly through the chair you know interestingly right now it typically costs between 300 and 350 000 per year to operate and maintain the mount morgan water treatment plant so potentially that is a cost that wouldn 't be incurred on an ongoing basis so yeah okay well thanks uh jason councillors uh the officer 's recommendation is there and the recommendation is that we progress with the business case on options five and six and we progress that could i seek a mover move councillor rutherford seconded councillor kirkland uh councillors uh is there any debate if not i 'll put the motion those in favor unanimous thanks very much councillors that 's great great outcome okay we still have one more item to be dealt with in two more items in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did cover what we were looking for and um very uh informative forgot about hey kensmith welcome back okay counselors uh we do have a confidential items on the agenda sorry well sorry notice a motion so notice motion item 10.1 i 'm jumping the gun uh notice motion council fischer to be approved to attend the lawmak meeting executive meeting in macquarie 2nd july 2021 councillor smith um yeah i read this mr mayor and i think um council officials should stay tonight i 've driven up and back in one day to a barwon basin morning club lunch and eight hours traveling in one day is too much and i believe that a one night 's accommodation should be included in that as well so i think that you know the fatigue sector look we can just do it we 'll just do that we don 't need to be in there it 's probably just part of the recommendation cancer so council smith are you happy to me yeah so it doesn 't need to be in there because everything 's got to come to the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the next meeting councillors where we 've got the council appointed committees or groups that will give that go through that approval process there for travel yep okay um move cancer smith do we have a second up council election we 'll put that those in favor i suppose the motions carried moving on to here we got the confidential no questions on notice no urgent business close business closed session it 's uh item 14.1 a property matter that the meeting uh be close to the public to discuss the following items considered confidential in accordance with section 254j uh three of the local government regulations 2012 for the reasons indicated can i seek a move in a second uh move cancer may the second and council wickerson i 'll put that those in favor against carrie and that pursuit of uh to s-511 the council meeting procedures meeting moves into closed session and the meeting be closed move council officials second council smith i 'll put that those in favor nation carried thank you the meeting is now [Music] i wanna see how the world

councils good morning officers and mr ceo welcome to the wooden council meeting uh for the 22nd of march 2022 i know we have council workers since here he 's probably just grabbing a cup of tea and we um we 'll hold the hold the seat up against the other foot i haven 't had any apologies there so um reasonably comfortable we 'll have a full house so moving on to confirmation in previous minutes uh could i seek a move in a second with regards to the minutes meeting held on the eighth of march move councillor kirkland second and councillor smith any uh discussions around that i 'll put that those in favor oppose emotions carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the agenda council of kirkland um miss mary i just want to flag that i have checked with ceo with regards to um whether there was a declaration or not with regards to um item 11.3 it was determined that there was no conflict as my children have sold that property just recently okay thank you thanks for that clarification councillors have been ruining me i 've jumped over the acknowledgement to catch me my apologies i 'll go through that now if that 's okay i 'd like to begin by acknowledging the traditional custodians of the land which we meet today that are humble people and pay my respects to the elders past present and emerging i also extend that respect to our neighbouring aboriginal peoples within our local government area the gangalu nation people the bharata kabubara and yetimarala people uh who and uh also acknowledge the torres strait islander people whose land is on the torres straits but they live and work on aboriginal land thank you we 've got to be a little bit less uh eager and uh to push on but uh that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so apologies again uh business outstanding nil public forums reputations nil presentation and petitions nil committee reports 9.1 the audit and business improvement committee meeting from the 10th of march 2022 could i seek a mover in a second with regards to that councillor election secretary councillor mathers i 'll put that those in favor opposed motions carried thank you councillors moving on to item 9.1 oh no sorry a little bit of a meltdown with my computer at the moment too so this thing bear with me moving on to item 11.1 the budget approval for the r1 software as a service subscription so asked brendan to speak to that one good morning council rutherford thanks brenton all right morning mr mayor councillors uh the report and recommendation before you this morning is uh to approve budget allocation for our r1 software as a service subscription uh with technology one commencing the first of july 2022 uh council has been utilizing the technology one solution since about the year 2000 and the move to our software as a service model where the solution will be hosted in the cloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ software solution now the approval of this budget allocation for year one will enable the execution of the contract to commence the transition project it 's therefore recommended that council approves the additional operational expenditure of 376 414 dollars for year one uh for the r1 software service subscription with technology one commencing the first of july 2022 uh and if approved this amount will be included in the 2022 uh the 2022-23 operational budget happy to take any questions thanks brendan question councillors councillor wickerson and councillor kirkland councilman thanks mr mayor through you i had to read this a few times and just to understand what we were getting for the extra money and correct me everyone but it 's just making it easy for the supplier it 's all cloud-based now rather than the way we had to do before unless there was some emergence we could keep it as it is and then call people in for any emergent uh patches or whatever for the software but i i didn 't fully understand we 're making it easy for the supplier who has a bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other bits and pieces of our software that we 're we have no choice but to go with the same supply unless we throw the whole system out and start again like so i guess the question is there 's some competition out there that we might do better i know that 's a massive job uh but it just seemed i couldn 't understand what we were getting with extra money other than to make it easier to the supplier of the software yes it is one of those situations where the supplier or the vendor in this situation has has us in a position where we need to move with what they 're suggesting they i suppose from their business model uh which i have been talking about for quite a long time is that they 're moving to that whole software as a service uh is the only way that they will be providing their solution so um we yeah we don 't have much of a choice at this particular point in time apart from as you 've suggested is to look at competition out there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utilizing is touches so many points across council and you are correct in saying that to move and look at competition is a major outlay it 's a major amount of resourcing and effort to actually to look at replacing that and then actually going through the implementation of of changing that as well so yes it is one of those situations where over time as we get more and more services in the cloud it will enable us to reduce our on-premise footprint but what 's we 're in this transition process where we 're handling with our own storage our own compute on premise uh in our server rooms uh and as we 're moving some of those solutions up to the cloud what 's we 've still got to maintain now on prem that 's where the savings aren 't going to be realized until such point where we meet we reach a tipping point where the majority of that is in the cloud and that 's uh going to be a journey you know over the over the coming years as i believe that more software @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it is easier for them to maintain the development of their solutions in the cloud and then not having to also deliver the solution for on-prem and support that as well so that that 's the nature of where the industry is heading in this situation yeah that 's what i thought but i don 't like it that we 're sort of back in the corner we have no choice but what are you going to do other than maybe down the track look at competition competitive solutions for it are you generally happy with with it i mean yeah look the technology one solution is um is out there among numerous councils it 's always been difficult because everyone 's at different parts of their journey within the process some elements of the system are further generations ahead than others so you 'll know that we run probably more of a best-of-breed solution so we 've only got components in tech one we also use other vendors for our property and rating we use another vendor for our payroll and our mapping and that as well so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our strategic plan has been to consolidate our systems as much as possible so that we 're only dealing with the one vendor but it 's about looking at the uh the functionality of those systems and make sure that um the solutions are meeting what the requirements of the business are so yeah no understandable thank you thanks again kirkland um thank you mr mayor i i too had similar questions and queries too to what my colleague councillor wickerson had but i also feel that the strategy of the it space i suppose of of the organization is necessary for us to to continue forward with and the reasoning for that of course is of course utmost is our cyber security and to make sure that we don 't have any areas where we 're easily breached and that 's all a part of that strategy we are a little beholden to the experts in it i don 't think there 's anyone at the table here that would testify to knowing more than anyone in the it department so brendan we really appreciate the fact what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to this is the only direction for us to move forward and i 'm certainly happy to move forward with that um just wanting to make comment to it really mr mayor thank you okay thanks again kirkland councilman council smith uh thank you mr mayor through you two brendan uh i just wanted to ask in regards to the um uh the requested um 367 000 um for year one what ongoing costs are there over the next few years well i suppose what i 'm asking is is that figure going to reduce over the next few years um or is that going to be a standard fee that 's that 's the standard fee and then there 's a cpi base increase on top of that as well including there 's some variable costs in there also in relation to um storage costs so when we move to a software as a service solution you pay for what you use so as our system continues to grow as our records grow the storage component also grows so therefore there 's additional um it 's not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution so it will require us to be a bit more stringent in in our archiving and record disposal uh practices to make sure that we are not holding on things and certainly when we 're paying for them in the cloud like that um that we are working through the proper processes and disposing of records when they 're required to be or no longer required so that we aren 't um having that additional expense certainly i understand that just another one mr mayor so the our our existing r1 uh system that we 've got now what 's the yearly cost of that compared to the 376 that we 're looking at for yeah so there is um there 's an additional um about 350 000 that we pay for support and maintenance so that 's our that 's the development of the solution along with us being able to ring up and get support across the organization what isn 't clearly identifiable is the cost of us running all of that within our system so you 've got license costs our own server costs our additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult because we do that for multiple systems so to try and extract that out into each individual system is a bit of a an exercise in itself but that 's why i said if volts we 've still got to do that for a number of systems we don 't see that saving until we 've removed that component all together and and that will be a fair way down the track as well so okay yeah i understand because it did seem like it was going to be considered the system would to start with would be considerably dearer but you just touched on something that was also a question i had as in regards to the licensing fees we know i think ceo was saying how much um each year our licensing costs are growing going up will this help some of that will the licensing fees maybe be reduced or would we need less or are we still going to need still gonna have to pay those same licensing fees so yeah you pay a perpetual license to actually use the system this component is for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storage on our behalf along with all of the other backup security so they run a you know from a dr point of view they run an active active active situation so they 're running data that 's in three different data centers around the country so if it fails on one it automatically goes across to another one obviously there are risks involved because it 's in the cloud so if something does happen to our internet services then um you know like tasmania lost uh was out of action so that would basically mean um you know in a majority of cases that people wouldn 't have access to the system unless we 've got other things in place which might be you know a satellite or something that won 't work as efficiently as what you would expect under the normal internet connections that we have so that 's other things that we 're looking at as part of the project to make sure that our our infrastructure and our internet connections are scoped and scaled to be able to handle the additional traffic that this type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the network yeah thanks very much for that thanks very much brother yeah mr mayor just said just to show that 's the world we live in now everything 's going cloud-based so it 's all fantastic until uh internet goes down and then it 's uh we 're in all sorts of bother but uh that 's the world we 're in now thank you so technology to make our lives a lot easier but it comes at a cost counsellor so it 's uh unfortunately that 's the thing but you 're right if you haven 't got that internet connection then uh yeah what do you do thanks brandon for that uh councillor smith yeah just fund me the amount of 237 so that 's that 's only for the first year obviously the pre-transition prepared to work um so the first year it 's about million million dollars 9.95 is that right with the two amounts 376 351 and the 237 that 's just for the first year yes that 's right the um the the three uh the 350 odd is that is the ongoing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're on premium crowd the 376 is the cost to uh to get us in the cloud and then as far as the the ongoing software as a service cost and then your 237 is what we 've sort of projected will cost us to get the system ready and to move it up into the cloud because there 's complexities with the system around integrations with our existing systems we need to work through all of those particular items and make sure that they are going to work through this new setup in the cloud along with some changes to the system configuration itself where we 're running some legacy items we 've got to go through and make sure that those legacy items are uh updated so that they will work in the cloud solution so it is a bit of a complex um task that we have to do we have given ourselves some time to actually go through and deliver that keeping in mind that you know as i 've mentioned in our staffing resources are also trying to do uh other uh operational work certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ig team obviously have a number of other projects we 're working on so we 've got to make sure that we can supply resourcing to be able to carry out those parts of the project yeah i just i just always thought the cloud was nearly free you know it was a lot cheaper than lots of completion your photo 's all up in the cloud and it doesn 't cost any on your phones and i 'm always shocked at the um at the i.t budget as it is capital and operational but i know we need it but geez it 's getting i hate to think what a large council would be paying a lot bigger than us unfortunately unavoidable in this modern day and age it 's something that we 'd do when you say roads rates and rubbish um there 's a lot more that that 's been annoying yeah i think we need to include that in the future it 's uh coming that way but uh that said we have a functioning uh to function the organisation you need to have those services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further brendan councillors if there 's no further questions there could i seek a mover in a second with regards to this report please move council wickerson second in council of kirkland i 'll put that those in favor as opposed motions carried unanimously thanks very much brendan i will move on to the walter reed cultural center lease renewals 11.2 thanks very much john john just before you go i just uh just before you start i 'd just like to again uh pass on my congratulations to the team with the jersey boys um performance it 's something there that uh getting rave reviews around town and it 's fantastic that we 're able to have that homegrown talent to that quality and uh it 's all the the things that go on behind the scenes the musicians but all the preparation and the the staff and the team that 's involved in that and uh again if you can pass on our congratulations from the uh from the councillors it 'll be uh much appreciated so thank you again uh through the chair um i 'll pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have sent me emails if you 're comfortable i 'd love to include some of that content for the for the cast and the creatives as well um just as a council officer and also somebody who lives in rockhampton i 'd just like to thank and commend the council for continuing to support this kind of activity it 's part of what we want to do to make sure that we are a growing and buoyant community and that it 's a great place to live 365 days a year it 's also worth noting that in this particular instance look when we don 't do it all the time um that it 's 100 local it is important for us at times to bring external people in to ensure that everybody gets the development and we can maintain those standards but the real testament is that all of those people that you see work and live in our community and many of them have returned to our community so it 's this kind of thing that we have i think through our cultural services which allows participation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a successful wonderful place so that 's enough soapboxing for me but thank you very much for the council table and supporting that uh here that 's uh something there that uh you know we all should be very proud of again congratulations okay we 'll move on to the report the walter reed cultural center lease renewals thank you through the chair um the councillors here we 've got a report um the recommendations are the sort of standard recommendations that you 'd see that pursuant to section 236 local government regulation council approved the renewal of the freehold leases and licenses as identified in this report and council authorized the chief executive officer officer through the manager of communities and culture to negotiate the terms and conditions of the agreements with the organizations listed in the report in preparation for execution by the delegated officer these agreements are to be for a period of two years with requirements for usage and activation reporting i 'll just go through some of the commentary um considering the appropriate course of action for council we 've got a few general options @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month by month tenancy allowing council to review usage and seek expression of interest from current and alternative cultural and recreational uses within the community or in you for an alternative term um summarizing you see there i 've suggested i can anticipate council wanting to be able to assess the usage that 's occurred within these sort of i guess these valuable and worthwhile tendencies in the walter reed but i think in considering how things have been in the past few years from a covert perspective these tendencies are nearly all managed by organizations that rely on community involvement i 'm sure you 're all aware coverts made life particularly difficult for many volunteer and community and cultural organizations so the recommendation that i 've proposed here is that we renew for a two-year period however keeping in line with some recent council decisions with regards sporting lead tenancies and leases maybe ask the providers for some information about the regularity of usage that way we might have a reasonable set of data to make some consideration about the best uses of the sites in the future and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process as we are at the moment there 'll be one tenancy that extends a little bit longer but that was the tenancy which we took to council just as covert was hitting but that 'll allow us to align this and get a bit of information and give these organizations some breathing room to sort of recover from what 's going on with covert so thank you thanks john uh questions councillors council wickerson and councillor smith yep thanks mr mayor just wanted to probably a good segue from the previous comments about jersey boys and some of the the people in that production may well have uh performed in a minor role at walter reed uh some at some stage so it just shows how important uh to foster the cultural and and creative community we have here even at that that grassroots level is so important um i 'm happy to move as per officer 's recommendation i think uh given that there 's some organizations i 'm thinking about the the print makers are highly active they have exhibitions regularly so uh very comfortable with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't even know existed uh so that might be terribly inactive but given as you said the covert climate we 've just come out of these these all these clubs are suffering and so you 've got to take that into consideration that give them a chance to to pick themselves up uh but you made the comment about keep in touch with them you know have have a chat with them about what their future plans may be and i think if we they go with the two years they can always be catch by their own choice uh and then to free up those spaces for um for maybe other groups who might be interested in looking for some accommodation i understand there are some still some bacon tendencies there too so it 's not like it 's not at 100 capacity but it must be getting pretty close to it so yeah very happy with with everything you said the only other comment i had uh this might be one for that ever and i 'd had a chat about uh it 's a bit of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which i know that there 's uh some issues with with access and head heights and all that but i 've uh in the the far distant past we had a jazz club and a folk club down there which was a a bit like the cabin i mean the beatles you might have heard him certainly i would love to see that space activated again if there 's any way that we could make it safe and obviously it 's got to comply with every every world uh but it 's such a wonderful space it 's sort of been hidden away so uh i won 't give up on that mr speaker leave that one as it is but anyway it 's worth worth having to talk about uh council smith i 'd be a bomb shelter one day um yeah just thanks for samir i was just concerned there were campers that would have the smallest area like only 42 square meters compared to some of the others as uh 257 etc yet they 're charged five thousand odd dollars a year that 's a hundred dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um for the younger children like a lot of our kids that have competed in the esteban here have gone on to the world stage and i just wondered why we 're charging that association so much money john are you able to answer yeah through the chair i think that 's um just a historic anomaly i would imagine that when these uh comparative rates were set there was a view that the estate fed had much greater earning capacity um that may no longer be the case um certainly keeping into consideration covered but then also um just i think the change in the model that stedford 's work so i 'm so happy to look at my at that as well and i can do that through consultation with the ceo and general manager from that perspective as well it 's also worth remembering that um the estate citizen association also does receive then further independent support from council from the community application process so we can go we can go through a process to review all of those inputs to work out what 's a reasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no further questions do i need a second and for the officer 's recommendation council rutherford put that those in favor opposed motions carried unanimously thanks very much john 11.4 the community engagement plan oh no sorry 11.3 the development assessment decisions under delegation february 2021. good morning mr mayor councillors this is a report uh on the development applications that were received in february this year um the majority of them will be decided under delegation but there 's two that may come to council the recommendation is that the report be received thanks very much tonight councillor may there 's any comment there would you like to move no no comment but happy to move okay thank you question uh tech move councillor may the second council of fisher council if there 's no um questions there to tania we 'll we 'll move that those in favor those opposed motions carried unanimously thank you very much now we move on to uh 11.4 the community engagement plan the planning scheme amendment cam you talk through that one thanks very much kevin thank you mr mayor and good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're currently undertaking a major amendment to the rockhampton region planning scheme to incorporate flood modelling flood mapping for local catchments and the fitzgerald river the purpose of the report is to identify for approval of the community engagement plan for the public consultation stage so state government have signed off for their state interest review and now council can start the commencement of the public consultation process so we 've i 've attached the community engagement plan that outlines the process and the types of activities that we 'll be undertaking as well as identifying the period for public consultation so the period that we 're looking at is from the 4th of april through to the 3rd of june uh council as discussed previously we 're looking to stagnate the issuing of letters to residents because we have 3 500 residents to to be notified who have properties that are impacted by these changes it 's important to recognize that the flood modeling information is already on our website this process is about incorporating those in those maps into the planning scheme so we can put some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the importance of doing this work i think councillors would be aware of the queensland floods commission of inquiry report that was done back in 2012 i had a number of recommendations one of which was that if councils councillors do modelling that they should make that available particularly flood modelling and overland flow maps to make that available for residents and applicants for development applications so there is an obligation of course of council to provide this information for the community particularly in light of recent events in lismore and southeast queensland whereby a number of people have been impacted not just by the mapping but levels above and beyond what 's been mapped in those areas so it 's really really important work that we undertake and in relation to the planning scheme itself it 's about obviously communicating that with residents to make everybody aware that they will be subject to to flooding whether it 's overland flow creeks or the updated modelling to to the fitzroy river now we already have modeling in the scheme itself for north rockhampton and gracemere so those two have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and grey smith so there 'll be a number of people impacted uh new people impacted in south rockhampton and mount morgan for north rockhampton and gracemere they 'll be updated and modelling for those areas is there any questions thanks cameron it 's uh again something there that it 's a document and it 's a process that we 've been undertaking uh since that report was uh presented in 2012 to to do that modeling and then uh and start the process of uh mapping and uh incorporating that into our into our planning so uh it 's it 's fresh of mine only um fortunately probably probably unfortunately that we 've seen what 's happened here in the south and uh you know the impacts that flooding and flash flooding can occur and what it can have then again that that stemmed from the the 2011 event where it was required that council include this mapping into their planning scheme so it 's something there that we we 've obligated to do and under legislation so uh part of that process is making sure that we inform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to to do what it uh what the modeling is telling us and uh and how to present that back to the community so we 've got a number of lights on so i 'm sure there 's a few questions there we 'll start with council official derpy mayor thank you council thank you mr mayor um probably to the ceo um we 're going to go out to the community the north rock hampton creek catchments uh which we are talking about flood issues we 've got residents already raising concerns about some of the issues with weed infestation of our waterways would this would it is it possible to have that report that 's coming back on how we 're going to address uh the weed management issues around our bridges and crossings uh within the region before we go out to community consultation peter to uh that one thanks very much peter through the chair i 'm not certain we could have that report done prior to this process this is starting now yes the issue around weed management but the whole thing about clearing creeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's an environmental process so the notion that we just go in and remove weeds as you call them um isn 't as simple as that and unlikely to occur um if it 's debris that 's been transported and caught there yes and we 're already looking at doing that but um it 's almost a perception that those weeds actually have a significant impact on flood behaviour it 's such a small amount in those creeks that i know the community sees it but it isn 't as big a as what is perceived but happy to look at where it 's those particular ones that you 've seen in where it 's particularly overgrown but don 't be surprised if there 's patches there where we can 't touch it okay second question um just knowing that i 'm concerned that actually the planning [Music] consultation is liable to become hijacked by residential concern about the the um their concerns or belief that the infestation the waterways uh is going to impact and change a lot of the flow and the risks around um the stormwater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something that we need to be prepared for and have um some information about a process and what i actually take on board what peter said that uh but we need to be able to relay that to the public because they they are seeing concerns particularly from liz moore and gimpy and what has happened there thank you through the chair i 'll just i mean the principle of this process here is to make people aware that they are within a flood zone and that won 't make them necessarily happy but the the whole premise here is that we 're identifying properties where where development occurred probably shouldn 't um structurally the council will never resolve those flood problems the best protection will be that you as a homeowner know where the flooding will occur and what to do to minimize damage because there is no magic wand or some pipe that we 'll put into these catchments to change these flood conditions significantly so it 's awareness that 's really the way it is this whole process yeah and just through the chair too i mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we get a variety of concerns raised from from members of the public and if one is about weeding then certainly we would refer that onto the responsible department and if there 's a management plan that 's been looked at then that information be passed on and inform that process in relation to timing of public consultation uh we really need to start it within a reasonable time of the state interest checks so yeah we don 't have a lot of scope to continually delay it and bear in mind that this flood modeling is available on their websites this is a process to incorporate into the scheme of the mapping okay thanks peter cameron uh councillor mathers thank you very much mr mayor um through you to um cam cam i just like to say um congratulations and uh thanks very much for all the hard work that you and your team have put in this has been a huge body of work you know i don 't have to tell you that but you know to send that off to the state development office and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it at all i think that speaks highly of the quality of work that you and your team have sent down there so i think that 's really good it means that we can be quite confident of the modeling that 's been done and i think that should go a long way to satisfying some of the questions with the within the general public you know i understand that there are going to be some people who are disappointed because their homes in their mind weren 't in flat areas but when we look at south rocky and also mount morgan that have never had that flood mapping done you know i think council have a duty of care to make sure that all our residents are aware if they 're at the risk of flooding some people may not want to hear that but it 's it 's something that needs to be done and i think what 's happened down south has been a very good uh very good reflection on that so um you know i i think it 's very timely and very important work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chair just generation thanks very much to council mayor for your comments um just wouldn 't i 'd like to acknowledge the work that our engineers have done because they 've done all the modelling uh so manisha and stu harvey 's team and street infrastructure planning as well as our gos team particularly christian smith 's done a heck of a lot of work uh with the mapping and when we go out to public consultation we 're sending letters we 're also sending them a map of their individual property and there 's been a lot of work in done by gis to actually make that happen so the gis team have done a fantastic job along with manisha and strategic infrastructure engineers so yeah thank you council rutherford um thanks mr mayor i 've got two questions if if i could and the first one is just to see whether it would be possible to have the argus included in um the advertisements that are going to be placed so we 've got advertisements to be placed in cq today newspaper um so can we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then the other one is just um off topic a little bit and we have this here for these areas but i 'm just wondering what our plans are for the likes of um stan wilcabra and the jewel so is this something we 're going to extend now i 'll leave that to peter to peter the answer is yes but at the moment there is no budget provision to go any further than the catchments we 've done so as we 've added some new catchings first time um the next cycle typically you 'd like to do this every five years an update so i think we 'll consider that next cycle which is not that far away yeah i would think stan will in particular the issue that they had um was was extremely dangerous and i i would think probably more dangerous than than any we 've we 've had so i would think that they would be a fairly high priority we 're effectively focused on the urban areas to date but yeah we need to go yeah i i get that and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know stanwell was it was a very very dangerous scary situation and yeah and we 're having people you know relocate all the time and you would have no idea that you know the water could come through there the way it did okay thanks cancer alfred councillor smith yeah thanks samir um just a little bit curious about all the properties that were wet in 2015 and now drive does that mean we got it wrong then the only time i 've ever seen that prediction like that was when we were planning for the levee and i just wondered boy they 're now dry but also are they are they part of the number of people we contact to say you know it has changed you 're now not not wet because a lot of those people could be playing flood insurance if they 're on the map as being wet in 2015. kim i 'll answer the last part first yes they will be notified um it is important to recognize though that in that correspondence that they should be still aware that this is a one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mapping doesn 't show them within it but as you 've seen down in lismore people have been flooded that never thought they would get flooded so um yes they will be will be notified um uh in this in this correspondence uh inration and i 'll refer to the engineers are probably able to get more better technical advice than me but there have been a number of changes um you know new developments uh drainage corridors put in things like that that does impact upon the modelling and what happens uh in those particular areas forest park estate was one for instance where it came across a number of houses and as they 've done their development they 've obviously channelized that water and as a result a number of properties are no longer impacted so as as with modeling you get better and better information better and better data better lidar data that 's updated and it 's a continual process of of improvement and you 'll find that yes some properties won 't be impacted obviously we 've identified a number who have are now so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide a little bit more technical advice than uh than what i 've provided but no look it 's just those the key things is technology and data and um so the surface elevations or the lighter that was described is a much finer mesh and more accurate not too much different to that the next time we 'll do it it 'll be the same again we 'll get finer more resolution more accuracy so that 's why it 's updated each five years one of those reasons changes in the catchment and technology yeah and and geographies are always changing too creeks change just naturally so it 's it 's continual process so it 's a live document that 's continually upgraded and improved just to comment mr mayor uh i concur with what council of fisher said about the creeks being chocked up because if you want to see laquina growing at its very best to come to gave your creek the start of the gave your creek that flows into the river here everywhere absolutely chocked up at boulder come and that has got just to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get through it 's going to back up to properties and then they 're going to be mapped as as having flood being flooded and it 's only because of the um the creeks in the debris in the creeks the the trees in the creek rather same at um grace fair grace graceful creek is in the same situation it 's absolutely i don 't know how the water flows through it at all in places just a comment introduce species that 's weird anyway thank you councillor smith councillor kirkland um thank you mr mayor i have a couple of questions that 's okay um so i 'm just wanting to ask kim if people come along to the consultation and they 've actually come prepared to make submissions what is the opportunity and what sort of submissions can people make is that going to be outlined and highlighted to them the type of submission that they can make and the process of doing that but also the likelihood of a submission making any difference to this particular modeling what 's the chance of that yeah okay unlikely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information photos or any information of you know i lived and saw it here or whatever we will feed that into the next iteration unless there 's some glaring error but that 's unlikely it 's used to build the next model okay okay one last comment is also this the fact that we talked about they may get removed from insurance companies the insurance companies don 't rely much on local council data to be honest they will have a look at it and take it but they do their own at a much more rapid pace than us so they 've got their own modeling and they that 's how they determine their risk not from our local studies typically um thanks peter and through you mr mayor i think that that 's highlighted that this is a two-way uh process there are some some people who will find that they now we 're modeled as potentially in a one in 100 year chance of getting wet whereas some who were previously modelled wet are now dry and so the opportunity for them is to take this modeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and weep change my change my insurance policy to reflect as such so that 's a good thing that 's a positive thing for our community um as as to the modeling and and how that has come about so my second question is will all of the letters the letters that you 're sending out go to both the tenants of the properties as well as the owners of the properties my reason for asking that is that leaning back into what i just previously said with insurance they need to have that peace of mind that their property insurance will be realized and recognized around the modeling through the chair the the letters will go to the owners of the land um and not not the tenants legally we should notify the owners of land it 's the owners of the land 's obligation to because tenants come and go we don 't know uh who 's is necessarily tenanting a business but we certainly know who 's the owner of land uh and you know that 's why we notify the owner of land because they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will notify these lands not necessarily the tenants we will obviously advertise what we 're doing to try and make the community aware we 've got an interactive website that everybody can go on and have a look and see where the flooding occurs we 've even got before and afters of what 's currently in place on the plan scheme and what we 're proposing so even people can see what 's actually changed from from the current mapping to the new one so also we 'll be doing [Music] stalls in in shopping centers and things like that so we are trying to reach as many as we can but obviously from a database perspective when we 're sending out letters we 'll be sending those directly to the landowners okay thank you um is there anything stopping us through you mr mayor to the ceo for uh councillors doing a letterbox drop to notify to the tenants of because some of some of those properties are long-term tenanted properties that are now going to be affected i believe that the tenants of those properties have the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counsellor that 's fine awesome um and uh suppose that also in reflection of of that modeling um cam i 'd oh it 's all right i think you 've answered it in the last i 'll just leave that question um mount morgan is that those figures represent almost one third of mount morgan recognized as now potentially getting wet mount morgan uh 370 properties [Music] yeah you look at the mapping it doesn 't appear to be one-third of sure yeah it 's it 's mount morgan is actually quite well defined in in the river and and drainage areas and they 're quite well defined so i wouldn 't hazard a guess at what percentage of mount morgan is is covered um bear in mind with all these properties too is that council actually owns a number of them as well so they are inflated a little bit it says 859 properties here yeah yeah yeah so okay all righty thank you thanks mr mate thanks again sir kirkland uh council there no further questions to cameron uh could i seek a second of with regards to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that those in favor as opposed emotions carried unanimously thanks very much cameron moving on to 11.5 the summary budget management report for the period ending the 28th of february 2022 last money to present that report thank you very much manny thank you mr mayor so good morning everyone presented this morning is the summary budget management report for the end of february this year 2022 we 're at a point in the year of about 60 just under 67 percent of the year consumed and in terms of our operating revenue it 's sitting in 87 of the budget due mainly to the net utilities net rates and utility charges being at 96 of the budget that discount period closed on the 9th of march and it is apparent that we had a relatively good take up of the discount period by our rate payers um with only less than three thousand letters going out for missed discount yeah to rate payers since the close of the discount period grants and subsidies are currently behind budget at 60 percent due around the rookwood where landholders grant program and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so generally speaking our revenue is tracking quite well compared to our budget in terms of total operating expenditure it 's at 62 percent of our budget contractors and consultants are at 51 and materials and plant expenses are higher at 72 percent so this is um this has been due to the increased level of recoverable works and there is also offsetting increases in recoverable works revenue as well to offset that but there have also been increases in chemical costs around the turbidity of the river and the treatment at the glenmore water treatment plant our asset operational costs are below budget at 62 and admin expenses are at 50 percent based on the timing various things like pool management i.t equipment and software support you 'll also see that our capital income is sitting below budget at 48 and our capital expenditure which we 've discussed widely is around the 29 of the budget we 're currently in the process of assessing the budget packs for the 22 23 financial year as well as the amendments to the 2122 capital and that 's going through a process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in due course the uh investments are sitting at 97 97.5 million due mainly to our rates levies and uh increased cash coming in and our total loans were sitting at just under 133 million as at the end of the month we did see 8.2 million spent on our capital program for february with that total spend being 47.9 million happy to take any questions okay thanks manny questions councillor kirkland um thank you mr mayor um through you and this may need to go to peter this question um on page 44 the total operating expenditure there 's a comment there about materials and plant expenses being at 72 it also says because reasoning around that in the second part of that is that there 's been increased chemical costs for frw for the water treatment as a result of the high turbidity of the water my question is is there normally a contingency included in operational costs for this because we do have a naturally high turbidity in in fitzroy as a rule i would have thought that there would have been a contingency set aside for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of questions around it but that 's the first part there is a contingency built in but the turbidity is much higher than normal so it 's not a normal situation we 're dealing with okay um is there any is it just because of water rain and that sort of thing further upstream that 's caused that extra turbidity or is there something else contributing to it no that 's correct it 's just the upstream receiving waters have changed okay so it 's just mud and stuff it 's nothing else that 's being released into the water that is a good news stuff there um also uh just further on just wondering about of course we 've got this water at the moment where we 're waiting for the aluminium hydrochloric aluminium chlorohydrate to arrive is that an additional expense as well because we 've had to go to a different supplier uh no no the rates are pretty consistent across the supplies we are out to tender for a contract for the supply which will over time i 'm hoping give us a better price across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story as well fabulous um and then i have a question just under that of course the asset operation uh it says is at 62 percent and and we 're talking about the electricity costs being below budget um is there i know that there 's been a very big push from environment throughout the organization to change their habits around electricity usage could some of that be attributed to that i don 't believe so councillor kirkland i think it 's just we have seen savings in electricity compared to budget for this year we will be looking at that closely in terms of our operational budget set for um next year as well to ensure that we 're closer to the mark in terms of what that budget looks like but yeah that 's where we 're seeing some probably some savings just compared to budget oh okay i was getting ready to celebrate and say woohoo turn the lights off as you leave the room has made a big difference yeah it 's probably true it still doesn 't but not not that great i wouldn 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council kirkwood councillor rutherford um thanks mr mayor my question was about the extra um chemical cost of chemicals for turbidity as well and i 'm just wondering whether we can have an email or something that delves into that a little bit more because you know our river flows quite regularly i don 't understand what 's driving it now why all of a sudden there is an issue now when um you know the we get big flows in the river quite quite regularly peter we are i 'm happy to provide a report on it but it 's not the size of the flow it 's the changing water conditions so how much we have to treat is not flow related it 's it 's the actual nature of the water at the moment is particularly yeah i think what cancer rutherford 's talking about is that it 's like with five rivers into one that we 're always there 's some years that we 're going to have a lot of flows continually going through yeah that 's not the reason it 's more to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's it 's what 's in the water as well as contributing to it but i can get maybe you could do a report on it i mean this has happened a number of times it was very two or three years ago we went through a very similar thing where we really had up our quantities of chemicals to to treat the water and i guess that that 's what i 'd like to understand it sort of seems to be jumping out as an anomaly at the moment and it may not be and and so that 's what i 'd like to understand as to why suddenly it 's it 's there when we haven 't seen that before and yet the conditions don 't seem to be any different now than what we 've we 've had historically yeah that 's and i think peter 's mentioned it um and that 's probably a bit of an explanation it 's not this is not a one-off it 's happened previously so yeah but it 's not a regular not a regular annual um experience no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're in the middle of trialling some new filtered mediums so that is compounding how we do things as well so there 's a range of factors underneath here in this plan happy to do a report yeah but not necessarily report just just an email or just some dot points so that we can understand when people sort of ask us some questions we can um we 've got answers to to be able to provide to them no good point [Music] one more and that was um i just don 't know if i 'm reading this correctly or i 'm not whether there 's a change of word that i 'm not getting so when we come to capital income and capital expenditure that percentage is the monthly what happened to the um year to date for capital no that 's actually you today that is year to date yeah that 's the spend year-to-date 48 of the budget for income is the year-to-date and the capital expenditure is 29 of the budget so what are our chances of um completing our capital program no chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run a whole range of projects so that we can next year in the year after manage the required capital we need in those years for water related projects so for recall we we did footpaths for main roads but for almost nine months that was to save that amount we also did not start a number of the major treatment projects until late so we 've just awarded north rocky now instead of last july so we 've we 've shifted our consciously shifted our capital forward so that we can have it in place for these major projects okay thanks council rutherford council kirkland for the question um thank you mr may yes i did have another highlighted thing here and that was uh the capital expenditure being at 29 which council rutherford has picked up on as well and so just to further add into that so thank you events are part of of my questioning around that peter but i also wanted to know through money does that affect us we actually have um key indicators around delivery of expectation of capital expenditure does that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where that affects us is through through the chair is through our borrowings program and what we borrow so we had received approval to borrow 40 million from queensland through queensland treasury corporation we will reassess that as we go as we assess those budget packs as we 've had a look at you know the preliminary information in those budget packs and we 're seeing quite large numbers into 22 23 and beyond so we 'll reassess what that means and whether we reduce what we borrow because obviously there are some contingencies around this if we you know we will have to mitigate against increased interest rates and what that looks like into next year in terms of a borrowing program as well so assessments will be made around that particularly in relation to the low spend in the capital budget okay thank you councillors uh no further questions on that one can i take a mover in a second with regards to the officer 's recommendation move cancel election second to councillor smith i 'll put that those in favor those opposed motions carried unanimously thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's plate rockhampton jockey club incorporated uh damon thank you good morning mayor uh councillors through the chair the report for your consideration this morning is a request for sponsorship that council has received in relation to the upcoming mayor 's plate horse race event at the on behalf of the rockhampton jockey club that 's coinciding with the capricornia yielding sales there in april this is an event that council has traditionally supported in the past with both direct financial contribution in the sum that 's been requested again for this year 's event as alongside a additional in-kind component the difference between our historic support for the event that 's being sought on this occasion is rather a substitution has been requested for that in-kind support from a marketing promotions perspective and rather seeking a waiver of associated fees and charges of council relating to the capricornia yielding sales but happy to take any questions thank you question is deputy mayor councillor fischer uh councillor wickerson um uh thanks mr mayor look i 'm not a racing person except i 'm melbourne cup dave i 'm an instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for our region for a number of reasons so if you look through the the uh visitor nights there 's nearly 1600 visitor nights so just even apart from accommodation which in its own right is uh significant it 's all the other costs they 've got to feed their their livestock they 're going to feed themselves and they 'll probably go out for a beverage somewhere so it 's uh the impact is amazing for what i think is a quite modest um investment in that on top of that it really puts us on the the local st other national stage for for horse racing events i mean they 're quite um high uh reward in some of those races so i think it 'll get rockhampton on the map for other things in addition to beef and rocky nets and all sorts of things uh the only comment that i 'd have is in the letter that they sent through it did offer as part of that packages sponsor a table for for 10 uh council uh people or guests i think the optics of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very politely uh declined yeah and so thank you for that but um it just doesn 't this doesn 't look good and it 's probably not come true anyway it doesn 't doesn 't pass the pub test and i think that 's that 's one that we respectfully decline that offer i think that 's uh that was part of the i don 't think it 's one i 've never been involved in that previously so i think it 's uh one that uh elect through to the keeper but uh acknowledge it thanks cancer wickerson councillor rutherford um mr mayor i 'm just wondering whether you can put these stock points separately please as in two recommendations yep so just to do the first one and then the second one yep okay councillor smith oh look i just want to speak in favor of it because um having owned horses they cost a huge amount of money to feed and especially to race all the equipment they need and barriers salary clothing trainers and jockeys and and the owners even when they come to rocky lovely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they come up when their horses are racing sometimes but i just um but also with the um um yielding sales that 's a huge event in rocky and i and you know if you if you can imagine robert 's foreign section is where the horses actually come in there to get sold and it 's really incredible to see if you 've never been to one it 's worth going to have a look um but the um just with the table um i know what people are saying about that but also if we 're not there it looks like we 're not supporting it and events rockhampton had the table last time and i was actually there because i did the presentation because you were unavailable yeah i think we could still have the table maybe we pay our own fees to go through it i think it 's just that perception there that we 're doing something in that with especially when it 's in racing or something like that it 's just that little level yeah i think it 's not those things if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care yeah yeah that 's understood not but i okay your comments say the the sales of the the to the economy it 's a great booster another another great thing that we 're recognized for not only the beef but uh the aqua equine industry as well um uh the benefits that that brings to our region as well thank you council smith councillor fisher yeah um mr reason i was sort of keen to go last because i wasn 't quite sure if anyone would pick up that comment in the letter about a table at uh this event one of the things that uh uh was mentioned to me that something that is happening at some of the western areas is they 're using it to foster uh young people sort of races uh or the industry their young jockeys young stable hands and that but maybe there it might be there that uh you as mayor host uh a number of up and coming young people within the industry that you want to keep in our local area that actually could be invited by yourself or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event and the racing industry is more than just about the industry itself i think that country races are probably one of the best forms of uh working with the mental health and uh and all of those associated issues throughout our communities it 's a time there that people can attend you don 't have to be the richest or the poorest person but you can attend just to have that interaction and networking so um could i just sort of throw in that suggestion that maybe is sort of something there that we it could be used as a as a partnership between the mayor and uh the rockhampton jockey club to foster some of our up and coming right young people in the industry i 'm open to those discussions cancer if everyone 's supportive of it it 's something there we could talk through ar and see whether it 's something there that could be possible but again that 's something that we can probably talk about offline but if there 's any um real objections to it just let us know and we can we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm happy to move as per the officer 's recommendation for the for the first part of the recommendation secret second and second council of fisher uh put that those in favor proposed emotions carried did you want to vote against that councillor council rutherford um the second officer 's recommendation again council smith you happy to move secret seconder council wickerson i 'll put that those in favor as opposed emotions carried unanimously thank you thanks very much damon we 'll uh move on to our next gender item uh the revised policies entertainment hospitality uh you 'd like to speak to that one thanks damon uh thank you mr mayor through the chair um very briefly for your consideration this morning council as an uh adoption of a framework for the receiving purchasing distribution reporting and declaring of ticketing in various policies we have across the organisation further there 's been a number of additional amendments that has come to council previously in the expenses reimbursement and provision of facilities for the mayor and councillors policy the councillor gifts benefits and hospitality policy as well and seeking councils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office 's recommendation there this morning when this matter was last discussed a number of weeks ago there has been a further amendment made to the entertainment and hospitality policy in clause 5.1 just clarifying what has been a traditional arrangement around the approval process for the provision of alcohol at events again just reinforcing what has been the traditional practice but embedding that in the the policy document um but again happy to take any questions mr mayor okay thanks so much damon again yes we did uh we did walk through it a fair in detail uh previously and i thank you for that uh that work uh questions counselor wickerson um thanks mr mayor a couple of things um i don 't know whether our system allows it but with all the attachments it was quite difficult to flick between one to the other is there any way over on the bookmarks on the left-hand side of it that they could be itemized there just so if you wanted to flick from one to the other without having to to scroll through it was that is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have them side by side just when you wanted to compare them there 's lots of and through the chair i appreciate with the number of policies and with the track changes version and the clean versions it may have been difficult so apologies for that will certainly offline training i 'll get some offline training sorry [Music] [Laughter] the second one is at the last time we visited this um others raised about the the vehicles too for rural areas and but my my thing with the vehicle was to look at the cap to encourage the councils that wish to uh the uptake of electric vehicles i know currently because of economies of scale and all sorts of things they 're dear and there 's i don 't think there 's any models that currently fit into our cup without us paying the difference of it i know this won 't suit everybody but um i understand the fleet managers has got a comparison of the two uh types of vehicles uh you know similar vehicles good ones even ones uh not uh over the the life cycle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come through i think he 's he 's recently got that and i think he 's probably um approving himself we did have some commentary about the resale value and obviously that 's going to be taken into account the absolute accurate whole lot of cost but if it was comparable and there were some savings with fuel and maintenance even taking into account the resale whether that cap couldn 't be increased to whatever is equivalent so that we 're not a council 's not out of pocket for that but it does encourage that uptake for the councils that wish to pursue that so i 'm just asking i don 't want to hold this process up today but if in the near future that that information can come through and be be analyzed can that be amended at any time is that including the hybrid vehicles as well when you make comparison to the uh that could be in there too i don 't know i read somewhere but even with uh specifically talked about a rav that that i 've got nothing counsellor uh smith has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was about eight hundred nine hundred dollars just in fuel for average usage of course there 's other costs with it too and i think it 's council official raise you 've got to also consider what you do at the end of life if you 're going to get stuck with these things with a massive battery changeover but the fleet manager said even that 's being addressed that they they recycle the batteries into other appliances but um that 's above my knowledge of it at this stage but rusted through the chair um mr mayor that can come back any time so yeah and i mean and i think there 's a viewpoint for that policy is april 24 so it can be done anytime yeah so the provision sorry through the chair the provision that we 've also included there around the review date for those policies that 's essentially the the maximum time period for when all those policies will be reviewed under the actual regulations there is provision for a review of those policies at any time so if there is councils minded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowance or the um some of that modelling that you were talking about councillor wickerson then that 's something that can be brought back okay thank you thanks thanks ross council election thanks mr mayor sorry just a quick question the um should this be approved is there any retrospectivity to any of this uh policy i 'm not i don 't think so no retrospectivity to it no that 's that 's yeah that 's good thank you thank you uh council smith yeah when we had the workshop and i put my case forward about having to pay for a nudge bar and a tow bar i thought we were putting that amount up the 37 500 and i 'll be interested to see and i think i did look at it at the time but now he 's looking at it because i wasn 't allowed to have a diesel vehicle how much more hybrids are and that that takes up that amount at 30 37 and a half through the chair um at the um where it was done at the workshop obviously it 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be once again can be increased any time into what council and i 'll be spoke about the safety vehicles and that sort of stuff as well so that amount can be changed anytime i 'm not um aware of where that if there 's any urgency to change that just yet with the replacement vehicles all scheduled for that review period as dammit has said that 's my my take on it but that can be changed any time of counsellor i think as it 's still a live document i think there 's opportunity there we might click seek a bit more clarification about some of those questions that are being asked so we will um get a report or information on that to uh to the council so we 've got a better clear idea about where we 're going so we can make those decisions when we um when if the changes need to happen yeah cancer oh sorry cancer yeah i 'd like to see it change as soon as possible so other people aren 't up for that cost well it 'll all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great time to have that work done now so we look at the budget about what it means uh going forward as well yeah is that all right is there do we need a timeline on that though there 's a good round figure through the chair that amount if we 're just talking about the allocation amount that can be changed now council have a preferred amount that can be changed now um it 's just very much a changing picture at the moment in the environment we 're in that was all but it can wait i wouldn 't like to make that change now without having some um information on the back of what what you know what those impact you know what the options are or what uh what the current situation is or where it goes so um that 'd be good to uh to get that detail uh ross council rutherford yeah mr mayor i think the confusion probably is that councillors were expecting um a little bit of different wording in that paragraph um i think that 's what we decided after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a look at that said if it it 's going to be reviewed by april um 24 there 's no more vehicles to be bought before then i don 't think anyway so we have the opportunity to do that again to have a look at it and then and then go from there yeah before that okay you know it 's it 's really neither here nor there yeah fair point but it 's great to to be able to uh investigate the other other opportunities or options there that uh and what it means going forward okay mine 's out of sequence because i 'm 60k round-trip even to come to a meeting so obviously i my mileage goes up a lot quicker than anybody else 's i 'm on my third fourth car now 12 10 years again mr mayor was it not discussed that if there was a need for a safety item on a car it could be the city i could prove it okay yeah through through the chair that that 's correct um castle and also if this one is out of sequence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can certainly address this policy before then if need be when it 's coming up i 'm just not sure how far i seek with that one if there is one but yeah all the others should be i 'm way over the mileage too i 'm 143 000 because i 've been waiting twelve months for a new car anyway yeah yeah okay we 're gonna address that kent 's the deputy mayor council official actually council smith 's just raised a very very good point to go that balance of the value of the car sort of uh the turnover and that um there is a major problem in the world now with with availability of certain vehicles and things as well that we 're probably going to have to even look at the the process because basically what council smith has just said is her car 's probably lost a considerable amount of resale value in just sort of clicking over that uh mileage that we may even need to have a bit of a review of that um so that we 're actually still purchasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resale value but not being sort of forced where we 've got to go to a company of a lesser uh long-term value so maybe we do need to have a discussion about a number of those items as it comes forward and that 's a good three the fleet manager does that counselor okay that 's his role so behind the scenes he turns away and does all that type of stuff with having the same issue with all our plant and trucks that 's right across the board i was going to ask about that yeah easily at least at least it 's those bigger things that provide productivity okay okay councillors [Music] officer 's recommendation there could i seek a mover in a second with regards to that move councillor wickerson second and councillor fischer i 'll put that those in favor as opposed motions carried unanimously thank you moving on to item 12.1 notice motion councils uh i 've noticed a motion to rescind um the mount morgan aquatic center redevelopment project so i 'm happy to move that one could i seek a second councillor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually suspend standing orders to have a discussion before we move on any further as a procedural motion happy happy to do that so i 'll put that those in favor those opposed emotions carried thank you councillor kirkland um i wasn 't sure that there was allowed to be discussion around a recent motion it can be discussed around a research emotion it 's not the procedural motions and such so it just be probably a little bit cautious because you 've got on the technicality side you have to deal with rescission if that goes through and then you 've got the alternative motion that comes through so there are two separate portions they 're not done at once so it depends how much discussion you want to do in this about the second one it 's probably just if it 's questions probably are okay question so we 'll just need to be people you could uh if we start to get into debate uh then we need to be very mindful there council so it 's the reason um cancer fisher to do questions yes um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ councillors there probably mr ceo and i have had this uh had spoken to you um there 's probably four areas i 'd like to sort of question as to um part of the design process is would it be acceptable if i actually ask each question individually we 've got alicia coming up so yeah yeah probably missed through the bit of the technicality side of it i actually do think you really need to decide on the recipient first and then have the discussion and the questions around that around the alternative okay all right that 's so okay we 'll move into the formal debate so resume standing orders so again um council officially happy to register yes okay i 'll put that that we resume standing orders emotions carried unanimously thank you councillors uh and we move on to the to my uh recommendation that um uh that we will reaffirm the allocation sorry sorry you 've got to deal with the recision first okay sorry we 'll all i 'll move uh move as part of that that we were seeing the previous and secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that those in favor as opposed you wish to record you record your vote against that um emotions carried thanks to councillors councillor kirkland i 'm sorry miss me you didn 't give an opportunity there to to speak to the motion at all no sorry i was just going to speak to the wrist end in support it 's too late you 've already done it yep sorry so the motion is that the the motion is live again that the officer the recommendation my recommendation is there that the money 's been allocated so um against the once it 's moved and seconded i 'll be happy to move that we suspend standing orders you 'll need a movement second uh yeah i 'm happy to move um recommendation secret secondary council of rutherford now and council kirkland may i ask if we deal with this matter in seriata please sure can you put this in um to is it siriatum is that jose separately each of those points could we vote on those separately please well as a procedural motion i 'd like to actually move to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got a mover and a second earth so we might move to be moving to uh move to suspend standing orders and we can get some questions then we will work out where we go from there uh as far as the items go uh as we work through so you 'll move cancer and move the cancer efficient move that we suspend standing orders i 'll put that those in favor those opposed fire secondary with the procedural motion just a single to put at the vote okay so um sending orders are suspended so questions cancellers we have glitcher there to uh answer questions council fisher yes mr mayor probably this there 's probably four that uh if i could put uh through the ceo to all through to alicia firstly there the maximum cost is 6.5 million dollars that that maximum cost is the very very cut-off line that that 's um no that includes contingencies certainly there 's a element of contingency budget in there and we can certainly manage that project and value manage that to be at that maximum cost there was some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make resolution that um it to be forced to that six and a half million but i just wanted to caution council against that because with any project particularly one that 's not detailed designed yet but with any project there are always things that may both make sense to do whether it be the underlying infrastructure or you know and we don 't actually know so until we 're into that project there might be some really good judgment that we come to you and say this is worth doing whether it 's renewal of infrastructure up the road or whatever it be but i have through my experience there 's been a number of projects that we it makes sense well you 've already got the contractor engaged to do value-adding and the other option is if it comes back after the detailed design and it 's a lot higher than what what 's been budgeted for you 've got the option then to yes we would manage that yes because i 'm hearing that loud and clear in terms of um that maximum allocation okay thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that we make sure that every part of the pill designed so that it caters for not only the young people but those that need it but they 're like older people or those and that 's not the right word but it 's as many people as addressing as many uses of the swimming pool first i um through through the chair the i would definitely agree with that prioritization like the the requirements to have a 25 meter swing pool is the utmost sort of achievable goal here other works are ancillary works that yes they are included um as part of that initial application but they would be i guess the sacrificial cows if there were um if it turned out that the pool was more expensive to do that yes fissure next one water efficiency and i think this is probably uh one that i know that i had lots of of concerns about but are looking at the very very best practices in water efficiency in the operation of that pool so long term alicia did you want to yeah so a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ongoing operational costs so just remembering councils that this like the age structure that is at end of life now is significantly leaking so that there 's a cost associated with that so when we have a new pill we won 't have that but the other discussion that both andrew collins and i have is that we do looking for all of the efficiencies that we can around backwashing the pools and different pieces so we will sort of just by updating the equipment alone counsellors in terms of the treatment and the chlorine and all of those pieces with that pool it will be a much more efficient operations does that speak to your question or the other aspect is that the pool the filling of the pool is actually factored into the project cost in as part of the commissioning and water harvesting i think andrew mentioned something about water harvesting yeah we 've got to look at all those options but generally um with the project and the sustainability aspect of that project is that we will be looking for all of those options @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that um it 's better longer term and mr ahmed the last one is really i 'm actually taking council rutherford 's concern or question and that is that maintaining a heritage character of the swimming complex which i think is probably also something that needs to be considered is that able to be included uh back through the chair and yes that can be incorporated into the design um we would not be just to to make it clear we wouldn 't be looking at keeping any of the things there but certainly giving a nod or being sympathetic to the other heritage um that it is a heritage town essentially that it needs to fit in with the look and feel of other you know you 've only got to drive through the town and you can see that that 's the focus thank you thank you mr fischer councillor kirkland and thank you mr mayor i 'm sure that my colleagues um would know that i 'd take all things very seriously in the fact that we 've rescinded this motion that we all supported strongly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a result of our hesitancy about the the organization 's capacity to deliver this project in the scope of what we 've we 've actually applied for the grant with and there was some discussion at that time around some questions that i 'd like to just potentially revisit just to get some clarity on that if i may so does the grant agreement delivery and expectation limit us from reducing the scope of this project should the costs demand such i suppose referring to page 15 of the grant application colleagues i have absolutely over thought this i 'm sure but you can see by the paperwork in front of me i 've gone back to the history of how we landed at this project the changes in the costings of the project i 've rewatched meetings i 've read through everything i 've looked at the mount morgan argus which came out last week as well and a number of other supporting documents so part of the supporting document here is that grant application and on page 15 i 'll just refer to it for my own purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so back through the chat so if we are changing the scope of this grant and i mentioned to you um that we explored already with um i guess the spokesperson of the because it 's actually like a committee or i don 't look i 'm not sure what they call but it 's a sort of a number of players that have put this in terms of mining and government it 's and so they 've allocated the funds so when we spoke with the gentleman around varying the timing of the grant to perhaps leave it another summer and we also talked about reducing council 's um contribution towards a project because certainly that had been raised to me with the difficulties that we 're having um they were very keen that there was a number of criteria that they assessed which brought this project to the top of the list so which was great that 's how we 've got that grant announcement they then went on to say that you know there would be scope changes allowed but when it spoke to the timing which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that because we should have applied for the next round in their mind okay because what they are keen to see these are grants that stimulate things and if if we 're sitting on those grants that 's sort of not achieving their goals so i completely get that um the other aspect in terms of the organization 's contribution that again must have been one of the criteria so they when i said about reducing council 's contribution they said oh we would want to put that back into that assessment tool we then went on to talk about you know managing the project within that budget envelope and you know as long as we weren 't compromising the 25-meter pool which is what i spoke to earlier there would be they would be negotiable and those sort of things happen all the time in these grant projects because they acknowledge in that submission that it wasn 't detailed designed so there will be things that come out so the short answer is no um application changing the actual what we 've told them we 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it so everything you 've listed there that 's going to be delivered in this scope if we have to pull some of that out or change it to meet the cost expectation it won 't affect the grant the short answer is it depends what we want to change like i 've already explored that contribution and timing and they weren 't and men that but other minor things as long as like if we were um deciding a 15 meter pool or a lesser pool no well that was a key a 25 meter pool is one of the key outcomes that they 're trying to achieve so but then when we talked about sacrificing shade structure and different pieces to fit that yeah that 's absolutely fine and i i have an uh email from andrew collard saying that um you know he 's he 's had a look at the project costs and uh what he believes he 's come up with is uh and he 's attached the details from uh rulings constructions and the cost handbook and the queensland government publication on facility costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh to the main structures should be enough and also there is approximately 15 percent uh 800 000 uh contingency allocated to the project as well so um they have that buffer there um should should be required i will qualify it mr mayor that um these are seem to be almost extraordinary times in terms of cost escalations like i 'm saying hearing it quite often in terms of project managers and some of the things that we 're seeing in other projects but this is um a lot of projects we start off with a very small contingency so that 's why we 're back with the table this is sort of got an appropriate contingency to manage those things thanks cancer kirkland um i 've got a page full of questions here if you might indulge me thank you i 'm not it 's not counselor you 're welcome to ask questions it 's not whether i approve it or not so um since we 've mentioned that contingency it does come down to one of my questions here i note that previously there was um communication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 so this contingency i believe is 15 percent um which is eight hundred thousand can i ask what the normal contingency percentage is in delivery of capital works projects peter uh there is the contingency percentage varies to the point where the project is the 15 contingency is probably on that slightly lower side for where it is but the nature of the project is not a high risk project so a swimming pool 25 meter is is not something unheard of it 's very standardized concrete construction plus plant equipment so it 's been judged as an adequate contingency the other point to this is that there is something i think the dollars in ancillaries which is shade structures and other things is there as well which gives you a bit of flexibility the only thing i will caution you is that you cannot say it 's the upper limit or whatever or maximum expenditure because council is entering into a contract between two parties that 's agree that we 'll pay certain components of the project that are unforeseen some risks are with the contractor some are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have gone into a price that 's going to be determined by the project make sense okay and the last comment i 'll make is that i have had a good look at the budget i do think it stacks up okay the only two risks that i see that are not factored in here is it 's the location the regional factor of carting and building up at mount morgan will be a figure and as always you 'll have the underground risk which is on all these kind of projects but there is a whole point if it came back at the tender price and it was exceeded or it consumed our contingency then we have to make a judgment call but council kirkland thank you mr mayor um so the grant application on page seven 3.2.2 says um a few things there but it 's basically saying that that we can 't use um let me just get the wording page seven the question around here is additional things that are not allowed to be used not allowed to come into don 't qualify as part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening conceptual designs um has there been an allocation of those extra costs to the council 's budget so going out to the community for consultation all of those types of things according to the grant application are not allowed to be used up in grant funding i 'd have to have a look at that one back through the chair i would have to have a look at that um i think we 've spoken at the travel before that community consultation you know you have a community meeting up in mount morgan and people do show up so i expect those things to be somewhat minor in terms of the consultation and the and the opening aspects um in terms of the conceptual designs i would have to take that question on notice or peed might be out of answer there 's a provision for in the order of 250 000 for design development which is the concept development because the the design cost will be actually in the contract but we 've already got so we 've got 250 000 to do the front end which will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement for how we want the pool to perform so that 's already allocated sorry and i probably need to state the obvious here that those things come out about our money yeah yeah yeah that is that is what i was getting at yeah and secondary to that had the site the demolition costs including the old squash courts um been included in the project cost estimates uh yes there 's 200 000 provided for site demolition okay very good and can i ask what methodology was used for the cost estimate kind of got into it a little bit with your letter from andrew the estimate has been prepared from a zero base so it 's actually determined the cost for each element and calculated it so it 's not a square meter here it has actually detailed every component plant room shade structure determined the cost for all of those it 's been checked against a uh it was reference a queensland standard on effectively the typical cost for these leisure facilities and they 've lined up as basically within each other very close okay thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the ramifications of not continuing with the grant at this stage may or may not be um and what the compared ramifications are pulling out down the track yeah it 's a political system council might hold that we 're in um just asking questions that 's a political so just to speak to the operational side rather than the political side i made it quite clear at our committee meeting that um that facility is end of life so the outcome would be to close the pool like it 's not to limp it along further at the substantial extra cost of the water leakage and everything else like that decision would result in us closing the pool thank you councillor kirkland um i 'm just reading through my question to make sure that 's not a political question okay that 's it i 'm ready okay thank you councillor wilkerson um thanks mr merrick a couple of questions uh my colleagues already covered the one about uh demolition cost so i 'm happy that they 're included on there uh we 're happy that that 's uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and i know some advantages too that the hole 's already there so that 's probably a plus and i might balance balance out of it so uh the second one is and we touched on it earlier about the sustainability of the new design and ongoing operational cost because that 's what we 're clearly focused on across the board uh is there an allowance for uh solar electricity and solar heating are we are we looking at including that on a nearby large roof just to reduce i know there 's an upfront cost but to reduce that ongoing operation cost somewhat so just to be clear this pool is not heated so that 's a no for the solar heating i 'd have to take on notice that question around the solar councils you know how i feel and i 've just been looking at budget so it 's just what the structures or the size if you think about the footprint there 's not particularly large roof spaces um but peter do you have any comments it 's it 's it will be in the performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up or not i mean i know everyone loves solo quite often it doesn 't doesn 't add up it doesn 't add up so it will be considered but but always more cost effective to do it as part of the project than to retrofit something later on but i absolutely understand what you 're saying uh and the last question mr mayor is again about the heritage of it and i understand uh and and exactly why the the community up there value their heritage so much it 's ingrained in their community and culture but with the the grandstands assuming that they would comply with all of our current standards for grandstands and seating and safety and whatever is there any possibility that they could be relocated somewhere at a a modest cost to maybe the showgrounds or something and so they can have the new facility but also uh not not totally lose them i know relocating is never i 'm happy to have a look at it but it reminds me of the bridge we were trying to relocate um so we 've got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provision for new grandstands in this budget um and we 'd have to have a look at compliance and all those things i guess yeah just doing a response it 'd be something we 'd have to investigate but be clear that that it hasn 't been allowed in any costing so that would be something that we would come back on what the value to do that it would be a separate project yeah correct because it 's that 's going to add costs but we can certainly do that before the demolition just just on our brief uh inspection were up there they appeared to be in reasonably sound condition they were like collapsing so if it was at all possible that might keep the local community happier sorry it 'll give them a job to keep that wood going um yes okay and probably that would be the other thing is that you know we 'd be looking to try and see whether a community group could take that on because it 's the substantial renewal that was required um to the facility in terms of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're not keen to keep it i 'm just pondering when we did the riverbank we had a similar situation with one of the shelters that the contractors that did the job my recollection is that they took it on themselves as a community project to relocate that somewhere uh just wondering at some stage we might sort of approach that with whoever it is that gets the contract if this is a community uh contribution back i 'll leave that with the ceo and peter and alicia to um to consider yeah okay council if there 's no further questions council council official move that we resume standing orders i 'll put that those in favor those opposed motions carried our councils i 'm happy to move the recommendation rutherford uh i 'll speak to the motion council as i um i believe the need to have a pool uh for the morgan community something there that 's that 's um existing and to to not go ahead with a project of this size is something there that uh would would um paint cancel with a bad reputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the water cutting and and we 're dealing with them separately understanding that this project had started well before we 'd uh we 'd started the water cutting uh to to to not continue with it at this point in time i believe that would leave a a paint council 's reputation in a bad position also we have external funding in our federal grants applications for the upcoming priorities in the federal election and also that the the project there is one that with external funding being approved would make it difficult in the future if we were to apply again at a later stage so councils in the in the interest of the the public in the community looking uh at what the project entails and we and mindful we 've got another opportunity uh once the detailed design comes back if the cost cost escalation 's there but on those principles i 'd seek councillor support to continue with the project speakers against the motion uh not against it just wanting to talk to that point one there reaffirms the allocation of two million included in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 23 budgets because there 's no going to be delivered that won 't be delivered in the 21 22 budget technically peter through the mayor i think that is correct it spread over two years the project okay two financial years so add move we 'll move it to 22 23 as another yep yeah okay that 's true okay yep that 's true that 'll carry across okay okay you happy with the changes to that oh sorry councilwoman no no cancer rutherford sorry going too many moves and second is uh speaker against the motion council mothers thanks very much mr mayor um mr mayor i probably just uh would like to um reiterate or repeat what i said uh during our committee meeting which is you know this is not about whether the public at mount morgan deserve a pool or whether they don 't they certainly do deserve a pool they have one there at the moment and i still believe that you know i 'd like to see a report come back in regards to if there 's any chance of that being saved but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial nothing else and and it is purely and simply the fact that you know we need to find over three and a half million dollars for our business case study for the um getting water up there um at some point we 've got to make decisions as to what 's more important and um you know we need to we don 't have the money to push uh further forward with the with the water water pipeline up there for a substantial um water source for the uh for the public up there so you know i i would just rather see that money used for something that is more important which is supplying water to that community uh that 's my view on that i think we 've just got to be um i use the words before it 's fiscal responsibility thanks councillor mothers question counseling no no no waiting people sorry yep okay if i may mr mayor um councillors i think the mayor 's comments uh as to why we should support this motion the very wise our council has developed a very very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prime minister 's office i know it 's a different level of government commented about the airport about not only being able to be delivered on budget but delivered on time and also delivered with uh the community 's support and i think the mayor has uh during this sort of process has raised that it 's actually a lot of our reputation as rockhampton regional council and our ability to be able to uh deliver a project i know that there are questions uh uh that many of the councils had i think today that they have been answered but i would like to endorse the comments of the the mayor i think that it is something that the community needs i believe that with what has been raised today and our alicia has taken on board we actually there will be able to deliver a very very good project to the community but actually addressing all of those needs so i would endorse the mayor 's comments and also seek support for from this recommendation thanks councillor fisher another speaker against the motion i 'll wrap up councillors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial position again it comes back to a project that had started prior to our cutting the water being mindful that this grant funding that is extraordinary that we wouldn 't receive for a community of that scale and that size uh it is it it it 'd be a shame to to knock that back for the community of mount morgan that is desperately in need of of um refurbishment of a lot of their facilities on the in the town and i think it 's beholden to the to the table and the councillors of today to support this project and uh and but again still being mindful that we need to um you know make sure that we we 're financially responsible going forward but i believe that uh with the commitment that we 've made in the external funding that that achieves that and still provides to the community well we still have the challenges and the uh the work we need to do with uh with securing a permanent water supply to the community mount morgan that this council is charged with and something there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and uh push so that said councillors i 'll wrap the bait up i 'll put that those in favor those opposed i 'd like to record your um record against that councillors uh latcham and councillor mothers record their vote against the motion the motion is carried uh thanks very much councillors we 'll move on to further business we have a number of items to be dealt with in confidential reports um in closed session councillor fischer do you have a question um we before we go into confidential can we um do our general business and oh sorry yes yes and are you right to go to general business before we move in no general business uh business urgency sorry no question surgeon business counselor fischer yeah mr mayor i 'd like to just ask the council for the councillors for their indulgence um i 've been asked to be the face for relay for life this year and um relay for life i know when i look around the table everyone here has been involved in relay for life over the last 20 years and [Music] @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their each councillor would like to just do a small video of support for relay to life and for those that are going through their journey uh with cancer those that uh who have um supported family members on that journey or for those that have sort of been on a on a journey and also there if um they could bring a relay for life um shirt for everybody to to wear and support and i 've and then the last seat part would would counsellors be interested in actually forming a team as has been part of relay for life as well so i 'd just like to raise those um i when i was first asked i actually wasn 't quite sure about taking on that role because i 'm still doing my own journey but it is telling the story it is support and when i look around the table everybody there has been so supportive in the past that it would be great to have it as a as a sort of a combined effort so i was just bracing that mr mayor if that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah no i think it 's uh something there that that we 're supportive of i 'll just see a number of lights on so i 'll go to a couple of questions there councillor maters and councillor wickerson thanks very much mr mayor uh thanks very much uh councillor fischer that 's uh it 's certainly a good cause i 'd just like to say that i 'd certainly be keen to be part of the team on the proviso that um our mayor would wear his super mario costume they put that one up by uh you know it 's a wintertime council [Laughter] i think it 's uh i think it 's a worthy cause and one that we need to need to support and uh you never know if enough pressure comes on you never know but uh i wouldn 't want to get that on camera thank you councillor wickerson uh thanks man yeah i 'm happy to keep continuing relay for life it 's a fantastic event i know councillor kirkland 's been terribly heavily involved with that in the past as well so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um was she spokesperson for or chair of the committee assumption patron patron big pardon um the only question i had is as well as councils and obviously happy to do that i think it was was a team of one last time they had it um not that i invited anyone just rocked up uh council has a process to nominate one or two charities officially have we done that this time maybe mr sir would know hey hey john when we get um the staff do that does staff nominate have we gone through that process that 's not at this stage now no well i guess in addition i 'd be campaigning uh lobbying how did that be one of the charities that we we support with a range of activities through and and to have a council law and council staff combined team or we compete against them something i don 't know but um in the past i think we a couple years ago now we set the record and we raised about fourteen or fifteen thousand dollars as a councillor that 's sorry as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so yeah good good team bonding for all of the the organization i think that yeah happy to support you okay thanks very much any other comments with that one it seems like we 've got a programming ahead of us now we just need to fill it out so we 'll see where that takes us thanks very much councillor fisher uh council if there 's no other urgent business we 'll we 'll move on to where closed session items are 16.1 a property matter um and i 'll move that uh i 'll seek a second uh move in the second of the uh the meeting that we 've moved three three item property mel there is a financial assistance grant boundary review uh with livingston rockhampton regional accounts 16.2 16.3 is a legal matter as well cancer so there 's three items there so uh can i have a move in a second of the deal with those items in closed session move council smith second head council of kirkland i 'll put those in favor emotions carried unanimously thank you and that the meeting move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and seek second council smith i 'll put that those in favor

aboriginal peoples within your local government area the gangalow nation people the bharata kabul bara and yatamara people and also acknowledge the torres strait islander people whose land is in the

for death and follow me it 's a bit sobering isn 't it but what it means is that what we do in life matters and so my prayers for you this morning if we can bow our heads father god we live we exist and we have our being because of your great love and for each one of us you 've ordained a purpose and as that purpose is brought to bear in this city of rockhampton i pray that these people here who who you have placed strategically to accomplish that purpose i pray that you give them wisdom grace power beyond their experience and lord a sense of your presence in all of their conversations all of the decisions that are enacted in this place i pray that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purposes so that people who come here would do so with a sense of anticipation knowing that the future that 's before them there is going to be one that 's accompanied by a sense of accomplishment and fruitfulness that otherwise would not have been apparent so as the conversations take place in this hall today bless each person here with that special measure of wisdom and grace and honor i commit them to you and i thank you for this occasion bless each one i pray in jesus name amen okay thanks councillors um we might just bear in mind too that that uh traffic accident that uh that happened yesterday in stanwell um keeping their thoughts people that were involved in emergency service and people that attended that as well um council 's morning leave of absence and apologies we have a leave of absence from cancer neil fischer that 's previously been granted uh councillor smith is on webex and we have a full house so i might move on to confirmation of previous minutes that the minutes from the ordinary meeting on the 28th of september @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy to move uh seeker seconder councillor wickerson i 'll put that those in favor against nation-carried university think councillors moving on to item five declarations of interest in matters on the agenda um councillor smith uh has informed the meeting declared a conflict or a perceived conflict of interest in item 10.5 the queensland beef corridors council wrote as roads mentioned in the report include may downs road which commences in clark creek and uh traverses uh 31 k 's to middlemen and the partner pat moore owns uh land on the side of that road and uh commenced to the road to the isaac river about 10 k 's along there councillor smith did you want to make uh talk to that at all would you like to remain in the meeting or would you like to put it i 'd like to meet and to decide um at this stage if i 've got a conflict because um you know those rural roads around our region sort of interest me um it 's this one yeah look i i believe that it 's it 's reasonably far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recorded but i believe you need to be involved in the meeting as your portfolio takes in infrastructure and part of that is roads and road transport so um i 'm happy to move that you uh that didn 't remain in the meeting uh seeker segmenter um second to council rutherford uh question councillor dickerson um just on another matter maybe another potential okay no that 's right well i 'll put that one those in favor opposed

council of rutherford 's in favor council kirkland in favor and cancel a laptop in favor thanks linda council wickerson yeah thanks mr mayor um just need some clarification from the table uh the item 10.1 community assistance program uh for funds to go to capricorn helicopter rescue now i understand that my brother-in-law mark tobin is still on the board for capricorn helicopter rescue is that still a bit too familiar i think that 's two years okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and uh elected leave the meeting yeah okay we 've grabbed the details of that um for the minutes yeah okay thanks cancer wickerson uh for no further declarations or um conflicts just let please let us know if something arises throughout the course of the meeting councils we can record that public forum 's deportations nil presentations of petitions nil committee reports 8.1 uh audit and business improvement committee meeting 7th of october 2021 councillors are you happy to move happy to move that very pleasing result thank you and secretary councillor kirkland any discussion around that item counsellors if not i 'll put that those in favor proposed carried unanimously thank you moving on to item nine dele local government association of queensland incorporated annual conference delegates with voting rights so this is a bit of a just to report me um just in case somebody doesn 't um isn 't able to make it my my commitment there previously will be i need to be back in rockhampton so i 'll miss the last day which normally where the most of the majority of the uh the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave will will be also not attending so we need to have councils that are attending uh authorised to be able to um undertake those votes so um i 'd probably be happy with all three if if that was okay we could have the three evan or do we need to have them in one different probably anyone oh yeah um mr mayor i 'm happy for um council latching and council copeland to do it give them a good experience yeah because i have done it on lots of occasions uh previously and i think it is good experience for new councils to be the voters okay can i also add that i think we need to go through the motions to make sure that we 're all happy um you know which way to vote for our positions yeah more than happy to do that we do a catch up uh prior to the actual um uh delegation yeah the delegates will have a meeting with myself before you go so yeah okay that might not happen that might be with rocks this year yeah we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks very much uh mr mayor i just want to say i have uh full faith in all three councils that will be there so i 'm sure any of them could represent the table um so i 'm happy with whoever just decided that 's um i think we 've got to a point there councillor smith thank you for um for nominating the other two and uh that takes the uh the issues there so i 'm happy to move and seek a second with those recommendations second and council maters i 'll put that those in favor proposed emotions carry thanks councillors moving on to 10.1 the community assistance program made your sponsorship and councillor wickerson will leave the room while they go through this item okay thanks very much alicia i 'll hand over to you good morning mayor and councillors so um it 's the racq capricorn helicopter rescue service requesting assistance to conduct the cbd christmas fair for this year this has been an event that has gone on since 2013 or 14 and it initially came about at the former mayor 's request @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it also coincided with the christmas lights and the turning on of the the christmas tree now um it didn 't happen last year because of covert obviously and was cancelled but this year there 's hoping to get the event going again in terms of looking forward and the review i know that we 've had several discussions around the review of the community assistance programs and the community events that we will hold into the future so again until we settle on that review this process continues as normal so previously the other aspect of it is that we discussed with advanced rockhampton about activation of the cbd so this event this was prior to actually knowing whether the racq were going to want to organize this event so now that have come forward and they 're wanting to have this event the two will coincide together nicely in terms of the activation and the christmas decorations and all of that happy to take any questions mr mayor thanks lisa greg did you have any uh anything to add no questions thank you mayor um i not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working uh with racq on this that 's for sure and we 're working through all the christmas activities we 're calling it the 12 days of christmas uh right now so i think it 's a i think it 's a very prudent uh use of our community assistance program so i highly endorse the recommendation as well okay thanks greg councillor rutherford um mr mayor i 'm happy to move this event has been a really good event for our community in the past and and i know we did have some questions but while our our um matrix is is the way it is i think we run with it and it 's certainly an event um and an organization that 's doing a great job of running an event for us so i 'm happy to move okay thank you councillor kirkland yeah absolutely concur with everything council rutherford has said i think it 's a fabulous family event and the fact that it is is lining up with our corporate plan and our um stance on reactivating that cbd area i think it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward to it second second okay thanks again kirkland yes well um oh yeah the comments from both council i think it is important and one that um our community look and look forward to um and be sad to see if it wasn 't there but uh that said uh it 's definitely going ahead so that said council if there 's no further comments or questions i 'll put the motion those in favor opposed emotions carried thank you last council wickerson oh sorry yeah unanimous yeah sorry thank you again we 'll move on to item 10.2 museum of art membership program fees and charges 20 21 22 amendments and hand over to diamond thanks very much dana thank you good morning mayor councillors the report before you this morning relates to proposed amendments to councils adopted fees and charges scheduled for this current financial year particularly as it relates to the proposed membership program for the rockhampton museum of art upon commencement as noted in the report and previously discussed with council a consolidation of a number of membership categories is being proposed in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the intention of regular review and obtaining feedback from those visitors to be able to adapt and potentially grow that membership program over time two additional amendments to the fees and charges proposed before you also relates to room higher for one of the spaces or rooms within the rockhampton museum of art which is ostensibly a staff facility and not deemed to be appropriate for public hire and also for the imposition of a nominal administration fee for the replacement of lost or misplaced membership cards it is intended that upon approval or if approved today that there will be a promotional campaign commenced in relation to that membership program in advance of the opening highlighting the the various benefits attached to the different categories particularly as it may relate to for example discounted higher rates for various rooms and spaces within the rockhampton museum about but happy to take any questions mr mayor thanks damon uh portfolio spokesperson council wickerson any comments or just some comments because we 're happy to move this but also very happy to see that we 're acknowledging the uh the long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initial offers for the first 500 um being offered to those people initially that support you know we can 't survive without that and hopefully that will also inspire a new generation of uh of supporters and friends of the uh the rockhampton museum of art happy to move okay thanks ken yes again uh echo that it 's uh it 's important sometimes when you have something new that you forget about the past and history and the legacy there that 's been forged over many years to work in that space so it 's important that that that they 're being recognized in those first offers uh we have a mover council wickerson second and councillor kirkland put that those in favor opposed carried unanimously thank you councillors moving on to item 10.3 councillors smith has a perceived conflict of interest in that one but we voted on that one to too for you to remain so um might end over to oh sorry this is i 've jumped one i think so yeah we 'll go to the 10.3 the tender consideration plan for the retail store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mr mayor councillors this next report for your consideration this morning relates to a tender consideration plan for the retail store there at the rockhampton museum of art the potential vendors identified and included in the tender consideration plan have been identified following a public expression of interest that have has been undertaken by staff and also following investigations and planning in relation to the proposed operations of the store upon opening of the new facility the objective of the tender consideration plan is to provide council and the rockhampton museum about the opportunity to engage directly with vendors in relation to stock for the retail store i would note however that it is not proposed that stock from all of those initial vendors that are identified and detailed in the report will be purchased and there will be stock on hand from all of those vendors at any particular point in time that is just an exhaustive list of potential vendors over time there for the rockhampton museum of art a significant focus of the retail store and its operations within the new facility will be on local content @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways in which to support business development and opportunities for those local artists as well but again happy to take any questions thanks very much damon uh councillor kirkland um thanks mr mayor through you damon just wanting to clarify in the event that further down the track we have people that would like to move their product through this particular retail store does it need to come back to council to receive those uh businesses and their stock or does it is it left to the discretion of the retail store to to negotiate that or is it simply not an option until the next round no so under the proposal that we have the expression of interest that has already been undertaken will be ongoing in terms of promotion and opportunity for other local artists or potential vendors which will then be considered based on criteria and obviously the proposal that 's put before it and then depending on the nature of the the stock the value in terms of what procurement process may need to be undertaken to meet the the local government regulations it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there may be some modifications and again subject to those value thresholds may well need to come back to council for further consideration okay thanks so much councillor wickerson in the comments portfolio thank you mr mayor again this is really good way to uh support our local up and coming artists and some of the names on there we might remember i think aaron dunn stood out to me as one of the winners of a gold award previously so it 's good that the museum can not only showcase exhibitions from hopefully around around the world but also showcase our local talent here and also give them a means to promote and sell their goods uh as we learned yesterday it 's uh will be a combination we think of purchased items stock for the uh for the retail store but also commission work so i gather they would be more uh unique one-off art pieces that might be of a higher price point that could be sold on commission so again it gives a good outlet for artists to make some money hopefully that we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but provide that showcase for local up and coming artists so it 's a win-win i think mm-hmm would be good to um have a review and 12 months time to see how successful it 's getting to them yeah okay then um if there 's no further questions move in a second move council wickerson second councillor kirkland after no further question i 'll put that those in favor proposed carried unanimously thanks councillors moving on to item for the dean street bus stop location i see stu joined us thank you very much mr mayor and councils uh so as part of the queensland government program to make our bus stop stda compliant council been progressing through a range of bus stops with translink to make them up to the dda standard and that predominantly involves putting in a concrete pad and j pull and bring up the standard there there 's two remaining or handful of remaining bus stops that that remain and one of those is on dean street previously located at 433 now as part of the review of that bus stop there are some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dean and hyde street and presenting a bit of a risk to safety of the public there so a previous report was brought to council about the location and this report i suppose a follow-up to that providing some other alternatives to the location of it so we 've looked at four different options and i 'll go through those now the first was to leave it where it currently is so the issue with that is that the when a bus pulls in the actual rear of the bus will overhang into the intersection and that presents a safety risk i suppose that we don 't think is worth taking it is on the departure side of an intersection so when trans lincoln and officers look at a location of a bus stop there 's a preference to put it on the what they say the departure side of the intersection if it 's at a minor road and that 's so that when the bus stops pulled up and people are lighting it doesn 't necessarily block that sight distance for a vehicle wanting to make a left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at impact to resident parking and also the proximity of that bus stop to any other bus stops or to safe crossing locations and and to the rest of the footpath network so they 're part of the considerations i suppose that have fed into where we 've looked at these different options so as we said option one was to leave it as it is but that overhangs a few meters into the intersection and i although the intersection is truncated it still presents a risk that we 're not particularly comfortable with with proceeding with the second option which was our preferred location before we received an objection was on the approach side of the the dean and high street intersection this is predominantly because it doesn 't have any properties that sort of immediately front it and has minimal impact to parking however its location on the approach side isn 't ideal in terms of where that location sits as we said before because when a buses are lighting it sort of blocks that sight distance for vehicles turning left and right out of the intersection the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the intersection of the approach side or departure side of the crook shank and dean street intersection there 's no properties that have a sort of driveway or frontage to that particular location however it is starting to move know 130 or 125 metres from the the bus stop on the opposite side of dean street and so there 's a preference from translink to sort of have those in close proximity in case you 're transferring from services or if you 're um or you know if you need to move from one to the other um that they 're sort of closely located and that there 's a way to cross sort of safely so the southern extent crookshank street it 's on the upper limits i suppose of that separation between the two bus stop locations whilst it 's still an okay location um it 's probably not as preferred as the the option d which is on the southern side of dean street and venables so that location does have an impact on on parking so there 's a section i suppose it 's about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park there and it would be impacted as a result of this location however the location is very close to the opposite bus stop on dean street it 's also very close to the intersection of dean street and french will road which gives people an avenue to cross the road and get back to that opposite bus stop and is a bit closer i suppose to council 's existing footpath network um so you can see on the on the plan there in the zoomed in view where that the two where that bus pad is is where you could probably reasonably park a car that will be impacted however the property on the right hand side with the driveways there close to venable street is on a corner so they do have an avenue to park in venable street for access to that property so whilst it 's removing i suppose a bay or where you can park adjacent to the front there is still the option to park on venable street there so given the [Music] the preference to have it close to the opposite bus stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the opposite side of the road its proximity to the roundabout and the existing network and its mutable impact on parking that 's council officers i suppose preferred option moving forward so this bus stop represents one of i think two that are left on council 's program to bring up to dda compliance in conjunction with translink and is scheduled in the budget for this financial year so once we can lock this location in we 'll finish design and the crew will get out and finish it before end of financials so i 'm happy to take any questions from the table okay thanks very much stu uh just dda just uh disabling disability access yeah yep so disability discrimination act so discrimination right um and just that it 's still a hail and ride translinks still provide a hail written ride for the general public but yeah yes specifically designed in locations that need to be accessed by disability people with disabilities so they can get on public transport so that 's probably just an over overview of the process but i 'll just ask councillor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair uh any questions or any um information on that cancel smith anything oh and mr mayor just to comment um now dean street 's one of our busiest streets so it 'd be good to get this right i can understand people not wanting a bus stop outside their place i 've seen that happen a lot of times i think this is the safest option and revert to see if you get complaints with this one but i think if we liaise with that property owner it should be okay so i 'm happy with the proposal thanks council smith now i 've got a couple of lights on councillor kirkland council election and cancer rutherford and council wickerson thank you mr mayor for you um just wanting to in reference to option d which i i agree is looking like the best option two questions number one did we liaise with bus drivers about the exiting from that because given that that is a very busy intersection certainly at peak hour traffic times that roundabout whether or not they 're going to have challenges getting back into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoken to drivers about that and what their thoughts are around that in this process at all so that 's question one yeah so do the chair no we haven 't had those discussions yet with sunbus however there is from the exit there there is i suppose that emerged space there for them to merge into that that intersection and from some perspectives because it 's queued it does present i suppose a slower environment for vehicles to merge in but yeah acknowledge that that may um if there 's excessive cue made um i suppose it poses a difficulty if people aren 't you know being polite and courteous in driving but you know as the way the mergers is marked it should be that it 's sort of like a zip merge so they should allow for the bus to come in um but yeah noting that we may sort of have that discussion with the bus operators do the the buses have the giveaway to a bus anyway on them anyway yeah yeah just very mindful mr may that that that intersection is is certainly at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on just getting in and out of the roundabout without having to navigate entering buses and pedestrians and that sort of thing which leans into my second question for you is i note that there 's a little bit of language around the the accessibility of a lighting and um and boarding passengers crossing the road to go and connect are we looking at putting in a pedestrian crossing for safer passage for those pedestrians given that it will be again at that everybody 's got their eyes on just getting in and out of the roundabout not necessarily pedestrians yeah so through the chair there is um i suppose some existing crossing points at that at the roundabouts at the roundabout of french full and dean street there that would be sort of looking to utilise the current existing arrangements rather than propose something new in that current location so can you tell me what those exact areas are because i 'm not familiar with them so they 're at the moment i believe there is just some the slitter islands on the approach to the roundabout so there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so they 'll cross it staggered to the splitter island and then cross again onto the other side there and there is also if that suppose makes residents or patrons a bit uncomfortable there is the underpass to the northern side of that roundabout as well that snakes back up onto the other side of french fall road the long way yeah yeah i suppose it 's not ideal but no you wouldn 't yeah i 'm just thinking of the pedestrians and their safety i suppose is is paramount in in the decision as well as those bus drivers being comfortable that they 're going to be able to get back on to the main flow without too much interruption to their to their schedule through the chair to you know in terms of the loca the possible locations um it was i suppose located where we had the most amount of existing so further down to that crookshank street one there 's there 's no appropriate crossing point so they then either have to walk all the way back up to here or to the south back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it i suppose that 's closest to what existing infrastructure was already there um but take the point that yeah there are you know from that location to cross the road there 's a bit of a trek that 's up to the intersection all right thank you thank you uh council election thanks mr man three two three three two stuart um if we 're talking about a liking to join up to another service i don 't think it 's the right spot there is one back at kerrigan and dean street on the western side where you were the light from there and then i joined up with the dean and kerrigan on the outside the food store that 's where you would a light if you 're going to we 're talking about bus service 402 as i understand is the only one that goes past this point here and so i guess my question is do we know how many people actually use that point at all given that it is pretty close between the one at kerrigan and dean and then the one just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explain the the requirements but to meet the legislation they 've got to be a certain distance it 's not where they are they 're going to give you 150 meters distances rather than whether they 're being used or not just to be compliant yeah there 's a preference i suppose in the location of this is an existing i suppose established bus stop with translink and their preference is to to retain a bus stop in that particular block um so that 's probably what drove the the location of it noting that yes there is one at the dean street to the south of kerrigan street and then there is also a service that comes along kerrigan and turns left and heads up dean street as well and there 's a bus stop close to that location but in terms of when we 're doing the planning for for bus stop locations there 's a preference to have them ideally within sort of 400 metres of most residential areas so that you 're within sort of a radius catchment and so if you 're in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street there in that venables hide crookshank that area there some will be able to be in close proximity to the ones that you 've mentioned but then if you 're getting closer to ramsey ramsey moore 's creek this is probably the the next closest location so that sort of drives the decision as to where we need to have those extra ones but in terms of the actual patron numbers that are there i couldn 't say off the top of my head but i can we can ask the operators and try and provide that information back because they do keep some numbers on who are lights and where that happens thank you i just thought that would have been a consideration um as to why whether you continue the service or not if it 's not being used and you kind of given it is such a busy area yeah probably if it was possible not to have it because of how busy it is i 'd be preparing that way but um i 'm happy with your report it 's a requirement that we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's an option to have it or not yeah just through the chair all we 're doing with this bus stop is it 's funded and we 're just making it slightly safer so those locations they don 't like losing them translink determine that network and we 're just doing a task for them which is just adjusting this one bus stop and we we 've spent over 18 months of this to adjust the bus stop and they they determine and will adjust network and where they 're located but that 's translink that does that not us council rutherford um yeah i 'm along the same lines as councillor kirkland i 'm just a little worried about the prox the close proximity to that roundabout and how busy that roundabout is and i was also concerned about um visibility for those people backing out of their driveways into a very busy area so um do we know whether there 's going to be clear vision or will there be an obstruction to their vision so through the chair at the moment the the with the run in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's there it actually obstructs some of those driveways there like physically physically obstructs them but in an urban area given the run in length and the length of the bus it 's quite common that we would allow that to happen so on the opposite side of the road the bus stop where it actually sits does extend over a driveway so the idea i suppose is that the bus is only there temporarily it 's not parking and you know at a rest break or anything it 's just dropping and alighting passengers and continuing to move but we note that that is an issue for the residents that are there and that whilst the bus is there it will have some impact on site distance for people reversing out but at any of those locations along dean street you you 'll encounter that same problem at any of the locations we 've picked to reverse out of a driveway for buses there at that time you won 't see so it it 's it 's a difficult situation but in an urban area the expectation is is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move off and then that person will have you know outside those times they 'll have clear sight distance to burst out of the driveway and probably the general public it 's halem ride they can just wave a bus down at anyone and that 's probably do the same thing sorry mr mayor i i think stuart for that it probably wasn 't the question i probably should have asked is is the bus stop a covered bus stop with walls uh no no so through the chair it 's just the um concrete slab and the j-pole so it doesn 't have a shelter associated with it okay so that was my concern if it was a shelter was it a permanent vision hazard so thank you for the other description but it wasn 't quite where i was going with you so just uh just a little concerned about how close it is to that roundabout and how busy that roundabout is yeah councillor wilkerson thanks mr media along the same lines yeah what was he going to be a a shelter in sometime future and would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um but you 've answered that uh yeah so so through the chair if there was to be a shelter there located it would be set back beyond i suppose that pad so that extend the pad out and have the footpath go in front of it so that 's for twofold reasons is that translink has a preference not to run footpaths behind the back of shelters but also if it 's set back that little bit further then you 've got a clear vision for a vehicle reversing out that it doesn 't obstruct it so if we were to do one in the future it 'd be sort of at the back end of that concrete slab um where we could which would allow a bit more sight distance coming out of the aid of a driveway there and i take your point too that the the buses will only be there for a moment while they uh park and move on um and the one car park that we lose that probably would have created more of a vision hazard for a longer period of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes sense um we were talking about the disability access before and on the little breakout diagram there the crossfall maximum of 2.5 percent that 's about the same as what a a road lane would be and i know that 's a maximum but that seems steep like if we 're sitting there with a wheelchair you can quite easily roll on that uh do we try and get them more level than 2.5 where we can yeah so through the chair the the crossball that 's adopted there obviously is the maximum the reason why that 's shown there is that they haven 't gone and done survey pickup at that location yet because we 're in concept because we were looking at different options we didn 't want to go and get surveyed every single one of the different options so once we 've locked that in they can go and pick up survey and try and get that grade a little bit better the grade there isn 't too bad so the idea is that i suppose we 're trying to keep it as flat as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they have to adopt to off the top of my head i don 't know what the max grade is i dare say probably is that two and a half percent um but they 'll be trying to put it as flat as we possibly can but in the absence of survey they 've just said what the maximum would be i suppose yeah okay and find one mr fma um you know you talked about having um a community engagement with the the residents there what 's the process so will you go back now that uh we 've landed soon to land on a resolution for it back to the those affected properties and get some feedback from them and then come back to a table or what what through the chair previously i believe that there were um it was more a letter to the residents to tell them that that bus stop was going to be going into that location and then that prompted i suppose that the particular resident to raise an objection with it so i believe that would be the way going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ location and that bus stop would be located there and some information and some drawing about it and then giving them an afternoon i suppose to come to council and talk to them if they wish and sorry the final one i just sort of then um with i haven 't caught a bus for a while but does the bus service stop at a certain time at night is it stop at seven o 'clock or later i 'm just thinking about that it 's only one park but yeah so through the chair it 's um six to six of the hours that are associated with the the bus zone so we 'll they 'll be marked as uh monday to monday to saturday i think six to six and so it 'll only be through those hours but i believe that the bus service uh depending on the schedules but generally we allocate six to six which gives translink and the operators a little bit of flexibility if they have to change schedules but um outside and six then it is available for someone to park in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much thanks very much mr mate just uh through you to stuart and peter yeah it 's a it 's bit of a hard one that 's because i think all four options aren 't ideal um but i do believe that this is probably the best option over the over where it currently is so and and uh one of my questions is also going to be about the grade for the handicap so as far as options go i think it 's the best it 's been presented to us so thank you chancellor kirkland oh thanks mr me i 'm stuart i don 't really mean to labor on this but i 'm just not mindful of the current um bus stop has a really wonderful shady tree there and just previously in the questioning you 've mentioned that this is just going to be a cement slab is it council 's responsibility to maybe plant a tree or something there too to come because we 're very conscious of the environment that we live in and just throwing those residents it 's a doctor 's surgery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elderly people etc that potentially are utilizing this service to access that doctor 's surgery and to be sitting in the sun is not ideal and hopefully that down the track that would be a sheltered bus stop but in the interim whose responsibility is it and it would we be making some um consideration about providing that shade through the chair at this stage there wasn 't consideration to that but um if it cancel wishes to we can look at the installation of the scree tree there however we 'd probably have to consider overhead power how many and services and and some other impacts i suppose that are in that place um just probably just to give a bit of context on how many of these pad ones would we have across the region um without any shading through the chair we have installed these pads over the last three to four years and i can 't think of the number um and the funding is only for the dda compliance so the flat piece there is no funding for shelters and we 've got hundreds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming out and there may be we will be going back there and looking at putting covers over it but there 's two things one just about every bus stop as described by stewart they push it back off the network but every time we do that in suburbia it is blocking the the view or the sight line for that temporary little piece so in suburbia bus stops are on the in front of houses that 's how they work so there will be an impact as we go forward potentially by installing them but there 's a recognition that we should be trying to do at least the higher usage ones getting shade there so translink are coming to talk to council i think there may even be a meeting in the mayor 's diary within the next month and that 's to talk about a program of bus shelters peter through you mr mayor that 's music to my ears um to hear that you 're having that meeting with translink probably we 've been as new council as a previous chair of infrastructure there have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelters across across the region but again subject to funding and grants that were available hitting those high network roads where a lot more public not more use were able to do it so yeah and again it 's a rolling program where we 'll look to include more it 's good to see that i think with the climate change we want to get more people out of single people driving a vehicle more people on public transport if we can encourage that through better means of um comfort comfort uh is the best way to do that so yeah i agree mr mayor and i suppose in this they can stand under the tree and then walk down to the thing when the bus is approaching so um that 's good to see thanks peter for that information thank you councillor smith you happy to move option d move councillor smith secret second council of kirkland i 'll put that those in favour margins carriage unanimous thank you councillors moving on to item 10.5 beef roads corridor queensland beef roads corridor request councillor smith you we 've had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of this one so we 'll hand over to angus to um walk us through this one council i 've got a phone call from uh mayor central highlands gary hayes asking to uh being the beef capital but with two major processing plants that we we consider being included in this group uh for our own interests as well so i 'll hand over to angus on that morning mayor and councils um through the chair um as the mayor 's indicated we 've received an invitation from mayor carrie hayes from central highlands to uh participate in this queensland beach corridors uh council 's group um it probably goes without saying that the beef industry is significant to uh not only the wider region but also to rockhampton with um we 'll claim both meat processors even though one 's on the other side of our boundary um so we have two substantial meat processors in rockhampton we have a number of livestock transport operators that are based out of the great sphere industrial area so the industry as a whole is significant to rockhampton the beef @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funding and particularly targeted at sealing a number of unsealed road networks throughout central queensland to improve the efficiency and continuity of the the beef supply chains um so for example in rockhampton where we have our meat processors they can be impacted by adverse weather events where you might have you know a road closed in the central islands or the central west uh where they 're not actually able to get uh livestock transported uh into rockhampton either by flood impacts or uh impassable unsealed roads um happy to take any any questions in relation to the report counselor kirkland i miss probably a comment more than anything mr mayor i just think that um you know council have recently uh illustrated and shown through the queensland business friendly councils program our commitment to local business and um that this particular alignment shows substance and reassures the regional rate payers as well as all those industry rural industry stakeholders that we 're batting for them and to achieve better outcomes it 's a shame that rate payers and councils have been forced into needing to finance matters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be doing but connector and feeder roads that lead through um the rockhampton regional council is not just not just our footprint of course the other councils as well is responsible for tourism and mining and and other energy the energy sectors there 's there 's strength in united forces and there 's no denying that when other tiers of government see that we 're all combined commitment we should hopefully see some return of substance from them through way of grants and getting these roads done i think it 's a great project program and happy to be involved yes thank council kirkland and again uh improving safety on those roads too is something there that 's probably not um highlighted enough but you know improving those roads at a long long distances and the more safer you can make them uh the better is for the all involved again with tourism and the resources sector uh and then agriculture as well through the check yes it 's while it 's focused on beef corridors and the beef industry supply chain it certainly has much wider ramifications for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some of those families do business in rockhampton and have kids that come to school in rockhampton yeah that 's right okay counselors with no further questions could i seek a mover and a second uh councillor smith seconded councillor rutherford i 'll put that those in favor passion 's carried thank you councillors thanks angus oh yes unanimous thank you uh item 11 11.1 known as summation councillor shane luxtron wasted management resource recovery conference lunderberg uh you 're happy to move yes mr can i seek a second now with regards to that one councillor maters uh any comment to that councillors any questions if not i 'll put that those in favor propose emotions carried thank you council we have a couple of items to be dealt with in closed session but is there any questions on notice or urgent business nothing there i 'll move into uh i 'll ask that a mover in a second order that we move into closed session to deal with two items 15.1 property acquisition and 15.2 seller properties for overdue rates move councillor wickerson second council of kirkland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move that we move to close session struggling through it move against the wicked kirkland second in council of wickets and i 'll put that those in favor motions carried thank you we 're in the closed session [Music] now that we 've

some more but i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and i 've known him uh personally through the bedual and malmo ratepayers association and his lovely wife famous emily as well who 's obviously uh deeply saddened at the moment as we all are so um on thursday at 11 o 'clock at coco brew there 's going to have a um a small uh memorial for him there 's it 's a closed invitation to the funeral proper just for family but if councils are interested in attending which we 'd all be welcomed to attend that council smith you want to add some yep yeah thanks for that uh council i 've had it on my notes to bring up and i completely forgot about it um i remember going to an lgiq conference where bruce was presented with his 30-year certificate and he also was chair of the sale yards board for a long long time well over 20 years i think so yeah and a great community advocate he was always at the right player meetings uh just loved his community and uh yeah very sad and sad okay thanks very much for that

community so yeah sad day okay counselors there be no further mr me yes councillor smith mr mayor oh sorry uh could that be recorded as a notion so it goes in the minutes just in recognition of a long-serving uh counsellor yep we 'll get some words together again um bruce is uh chairing the meetings at the bedroom ratepayers one on uh they 're very diligent and on there i 'm sure the efforts of that group for that community will be felt for many years to come uh his involvement council wickerson mr mayor i appreciated bruce 's uh support one night because it was a bit surprising when we had um comments on the floor which we all hear in the rural sector you know we get nothing for our rates and i might have commented something like um you 're probably better off yeah than previously because we we put more back in than we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some house from the audience uh very supportive he said no raid post that 's exactly right we 've never been better off more better off than than under rockhampton region so it was a bit a pleasant surprise that he jumped being on the former council but he recognized the difficulties of the small rate base and trying to service your community so he was very grateful that 's what it was fairly green council at that time and really appreciated that yeah okay councillors um council smith you 'd like to move that cancer wickets in second carried unanimously thank you councillors thanks very much for that that 's okay um on that note we 'll uh we 'll close the meeting up and uh thank everyone for your attendance thank you

member of the councillor kirkland um councillor kirkland um mr may i also attend the emmaus um pnc meetings i would potentially argue though that because we are not necessarily um on the committee we don 't under office bearers that that that is not doesn 't constitute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody wants to be deceived an extending mind my daughters go to my so yeah councillor kirkland again if you wanted to um remain in the meaning to believe that there 's a perceived um well i think that since council of latin has volunteered that he 's going to leave the room i 'll i 'll follow suit can i question and you can ask the table yeah councillor latcham will deal with these manifestos children and these members attend the meetings not a member children children attend college but i can 't go to meetings with you yep uh and councillor kirkland uh and you 'll leave the meeting council election and councillor kirkland wishes to um to remain in the meeting and would like to ask the table uh for a decision around that so if that 's all right yep no that 's okay councillors any uh concerns with councillor kirkland uh remaining in the meeting i 'm happy to move that uh councillor kirkland remains secret second councillor wickerson i 'll put that days in favor those opposed motions carried thank you thank you mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something arises uh in the course of the meeting please

license leave the meeting yeah the big party just rocked up it 's fine uh thanks very much christine thank you good morning mayor and councillors it 's my pleasure this morning to report uh about the community assistance program environment and sustainability scheme we 've specifically got one application here from emmaus college p f association it is to support the uh the student-led cq sustainability youth summit and also a range of school waste management initiatives being delivered in conjunction with the recycling heroes schools program total grant value today of three thousand dollars thanks christine council is any comment you move councillor um smith seconder councillor kirkland yes it 's um it was great to see last year 's event that i may have put on it was well received and some challenging questions from members in the gallery but really something they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means moving forward so i think it 's a great way to encourage youth tomorrow to um help look about where we 're going okay then um i would yeah i 'll move in a second with regards to that if there 's no further questions i 'll put that those in favor oppose motions carried unanimously we 'll invite councillor latcham back into the room please thanks council election uh we 'll move on to item 7.2 uh bringing nature back the operational nrm program update thanks very much christine thank you so the second report this morning is an update on council 's operational natural resource management program uh it includes a summary of works completed in the last 12 months and also outlines proposed delivery partners for the 2223 period of note is a number of partnerships which uh council has the opportunity to enter into with community organisations including multicultural australia and capricornia catchments this will add to work also being undertaken at this point in time with cq university and capricornia catchments already on existing council projects so this update uh today asks that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very much christine councillor kirkland chair of the portfolio would you like to move but uh speak to this as well yeah thank you thank you mr maybe it 's definitely happy to move to receive this report another comprehensive report that shows the great work that 's been happening in the community and certainly then that collaboration space and helping uh those a number of different um people in the community to to find gainful work as a consequence of being involved in the nrm programs so across as a huge spectrum of people i congratulate you and your team on what i said a comprehensive report and the good work that you 're doing collaboratively across the across the organization but also around the community so thank you very much for that good work thank you um probably just a question um through the to christine the um creaks in the waterways we note there 's a number of uh issues at the moment with overgrown vegetation uh are there any programs there that are available for council to apply for i 'm not sure whether it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for we 've had previous work for the doll schemes that have been able to um to do piecemeal areas but we 're looking at uh maybe trying to get into some regular program whether it 's just the one-offs or longer-term issues that we would try to uh get involved in so if you can 't answer it you take it on notice and uh come back to us but it was one we were talking about yesterday so that 's okay look uh mr mayor i believe look it is a quite a holistic issue that we need to look at to determine what the various goals are in certain areas obviously we are aware that we have certain weed issues in some some areas there are obviously issues with overgrowth of exotic species in areas which has multiple implications for aesthetics and water flow through those areas as well i don 't believe that there 's any single program with available funding for these kinds of programs at this point in time but certainly something that we can be looking more holistically at opportunities for moving forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were piecemeal um approaches previously i think that the the thoughts for the council maybe start to talk about a workshop and then maybe formulating a uh another summation to the lgaq conference about uh here we go from there probably not trying to steal council of mother 's thunder but i think it 's something there that we were talking about yesterday and maybe um we 're all interested in but uh no decimation coming up about looking at that going forward councillor fisher can you hear me yep yeah um mr mayor could i add to that um the investigation of bio control um whether we go back probably about eight years ago there was a number of programs where they were looking at using uh in predator insects and other rusts and things as some of the control of some of the weeds and i 'm just wondering whether uh that could also be included in that uh there 's a bit of a study to see if we could actually sort of see if there was a natural way that we could bring some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might um we might condense that into a workshop it 's probably a little bit digressing from this um notice much but i think what the the concept is there that we we work towards that but uh talk with alicia and the chair um as we go forward with that or the chairs the two in that space bay uh that said we have a mover and a second with regards to this recommendation move council at kirkland uh is there a second council wickerson um any further questions of christine this one if not i 'll put that those in favor opposing machines carried unanimously thank you uh 7.3 the draft biodiversity plan for 2022-26 and we 'll go after you thanks doug okay questions council kirkland oh look my question is really just around being able to read part of the the draft here so i think it 's page 58 just um oh sorry 56 of the actual report down the bottom where it says strategic links to other legislation can you just read what that first line is it 's really interesting to me mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of legislative requirements actual points it says local government must ensure that the plan does not breach the requirements of other legislation including those other acts yeah yeah yeah so it 's um that was relevant and i felt it was important to make sure that i had my head around that because i couldn 't read it at all on my copy thank you yeah a lot of devolution and responsibility over the years uh coming back down to council so uh without any dollars behind it uh remind you of that councillor smith oh yeah thanks mr mayor and karen i know i 've probably asked this before when i was that was my committee but a lot of these the list of things and a lot of them are trees i 'm pleased to see the tacoma and yellow bells in there but i 've often asked about the tiruliana kadaji it apparently kills native bees and i know rocky city council actually took all the all those trees out a long time ago but they 're still growing everywhere and causing a problem because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about them falling on their houses because they 're not on the list we won 't take them out that 's the first one and the other one is the west african church tree that we don 't want people to grow but where have we got it in here through the chair i think the truliana tree is a native species which is why it 's not in the plan at this point it 's definitely not a declared one under the biosecurity act i 'm i 'm maybe incorrect there and the african chill tree is in containment the containment section of the biosecurity the proposed biosecurity plan yeah thank you thank you thanks for that karen councillor fisher 's uh got everything uh the green thumb there and he 's put his hand up he might be able to give us some info on that council fisher can i just reply to the truliana uh it he actually used to be able to buy it in every nursery it doesn 't come up naturally yeah sorry yeah cancer fisher might be able to help yeah um the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a native of uh up on the edge of mount bart of barcelona but uh it is one of those ones that there is still great debate as to whether it is a problem as far as native bees or not and a number of botanists are still arguing that that fact um i think it 's one of those ones we should discourage the use of it but it is because it 's a native plant species it becomes very very hard to list it as a weed the similar sort of thing with the pathology of the west african tulip that one also is one that causes a lot of debate i know gladstone regional council have made a point of removing those out of all of their parks and council land um my my feeling is it 's not as bad as some of our other weeds if you had a budget i 'd rather have that game controlling the likes of lakina and some of those other things but still discouraging um you know sort of the uh use of the uh west african tulips it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh yeah if they 've got to be cut out cut out at that point um if that 's a little bit of help for everybody thank you councillor smith i just apologize karen yeah i 've had this i this discussion with you before so you are correct and um that i would rather see them somewhere because um as i said if they i know in gracefully there 's one on a corner there 's an elderly lady living there but because it 's not on the list we won 't take it out and she 's worried it 's gonna fall on the house anyway um so yeah i just have concerns about them and i know we 've got them all through other towns where they 've been planted as boulevard trees yeah and they are a beautiful tree but um yeah so anyway thank you it 's good that we 've um sorted that one again thanks councillor smith councillor kirkland um thank you mr mayor through you uh just doug with regards to page uh a lot of this page just so i can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've got there where it 's talking about local government and our responsibility is obviously to administer enforce the biosecurity act further down the paragraph there says local governments are also required to manage invasive biosecurity manner matter on land controlled by local government and of course pythonium is a continuing problem we 've got um you know the rat 's tail and all the others yeah all the other things i i 'm concerned about about this wording perhaps putting continuing to put the onus back on does he put the onus back on us to to pay for that you know obviously um it 's huge that 's a huge problem in our region at the moment it 's a massive area that we cover which is outlined in the um in your strategy so can you elaborate what what that sentence means it says we 're required to manage so if we 're required to manage it and it 's not being managed i would imagine that there needs to be some budgetary contribution to that on our behalf how how do we get around that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doug i just saw it as a subject matter expert for the biosecurity act right here karen might be able to answer that bit more in depth than i can through the chair i 'm happy to reword it that 's fine i guess it 's just trying to explain that we on top of the enforcement actions that we have we also actually do have a requirement to control invasive weeds and animals on our land and we do what we can with the resources we 've got and i think it 's well recognized that local governments aren 't able to get everywhere all the time there 's not a local government in queensland that can so we that 's why we prioritize what we do and we have the priority list so we will focus on those ones that are in those higher priority lists and then the asset based protection ones will probably will prioritize the assets that we need to protect is how i guess the plan works so we 'll destroy the infestations of the high priority ones we 'll contain what we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep it to an area it does mean reduce it within that area as well and then now asset based ones we we focus on those areas of high value to council and the community is it is it worth then thank you karen is it worth do you think rewording it slightly i i just you know i can imagine landowners coming to us you know roadsides and wherever else where and we just simply don 't have the resource or capacity to get to it but if it 's worded this way it 's almost like well too bad you have to you have to do it right now um is that onus in the wording do you what do you think and i think there 's some ones that we we need to cut free as well i mean the leukemia who 's going to say that we 're going to be able to eradicate that out of their you know region um are we going to keep throwing money at it yeah and not going to be like is there a point where you just say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah yeah i i think i 'd feel a little bit more comfortable if you were to perhaps even elaborate the way you 've just now done to us about the prioritizing yep um and just so that anyone who 's reading into this can see that that 's obviously something that 's resource dependent yep yeah that 's yeah i think there 's words wording that could um help capture that as we go forward so mr mayor and probably question through to karen um would the time to make though that softening of word change be before or after community and consultation i guess is my question through the chair i can make that change before we go out to community consultation that 's no trouble at all okay okay and then if it needs rewording after we can do that okay thanks karen council mathers oh thanks very much mr mayor um i 've just got a couple questions yeah that 's okay so through youtube doug first thing and one statement i want to make which is thanks very much for the work that you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's obviously something that we have to have so i appreciate what you 've done there um the first question i had was very similar to what um council cocoon was saying with some of the wording of that i just sort of looked at it and it just takes me back to the conversation we had yesterday in regards to you know the creeks we know where we 're fighting a losing battle there but we certainly need state to step up and give us a you know give us a hand or give us some financial handle or get in there and help as well but i think it 's very prudent that we realize that as a council it 's very hard for us to push and request things from state government when when you know when we 're struggling to do our part which is maintaining 100 meters either side of those culverts and bridges and everything so you know i understand the pressure you guys are under and your team 's under and you know it 's our job to try to get some sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wings a little bit and do a little bit more of that area but i 'm just very mindful that it 's you know if we if we 're trying to push state government to get in there and clean those creeks we 've got to do our part as well so it 's something that we need to be mindful of the other question um the question that i had was uh with um doug in regards to not very much for community consultation doug but what exactly are we um what feedback are we looking for are we hoping for in regards to the community consultation when this goes out what what what are you what are you hoping to hear back from uh from the community it 's awesome no need to change it [Laughter] how long has that been a string yeah no i suppose you know do you think that you know are you hoping that you will be hearing from a lot of people saying hey we 've got issues with um you know pests in this area this area they say aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or are you are you thinking they might come back with some ideas that um could help us as well yeah through the chair um a bit of a bit of both counsellor it 's a bit more high level than um then trying to just uh find out exactly exactly yeah there 's some weeds here or some pigs here so we 're just trying to get a bit of a bit of a better idea of of the community how it 's changed the last five years with pest management and how we can push those resources in the right direction and i understand what you 're saying it 'd just be very interesting to see what the mix is going to be because i would imagine that the main feedback we 'll be getting we 'll be hearing from landowners i would imagine more so than any um urban people would certainly be more or rural you would think and through the chair those um land a lot of landowners are in groups and they will give us feedback from from that group and karen and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ councilman kirkland um thank you samir i i did go through this document and got a few things highlighted and circled and one of those is just under the i can 't find the page number on this this one here it 's not written on it but it 's uh at the bottom karen where it 's talking about best practice and uh it 's on the page where you 've got the land holders day photograph so at the end there it says about research um about invasive plants i was proving to the landcare meeting that the last landcare meeting that they had and one of the conversations was around how to use these pests how to use these pest weeds i mean something for csiro my question to you is what to what level does council get involved in that type of research and what are our responsibilities around that through the chair so on the ground research we don 't get involved in a lot what happens is council pays money to the land protection fund every year so we pay a considerable amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daf and they do a lot of that on the ground bio control research and other research through their labs there 's one of charters towers that i 'm aware of and i think there 's a couple others around the state as well so that 's sort of our contribution back to through that program okay that 's awesome thank you council wickerson uh thanks mayor uh through you to both doug and karen i think uh whenever i catch up with my rural residents one thing that always comes out with pest control and weed control is they just want a bit of a had to do the work by put the labor in to to keep their property and maybe their road front each clear on road frontage on our behalf um but they just need a bit of a hand with either discounted or supply of of the chemicals that they need to do it but also there 's some legislative problems around that as well not not doing it but us providing it as contractors to us nearly unpaid contractors is that uh duty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're giving this to so i 'm just wondering there 's a way around that so these people are happy to do the work obviously for their own benefit too but how do we how do we smooth that process out so it 's possible to do it but i hope that that will come out with the with the consultation as well um through the chair and i guess we did have investigate incentives program as one of the action items in the in the plan so it 's something that maybe we can focus on uh during community consultation digging into that a bit bit deeper on where the community would like to see that and then we can do the analysis of that afterwards and see see how it pans out thanks karen councillor smith oh currently probably know my thoughts on this but it 'd be lovely if we could bring back those small land holder days that were really informative i think we need to change the um the heading because people with big properties or people in town thought that they wouldn 't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in those little events that we had was just incredible and i always had feedback from people saying that there wasn 't huge crowds there but um very interesting uh displays but interesting um presentations and you know even people i was with learned to get get maps of your property and see where you sit in the landscape you know see how close you are to creeks and and the river and all sorts of things so it was really really a good uh initiative i 'm not sure how much it cost us to have it but it 'd be good if we could bring that back one day i think it stopped with covered or stopped before then i think but i just thought well if we could bring those back that would be really really good thank you councillor kirkland thanks mr mayor um i 've just got highlighted here the 1080 program council it says here council will maintain the 1080 program um can you just there 's been some changes around that jose can you just probably enlighten us all as to what that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of changes to our 1080 baiting program the first one was um the death supply of 1080 runout which means council is responsible for purchasing our own 1080 through that program now we did receive some funding through one of the rounds of the daf funding to supplement that for the next three years and then the second changes were around some legislative changes all of our staff have gone through the relevant training to continue to supply that program so the um there 's just a new act in place in relation to the drugs and poisons regulation that we 've got to comply with which just means we 've had to do some extra work in creating our own deed polls and our own stock control books and all of that which has been done um just through you mr may thank you i 'm back to you karen on that 1080 then is it is it now available commercially is my understanding so why would council be continuing to supply that and do we supply it free to land owners and are they purchasing it able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it previously wasn 't available commercially yep so through the chair there is an opportunity for landowners to commercially purchase it on their own now i guess the advantages of the council program is we do it as a group and multiple landholders at once so you get the best effect against the invasive animal and we have a program where we supply the 1080 but the land holders supply the meat so it 's a little bit like an incentive program i guess that we supply the 1080 they supply the meat we inject it and then they 're responsible for laying the baits but getting multiple land holders together at the same time really does give us more effective control over the wild dog and pigs and that 's why we think it 's still worthwhile to continue running it thanks karen thank you good good aleisha uh mr mayor just going to respond back to councillor smith 's um comment in regards to the landholders day so my understanding of that is um that along with a lot of other community events got absorbed into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i guess do and undertake and plan those events so that 's sort of um back with the discussion over with advanced rockhampton over what events uh council sees important to run in the future so it 's similar to our gardening competition and different pieces like that so just be mindful when you 're having that discussion with advanced rocky those resources went in there as well thanks alicia cancer fisher you can 't hear you must be on mute mate okay so my apologies for that um i actually i think this is the plan has actually got um a lot of community benefit and going through that but i would like to maybe suggest that we have pictures of our pest and weed species that we could get a little bit more community interest uh if they were able to go through and have a bit of an understanding of what some of these weeds are because quite a number are starting to show up in home gardens now and it 's not just the lacina but it 's quite a number of other pests that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's in flower at the moment and i went out with the council of may the uh last uh last week and we actually were able to identify these in community in um gardens and landscape gardens and different things so people don 't realize that they have got basics so just so wondering if we could go a little bit further the second part is we 've been talking about what we could do with the show probably some of the council areas this would be really good in the area at the show where we 've got a lot of the agricultural uh sections that we could actually even just have a static display of uh what we 're doing with our biosecurity plan yeah cancer fish it all comes at a budget but the invasive plants are on our website there um with all those species in that there for people to access as well so it 's online uh information there that 's able to be shared as well so good point but it 's great discussion as we 're heading up into a budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah so just to add to that um we do normally have some presents out at the rocky show um do you know karen are we planning to do the same this year through the chair yes pest management will be at the rocky show i believe yep so and a lot of those brochures and stuff we take out to the show yes yeah okay council i think we 've run the questions on that one we might um take them over in a second the council may though would you like to move seek a second uh councillor fischer if you 've got another question no he 's right you 're on me again i 'm happy are you on a second rider councillor fisher second i 'll put that days in favor those opposed motions carried unanimously thank you councillors 7.4 the dog off leash areas community engagement policy council do we need any comments or commentary on that one that 's self-explanatory i 'm open to against the election thanks mr mayor just a question a couple of questions um i noticed some john hegbold park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and opposite that park is is bill nevin park and i noticed i 've noticed on many occasions i 've been out there there 's obviously already dogs off on leash using that area was that considered as part of it and the other thing was minimum standards for these unleashed areas so when we 're talking about john hegbold there 's no mention of a dual water for the dogs and for that for humans as well so i would have thought water was pretty important especially if there heat that there 's water provided wherever these dog parks are so that was probably one of my concerns on john hegbold yep we might just get answer those questions amy he 's been working on this one council social response thank you morning councillors mr mayor um so to give you a bit of a recap i guess as it 's been a while since we 've seen you guys um so last year we workshopped the minimum standards all that kind of thing after our first round of consultation um where it was evident that the public would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog off leash areas because the ones we have at the moment are simply just too small especially for those larger breeds so during that workshop we did sort of come to the agreement i guess at that point in time that it was quite expensive to fully embellish fully fence these large parks that we 'd love to have um but just not feasible to do a whole heap of new ones so from that workshop we identified the dog friendly park concept where we 've introduced i think it 's around four potential new sites that are just a park where you are allowed to have your dog off leash if obviously your dog can obey commands um so these don 't have that kind of level of embellishment that we would love to see at every dog off leash park um but it 's also giving that community that option of having another option to take your dog too so in terms of having areas where there 's water available that 's if there 's no current water set up to that site that 's obviously a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of thing so i guess that was where that decision was made back in that workshop is to perhaps have some of these other areas that maybe they might not have the facilities like some of them might do like georgeson we 've got taps and all that sort of thing but it 's at least giving the community another option to go and run their dogs so in those kind of parks you may suggest people bring their own little water tubs and that sort of thing is sort of portable dog waters all that sort of stuff you can bring these days so i guess that was sort of where it sort of laid last time was that we had to come to an agreement to maybe some some of these dog friendly options aren 't as fully as embellished as we would have liked to have had yeah some of those ones on the coast and that they just take your arm water and go for yeah i just would have thought there was there must be some connection here because they 've got irrigation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but i 'm pretty certain it 'd have to be water there somewhere wouldn 't be too far to get one so it 's just as a minimum standard yeah and if there 's water there that 's definitely something like if like at this point we 're sort of just wanting um the recommendation to receive this report so that we can go to some more personalized consultation um because before the community think we 're just going to go out and let dogs run around in the park behind their yard we want to make sure that they are aware that it 's happening or that it might not even happen what their thoughts are this was just sort of we 've identified that maybe this is a great area the community could very well tell us that it 's not going to be so once we get to that point we 'll start looking into a bit more of what services are available council watching thank you another one i would have thought was an easy one to tick off from the list with the one down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's got water down there it 's already got a playground there um other than it 's not fenced in um but that would have been one easy one but more importantly um gross swaddling and the reason i 've mentioned that one besides being in my division is i seem to be forever logging calls for the dog tidy bags to be replenished so obviously there 's a lot of dog users or owners using those dog tidy bags maybe that was by having a look at how many times i log it obviously they 're being used quite regularly it would have been an area to the southern side of the footpath which would have been with trees and everything picks all the criteria would have been a nice area i would have thought for that area i guess the justification for not including that one in the report at the moment is that the eddie baker park is only sort of 800 meters down the road um and it already has an existing fence park with with us all the sort of some agility equipment and stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um part of eddie baker park to be this dog friendly concept keeping the fenced area so if someone still wants to take their dog in the fenced area but the playground there is completely fenced um it 's it doesn 't have any adjoining um houses so to speak there is sort of the road um abutting the adjoining owners so it was sort of a bit more made sense to sort of embellish the larger eddie baker park and try and sort of bring more people to the existing equipment that was already there for that one i 'm all in favor of eddie baker i think it 's a great park i just think with such a high concentration of residential uh around rose swaddling that and given its its popularity and how many people obviously use the dog tidy bags i would have thought that was one that would probably jump ahead of the next year 's one that 's proposed without the around norman roder parker which is out in the middle of nowhere yeah i guess it 's looking at also um like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the moment there is no dog off leash at all in parker so i i think in terms of where people want to see it there 's sort of nothing there and there 's already something here so we 're sort of trying to i mean if we 've got enough money to do both let 's do both but we 're already putting one out of john john which is our parkour so it 's not an actual same argument eddie baker and rose wanting too close the one on norman road and and john hegbol are very probably even closer i didn 't think john hedfeld was an actual endorsed i 'd have to check with local laws on that one i 'm not sure if it 's an actual yeah just something i think we 're just asking the community for their views at the moment yes that 's pretty much what this report 's about actually yeah thank you uh councillor fischer and then i 'll go to council kirkland council smith council fischer thank you mr mayor i 'm actually so glad that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of something that i 've been very very keen to see how we can expand um uh one thing there that i did learn uh with sort of part of the drive tourism is that a number of the western councils now are putting in a small off leash area in areas where uh caravan and motorhome people can pull over and give their dogs a break and like in barcalden it 's across um in the main street it 's just a small area as part of a park probably something similar to what uh oceanside park in rockhampton is but they 're finding now people sort of stopped there for a little while then they tend to stay in the town that night because they 've they 've spent a couple of hours just letting the dog have a bit of exercise i 'm just wondering whether it 's a little bit off uh from what this report is saying but whether we can invest it investigate a park that a small off-leash enclosed area with maybe some agility equipment that could actually be part of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did suggest for possibly in the second year budget to put a smaller um even though we 've sort of said we want to steer away from smaller areas a smaller area um at the information center on gladstone road um typically people who travel with dogs usually have smaller dogs so um providing that sort of fenced area in there we 've spoken to advance as well and that with what they want to sort of revamp that in tourist information center there as well they thought that would be quite a good idea as well so is that the kind of thing you 're talking about counseling exactly yes okay and i 'd just like to thank you for the report no worries thank you thanks again for councillor kirkland and council smith um thank you mr mayor uh just wanting to check with ergon park um is that going to be fenced i just i 'm just wondering whether because it is such a big area my mind would be thinking that would be a park for big dogs and there 's right behind that of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of activity there at certain periods in time and if it 's not fenced what 's the risk that we 're then putting the community out of potentially a larger dog yeah yeah i guess that 's what if i could i 'll just live from up from duthie park and that 's sun fence and the amount of dogs most of the people are responsible and it 's more that the um the owners having a timeout as well not only the dog but the owners do and once the dogs start to work together they yeah you find that they just sort of because those leashes aren 't there and they 're not protecting their own patch it 's a different uh different environment for them and they they tend to just group together and do their own thing people throw a ball and do that but yeah yeah that 's incredible it 's never been a real issue um as long as the road you know it 's far enough away from the road uh that 's not a problem yeah may i just add further yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouraging to know it doesn 't we have there 's certainly as everybody here in rockhampton knows there are so many dogs and the people who are responsible for looking after that just left the room but uh there is there are a number of dogs certainly in that park avenue area that seem to roam around those dogs aren 't dogs that are going to be behaved but they may end up congregating at places where there might be other dogs i 'm just i am i would be remiss of me to not to not mention to make sure that when we 're in stating these facilities that we 're not creating a potential safety risk to people who are using the the amenities nearby yeah so um i appreciate that there 's going to be well-behaved dogs i suppose is it something we just do case by case and if there is an incident you then have to put up so we have suggested to run even just monthly customer request reports um just making sure that there hasn 't been complaints so do a 12-month trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's go ahead with this do a 12-month trial period where we keep an eye on these requests making sure um that we act upon and if we get to a point where we 've had three complaints in a week we shut that place down like it 's it 's we keep that flexibility so that we know that we haven 't opened ourselves up um with that 's why we 've sort of deliberately picked parks that aren 't these prime playground parks we ergon park is quite a fair way away hopefully there 's not so many stray dogs we 've sort of picked parks that aren 't near playgrounds but if they are the playgrounds are fully fenced so we 're trying to identify and minimise that risk but obviously especially with dogs like there 's always going to be a risk even when it 's fenced or not so that 's why we 're sort of yeah trying to sort of make sure that the community aware before we even go ahead and do it then it will also be we 've been talking with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of things as well uh making sure that the community realized that these places are for trained dogs i certainly wouldn 't go and be taking my dogs there without a fence off leash so it 's yeah that education as well as and just that constant follow-up as well to make sure that we haven 't created a problem really good feedback i 'd encourage counselors to go and have a look at the duthie park example of an area that 's not fenced and and observe what happens in that just so get an understanding about them yeah how they behave i have two more questions they 're different sorry thank you mr mayor um just with regards to putting in um all of the agility activities and and seats and that sort of thing for those particular um parks that tick those boxes that 's that 's a great idea i 'm just the there 's a fairly high amount next to ergon park is that just for clearing of the land and preparing the land ergon park is a pretty raw site so it probably will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um because it 's basically just like a livestock fence around it at the moment i don 't think there 's even really a pedestrian gate in there so that yeah the kes the cost of ergon um probably is a bit more than the other parts there is no sort of landscaping or irrigation or anything like that at the moment um but i guess it 's before we go and invest too much in there as well that 12-month period will be a good example um we 'll have qr codes on the signs um so hopefully we can try and encourage people to provide feedback positive or negative um just so we can get sort of a bit of an idea um we 've also got the ability to do um like people movement monitoring so that could be something if you 're interested in looking at after the 12 months time we can sort of engage a consultant and look at how many people actually visited that site and when it was popular and all that sort of stuff so before we go and invest fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff we want to make sure that place is going to work first and get used and then we 'll look at further investment somewhere like georgia cenoval we know it gets used we know the people want it we 're getting requests every day for shade and seats and all that sort of stuff so that kind of place we would invest in these new ones we want to give it that trial period first excellent so then i would probably ask that further down the track once this has come back from community engagement et cetera that there is consideration of whole of life costs then to continue to maintain those areas ergon park is really looks after itself at the moment so it would now then be there 'd be an expectation that there would be some ongoing maintenance that that 's going to of course be needed to be included in in parts and and that 's more resource again that 's right that 's going to be needed so when that comes back that would need to be done yeah and is there a capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that just going to we 're hoping they can be there permanently so yeah while those sort of signs are up so yeah and we have been working sort of closely with the parks team and also local laws as well to make sure that it 's wherever we 've chosen um it 's going to work well with them as well thanks cancer smith uh yeah thanks mr mayor um i get very nervous about off-leash areas even though duthie park is working a treat now ten years ago it was an absolute nightmare and when i first took over that portfolio my god all i ever heard about was duthie park and all the problems the problem was that people used to let their dog off the lead before they got to the park knowing that they 're going to be able to run around down there so they let them off like a street before and we ended up having two local laws people there finding people on the spot so that stopped that well that was a bit of a heavy hand approach wasn 't a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something there i think just community a bit of education helped resolve some of those problems and again that 's uh you know there 's a way to be dealt with it yeah and also they were uh not staying in that area and going over to where the people the dog obedience people were trying to train their dogs and these other dogs were running around everywhere there 's no way i 'd take my dogs to one of these parks because they 're not used to other dogs i 'm surprised there 's not dog fights everywhere but anyway i 've got rural dogs we did talk about an area off the highway where the people pull up to go on that yepen trail and that 's the way i 'll come into rocky nearly every day there is a lot of tourists go down in that area and we talked about that area or curtis park yes and i would have thought that yepen area would would have been an idea more ideal place as far as parking is concerned so we did discuss yepen um with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people go to yepen to go for a walk they don 't necessarily go especially sort of close as there 's no dogs allowed in botanic gardens um so you 're potentially bringing in dogs to an area where people weren 't expecting they just wanted to go for a walk they didn 't want to be near dogs so we would have to have a fully fenced area in that area to make it comfortable for people who just want to go for a walk and not be disturbed by a dog and then if that 's the case when you 've got a fenced area there is quite a high velocity and flood in that zone um so we would have to look at whether it 's feasible to put a fenced area with equipment in a flood zone so it would have to probably go up a little bit higher at least not close to the yemen so that one um what you definitely was on our list yes and a lot of people identified that as a nice place for one in our last consultation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that walking path so close yeah council smith yeah um yeah we were talking about a fenced area for there certainly not an off-leash area being so close to the gardens yeah if i remember yeah even curtis park would have to be fenced in so close to the highway i 'm just thinking of people getting their dogs out of the car so yeah the highway at curtis park because it 's quite busy there yeah that 's the what that 's the information center is it yeah yeah so with the 12 months trial is it is there a like a desire to then say it doesn 't work out there 's a lot of problems is that then a desire to put money in the budget um to fence those areas still keep that that park there because i think they 're really good locations throughout the whole of rocky yeah i guess it depends on what the concerns are um if the concerns are just nuisance sparking all that sort of stuff with the nearby neighbours then offense isn 't going to solve that issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's working and it 's just the fence that 's the issue then that 's probably something we can look at keeping or embellishing further sort of thing or removing council rutherford um oh mr mayor i 'm happy to move the recommendation sir i thought councillor wickerson 's light was on for a question but he 's turned it you 're happy to move i 'm happy to move and i 'd like to um maybe speak to the report thank the officers i think a lot of work has been put into we 'll just grab a second and first counsellor and have a second to council wickerson so move councillor eleven second and council wickerson thanks again to rutherford yeah a lot of work has been put into spreading these around making sure that they 're available to all members of the community and also to service the different size of of dogs and the different needs of dogs whether that 's through agility or just open space to play so um thank the officers for the the effort great to see it at this point that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial it um i think it 's been something that the community have been asking for for quite some time so um great to have it to the point where we can now now go out there and and see how it goes we see more and more now where dogs are becoming sort of members of families and and exercising them is as important as exercising your children hence duthie park where we fence the kids and let the dogs run free so um you know it 's great to see there 's no fence for the kids though it 's the type of area as well and the playground 's fenced there 's no interference from the grips either they they work quite well i 'm a regular user of the park and for years and um yeah there 's no problems there so if there was anything it 's probably a taller block that needs to go in there because it 's so popular but anyway that said uh it 's it 's a great um yeah you 're right i think the community 's been asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time and it 's the trial is really going to allow those people that may be impacted the opportunity to have their say as well so it 's a great initiative and one that we support okay that 's said but i don 't think there 's any more questions we might put that to the vote those in favor opposed motions carried unanimously thanks very much councillors thanks very much amy moving on to 7.5 rockhampton botanic garden zoo 's redevelopment program update okay jacob thanks very much we 'll uh we 'll do a presentation happy to take questions as we go through it jacob yeah yeah good morning miss smith there 's no formal presentation we had a whole uh series of attachments included as part of the report so we 're just going to step through them so the report before you today has got three key matters across the botanic gardens and zoo redevelopment program so the first one is around seeking council 's endorsement for a revised concept design for the playground renewal to allow it to proceed into the detailed design part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around just receiving a progress update for the visitor hub and animal operations centre so that 's one that 's proceeding in detail design at the moment so we received a design submission on friday and wanted to just provide a brief um just a brief update on that the third item is something that 's probably new to what we 've discussed previously and that 's around the enclosure program so what we 've presented is three projects as part of the enclosure program that 's um we 're seeking an endorsement to proceed with preparing a design and construct tender for as well as some initial planning to secure some proposed animal species so happy to just step through the three of them so the first item around the playground renewal so a couple weeks ago we had a workshop and discussed some concepts as part of that and we collected a series of feedback we 've gone back to the appointed consultant incorporated a lot of that feedback and then have that revised concept presented so as part of the attachments there were four new renders that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shade diagrams so what we 're seeking from council today is endorsement of that concept so we can proceed into detailed design and there 's a whole series of detailed investigations that we still need to do as part of that project such as the shade working out exactly where it 's going to go a lot of work with the arbor cultural assessment so confirming locations for footings for a lot of the equipment making sure we 're not in any protection zones of the trees and whatnot and as well just firming up some of the exact equipment that will be on it but we 've got to proceed from the concept into um into that detailed phase so we can do that work the second item around the visitor hub and analysis sorry the council election question is through to jacob thank you before we jump to the next item just a quick question the wheelchair swing thing i 've noticed it 's nowhere on there is it being relocated or the disability through the yeah through the chat yes correct it 's been relocated and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're doing with the consultant is around outlining which pieces of equipment within the broader playground are accessible for wheelchairs as well as other disabilities as well so we want to provide a bit of a heat map on what the playground looks like as well as where and what those specific items are but yes the the wheelchair and the liberty swing currently that 's there will be getting relocated we 're going to do an assessment of its condition and then if it can be put elsewhere or has to be disposed of thanks uh councillor mayer thanks very much mr matt i 'm just through you to jacob jacket it looks really good i just got one question i know we discussed quite a bit about the materials uh that being used on the dingo uh and that it is actually uh real timber it 's not the um composite material type material have we looked in regards to the whole of life cost of because i would have i would imagine that will have to be restained and that type of thing at some stage has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to maintain yeah so through the chair we are doing that as part of the detailed work as well and we are so typically the consultant who we 've awarded it to they don 't they only deal with timber so we are asking them to look at alternative products and if they can do it the same it 's just around the actual fabrication process causes some issues but as part of the detailed assessment we 're going to do that analysis as well as provide their whole of life costs its frequency six months 12 months whatever that is yeah provide all that detail fantastic thanks very much jacob okay thanks jacob perfect and the second item so the visitor hub and animal operations center so this one is more just a general note so on friday we received the 50 design submission and so our team at the moment where just commenced quite a detailed review process of a lot of the design we 've included a layout just to show council that the project is progressing in alignment with the concept that was endorsed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're going through quite a lot of detailed technical assessment so the site there 's quite challenging it 's constrained by both its natural environment as well as trees and the um and the gradient and the slope that we 've got there so we 're still working through quite a rigorous process with a whole lot of different options trying to um to find one that that best works so we still haven 't resolved a final outcome yet so we 're still working through that and in the coming weeks we 'll um come back to council with a presentation on the project itself once we 've completed all of those assessments so this one 's more just to note the progress of where the project 's at okay kent got a couple of likes uh councillor kirkland and council wickerson oh thank you mr mayor i think um councilwoman was before me but that thank you um just uh jacob can you remind me how many toilets will be in the actual the hub itself um you know there 's there 's some concerns i 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alleviate some of the pressures that are currently being experienced up at the gardens with regards to toilets so can you give me some sort of time frame and amount of toilets that are going to be there or if other things are happening in that space yep so through the chair the toilets are part of the visit hub project which we 've secured building better regions funding for so it will progress as soon as we get the design finished so we 're looking at a july period to have all the design finished and then prepare construction documents for it and then so how many toilets so in terms of toilets from what we initially had in the concept we 've doubled the amount of toilet so it 's at six at the moment it 's in the report so and but split with some access internally within the zoo and then some externally outside the zoo okay and noting with our strategy for toilets was that as part of the zoo 's redevelopment there 'd be a second set of toilets on the other side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there 's a staged approach to providing toilets there all right that 's good information thank you thanks councillor kirkland council wickerson thanks mr mayor through to jacob on the operations center i 'm looking at the lower ground floor plan i think it 's growing 20. uh just a couple of questions on that uh one is at the eastern side of it i guess uh there 's a space there for two rainwater tanks in a room but that just seemed a bit extravagant for rainwater tanks i think the area is you know looking at about ten by five square meters with two rainwater tanks can 't these go outside like that per meter the construction cost is quite high just whether that space could be used for something else other than just water tanks yeah so through the chair what with this project what um as part of the 50 we 've included a lot of i guess what we call sustainability initiatives as part of the project purely on the basis that we 'd rather include it see where the project sits as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strip bits back so we 've included a lot of things in there under that basis in terms of the tanks because it 's all coming straight from the roof we 've put them underneath there because we 're constrained with a lot of space in that location so if they did have to go somewhere else then that means that i guess the real estate that we 've taken up along there would have to change so we 've put them under there and given the terrain works in our favor we 're able to put them there quite easily so the building is actually elevated on one end so there 's no i guess real excavation that needs to occur for it so we 've sort of taken advantage of the natural landscape there but yeah that 's why we 're still in the middle of quite detailed um assessments at the moment so those tanks may move or may make them out completely but we want to start off with including a lot of um a lot of initiatives in the project now i understand it just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cost but that 's all uh second question is the there 's a ramp on the outside this would be the western side uh with a series of boxes is that uh wheelie bins is that like a refuse area yeah correct through that 's wheely bins that 's in there as a provisional note because we submitted a funding grant as part of the healthy soils state government and federal government grant for a on-site composter so if we 're successful with that and that 'll reduce the amount of wheelie bins that we 'd need so we 've space-proofed it in the event we don 't get that and that 's the amount of bins that are needed but in the event we do then we 'll look to shrink that okay now that 's answered the question exactly because i was thinking we 're looking at fogo for ourselves i imagine most of this waste would be organic given its food preparation whatever yeah and even if it had to be bins whether a larger scale industrial bin rather than a series of williams but anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mayors given that it 's this is the lower floor to the upper set the only access up i could see sort of close to the building was stairs is there any need that something that 's produced or stored downstairs needs to come upstairs uh in a a wheelbarrow or some sort of trolley or something and i just couldn 't see any ramp or or a lift or anything like that to get get upstairs and even with disability access yeah so through the chair the um on the eastern side there 's a second loading dock so the building is actually level at one side and then it 's elevated on the other side so if there was the event where trolleys or equipment had to be moved they 'd take it from one loading dock to the other and then that 's where it 's got its equal access into the building so you have to take it from yeah the western loading dock so they loaded the inappropriate dock depending on which level had to go yeah correct yeah so that 's been we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit of a waste of space with you know it 's only used in the event of deliveries or other bits and pieces so by having two for distinct activities we 're able to make them a bit smaller for their specific purpose so there 's no need to have disability access between those two levels it gets disability access from so from the food preparation end and that eastern side of the admin building you come in at ground level and then on the other side you 're um you 're elevated so that is your disabled access there 's also a um stairs there for staff if they wanted to come up from the bottom end in so we sort of provided both both routes so there is a primary disabled access room from the eastern side and then stairs if in the event staff wanted to use the western side okay thank you okay jacob just went through uh is the car parking part of the hub project yep just so we could go to that design um yeah just the pathway uh leads to the existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be parked or is there a safety concern around that and should they maybe um go around the front of those car parks and then down again to the road for the crossover because that if we 're adding more car parks we 're gonna have more people more families um prams and children um just thinking that may not be the best uh best drop off point for the pathway to drop in behind those existing cars yep um so to you smeared the car park 's gone in a similar process where we 've gone through a few options yep um and with this obviously we 've got sort of a stage one which is this and then our future stage where the broader site would be developed into a car park so in the way that we 've approached this is we 've got the stage one layout refined which has um all of the pathways on it and then we 're trying to work out for what that stage one is and where 's the best bang for buck with that um in terms of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this way yeah unfortunately is too steep and we can 't get it to be disabled compliant so the path actually has to come along here so what our approach was initially that um we can put the path going into the existing car park and these parks here are um disabled removed for the purposes of getting access into this new area yep um and then in the future stage when the additional pathways are put on um then this path essentially would come back to here and then there 'll be a path going there and another one here as well we 've also left it because with the fernery um still needing to be developed we 're not sure how the footpaths connect from here across into the fernery so we don 't really want to i guess set any precedence for that just yet so we 've really looked at i guess a bare minimum for a footpath and really yeah not looking to improve any of the existing issues for disabled access or separating pedestrians and vehicles yet that is something we can look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bare minimum we can do to get extra cash bases within the existing site within the existing budget yeah but noting that we 're still it 's a concept as well so we 're still looking through that as part of the broader work that we 're doing okay but that 's something we can definitely yeah i 'm just a little bit concerned about that if that 's going to be a operational um car park and still having that uh that issue with the rear there are those cars coming out with pedestrians dropping in um well that was a don 't for me on that one so any no more questions about the hub alicia jacob were you going to talk about the trees i thought we were yeah we can do so with um the visitor hub we wanted to jump back on any of the other plans so within the site we 've undertaken a detailed agricultural impact assessment and the result of that is that basically every single tree within that site has been given an id tag and we 've had an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health and viability of that tree the second part of that is how the footprint of the site then is overlaid with it and then the arborist comes back and we look at how the design needs to adjust to accommodate the trees there as part of that assessment there were some trees that the arborists identified were in poor health as a result of the cyclone and weren 't growing that well and actually posing a danger with the new use proposed as part of this as in dropping limbs um and other bits and pieces so there are a series of trees that the average identified to be removed anyway so our assessment has been looking out of those ones how can we maximize our building footprint with respect to that we 're still going through that in the building for principal changes essentially on a weekly basis where we 're shifting bits and pieces around but where we 're at at the moment i can grab i think it 'll be yep that one does show so all the so essentially you can see the little circles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's called the tree protection zone so each tree has its own unique tree projection zone that 's calculated based on its diameter and a few other bits and pieces so the arborist has provided all of that and in our design we 've overlaid a lot of that information and as part of preserving the health of these trees basically no no works can be within 10 of that zone or there 's some special considerations around what actually it is so is it something that water can still penetrate through so say concrete no-go but something like a deck could be because water can still permeate through into the tree roots so we 've done a bit of work with overlaying that and revising a lot of options where buildings are in different spots and and moved around a little bit but in terms of the trees specifically we have got a preliminary plan that shows the exact ones to be removed so of the 172 that are located in that spot we 're talking about the potential removal of about 17 that are in poor to average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an independent arborist to also come in and just verify a lot of the information that we were given um just to make sure that i guess what we 've been given is is correct it 's a similar approach we 're doing with um the playground we get one report we get an independent report um as well and of those trees to be removed um i know that there 's we 're trying to retain the look and feel of the site so that 17 whilst it may sound like a lot some are you know something about 1.5 meters high so there are a lot of smaller trees um the larger ones that were proposed are ones that were noted in poor health by the arborist report so it 's been something we 're still ongoing with it 's not final by any means we 're still working through that that assessment process and there 's probably a comment around shade as well so a lot of those trees provide a lot of shade so with um the built form one plan that was in there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more uh maybe two more was around so you can essentially see it 's a one roof all the way across so most of the built infrastructure that we got is under a roof so it does provide shades we wanted to make sure that at least if if a tree or some had to be removed that there still would be shade provided through a built infrastructure form it 's also worth noting that we 're still going through the landscaping design so whilst we 're talking about trees to be removed there are a lot of works that are being proposed as part of it to reinstate a lot of new trees as well as ones of significance so for example the existing footpath that 's along there has the cowrie pines and there 's an opportunity for some significant plantings in between the two so a lot of them are being explored as part of this current design phase that we 're in thanks jacob is it yourself or aaron that 's going to talk on the enclosure program i just don 't want us to we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about okay um just with the the trees it 'd be great to have a list you know there 's a difference between a shrub and a a tree and when you talk about the curry the avenue of carry pines if it 's 17 of them then we 've got a big issue and i understand that that 's not the case so it would be good just to know you know which tree which trees species and which shrubs i 'm guessing that area is covered by the heritage protection act as well so it has a layer of protection over it um to a degree anyway but just just for our knowledge it 'd be nice to know to break it up into you know trees versus shrubs and which ones those are yeah so through the shell here we 've got um we 've got quite a big excel spreadsheet with all that information so we can we can provide that and it is it is yeah all subject to heritage approval so that 's why there 's been a bit of back and forth with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calories for example we have to be well away from them but some of the other lower value or smaller shrubs are able to be removed so just working yeah working with that thanks council relevant councillor wickerson uh thanks for samantha sorry i 'm just going to jump back to the visitor hub again uh jacob just behind the entry plaza there 's a multi-purpose room uh and by its nature 's going to be used for a few things but is that where the we might have a gift shop or some sort of interpretation area like we used to have with the old center yeah just how people can get their bearings and also when i refresh my memory is that will visitors come back through that same is that an entry and exit or can they escape through other gates in the zoo they 've got to double back to that because that 's normally where you you catch them to buy your merchandise and drinks and whatever if we could just jump back probably two plans so with that with um sorry one more we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can so um you you can have it as an exit only so with the building itself so this is the entrance which would be something like the turnstiles you see commonly at um at any zoo or amusement park so that provides your access in but as well from the existing footpath down the way that we 've got the multi-purpose room is that the doors are similar to what 's at the rockhampton museum of art in the program rooms where the doors you can push wide open so you could have a direct access through and we 've allowed for doors here as well so we haven 't said that that is the form of access but future proofed it for in the future event that it did become a gift shop or part of it became a gift shop or however it looked that access isn 't compromised okay thank you okay thanks jacob we move on to no more in the that stage we might move on to the enclosures and perfect and so the last item on there around the enclosure so with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ egg situation so in order to know what we 're scoping for the enclosure program there had to be a initial decision on what is the animal species that would go into that enclosure because they 're all quite different and have different standards and legislation that apply so working with with the zoo curator director liz has done a lot of work in looking at the enclosures and then providing a recommendation for a new animal species to go into these particular new enclosures and then so we 've taken that and then started to scope up a preliminary design and constructs tender document so what we 're looking from council today in terms of the endorsement is both two-fold for liz to then look at what timings are to procure some of these animal species because some have a long lead time and it 's a you don 't want to have an empty enclosure that 's all built ready to go if there 's no animal to go into it so there 's a bit of planning that has to be done as well as scoping and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much it 's going to cost and can work within the existing budget so there 'll be a second discussion for endorsement back with council after the dnc tender process to present is the outcome of it um and potentially discuss a prioritization with within the existing budget that 's there and what its total cost comes out to be so there 's three projects as part of it there 's the dome avery refurbishment there 's the um the previous macaque and current order as well as the wedgetail eagle and macaw enclosures just before we go there sorry jacob right back to the car park one there 's just one final question um with the entrance coming in off ward street would that 's and would there need to be a gate there for the closure of the um yeah so that was um on the layout there was a gate essentially where um we were proposing to take out the four car parks that 's where the gate had come across so that car parker be still closed yeah for the night time yeah rider so it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their functions overnight so the existing gate is sitting here so yeah and then it connects up there so again thinking what 's the i guess best bang for buck is it 's quite a simple um construction just to put in a little gate there okay connects in with the existing and yeah it allows the falls club to have you know after hours access because if we put the gate here then it makes it difficult if they want after hours yes or after hours from the potential starting one perspective so right now it 's all covered thank you uh now go to questions on the enclosures council kirkland um thank you mr mayor so um it 's exciting to see that there are options with with animals and and the types of animals that have been chosen i also know noted in there that there 's a little bit of time pressure on on procuring some of those animals um given that their babies are being born and we 've got to take them at this point in time and the enclosure 's got to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure in um from from where we 're sitting is that well well we don 't want to miss out a little bit of promo there i just do want to know about the whole of life costs with these animals and in the variances in the types of animals that we 're going to be procuring um and you know whether they would be with specific species of animals whether we 're then needing to engage specialists to come and be a part of our team to maintain and look after those those animals because life whole of life costs for this facilities and certainly in the position we 're in right now is something that we absolutely need to be building into the cost projections for these before we can make an informed decision around that moving forward um you know that 's a that 's a really big concern of mine the second thing in regards to the moving of the animals during the actual um building the construction phase we 're talking about needing to permanently relocate some of those birds the macaws and the eagles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and and i think that that 's that 's a great option i did want to ask around well if there 's a concern about the birds and the noise there what of the the primary attraction that we have at our zoo which is our chimps of course and and is there going to be a concern around their safety during construction if that 's also a concern for those birds they 're not too far removed from that so i do have some questions around that council brotherhood mr mayor if i could answer maybe um as best i can to those um the the chimps uh liz certainly believes that the chimps will handle they 're quite used to loud noises and and lots of activity going around them so um you know there 's not a major concern there at all um your questions are very valid and and whole of life costs certainly we will need to bring back but i would like to remind the table that these are not necessarily additional exhibits these are replacement exhibits the dome avery was an exhibit it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same with um the mccatch replacing the macaque so we 're not looking to expand the zoo as in the number of exhibits or or anything like that it 's it 's a replacement of things that we already had and along the lines this has already done the sums according to the skill set that the staff have the budget they have to work within and the ability to be able to work with those exhibits plus whether what those exhibits add to the zoo as to whether they 're an endangered species and the program breeding program what that adds and also which of course is in this report but also the ability to have encounters or what it can add to bringing in revenue for the zoo so a lot of that work has already been done and certainly we can present more of that along the the way as we get down this but it 's it 's like that circular argument where do you start because there are so many pieces that need to link together and to get the timing right that um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now um that one other point i would like to make mr mary is i think the council table had given um some indication that really the avery should be maybe the first point of call for um refurbishment and and a new exhibit there that may not necessarily fall into how things need to happen on the redevelopment and i think that 's what jacob was trying to get at in that because of the the construction work and because of how or when we can get these animals the timing may be different different and the avery may not be the first cab off the rank so if we could be fairly um flexible as to how this happens um that would be a good thing as well thanks mr mayor just answer back to that thank you and and councillor um rutherford i am not here to be a wet blanket or to to you know dampen what is a really exciting um option for us this is a premier premium facility that we have that 's a tourist attraction and will continue to be such i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure that it is generating a revenue that actually pays for the ongoing maintenance of these facilities and those experiences that can be you know the experiences that we 've already got happening with the meerkats and certainly with these proposed future new additions they would be great and they 'll go a long way to that but again once we get this facility to that standard there is an opportunity for the facility to continue to grow and be autonomous to a degree in in maintenance of the animals and i just want to make sure that we have got our head around what those costumes are going to be so we know what we 're signing up for yeah no that um questions and uh one that i had as well as if we endorsed this one and i expect to after reading the report about some of the uh the budget um whether there was enough money in the budget to to be able to deliver on some of these things so um i 'm confident that i 'll each of that yeah i guess councillors in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mind back to our actual redevelopment plan there was i don 't know i don 't know how many millions with works and our plan in terms of budget was to chip it away over a 10-year period now depe the timing and dependent of things would um whether depend on whether how much money we attract from grant funding the actual final design costs so this step three is really about actually gauging a measure for the design and that is needed to see how much it 's cost and then we will come back with an actual plan for how we manage that within its budget envelope so yeah yeah okay thanks alicia thanks councillor kirkland councillor latchin thanks justin just a couple of quick questions um it 's good to see that um liz is considered something that 's endangered to go into that the the dome um i guess my question was had she considered or was it considered koalas given that they are endangered now and obviously there 's 50 million dollars from the federal being put into that program would that be something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could go in the dome but maybe it could um i know when you go and see the koalas you can 't really see them they 're up in a tree but the dome lends itself to being closer to them and seeing a more eye level rather than from the ground looking up um that 's my first bit was that one but the other one was the um ringtailed eagle um is it just gonna be one just that one bird in this big avery that 's going to be made up or is it um it 's i guess is it best bang for buck um are we better off to donate it back to some others and make better use cancer other might be able to answer that question um oh or not very pious valkyrie um is is really one a spectacular animal um for us to have she she 's just she needs to be able to move she 's actually i agree um but i also now please correct me i also believe that they are fairly um solitary animals um so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house um a number of them together um so yeah i guess it gets back to the best bang for buck for that area taking premium premium amount of land um um the idea is that valkyrie will move down into the australian native section so there are three smaller enclosures there which are of no real value to us at the moment um there are some issues with um a fungus in one of them that affects what animals can be put in it anyway um it wouldn 't affect valkyrie so it really is about making good use of a section of land that is already has three old um rundown uh enclosures so those cases will be removed and a new one put in yes yes so valkyries where valkyrie is now would be the macaws enclosure so the macaws would move from there into um which is what that enclosure was really built for in the in the first place okay thank you for explaining it okay thank you councillor wickerson uh thanks man probably just more more commentary um i was pleased to see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the um pipe work and whatever for the for the damn ivory now it 's um old like it was there before i started a park so it 's either heritage listed or certainly getting near to its end of life so i just just have concerns that given that it 's always wet with irrigation i expect that we probably will find some structural or at least the mesh that needs to be done and fairly specialized work to be done but uh but just to argue that we should still pursue that this is a an iconic part of the botanic gardens and zoo that everyone identifies i was lucky enough to chat to a very old man now that was part of the team that built that i think was rotary that sponsored it and uh what have you been in rex bilbin 's time where they went door-to-door to raise money for tom white was involved in so it is especially in its own right but also the history of how it came to be so i 'm not arguing that at any cost because i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pursue everything to to restore that back or whatever we need to do because it 's just such an important part of that that facility uh the second part is and apologies to alicia because this is probably getting into operational sort of level stuff but given the the story uh or the uh the history of the macaques then we had to euthanase one of those i said we 're getting two gibbons for the same enclosure i think um and there was some commentary about the timeliness of getting those because that was that window of getting them but are we going to pursue more than two otherwise won 't we find ourselves in the same position in due course they 're a male male female breeding people breeding repair and and they 're endangered so it 's important that we yeah we do okay well that 's cool so we might end up with uh like chimpanzees even muddling up with a colony we hope to have a family yes but um they 're good very limited there 's only 20 i think in australia so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shall we miss out on these i think there may be a long wait uh yeah if we miss out on these particular ones here okay yeah they are extremely endangered um and very few of them so you know we would be very lucky to have them and to be able to contribute to um a species that is that endangered would be very special outcome for our zoo um mr mayor i 'd like to add um and i don 't know aaron and or jacob could the initial um investigations on the avery um are actually quite good um so it 's it 's held up after all this time fairly fairly well so um it 's there 's still more investigations to be done but the initial reports are quite good there 'll be some um vegetation that needs to be removed from inside because it 's pushing through the wires but apart from that it 's yeah it 's held up quite well okay jacob have you got any more on on that no unless you put a tiger in there yeah if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um we 'll give you a tiger sorry through the chairs just a couple of um comments um and in relation to some um some commentary from council i think in terms of the capital um what we 're seeking to do is get a market estimate on what these upgrades and what these renewals will cost so previously we 've probably not scoped them as accurately as what we would like so then we can you know prioritize accordingly so rather than you know doing the thumbs up and thinking something 's going to cost x amount we 'll get a far more accurate um cost estimate and i think just to your point um councillor kirkland just around the design and the ongoing cost we are designing enclosures that are safer and more efficient for the staff so some of the old enclosures aren 't exactly the the best to work in so particularly in terms of safety also from our facilities maintenance side um there 's roofs that catch leaves even the dome avery itself the way it 's built the um the skin catches leaves where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if that makes sense so we 're trying to make some smarter decisions around that which may then not to say their savings but they will be you know more neutral than the you know better to maintain easier to maintain so also on top of that is the viewing side of things they 'll be more attractive and they 'll be more accessible and greater customer satisfaction as well so i 'm certainly trying to look at it from a few different angles and that sorry and that was the other thought about the the new hub um if there 's those trees there that you know leaf litter onto the top of that is that being considered in that design about trying to reduce the maintenance of having to get up there and uh clear the yeah yeah through the chair absolutely and to your point with the water tanks councilwix and is it more efficient for us to have a building without gutters that we don 't catch water for the amount of water that we might save it might actually be that the cleaning cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there 's some some choices there um that we may value add sustainability options but it may be that there 's a operation yeah there 's an operational saving through some of that as well especially with risk and having to get up on the roof and things like that at heights there may be an added cost there that uh we may not uh need to need to include occur okay um that looks like enough questions from from that end just one last one though the black summer bushfire grant was has that been included in that or is that something that uh at half a million dollars that that we 've been granted has that uh being good about where that goes what 's happening in that space yeah i can talk to that um i 'm just saying it would be a shame if we spend it on some part of the facility that was going to be removed or we upgraded no we 're absolutely planning in conjunction with these projects to make sure we 're not redoing something and and some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflicts with it so but it is largely in the existing zoo if we want to if we want to call it that but yeah we 're trying to make sure there 's some synergy and some harmony between the two um between the two projects so um and it is a coordinator um coordinated approach between the zoo team jacob and andrew collins and that team and also the um facilities team as well so we 're just all working together and making sure we 're not um yeah we 're not conflicting yeah no that 's good okay glad to hear that uh councillor rutherford would you like to move yes please mrs okay move cancer rutherford we have a second uh councillor maida uh i 'll put that those in favor i suppose motions carried unanimously thank you councillors uh we move on to man morgan pearl redevelopment and andrew online to talk us through that one uh andrew is online so i guess i we thought it prudent uh councillors to put this report up just just looking for my recommendation here so there have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project in light of the water shortages in mount morgan um so there 's a couple of things that we wanted to tick off we we have sort of discussed with the grant provider the opportunities for one limiting council 's investment into that um and two you know scope changes within the the pool itself um which all were very met with um i 'm the human diplomatic so they weren 't they they sort of more or less said that any scope changes will need to go back and should there be a substantial change then we will put at risk the grant that has been received so we 've put the submission based upon our investment based on this project that will be delivered so um it 's recommended that we continue to proceed with the project this pool still needs replacement um and the proposal is for the timing then to basically not have a mount morgan pool for the next summer now um andrew you might correct me from my if i 'm wrong here but um the discussions that we talked about with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can limp it along for another summer and then knock it out and do the works quite intensively and again that was met with some reluctance from the funding provider because we had um because the timing then if we were to delay it further would sort of mean that we should have submitted in the next round of funding and not this round so they want to see the works um actioned you know things built and ribbons cut um and so they 're keen to see us honor the original grant timing which is um what we 've put forward did you want to add anything to that andrew yes certainly through the chair um we had discussions with them obviously in relation to the number seven damn and its current uh condition for recreational use and then what pressure taking the um pool offline early would would do uh it would do the community um they indicated obviously if they had known that um they would have reconsidered us being approved for this grant um the requirement of the grant is that we do start within six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now would be to develop a design and construct contract and counselors the feedback um so develop a design and construct contracts based on a performance specification in some concept plans that we would get developed at uh the so i might just interject you 're cutting out a bit there andrew so i think we got it that we 'll go to a um design and construct so when we 've got that concept design and specifications um the proposal was then we talk to them at morgan community and undertake some level of engagement around that at this stage that 's open to i guess some discussion and feedback from from council um but happy to take questions mr mayor just uh first one though the there 's a second round coming through from this fund are we able to reapply to look at if we can 't move money from the initial one are we able to reapply to see if there 's a subsequent grant allocation to this project uh maybe allowing council to look at its uh its own funding in other areas or is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought if we 're going in there and there 's another round is it possible that we we look to get better bang for the buck and do something bigger i guess it comes back to their advice to us is that the original approval was based upon us having skin in the game and having that 2.5 million in terms of our costs so if we were to subsequently come back in the third round we would order sorry the second round and i 'm looking at you angus for further he 's not even listening angus are you listening why do you not why don 't i have your full attention so we 're just talking about whether or not there 's a the second round of the resource community grant if we were to go in again and ask for that matching funding we would still put at risk that first approval wouldn 't we okay that probably said i think we need to look at another another project there and now morgan then if there 's a second round coming up and uh something could help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the infrastructure requirements yep no that 's all right okay go to questions uh council election kirkland rutherford and madison thanks mr history to alicia um with this grant are we required to rebuild it in that exact spot or can it be which i 've suggested before next to the school of arts you can easily put a 25-meter pool in aquatic centre and from an operational point of view would be easier to maintain and it would allow greater access from both schools to use those use the facility that 's closer to them but does it have to go back in the same spot um i guess the preference from an officer level is that it does go back into the same spot um it fits within that precinct and it 's sort of the proximity to the school already is quite close so there would be no room oh sorry no reason to move it okay other than it 's closer to the schools it 's not even especially during summer i can 't see the kids walking down to the pool we we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to school of arts is a big chunk of length 60 by 30 meters yeah i don 't think the council support there for i think it 's a hole in the ground and you make it advantage of the hole that 's already done you can still still demolish the old one with the money but you just relocated and i guess when you 're talking about closing it down and there 's 12 months lag you could still use the existing until the other one got built so there 's a few reasons for it but that 's that 's up to you guys happy to take counselors feedback do you want to move do you want to move the people to another location you want to put a motion up counselor you could take that chance yep councillor kirkland um thank you miss mayor i 'm coming from a as very similar town structure as mount morgan and certainly understanding my own history that the importance of this facility and the whole center of children in the community having having access to ongoing access to a facility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a couple of things here that i 've written down that are concerns about the project itself but i 'm keen to hear what the community of rock of rockington community of mount morgan if they feel that this is something that 's a priority to them or if they 're more of an you know majority saying no we actually don 't use it at that much i mean we 've got some statistics on that um so i 'll be keen to see once it gets to that point what the community actually is saying i 'm also you know sometimes we get these grants because they are all different buckets of money and we get the grant and then we have to have that commitment sometimes it might be that we 've just got to not take on a grant because there are other priorities where we need to be putting our money towards and this is something that we might need to come back to in a couple of years when things have changed there 's a few questions around it and whether or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also i 'm concerned about the actual p90 of the entire project and whether like we 're probably not at that stage yet where we can totally but it is a very ambitious project by the look of it with some fabulous things changing and demolishing of things and not setting aside the fact that the grandstands that are there and other things may have heritage interest and whether or not we 're going to start getting into a space where people are wanting to preserve things and monument things etc and i i am concerned as to whether we 're going to start at point a at costings and it 's going to blow out and blow out so bearing in mind our current position and certainly where we 're at with water and other priorities and equitable distribution of monies across the region i have a few reservations about whether this is where with whether we need to be going down again probably put a motion to the table cancer and see whether you get support if we don 't want to do it that 'd be that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invest in offices time to do something you 've got you 've got to make a call and that 's and i think that 's what you 're saying well i 'd suggest you put a motion to the table um i 'm happy to oh that 's a bit scary well counsellors too it 's not you 're just making a comment this is exactly the reason why i 've got this now like we 're about to fund it like execute the funding agreement if it does not have council support because of the host of other issues that we 're facing up there let 's flesh this out now because this is the reason i 've put this report again to council i say it 's scary because i i i want to make sure that that we 're not as i first when i first started speaking i spoke about the importance of these facilities to the community and the functionality of the community it was a life blood flow when i grew up everybody went to the everything that happened at the pool but i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if it 's that important to the mount morgan community i don 't want to deny them the privilege of having such an important facility if that 's what they need but at the same time we are looking at very very serious budgetary constraints at the moment and we really need to be sensible do we just react to a to an allocation of a grant that commits us to then having to put in our portion and we really can 't afford to do it well cancer put the money up first before the grant we yeah we 've made that commitment to the community that we were going to do but it was also before we knew about the federal assistance grants too against the rutherford and councilman um oh mr may it it 's so hard to um to talk to the you know the the need of this in the community and and certainly understand that the stats the numbers don 't support how valuable this is to the community but the ability to have a facility where people learn a life skill like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most occasions you know i just think it is so important i think there are a whole pile of reasons why the stats aren 't there to support the usage of the pool and a lot of that has to do with how it 's been operated so i think there is there 's a whole other discussion around around that i believe this facility is vitally important to the mount morgan community my my questions however are the consultation and my concern that the consultation or what we 're planning is in the wrong order the mount morgan community talk about the fact that their heritage is their key tourist attraction it would be like our key street is to us um and changing the vibe of key street through knocking down buildings or or whatever else so they are very very attached to the grandstand they 're even attached to the the length of that pool which i believe is quite unique in its actual dimensions and we haven 't actually had any discussions with them about this project so i would prefer that we go to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them and if there are some things that we can 't do that we explain that to them before we go to a you know a design and construct and then say we 've already done this with this is our proposal do you like it or don 't you you know go talk to them before we do that and then do the design and construct from there the thinking was we need a solid concept plan first counselor so before so concept first community consultation and then the design and construct aspect at this stage we 've got some boxes on a page and there 's a lot sort of more that needs to be developed before we can actually go in go to the community do you know what i mean my fear is that we are doing something very different from what the community actually want again um we 've put this you know we 've done the legwork we 've been through sort of this grant application and and this process um i think this is the third time i 've had this at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that site we also put at risk the grant money so again i want to hear some council direction correct you need to move on cancer rutherford or peter did you want to make a comment or you list us now we are really selfish we haven 't entered into this agreement yet so there 's nothing signed we can hand it back as you 're talking about and my concern is that we 've got a very strict deadline for this grant and completion so i accept about the consultation and what you were just raising councillor rutherford but um it does feel like we we are being rushed with this grant so i just don 't want to get us to a point where we 're committing to a project and i can 't deliver it in line with the grant funding requirements so i think we need maybe we need a little bit more information and another discussion about it because i 'm just nervous we 've got a p90 estimate if my memory serves very right on this project i don 't believe so andrew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimate 's based on my my historical delivery of all the pool and water projects that i 've done for council so okay um it 's the assumptions are made on there but we would obviously get a p90 done as part of the design development yeah okay and the other option would be to to not take the grant and do what we could with the two million that we have in the budget if the community want to live the way it is uh grandstands and like do we just put in a bladder or something and then back to hand back to the grant funding and mr mayor i guess that 's the point i 'm trying to say we never actually went to them and asked them we haven 't discussed it with them at all and i can pretty much guarantee that if we go ahead the way we 're going the backlash from that community will be quite um quite strong we need to make a decision because we 've got timelines as peter saying that uh that are going to be there so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't do the grant and just do what we 've got with the 2 million and then go to public consultation what we spend the 2 million on whether that 's going to deliver us anything that 's going to be i 'm not sure you 're putting a band-aid on it your 2 million won 't do anything so you either to me build a new pool or you don 't or don 't build a new normal the previous estimate just related to the plant room and the pipe work but didn 't actually fix any of the leakage issues we could do we could do a lot with the two million dollars in the budget that uh that we we 've got in there uh if we don 't do it that 's the other option so councillors will go to council major thanks very much mr mayor well i 've um i 've got some major concerns with this with this pro project um i just want to start by saying this is not about whether mount morgan deserve a pool or don 't deserve a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important that that community has a pool but they already have a pool my concern is is that when this all started we didn 't know half the issues that we had in regards to the in regards to we didn 't know that we 're going to be staring down the barrel of maybe another one or two years of possibly four million a year cutting water up to mount morgan i struggled as a new councillor when we put this forward um to try to get the funding because i think i made comments around the table that i was i the only person i thought it was crazy because there 's no way in the world we 'd get the funding because there 's no way in the world that the government would give us money to build a pool at a drought declared centre or you know a location and yet here we are we 've got the funding just fiscal responsibility i don 't see how we can possibly look at spending two million dollars of ratepayers money whether we have money coming from state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is drought up there and they don 't have water you know we 're chasing three and a half million dollars just to do a business case study to put a water pipeline up there and we 're talking about spending two million dollars of ratepayers money to build an aquatic center when we don 't have water to fill it i 'm sorry i just it makes no sense to me whatsoever and i 'm finding it very difficult to support fairpoint councillor smith yeah thanks mr me um i 'm i 've always been fairly concerned about the total cost of this and probably share a lot of the concerns and certainly we talked about it before we knew our financial situation the only time i was sort of keen on it i know some of the smaller schools have their swimming carnivals up there um for boulder camp for instance i don 't know whether they still do what i don 't know whether owen goes to mount morgan or wiela i 've certainly been to swimming carnivals there and watched kids that 's a fair while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether we needed a water park there as well and i know the demolition of the squash center is going to it is adding to the cost as well um but i just wondered it was did we ever get a report on um if we can actually repair that leak and how much that was gonna cost because at the moment that is that is the problem repair it might peter might be able to answer that one the reports into the pool say it can 't be repaired it 's it 's that end of life so that 's why the decision was made to then see yeah great it 's fun it 's 100 years old bit like everything in memory very old and needs a lot of money and if we 're talking about consulting with the community in line we 've got being talked about here i do think we would have to use our own funds to do that consultation because if we start this process of design development which is getting a concept or two to go to the community we 've had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community and they don 't like a new pool we don 't want a new pool we 're trapped we 've just accepted a grant so if we want to go out and engage with the community about what mount morgan wants we should do that with our own funds not with the grant funds against brothers can i just clarify i 'm not saying whether the community wants or doesn 't want a pool or to fix the pool i believe that 's definitely the case i think what the community is saying that please don 't take their heritage away by demolishing a grain stand and a pool and replacing it with something that is is modern and contemporary it doesn 't fit with the mount morgan theme it doesn 't fit at all you know certainly replace it but have you know have respect to their their heritage um that 's that 's what they 're asking for yeah i 'm not hearing that from the table though near cancel that 's a thing councillor fischer and then i 'll go to sorry can i just can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have public meetings with the matt morgan community you know whenever we want to talk to them about something that 's the type of consultation i 'm talking about i 'm not talking about anything expensive or you know overly time consuming it is you know we need to go and talk to them about the the water pipeline anyway so why could we not talk to them about the pool at the same time i 've got no issue with that it 's just i don 't want it linked to the the danger is that you link it to the people if you don 't want to touch those structures then we 've got to go to a different site potentially thank you mr mayor look this has been troubling me for quite some time to actually it 's not just the man morgan community but the whole of the rockhampton regional community we 've gone to them and say of the cost of of providing water to mount morgan then we 're going to say well we 're going to actually build a brand new swimming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this particular time i think that that just does not sound responsible to the greater community as much as i would love to see a pearl this quality i just think the timing 's wrong it 's sending a wrong message to all of the rockhampton region and i totally agree with rutherford the heritage part of that pool is what actually makes it 's almost a sort of this romantic type old-school uh pool uh swimming pool complex and uh i we 're just not quite the timing wrong i believe that mr mayor if you could you could almost talk if you were able to talk to the minister i think they would understand the position that we 're we 're in at the moment and that while we would like to provide a new swimming pool uh to the mountain we 've also got these other difficulties and i would like to sort of think that we uh don 't look oh i can 't support as today but i would like able to find a way forward but we 've also do it with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need for water for that community and the need to find the funding there for what that is the case for the client this is just not fairly sick so look as it is at the moment i 've been taking a gap just today but i 'd like to come up with a better solution but to be railroaded and it almost looks like they 're putting pressure on our officers yeah we need to need to look at an attorney match and cancel fischer i think that 's the direction that you 're saying so councillor mathers no sorry kirkland that 's all right thank you mr mayor okay i 'm going to bite the bullet i 'm going to propose a motion today that we actually turn down the opportunity for the grant and i 'd also like to add into that that we reallocate that two million dollars that we have previously allocated for the construction and design of of the mount morgan pool to another part of our budget just reallocated not quite sure of the wording i appreciate some help with wording around that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh the wording for that motion um are you prepared to accept that the pool is closed i think that we have to accept that i 'd like to stress that this is something that and certainly for anybody who 's reviewing today 's discussions that this is not saying they don 't need a pool this is saying we need to put it on hold right now and we need to revisit this down the track but not now not today not in this budget avoiding cancer uh yes that council does not proceed with the funding agreement does there need to be anything else and then also that we would reallocate the what is the exact amount two just neat to two million i thought it was i thought it was uh two point something but uh that we reallocate previously allocated funds for this project back into the budget yeah so how do we how do we work that just reallocate it or that we pull it back so reconsider it or the discussion is is whether you want to defer that out for future years to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project altogether so what i 'm hearing is you remove that project so that we 'll in the future stage or at a future time we will look for a hundred percent funding for replacement of the facility yes all together let the project be removed from the budget yep you need to need to talk to the community sorry council we 'll have to work through those pieces sorry councillor fisher um i 'm just saying whether or not we need to incorporate the closure of the pool but um that can come back at a subsequent report in terms of i 'm concerned about the ongoing costs of operations in the environment that it is and we 've talked about leakage at the pool so i can bring a subsequent report to deal with the pool excuse me so can i can i just say that i i 'd certainly like to see a report on that because yeah i 'm sorry okay so can i just check one counselor kirkland that that 's your intent and two council fisher can you see what 's on screen at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're putting that up the evening chancellor kirkland you that captures the intent i believe that does thank you mr may yes so you 're happy to move or seek a second happy to move it don 't leave me hanging second and cancel election would you like to speak to the motion council of kirkland uh i think there 's been a lot of conversation around it prior to the moving of the of the motion and there 's certainly a sentiment across the table lots of reservations about the project certainly what peter coffett has added in with feeling the pressure of that and even in his own capacity wandering on our ability to deliver the project within within the constraints of of the requirements of the grant so with all of that just clarify that project as proposed today i don 't have any concern about delivering so that 's just with consultation and all the other no the questioning that is going on okay so if the decision today was as per the report we would have signed the agreement and commenced work yeah and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peter for that clarification so with that in mind i think but also with the conversation that 's come from the table and where we are financially i don 't like having to do it but i believe this is the best fiscal move and it 's it 's our responsibility to be minded mindful of that so happy with the wording and uh thank you looking for your support david thanks councillor kirkland uh speakers against motion council rather mr mayor i just see this as so unfair you know the previous mayor used to have a saying that you can walk and chew chewing gum at the same time you know that 's what we do that 's what councils are about and we we often deliver projects you know they take time to deliver they take time to get money we were lucky to get money for this we don 't always get money for these types of projects we deliver projects all over the region at different times that are not necessarily convenient or work work well we could have pouring rain next week and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about you know delivering it during a time when matt morgan has no water in the dam that 's just an excuse where this community have very very limited activities to do it 's an aging community who use that pool for their health for rehabilitation you have young children that need to be able to learn to swim they don 't have a lot of them do not have access public transp to come down public transport is limited to come down you know they just do not have the same access to to facilities or anything else that the rest of our region have the one thing that they have here that services that entire community we are taking away from them and let 's be clear about that because we can 't keep running this pool the way it is so we are taking a pool we are taking a facility away from this community we are kicking them while they 're down and i think that is completely unfair given what we have supported in this region over the last few years thanks cancer rutherford another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i ask in the wording of that nation it 's just got project as the proposed new pool uh swimming complex in that wording would counselor kirkland accept that if if it feels it 's yeah if you need to then what were the words again the uh the proposed new swimming uh complex you removed from the budget so you just want an amendment to the to the motion just wordy are you happy as a mover to support that yeah um and the second yep councillor uh we still need a speaker for them for the motion okay uh we 've had a speaker against another one for another speaker yeah we 're here can i close you know i 'd like to speak again no may i have the opportunity to wrap up counselor um thank you i i think that where my my decision and this has come back completely just disassociating with the feelings and and everything around it is that we have major major um critical infrastructure that is also in our future budgeting and we need to be able to provide those critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra financial constraints and potential blowouts and whatever else may or may not happen with this particular project the pipeline the water pipeline mr mayor is is something that we are really pushing and the cutting of the water and getting funding for the cutting of the water i think this would absolutely add to your argument when lobbying with our state members as to how hard they 're not helping us with this pipeline and the funding of the pipeline is being on out to literally cruel on our community but because of where we are at and because of them not helping us with this funding this is pushing us into position we 're actually needing to consider such a thing as to close a community pool it is outrageous but it is where we are financially and fiscally this is our responsibility to deliver to our community and equitable distribution of our our woes so i would like to seek the support of the table i know that this is an emotional decision today but it does definitely speak to our state uh departments of the positions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forcing us to make by not coming forth and assisting us in the funding of the trucking of the water and hopefully down the future looking at this final sustainable solution of potable water to the community and at the end of the day that 's going to be a brilliant outcome and their future is going to be much brighter because of those decisions those bigger decisions so uh i seek your support this might ask a question to the ceo please with the debate about the trucking of the water should i declare a conflict and not vote no that 's not the that 's not the issue that 's not the that 's not the uh whole region the decision we 're making about cancer separate to uh pipeline yeah but the leakage is is connected to the cutting no okay council 's uh we 've finished debate we 've wrapped up debate cancer brothers can i um suspend standing orders um no we 're not really cancer we 've just gone through the debate it 's uh probably hard to to sustain sandy orders at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's unfair that uh that that we step into that now it should have been done earlier in the uh in the debate if we were going to do that unfortunately council i 'll call a division and i 'll put the vote uh those in favor please stand councillor fischer we 'll record those no um yeah councillor uh grant mothers for councillor drew wickerson councillor alan smith councillor donna kirkland council shane latcham and councillor neil fisher in favour of the motion [Music] i 'll go for those against those against myself and councillor rutherford the motion is supported and carried thanks very much councillors there are no other matters on the agenda cancers i 'll declare the meeting closed and thank you for

already undertaken an acknowledgement to country in their previous meeting so we weren 't required to proceed with that we have councillor fisher online we have a full house declarations of interest in matters on the agenda councillors councillor smith uh yeah uh thanks mr mayor i have a declarable conflict of interest in oh well actually it 's prescribed i think because it 's family item 7.1 and 7.6 the mount morgan rail trial feasibility study consultation outcomes as my brother john mcavoy owns land at 148 cabra road that joins the proposed rail trial so propose to stay away from the place where the meeting has been held while this matters being discussed and voted on thanks council smith that 's the only one that was sent through oh the other one 's been removed cancer okay uh just with um the other item the other item 's been removed off the agenda oh yeah okay obviously yes sorry okay so just mr bell just needs some advice and this is the 7.1 the capital project report is talking about it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether we 're going to go into discussion of that might hold the fire until we if there 's questions then we may raise it at that time rather than okay and deal with it now that might be um one we 'll take on notice when we come to that item okay council is there any other declarations if not something arises throughout the course of the meeting we 'll we 'll accept that at that point we 'll move on straight into the offices reports the item 7.1 the capital projects report for february 2022 andrew would you like to present that report please thank you mr mayor councillors through the chair i 'd just like to provide a bit of an update on the monthly status report and pro on capital projects that the project delivery are managing um the first one is the hail damage insurance claim so this is a comprehensive damage occurred to council 's assets uh various assets within the city um so dooley street works commences tomorrow on duly street um a number of sheds there will have their roofs replaced over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenders and assessing those for elf and house and north rockhampton library so they 'll be assessed in um contracts awarded we 're currently out to the market for the landfill site so the waste transfer station and a number of ancillary buildings there for their roof replacements and we 're also now scoping kershaw gardens so a lot of the shade structures over there were damaged and to be replaced so that 's now underway um mount morgan water security so um see the premium evaluation was presented to council last week and aecom are now continuing on with the business case we expect that to be finalized somewhere towards the end of april with a couple of workshops in between just in relation to risk management uh the alliance maintenance facility at the airport so uh this is the one where council 's providing under 25 million dollar funding the landside bulk earthworks are all now complete so um and our civil uh contract is now uh working on the airside subsoil drains are going in um aarons have commenced on site for the construction of the hangar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commenced casting some of the tilt-up wall panels so i think about 30 of those are done um and they 're also at the same time constructing a footing system so that project 's progressing well we have submitted for a milestone payment yet to be received from the federal government um came from museum of art in the cultural precinct so uh east street links is probably the last project uh still with some a balance of work to be done there so we 've um basically um put in the link now and stabilized uh the adjacent structures so we 're now waiting on some pricing back to to do a bit of render treatment to some walls and and just flashing just to prevent any further water penetrations into some of the neighbouring buildings we still haven 't heard back from the owners of chemist warehouse in relation to their intention however a couple weeks ago there was a site visit by someone looking at wanting to attend on a demolition contract for them so still to find out any further information on that botanic gardens and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a presentation this morning about 50 design there 's a workshop tomorrow in relation to a safety and design development so that 's happening um the uh playground 's been awarded and i think they 're just working through a few um concept layout designs um for council to approve glamour water treatment plant so that 's a design and construct contract so about 80 of the design has been completed the contractor has established themselves on site now and have started to uh to do a bit of decommissioning and demolition work on site so that will happen over the next few weeks and then obviously the full augmentation will progress grace my series treatment plan so um i suppose post the council resolution a couple of weeks ago we 've now transferred some of that money uh in the budget review over to um to north rocky and uh that 'll allow that project to go ahead we 're also now both looking at the south rock hampton augmentation uh with grey smear and and what we can do to take effluent um from grace moon treat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority of the civil works is now done they 'll commence finalizing the security fence around the site and anticipate mid-april they 'll be finished that we 're still negotiating with soldiers in relation to the acquisition of plant equipment so i think there 'll be further discussions next week with them in relation to to where we take that we 've also got the resolution from council to uh to work with alliance automation who are out doing the other works at glenmore to see if they could um facilitate installation of all that equipment hockey redevelopment so that project basically is just uh waiting on the arrival of some pumps we 're hoping that they would be here by the end of february that they haven 't arrived so uh the new date is the end of march so we would keep pressure on them but the supply chain uh issues is is causing us a bit of grief there um north rockhampton church treatment plant so we 're able to transfer that money from gracemare and a letter of award went out this week so uh we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together with uh with that contractor haslam and um looking at a pre-start the next few weeks and get that project underway riverbank boardwalk so that uh that 's a replacement of the timber boardwalk in rotten lava arena there at broadly park um the contract 's been awarded to uh to loftus construction they um they 've been working with us and we 've been working with the events team so we will start that project basically straight after uh rocky nats so the week after uh easter and have it finished before the uh uh wine and food and river festivals in september october so that 's the plan there just a question uh through that injury council wickerson yeah thanks mr mayor through dear andrew with the rod rod laver plaza boardwalk yeah um there was some i think there 's a big gum tree that was pushing against foundations or some substructures is that included in this package i i couldn 't quite recall um was it just the boardwalk it 's just just the ball book but if it 's within the boardwalk then obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so it has sufficient um you know it 's not impacting the boardwalk and we 're not impacting the trees i 'm just concerned if it wasn 't and we did this new work on top we 'll have to disturb that again to get back underneath it yeah to fix up there was beans being bent basically with the tree growing here yeah well this project replaces a lot of that the timber substructure so that 'll be um realigned to to provide the clearances there is a a web forward so a mesh that goes on top of the current structure to give vehicle vehicle loading and then the deck is actually a plastic plastic composite material so yeah okay done thanks council wickerson um campton airport security screening project so that 's obviously basically we 're using facility we 're just working through uh with woolam 's um any defect rectification and rockhampton airport parking so the contract has been awarded um and material the plant materials have been ordered um i understand they 're about a 12-week coming from germany so um but to say may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks very much mr mayor just uh three to andrew if you don 't mind can i just quickly go back to the um uh riverbank boardwalk yep um what about plans for the timber that 's being um pulled up from down there because obviously it 's still very usable timber i 'm just wondering are we going to be you know reusing that are we going to be selling it what 's out what 's our plan well it 's not salvaged by council so it is the builder 's rights oh is it okay so they get that as well yeah okay so cost of that taken into account in the during the um they would have costed that i suppose if there 's resale value in their attendance submission because that 'd be worth quite a bit of money yeah thank you thank you thanks andrew is that it no sorry okay counselors any questions to andrew on any of that uh that report like i say we have a more detailed one in the in the future with costings that will be dealt with in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that that report but uh that said could i seek a movement in a second or with regards to it move cancer election second to councillor wickerson i 'll put that those in favor as opposed motions carried unanimously thank you andrew moving on to 7.2 the queensland government waste library update and michael would you like to present that report please yeah good afternoon mr mayor and i 'm councillors um so yeah just wanted to give you a little bit of an update and just to go back a little bit so the waste levy was reintroduced or was introduced by the state government back in july 2019 um at that time we were given a three year window of what that looked like it started at 75 it then went to 80 and then 85 and then they flagged at that time that there would be a regulatory review by july 2022 that would then tell us what was happening with that levy beyond um basically june of this year um so an announcement came out in december and with some of that information so there we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still some information that is still pending the final uh regulatory review which is still due by the 30th of june of this year so in the report i showed so again at the time that the levy came out the the state government made a commitment that there that there 'd be no direct house uh impact on the household um so that they at that time they came out and they provided uh local governments with an advanced payment uh to offset what our levy liability was on a monthly basis so they basically pay us an amount of money up front and advance payment and then we pay that money back each month as those domestic waste tons are disposed into the landfill so in two in the first year we had a surplus and it was designed so that we would have a surplus it was calculated at a percentage of 105 to allow for a little bit of growth in our region and also to give us a little bit of extra money with the expectation that we would spend that money on on initiatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so as you can see there that 's sort of the first two years in the first year we had 293 000 surplus second year we had 20 000 surplus this year uh we 're actually forecasting that we 'll have a deficit of about 90 000 dollars the surplus from the first year was used along with that state government funding to run our uh our garden our garden organic and garden and food organic curbside collection trial so that 's just a little bit of history um and then in december as i mentioned uh council came out and what they 've done is they 've split queensland into the metro zone and the regional zone and within the regional design zone they 've included ourselves along with cairns townsville makai gladstone bundaberg and fraser coast and the significance of that is that in in terms of the levy increase within the metro zone it 's going to increase by ten dollars per ton year on year until it hits 145 by 2027 and then it will increase by cpi thereafter and for ourselves it will increase by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percentage is going to be yet they 're working on that with qtc and they will tell us as soon as they can tell us but um just as a as a side note we 've submitted our fees and charges a month ago um and we based it on two percent um it 's quite likely that it will be somewhere closer to four percent is what we 're hearing um but we really don 't have any other indication yet from them so the other big impact for for us is within the with in regards to the advanced payment um the metro zone for the purpose of the advanced payment also includes those seven large regional councils including ourselves so that advanced payment was at 105 as i mentioned in 23 24 dropping to 95 to 85 70 60 so over the eight years it 's dropping to 20 the 20 is what they say is generally is their expectation of the residual waste to landfill once we 've implemented all these measures that we need to implement to get waste out of landfill so basically driving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the states strategy even though this kind of almost suggests that they want us to meet that target a lot more quickly than their state strategy so we 've done a little bit of work um to try and um estimate based on waste tonnages etc what that 's going to mean for our community from a from a financial perspective and really in a nutshell based on 2 and these figures are all based on two percent um over eight years up to this 30 31 uh it 'll mean we 'll have a deficit or a shortfall in of about 11.5 million dollars if it 's four percent that will increase to a little over 13 million dollars so that is just that 's because just to make it clear why that what that is so the advanced payment is to cover the domestic tons that get disposed to landfill so from the curb side through a utility charge and from the mums and dads that rock up in their car you with the trailer to to one of our facilities and dispose through our fees and charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and charges for the domestic customer do not include a levy component because that liabilities are covered by the advanced payment as that 's reduced then logic would say that we will need to increase our utility charge and our fees and charges for the domestic customer to offset or to recover this 11 12 13 million dollars depending on the percentage of cpi so they 're the knowns i guess so then we 've still got some unknowns so at the moment there is a general exemption for clean earth so at the end of every day 's operation we need to cover our waste with with soil or clean earth so at the moment there 's a general exemption for that meaning we don 't need to apply it 's just generally applied across our industry that the suggestion that that general exemption will be removed from the first of july we then have an operational purposes exemption where we can apply for special use like recycled aggregates asphalts other materials to build our our access roads on the landfill so we 're not exactly sure what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my expectation is that they will bring the clean earth requirement into the operational purposes exemption category and we 'll need to apply for that exemption specifically the rules around that are not out yet there 's been a number of industry meetings with with the state on this to try and get some clarity i 'm hoping for some more information on that application process by the end of march and then there 's still a regulatory review process which has to which needs to be complete before the 30th of july 30th of june sorry i just then the third one is around our materials recycling facility that processes all of the the yellow lidded bin recyclables and i need to apologize on this one because the facts that i 've actually included in that paragraph are incorrect the there are two exemptions that apply for the for the murph one is around the residual waste that comes after all the commodities are separated out and disposed then there 's a and that is currently exempt at a hundred percent so there 's no levy payable on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the material that comes all the glass that comes from the merv process that then goes through the glass plant and then the residual that comes out of the glass plant that goes to the landfill there 's a fifty percent exemption that applies on that component so we 're waiting to find out what is going to happen through this regulatory review but kind of the whispers are that those exemptions will probably be lost which actually doubles at 45 so it 'll have a direct impact of about 90k starting from the first of july thanks michael councillor wickerson um thanks mayor through you to michael sorry just to go back a bit and a side question about the clean earth so we 're putting in 25 000 tonnes so approximately 25 000 cubic meters also of of clean earth do we we have to buy the earth we don 't does it come off site somewhere um yeah so typically we get all of our clean earth from local development you know we get a lot from civil ops some from frw um some from other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free they don 't pay we don 't charge um so it 's kind of a win-win the reality is if we don 't need it and if we had to pop apply a levy then we would not take it and the owners of that material the owners of people responsible for those construction projects generating that clean earth would need to find another home for it so i was thinking two things one was just what you were saying but also about accelerating the the the airspace basically filling up the dump quicker so we can 't reclaim that earth the next morning before we start again we do yeah we can get all that back yeah yeah so so we actually use tarps as well so basically our operation is that at the end of today if there 's any area of waste that we expect to put waste on top of tomorrow we will use tarps and then those tarps are applied and removed tomorrow morning if there 's a any areas of waste that we place today that we 're not expecting to cover with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week or two weeks away then we 'll cover with clean earth and then in that week or two weeks time before we cover it we strip off okay we probably get around 50 recovery and we actually try to strip off in two in two passes we try and get the top say 50 and we 'll end up a stockpile of very clean soil and then we might try and get another 20 percent of the material which will have some plastic bags and that mixed in it and then we 'll use that dirty mix as the first layer when we repeat that process at the end of that day okay thanks thanks michael cancel election thanks mr man to michael i 've only just noticed it was on the previous page so the advanced payments just wondering page before that or yep just think so it goes it decreases reduces by 10 each year but there 's one year where it reduces by 15. is there a reason why it 's 15 probably it 's probably not an even multiple from 2022 to 20 to 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew they wanted to get to there and they yeah okay let 's finally just yeah so andrew the michael for the um change there 's a bucket of money there that they 're going to say that councils can apply for to introduce waste reduction schemes to to offset that um now i met with the minister 's office the other day and talking about that clean earth about how we 've got um you know we believe that it 's something there that we need to have it was going to be an impact to our community going forward they they sort of said that they they they get that but um there are other councils that were applying for that weren 't using that that amount they weren 't giving them rubbery figures so to speak when they were there so they said that they 'd look at our circumstance so i 'm not sure what that 'll mean at the end of the day but then also um with that billion dollars that they 've got here we could maybe apply for a business case to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try and um with that waste avoidance going into the main face so um i 'm waiting on those answers to come back as well through a letter that i 've sent to the to the minister as well uh to come back yeah linda can we scroll to the bottom i don 't know whether i 'll jump too far ahead of you there but no i mean i think i 'm not i 'm i 'm reasonably comfortable with that the clean earth issue will get resolved because from a regulatory perspective as well the last thing they want is landfill operators not to cover their waste to try and avoid that levy cost because there 'll be an environmental impact and just on that though the council further to cancel wickerson 's question if that material wasn 't coming and being charged and we weren 't getting any um reduction on it we 'd still require to purchase that material from somewhere else to do that cover so there 'd be a cost to us plus the cost to the disposer as well that would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comment for the other states where they don 't exempt clean earth what it generates is you actually try on site to recover the material so you actually become a little bit of a miner within your site because it 's the charge just triggered over the white bridge so if you can find it within your site as a clean cover then you you won 't pay less levy so but in some ways it 's safer that the way they 've got it the more common sense prevails with that approach yeah thanks michael so the real mr may so you know these there 's a lot of things but you know i guess there 's four dot points down the bottom there of of actions and measures that we need to try and undertake to minimise this this risk you know the the the curbside organics trial is really important um the cq rock regional waste management infrastructure plan is is a really important piece of work and that 's going to drive the state 's funding to achieve the diversion targets to be honest it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've set the all the levy targets but they 're really dragging their feet on on this piece of work not from the rock perspective not from the rock perspective the state perspective the recycle right like still trying to do something something better around trying to get better awareness around our curbside being a curbside collection system and get contaminants out of the red-littered bin and contaminants out of the yellow little bin and discussions are continuing there with the state and then our waste strategy that was adopted in november 2019 again under the regulation we need to review that every three years so that 's up for review again this year we 're doing a piece of financial modelling at the moment hopefully have something fairly solid by the middle of the year you know do we need to advance our zero waste to landfill strategy to make it earlier than 2050 if the economics say that that 's what makes sense so that 's sort of some of the information we 're trying to understand at the moment so we can come back to council with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mr mayor just uh through you to michael um michael sorry just going back to the clean earth just as much so 25 000 tons um per year of clean earth but if that 's coming into the site isn 't that then going over the weigh bridge which means it 's increasing the uh the levy fee that 's that 's actually payable as well at the moment there 's a general exemption on clean earth so it comes over the way bridge okay but then they get captured and we send them the data of how much we 've received and okay taken into the landfill but there 's no payment on sorry yeah i did see there was an exemption but i wasn 't sure whether it still went over the bridge or whether you buy past the bridge or something so now definitely goes over there it does have the bridge and then the exemption yes okay thank you so when that when that general exemption will in my view will most likely become an operational purposes exemption where we 'll specifically have to apply each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other materials we 're going to use the following financial year um you know they they 'll look at how much we 've used historically and how much to try and it 's it 's difficult because it 's not an exact science and then they 're trying to make this an exact science well you know what 's the length of your road what 's the width of the road your depth so that 's that 's how much you need it 's you know we 're on a landfill it 's not an exact science okay michael i think we 've gone through looks like we don 't have any further questions we might seek him over in a second with regards to that report uh council election thanks mr i should be that comprehensive report from michael and it 's very good for the table to be aware of what 's coming up in the future and obviously the cost to do nothing is actually going to cost council so obviously infrastructure and and innovation is is obviously something that we have to keep in mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from landfill so i 'm very happy with this report thank you michael happy to move happy to move um councillor fischer you 've got a question on mute just a second sorry mr mayor i keep doing that um i just want to uh just commend the report and uh have it a second okay thank you i think it 's a watch this space as we move forward and the impacts of what what the outcomes will be okay that moved in second i 'll put that those in favor opposed motion scout unanimously thanks very much model we move on to the queensland government waste levy update well not waste education sorry the plan went back to the previous one again michael thank you yeah thanks mr mayor so this one 's a little bit more uplifting and it 's really just for council 's information um we generate a waste education plan each year you know in part it 's it 's to help our our education officer just plan plan her year and and manage sort of her our expectations um with her um so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless there 's no questions there it 's a healthy report and something there that uh council see it but again it 's building on that um understanding and knowledge and starting in the schools to bring that education in and avoid from the landfills and that reuse and recycle theme that we 've been pushing uh means a lot at the end of the day when you 're that diversion 's coming out of the landfill so um we need to continue with that and uh get that program happening question councillor copeland oh probably more just a comment a comment if i might mr mayor um you know in in looking at these engagements and certainly being privileged to be a part of some of the celebrations of some of these engagements and the wins that the schools are actually having and as in they 've been educated on the things that they can do to help their school to be more environmentally friendly but also in the waste space to actually save on what 's going to landfill i think overall there 's been a huge uptake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a really good facilitator of getting the message out into the community of of what the importance is around reducing our landfill and those those children are taking that back to their homes and it 's filtering through and so it 's a really good program and it 's great to see it condensed here into a report to just actually give illustration to the community of what 's going on and because there might be a lot of people who are unaware of this particular initiative that 's that 's happening and being pushed through from the waste department so congratulations to to everybody who 's involved in in that and the key players of course who are always out there dressing up as pirates and whatever else to help push the message so congratulations to all of your team councillor i 'm happy to thank you just just following on from councillor kirkland just to say um a big thank you and shows how important kelly is to our organisation um as education officer she does a fantastic job and is doing a great job out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy to second mr mayor further questions that report i 'll put that those in favor as opposed motions carried unanimously thank you michael the organics strategy queensland organic strategy thank you yeah thanks mr mayor so this is another update um you know on the back of the state strategy that came out in 2019 and on the back of i guess the state funding we received to support a curbside organic collection service and the whole drive to get waste out of landfill the state released their organic strategy and their organic action plan just in february so only a few weeks ago for the next 10 years sort of their next 10-year plan so i 've attached that strategy and that action plan um to this report and i wasn 't really going to go through it again in any great detail i have also sent the strategy and the report to quite a few of the the managers across council because probably one thing that i just did want to highlight and i hopefully i 've highlighted that in this report is that it touches lots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events um obviously parks obviously ourselves but um sustainability it touches on lots of lots of parts of council so again it kind of endorses what we 're doing with our organics trial i think we 're very fortunate that we 're doing a trial and any decision that council is going to make on a on a future service going forward will actually be based on our data and not someone else 's data so we can sort of feel a lot more comfortable around that okay michael questions counselor kirkland oh just to comment i 've had feedback from community who are partakers in this fogo trial saying please don 't take my bin off me i 'm loving it it 's really interesting i 'm like okay yeah thank you we 'll uh take him over in a second with regards to this move against the latching seconder councillor kirkland i 'll put that those in favor opposed motions carried unanimously thank you moving on to the to crash me uh uh yeah great ways transfer station operating hours review again michael thank you yeah thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of last year 's budget um preparation or process you know we were given a task to try and look at potential savings in our operating budget while still meeting the needs of our community reducing the operating hours at mount morgan and grace near transfer stations was was some of that work so we 've spoken about this uh at some of our workshops that we had last year and and it was put to council that potentially in relation to grace me we we go out to the community and do a survey um to question whether um the operating hours of that facility are are correct or whether there 'd be be better hours without actually increasing the overall hours and therefore the overall cost so i just wanted to point out that um while the recommendation that i put forward is to to do the survey i would be equally comfortable and equally supportive of of maintaining the hours as they currently are without going for a survey so and i say that because since we 've amended the hours in february of last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through pathways we 've two of those were commercial customers it just wasn 't convenient to them technically speaking that facility doesn 't accept commercial customers even though for green waste we we do accept them because it doesn 't increase our our cost and we want to provide that service but and the other six were from domestic customers and one of those six was the gentleman from the gracemeer community voice association who i 've spoken with a number of a number of times so i don 't and i think the last complaint we had was it was in december so we haven 't had one for several months so again it 's a difficult one because i i don 't think the the dissatisfaction if that 's the right word is um is high um but if if council chooses and wants to go to to go and do a survey and seek some input and see if there would be alternative hours without increasing the overall hours for the week i 've included a number of options in this report option one 's obviously the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to from um on from on monday wednesday and friday from seven a.m to five pm there it is there yep thanks linda we 're closing the facility completely on tuesday and thursday and then altering the hours on saturday or alternatively option three um monday wednesday friday from sort of staggering him opening it early and closing it a bit earlier on tuesday and thursday opening it late and closing it late and saturday sunday just balancing those hours but generally opening them early option four is just a another variation of those so down budgeted implications they 're all they 're all based on those 44 hours per week so there 'd be no impact other than option four so this would be a minor impact there over the year okay thanks michael council election thank you mr mayor i guess i was very surprised to see this one come today um the eight people out of the whole of the grace in your area um when when i think you need 10 people for a petition so this doesn 't even make the number of people for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we 're always going to act on something with only a few complaints are we going to keep bringing this up and discussing it for eight people so while everyone 's opinion 's valued at the in the bigger scheme of things out of ten thirteen thousand people residents out that way eight i think says we 're probably doing the right thing but i 'll leave it to the table just to comment on that one thanks council that 's some councillor smith i 've certainly had a lot more than eight complaints i can assure you and um obviously i didn 't register mine through pathway but and i 'm sure i did a lot of them names addresses and phone numbers i gave when it first changed but also there 's been a fair bit of illegal dumping on allen road and tyndall road which is around that area and the residents there have taken to self-policing because by the time i get local laws to go out these people have gone they are very very upset with our reduced hours and they believe that that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting for cars to be off the road so they can dump so i 've certainly had happened at a real real good time with these hours that we 've put through and i would would really like to have public consultation i think that that 's you know imperative because i have told people it will be reviewed later on and on and people believe that we are looking at it again which is what we said we were going to do originally with grace me and matt morgan thanks councillor smith councilman thanks very much mr mayor just threw you to michael if that 's okay um michael when i was um first reading this report i sort of looked at the the hours you know 9 a.m to 3 p.m and i sort of thought oh look that kind of makes sense um you know because of all the um commercial operators but you 're just saying that there 's actually you know great span doesn 't isn 't supposed to accept commercial operators so that that 's now got me questioning the fact that if i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view you know quite often if i do work around the yard on the weekend it 'll be on a sunday quite often i 'm pretty busy and i might do one or two trips to the to the dump but then there 's usually a full trailer load after five o 'clock and i 'll get up early and go and do a dump run before i go to work and that 's what i 've always i 've quite often done i noticed that these hours that we 've got here they 're all nine to three so there 's no before or after work um time so so that you know and if there 's not that many um commercial operators going to it i understand that you 're looking at opening earlier in the in the other options but the the current hours um you know if someone wants to you know shoot off early in the afternoon you know after work or you know go early in the morning that 's that you know um i would have thought there 'd be a lot more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is is my thought so i would have thought you know maybe a review that has those earlier opening times or maybe skipping a day or two might be more of an option thanks council mathis cancers any more questions the counselor submits another comment mr um i did mean to say that that we 're not we 're not catering for full-time working people and i think that 's been a lot of the problem with opening at nine and closing at three you know they don 't have an opportunity a lot of people they have got acreages and they just can 't fit everything in their normal bin even people that do get a bin but other people on the outskirts there some of them aren 't catered for with a wheelie bin so the hours just having one day open from seven to five just doesn 't suit councillor kirkland um thank you mr mayor with regards to the matter that counselor um smith has raised with the illegal dumping through you two to michael do you we is that already on your i know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um or some of those little cameras is that one of those areas that has already been identified and potentially would be a good spot to so that these people aren 't having to self police if we get stuff on camera then we can prosecute those people who are doing illegal dumping yeah through the chair council that was a part of the hotspot program that we ran under that state government litter and illegal dumping program that program is over so we 've lost that funding um i know there was an extension or an addition to that funding program um i believe that was for a continuation of a local laws officer which our local laws team was taking that opportunity up do we still have cameras though that we can put up there 's no did they what cameras were i would need to they were all local laws cameras i 'd need to talk to them sorry yeah but we would still have cameras yeah i was under the impression we had a number of those we would have cameras still yes yeah okay thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move in a second with regards to the officer recommendation move councillor smith do we have a second chancellor kirkland put that days in favor as opposed motion 's carried unanimously thank you very much michael moving on to item 7.6 the man morgan rail trail feasibility study consultation outcomes good afternoon thanks man has a conflict in this one okay thank you afternoon mayor councillors so this report presents the outcomes of the first round of consultation for the mount morgan rail trail feasibility study so consultation was undertaken between 16th of august and third of september 2021 and this was generally engaged the level of community support business support any issues people might have with this proposed rail trail so letters were sent to property owners adjacent to the trail to key stakeholders advising them of the consultation media release social media was also informed the wider community of the consultation we had display schools set up at uh shopping centers at rockhampton grace miranda morgan a number of meetings were held with key stakeholders and landowners and online engagement was also open so in total we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proposed rail trail most of those opposing the rail trail were adjacent landowners so the consultation report summarizes some of the issues and potential solutions that would be worked through if we were to proceed with the rail trail so in general these involved were all around sort of disruption to farming practices safety security trespass those type of issues and also there was some concern around biosecurity and transference of disease and weeds from users particularly sort of horse riders but that 's all documented in the consultation report the preliminary design is being finalized and will be completed in the coming weeks at which stage will this will be presented back to council and then we 'd like to go back out to a second round of community consultation so we can get some feedback on that final preliminary design so and the feasibility study is also being finalized in parallel with that design and i 'd just like to reiterate that this is just a feasibility study there 's no other money has been allocated to the subsequent stages and this is fully funded through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election thanks mr mayor um just surprised you said 113 respondents to the to the survey and yet when the question comes up how would you use the trial as 191 responses how does that happen yeah that 's um because they could have given a various responses so they might have used it i think there 's a number of difference they could have been used for walking recreation it could have been used for cycling so they may have answered each of those yeah that 's fine that 's how that so out of that how would you use the trail 45 people respondents uh were horse riders which i thought was fairly high for our region and so yeah it kind of did a bit of research on that one and obviously they 're very keen to have a section involved with that [Music] i guess kind of the research i kind of found was they 'd like to see an adjacent to the trail they 've got their own dedicated trail and there 's just a comment at this point for that one but that that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry they have walkers and motorbikes and not that meant to be there but um trail bikers and horses that co-exist um is an interesting concept um but the the thing out of this report is that of was missing in my mind was consideration of a from the railway uh information center a a track using the existing track back to the showgrounds could be the southern track part portion of it that was kind of omitted from from a consideration um and if there was a track from from the showgrounds to the railway information center through to top of razorback as stage one hypothetically i think that would do a lot for the ecotourism of mount morgan and and something that 's probably stage one would be would a better better option to probably consider but it 's just a comment on that one but it would have been nice to see the the integration being able to use that rail tunnel um near the mount morgan mine going over to the um to the showgrounds it 's something that the local community could easily embrace especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the like they could stop there and they could spend three or four hours whichever way they want to go as opposed to this proposed thing is would they go all the way down to gracie or cabra would take a lot you need to spend a lot more time so i think it 's probably to me it 's more realistic to have just the mount morgan area covered and that 's probably something to consider in when they ask questions if it goes any further um would they prefer to see that as stage one rather than the next thing which is your horses obviously would be from razorback down to cabra so just to clarify there 's no motorbikes on this trail at all it 's just you said trail bikes yeah unfortunately they do happen but you 've got to take preventative measures to make sure they don 't use it yeah just come across that they were going to be allowed to use and no they 're not yep anyway i think the funding was for that that corridor anyway so um yeah where it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fisher are against officials thank you mr mayor um i spent a lot of time looking at other rail trails and videos and commentaries and testimonies and all kinds of things to to give myself a more educated understanding of of what type of things we could end up looking at or end up with and the advantages and benefits to the to the community and uh there seems to be a considerable amount of merit in in such a such a construction one of the things that stood out to me was the period of time to deliver these projects some of them were like 18 years in their delivery what 's sort of in your feasibility study does that come out with the time frames of the delivery or i suppose that 's more into the design and and budgetary constraints but is there any anticipation of because they 're all variable like some of them there 's a lot of um a lot of sealed sections and is it all you know all of those things obviously contribute to it but some of these were actually delivered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well uh through the chair yeah so depending on probably the length of the trail because some of those trails that you may have looked at are over 100 kilometers long or 150 there 's quite some long trails so this one 's a little bit less than that 's around about 29 kilometers but yes it would certainly be something that we delivered in stages if it were to progress um and um just referring to sorry i 've just lost my train of thought or what you 're what you 're saying but community participation in the actual delivery yeah yeah that was one of the um key things mentioned by our consultants one of the consultants has done a number of uh we 've been involved with a number of rail trails throughout australia and certainly um there 's a push there that if you can get volunteers involved that would certainly be a good thing at this stage we haven 't [Music] we haven 't established a friends of the rail trail or any sort of volunteer type group we do know there is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rail trail but there 's probably no formal volunteer group that we 've we 've formed but that 's certainly something we 'd look at if we were to progress yeah it 's it 's a bit similar by the amount and first tacky mountain bike trail where the the users maintain and keep keep an eye on it so you you get that community involvement and participation thanks cancer curve and council mathers thanks very much mr may yeah that 's exactly right mr merritt 's i think a lot of that community engagement comes from the actual maintenance upkeep that type thing at the rail trials but you know look i totally agree uh councillor kirkland in regards to you know i personally know um friends who go down to brisbane i think um toowoomba and that type of stuff and they do i think it 's 120 130k rail trails and they actually um there 's companies there who load up the push bikes bus them down to one end and then they ride back to brisbane or they go the other way and there 's bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know a lot of people get involved so it 's definitely something that i think it 's it 's exciting i know ours won 't be that long but another reason why i think council kirkland a lot of these projects take so long is because they start small but they just add to them add to them and you end up with something that might be 29 k 's long that might end up being 50 k 's long by the end of it or something you know so i think it 's i think it 's a project that 's got a lot of merit so it 's uh i look forward to seeing where it goes thanks again so much there 's no further questions could i seek a mover in a second with regards to that officer 's recommendation oh councillor fisher sorry mate so mr mayor um i just had one question just with regards to with going through a lot of these properties will fencing be part of this process and is that something that is covered by the grants funding yep through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study at this stage and fencing is something that would be considered if we progress to a more if we were to progress to a detailed design uh certainly something that the landowners have raised are fencing to obviously keep their their stock their cattle separate from the corridor so the the the right the trail would uh predominantly follow the existing disused rail corridor so that 's owned by qr um which so although it goes through adjoining properties it 's still owned by qr so so we would have to talk to those people um get them involved but fencing is something certainly we would be uh looking at if we progress further okay thank you for that i 'm happy to move if i just got some more questions i 'm having a second yeah we 've got a few more lights on there cancer fisher councillor wickerson and councilman rutherford thanks mr mayor look i think on the face of it this project is as a huge amount of merit i 've ridden on the the pineapple trail down the beach and it 's great it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do have some concerns as well and one is certainly the comments from the the stakeholders are up aside the property i think the the consultant nearly dismissed a little bit of that uh which i i didn 't think the time was appropriate i mean these people are right there on it uh their voice certainly does count uh fine to use it as recreation and i 'm one of those i 'd probably love it but uh yeah you can 't dismiss the people that that 's their life and life livelihood right there so i thought about the fencing okay if they 're worried about the security do we put up some screen fencing or whatever well then it might bisect their paddocks so how do they get from one side to the other so there 's some logistical issues there too um i like the idea of having a group that might maintain it and i know the first turkey group are very proactive with that but uh just a quick look at the the trail we 've recently put in around the dam which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to plan so i think a previous report we looked at today said look after what we 've got before we look at new infrastructure get our house sorted out and then look at some new stuff and probably the final point is just the timing and we sort of covered that with pool this morning that as great as this project is and we get certainly ironing out some of the bugs um you get the feasibility study and the report done and put on the shelf somewhere ready for when the time 's right to do it certainly a great project but whether now 's the time to do it when we 've got all these other much higher more critical priorities just not sure i 'm not convinced on that just yet but yeah happy to finish off the feasibility and get it shovel ready but then maybe park it thanks councilworks and cancer rutherford um mr mayor councillor um wickerson 's probably said it everything i was i was going to say anyway that there is it was quite dismissive of the concerns of the the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to certainly finish where we 're going but be very very careful about um where we where we head from here and um you know the impact that it does have on on some of those communities yeah no you 're right i think it 's uh you know they were highlighting those areas but i probably took the time to say that it 's it 's a pr it 's a great project don 't uh don 't listen to the to the naysayers but that said you you need to do that if it 's going through their properties and their livelihoods are involved so take that on board um but again it 's a it 's a great report and uh you know probably echo council wickerson 's comments there that the priority at the moment when we went out with this one was probably at a at a higher level than what it is at the moment so it may be one that we uh become we revisited a later date when we 're more uh financially able to up to to start to stage the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report uh do we have any a move in a second with regards to the officer 's recommendation or alternate motion councillor fischer you 're happy to move i read your lips and you said yes you were happy to remove yeah we have a second uh council election i 'll put that those in favor as opposed motions carried unanimously thank you thank you mr mayor i do apologize again that 's all good uh moving on to item 7.7 the lane dealings lot 305 cp one who 's got this one martin afternoon marion councillors um some time ago council was approached by the department of resources to formalize the tenure awesome council smith back into the room she 's still in the um uh exclusion zone thanks councillor rotherford i didn 't uh pick up on that one and i 'm rushing through to the next next item sorry councillor smith we i did forgot you at the chair okay thank you thanks martin okay no problem uh yep so thanks mayor and councillors yes the department of resources uh approach council to formulize tenure arrangements over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station in campbell street uh this is on the back of the department education namely rockhampton state high school also wanting to formalize arrangements on that parcel of land um for car parking associated with the school as you can see from the plan above we have quite a bit of infrastructure that goes across that that parcel of land it 's currently unallocated state land so we 've commenced some discussions with the department of resources about that the way forward for us is to purchase that parcel of land to acquire the tenure of that land now that doesn 't necessarily stop the high school from having access for parking but that would then require a lease arrangement between council and the department of education we 're suggesting that would be a market a 20-year lease at market rent try and recoup some of council 's costs in relation to the purchase of the block so essentially the purchase is about securing our rights we currently don 't have those rights really to have that amount of infrastructure sitting on what is an unallocated parcel of land estate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um to move forward with the um the purchase of the lot uh through negotiation with department resources and then uh have some negotiations with the department of education to entering into a 20-year lease which we can work directly with a government uh body under an exemption on the local government regulation without going out to tender as such okay can we do some bartering there martin i was thinking maybe if we offer some land there for parking that we could get some parking on the fields when we 're using the showgreens in exchange we certainly can keep that in mind when we 're when we 're doing the negotiation but it doesn 't hurt anyway questions councillor wickerson thanks mayor i think the school also used that or portion of that parcel land to get access to aquaculture i think on the site plan that you can see down along the fences sheds and tanks and things so it 's probably a double hit there that you know they want to use the parking and also access to that access to that new facility that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they 're developing okay council is pretty self-explanatory it makes a lot of sense to uh to tidy that up but it 's kind of a bit of anomaly we find these things from time to time but need to resolve and move forward with it so uh could i have a secret move move councillor smith the seconded councillor fisher i 'll put that those in favor opposed motions carried unanimously thanks very much martin moving on to 7.8 the derby street cycle lanes design yeah jamie thank you yes council received funding through tmr to undertake detailed design for the presid provision of cycling facilities along derby street from canning street to denison street so a concept design has been developed and as you can see here the concept design includes single traffic lanes in each direction landscaped concrete center median one and a half meter wide on-road cycle lanes in each direction a two and a half wide two and a half meter wide concrete shared path on the northern side of derby street to to construct a two and a half metre wide path through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would need to be removed some of the all of the angle parking would be turned into parallel parking so this would result in the loss of 23 angle parking bays between george and campbell street so essentially that 's at the front of dc motors and it 's also proposed that traffic signals would be installed at telford street in the section so we 'd like to take this out to community consultation this is planned to commence there was plan to commence 21st of march monday the 21st of march that may be put back a little bit and for a number of weeks to give the community an opportunity to provide feedback on the concept designed prior to us undertaking detailed design so letters will be sent to property owners immediately adjacent to derby street online survey will also be made available for the general public to provide comments i think you 've got a as attachments you 've got a letter there and a questionnaire that we 'll send out once submissions have been received we review those consider those submissions and then detailed design would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year 2022 comments okay thanks very much uh jamie uh portfolio spokesperson councillor smith yeah thanks mr missed me i had to talk to um peter and um martin about it the other day and i was just saying as long as there 's not you know trees up near denison and derby any blockages there we 're getting a lot of flack about the um the last fatality there i don 't think there is but i was just wondering with the trees being removed can you just tell us where they are just remind me i didn 't hear about any trees being removed the other day um whereabouts would that be yeah through the chair so those trees uh through here so you might note there 's actually a note there to say remove it so through this area and through here so the whole length of the street there so they 're medium-sized trees okay uh it would be proposed that we would replace we would put trees in the vegetation within the center medium center yeah i am concerned about removing that um angle parking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of had a good look at that area and there 's a lot of cars and i often go either stanley or derby either coming to rocky or going from and there 's a lot of cars parked around the corner in george street as well which means that they 're from all those businesses there just sort of concerned about that if we take that parking away and return it with so we 're losing is it 23 car parks lost 23 yeah and how many would go back as parallel parking so it takes probably that 's that 's a reduction that 's right total loss yeah i i 'm really concerned about that um because it 's going to push more traffic into those other areas and i 'm not sure whether there 's a lot of allocated parking in in you know the adjoining streets i 'm not sure i thought they didn 't drive around those to see well if they can 't park there would where would they park it 's through it 's going through for consultation so i think those issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's uh you know concerns around that yeah we can review that after that consultation and be raised up at that point also when i read it again um and i 'd you with apologize um putting traffic lights in telford street like you nearly at the roundabout at the um shopping center and i just thought that 's sort of a double whammy really yes you 've got traffic lights then next minute you 're at the shopping center then you run it run into that roundabout straight away yeah through the chair so the traffic lights will improve the safety of that intersection i think there has been a number of crashes at it at that intersection so from vehicle perspective from improved safety but also to provide a pedestrian crossing as well uh a safe point of um crossing for students to the nearby school as well so sorry so it 's that purpose as well yeah i wasn 't thinking about the schools that 's probably a good idea and they have the tennis courts across the road too so yeah yeah thanks council smith uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um i am concerned about the number of trees that need to be or i guess proposed to be taken here um and i know you 're talking about having some in the medians but that 's not normally trees these days it that 's usually just um you know shrubs and whatever else so we 're talking about considerable trees that are that give us shade so i i don 't see that you know shrubs or ground cover is going to make any any help at all really for for there is there ways that we can keep some of the trees that are there just through the chair yeah we have um we 've been out on site we 've considered uh it 's it 's quite constrained through there the issue is this is tied up with tmr funding and as part of that they they 're after best practice facilities for cyclists and vulnerable users so usually they recommend a shared path for off-road for those vulnerable users and a shared path has a minimum width of two and a half meters it 's difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without removing those trees there 's already some constraints there with power poles so we do have to narrow the path around some of those obstructions but if we don 't remove the teresa it would essentially we would have to have a narrower good path through there and it could have implications with our funding that we 've received for this as well so that would just a consideration would have to be given to that as well yeah mr mayor i i get that but at some point we 've got to start to say that you know our trees are you know really really important everywhere look around we 're seeing trees cut down we looked something um we passed something just recently and the trees are being chopped around around just to let those um different big uh you 're right concerns and i am lost my speech i 'm sorry no you 're right i 'm struggling with my words i 'm sorry no that 's all right look and i i hear your concerns and understand that but i think the what the the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a safety over the the aesthetics is is the decision for the council to say whether we you know is this is that a big enough reason for not to continue with the project as jamie 's mentioned if those trees are removed we can 't implement that pathway is that is that something there that knocks the project over would there be other options to put trees in another location to offset i 'm going to say there 's always options but all we 're asking is can we see the people impacted think of this they may come up with other ideas and we may change our design all we 're asking for is just to we 're just actually informing you that we 're going out for consultation yep you 're not making a decision on anything about the project in that sense yep thanks peter cancel election thanks mr mayor i guess safety first i really like this design um it 's sad to see some trees go but then there 's ad added more vegetation to to not just be a concrete jungle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the existing footpaths that are there are they being taken out in order to put the new two and a half meter ones in yes through the chair there so that 's correct that 's great um and and so it 's part of its purpose for the new east footers to be able to get to the botanic gardens or up to the at least the elements down is it part and parcel of where we 're going as a region that that could be a um that 's not what the intention was but certainly a wider footpath will um benefit all users so if there 's someone walking or riding and someone 's coming in the opposite direction of the scooter certainly a wider path is going to help with user safety okay thank you council wickerson and councilman um thanks mr mayor you know i 'm sorry to see some of the car parks go but absolutely the safety comes comes first um the only thing i 'd add to that is the at the denison street i think outside of smith races to denison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motorcycle rider and passengers not well either i did ask the other day whether we could look at uh and so just to get back this was a previous black spot funding so we 've already done major upgrades there was signage uh up to an uh exceeding what the standards are i think but just to in in this design whether we couldn 't consider maybe some optional additional um devices there to slow traffic down for for whatever reason as well as it 's designed um people still tend to go straight through this probably driver behavior more than anything but um you talk about vertical vertical restraints like speed bumps or whatever yeah perhaps but also and officers have got back to me saying that it 's also a truck route so that 's some things aren 't practical you can 't have chicanes and vertical uh bumps probably not but just he wants to respond to that one jamie or stuart it 'll probably come up through the consultation anyway just we need a microphone mate the people online the design here was completed i suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intersection so it hasn 't considered i suppose what safety improvements we are looking at at the intersection of derby and denison so rather because it was i suppose put it to design with a scope to look at cycling and vulnerable road users it hasn 't specifically looked to address those issues so council internally are looking at what can be done at the intersection of derby and denison uh and the adjacent intersections either side to address the matters associated with uh the recent fatality and the previous crashes that have been there so i suppose i 'll and and potentially it 's something we might need to put on these plans for consultation to highlight that it is a separate body of work that will be done to address those matters whereas this has been scoped i suppose and focused on cyclist facilities and vulnerable road users i think that 's an important point as we go through that public consultation to to highlight that we 're doing our own work and looking at that but also this is just focused on that uh pedestrian and cycleways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point yeah thank you and i appreciate your reply the other day i didn 't see you sitting there sorry but yeah i appreciate that and just to finish off mayor the even though it takes up some of the width of the road those um holding lanes for left and right turns from the center that will solve the problem and these aren 't fatalities but there 's a high frequency uh colloquially anyway of nose details there because there 's two lanes through someone stops to turn right and for whatever reason people are smashing at the back of them so um yeah that 's a good inclusion but it 'll solve a lot of problems that 's uh yeah probably probably having large wide streets uh you know planning years ago has probably led to some of these problems that we face now so um putting a lot more um into those those carriageways we 'll uh slow it down a bit councillor mathers thanks very much mr mayor um i 'm happy to support for this to um go to consultation i think you find you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just can spot speak just uh briefly about in regards to uh dc motors obviously with some uh previous history there um you know i 've seen multiple accidents where people have been pulling into and pulling out coming across lines of traffic to go into the into the dealerships and there 's been accidents there so i like the way that there 's a dividing um traffic hole in there which is good the um one issue that there is there 's already a lot of congestion there in regards to parking particularly on campbell street with everyone going in to drop the cars off for the service department that whole of campbell street between stanley street and derby street is backed up with with service service vehicles um but the other issue is i think there was about 28 angled car parks we 've reduced that by almost half more than half now i think it 's down to 13 and that 's where most of the customers would pull up to go and look at cars and also overflow parking for service so there is definitely going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we 're going to have around those at dealership again that 'll be highlighted in the um consultation on a minion it 'll uh come up and uh there 'll be options there and solutions i 'm sure to to some of those issues so uh any other questions counsellors council smith mr there is a petition coming as well regarding uh derby and denison streets from businesses in that area i think it 's been on i 've read it on facebook a few times so it 's coming as well so that 'll feed into this consultation yeah yeah that 's right okay councillors if there be no further questions uh we might seek them over in a second with regards to that constant move council smith second councillor wickerson i 'll put that those in favor opposed emotions carried unanimously thank you councillors cancer that brings us to the end of our uh gender items um there 'll be no questions i 'll declare the meeting closed and thank

land is in the torres straits but who live and work on aboriginal land we have no apologies apologies leave abstinence for granted for council official confirmation of the previous minutes councillors could i seek a confirmation for the previous minutes councillor smith and councillor wickerson i 'll put that council as those in favor as opposed motions carried declarations item five declarations and interests on matters of the agenda we have quite a number of them today councils so we 've worked their way through them um councillor smith uh item 11.8 yeah 11.8 uh i 've got a couple in that one first one being the alliance maintenance facility as it 's a development at the airport because my niece and her husband own properties at 48 hunter street and 60 hunter street and that 's also applies to 11.9 airport precinct feasibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's for the same reason then back to 11.8 the capital project report mount morgan water security because my nephew is a partner in mtc who i 've commenced a contract to cut water to mount morgan and my brother is employed to drive the water tanker and i 'll be all my conflicts i 'll be leaving the room and there 's also 11.12 federal election at advocacy product priorities grace merced yards building upgrade i i sold my cattle through the sale yards and so does all my family in relations so i 'll be leaving the room when that one 's discussed as well thanks kenzler we have a number of other councils councillor shane legend with 11.6 yes thanks mr mayor um just to inform the meeting that i have a prescribed conflict of interest in item 11.6 surrender and unclaimed animal policy the prescribed conflict of interest arises as i volunteer for capricorn animal aid who may receive funds from the policy thank you councillor wickerson thanks mr mr a query on the agenda that i 've got at least there 's no 11.8 it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is but it 's not bookmarked apparently so oh okay agendas haven 't got the uh the number on there can we clarify that eleven point eleven point eight and then uh so yeah if you go to click on 11.9 and scroll backwards it 's up above it 's it 's nothing 's hidden in the agenda thank you thanks for picking that up we can at least it 's noted now um business outstanding nil public forums deputations uh presentational petitions councillor rutherford you have a petition there to be titled uh if you 'd like to speak to that please thank you mr mayor yes i 'd like to present a petition on um behalf of residents within my division um that have concerns they live in proximity to the south side of the barrage and they have considerable concerns with illegal fish fishing now this has been going on for quite some time it goes back years actually and there was an alarm system put in cameras an alarm which has worked for a while but now the illegal fishing is happening so often that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've had to cut that back a little bit but the residents there are dealing with you know large numbers of people coming through trespassing they 're actually going through people 's yards to get there using their taps to clean fish they 're leaving all of the waste behind they 're leaving rubbish from their utes all over the road um and just generally it 's it 's an appalling uh condition so um i have spoken to officers about this um i think um offence is probably one of the the ways we could probably look at um doing something there but i think it 's probably more important that a report comes back um to council it gives a number of options for the table to consider to see whether there 's something we can do it 's really brazen most people are knowing now that this is really the department of fisheries to police it 's not council but it doesn 't matter phone calls to the department of fisheries even with um phone calls to the police the reaction time is so is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know they can can get there and get away with fish and it 's um it 's not fair it 's the fish barrage the uh the fish ladder um and it 's just so easy picking it 's not good for um so given given that 's happening i think i 'm going to leave it there report um with the fishing forum this has been previously there the next free zone forum on friday it 's been an issue that 's been raised over a number of years and again the the jurisdiction who can police at least we 've got the gremlins in the gremlins in the works this morning councillors unfortunately but uh look i 'm happy to second that one canceller as i mentioned before it 's something there that 's been an issue for many years uh and something that 's been discussed at the fishing forums previously so on that note i 'm sure that 'll be well received when i speak to the forum on friday that we there 's a report coming on options that we can look to maybe put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long run uh if we 're not unable to have have the authority to be able to police it it 's a difficult one and uh qps are probably their resources are stretched in other areas i 'd imagine this is probably not a high priority for them unfortunately we might just wait while we only have these uh that 's oh okay um any well i 'll put that those in favor those opposed emotions carried unanimously thanks council rutherford item nine the committee reports 9.1 the audit and business improvement committee meeting from the 18th of november 2021 uh the minutes from that meeting be uh approved could i seek a second move councillor latching second and councillor smith any discussion around the accuracy of those minutes counsellors councillor latcham thanks mr mayor just overall very happy with the all the reports um in particular the the interim report for the bushfire prevention governance review and it 's a very timely reminder i 'm glad they 're looking into that so i look forward to the uh the second stage of that so i 'm very happy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'll uh put the motion those in favor i suppose motions carried unanimously thank you councillors uh delegation reports nil officers 11.1 the rocky nats trade trade fees and charges uh thanks greg would you like to present that report please morning mayor and councillors yes we are venturing uh within now time planning and such starts so that has been going all year but certainly now time to put into action uh our rocky nats plan and this is one of the steps that 's required by council to approve the trade stalls which includes uh whether it be the trade in our sponsors and automotive type products or our food stalls that support us along the way mostly at the burnouts and showgrounds precinct as well but that 's helping those local businesses from the food vendor side they loved the event last year they love river festival so they 'll be lining up again for this one as well but uh and our aim is to to try and promote more and more into the automotive industry and get more of those trade stalls work with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slight increases from last year we work very closely with the summer nats team uh to benchmark uh what they what they charge at summer nets in canberra and redness at ellis then try and balance that with what we would normally charge with one of our events uh so obviously we do not charge as much as summer nets uh but we charge a little more than river festival because we 're where our numbers are much higher for this event so so it 's pretty self-explanatory it 's similar to the report that was presented uh earlier this year for for rockynet z01 uh with some slight increases which we feel can be managed thanks greg just um the number of um sites and the bookings are how they 're going yeah so at this stage mayor uh we we haven 't gone out heavily this is really the important part going out with the costing so uh our sponsors are lining up uh very quickly so they 'll be right but they don 't actually pay our fee because as part of their sponsorship so this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit the market both for sponsorships which is a separate thing but uh but also trade stalls as part of that uh along the way food truck vendors are already calling so that 's a good sign uh so they are ready we had uh 22 i think food truck vendors last year and i think we 'll have more this year because they 've seen the success of the event so they 're calling we 'll we 'll hit them first but then we 'll we 'll put a dedicated resource onto sponsorship and trade stalls and just sorry just to to give you a number from last time around trade stores was 30 uh last year or this year sorry in 2021 and uh food stalls were 22. so so is there a scope to increase that if they 're interested if there 's interest there yeah this certainly interests me after rocky natso one we 're people both on that food side of things but also on the trade uh and and i think we didn 't have a lot of local take up last time uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players so i think there may be some local take up uh in rocky natso too and that 's our plan okay thanks greg councils any um questions to greg at all i 'm happy to move that one seek a second councillor kirkland i 'll put that those in favor pose motions carried thanks greg uh moving on to 11.2 submissions to the rockhampton regional council memorial for john and margaret shannon thanks alicia good morning marion councillors uh this was a request made by mr ross shannon who is attempting to get a memorial across the entire state in terms of where his family have been of which rockhampton is part of that so councillors we have commenced working on a policy to deal with these types of requests however when i discussed with mr shannon around the timing of the policy he 's sort of trying to celebrate a 150 years sort of celebration early next year so it didn 't fit in line with his timelines so i said that i would put the matter to council but the recommendation is that the answer is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um mr mayor yes i i applaud uh uh mr and mrs shannon and their desire to have a memorabilia a memento of their family 's uh heritage in the region and everything i think that council 's current position on putting together a policy around this is a really good idea so thank you to the officers who who are putting that together and look forward to seeing it i 've also seen the uh serena field of dreams memory lane i don 't know if any of the other councillors are familiar with that but potentially down the path down the track i think this is something where we could accommodate um one of um mr shannon 's things is that something that you 're going to be putting into the most into your reports or uh so just to respond back through you um mr mayor and the policy at the moment has certainly um discussed the types of things whether or not um anyone can buy a memorial for their family what places those memorials should go um and or whether or not it needs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be in place for so we 've commenced some of those discussions through our communities workshop but as yet we haven 't got that clear direction of council yeah thank you you 're not saying it 's known yeah i think that 's something we can discuss at a further workshop i think it has been something that 's been muted but we we need to get some clarity on what that is so i think there 's options there and um yeah if there are other examples there that we can consider then yeah something there we need to uh workshop and work your way through thanks a number of other likes councillor wickerson and councillor smith thanks mr media just to uh also acknowledge the passion that mr shannon has i know we 've had frequent phone calls from him and i understand his his passion for that and i don 't speak too much specifically about his situation which is generally it 's good that this matter at least is brought to our attention that we don 't have a policy around because it is important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contribution to the region and that 's something i think will which will form part of the important part of the policy is because i think council rather than i 've chatted it 's it 's not that a particular family might have been here for 100 years but just been regular members of the community and not made an overwhelming contribution uh or you could have been here for for 10 years and changed the world so it 's not time uh initially i thought this might have been a good opportunity to to fundraise for other heritage activities but then i 'll change my mind to that after conversations we 've had because it shouldn 't be someone that can afford to pay 20 or 30 000 for a memorial that gets one and someone else 's has a lot of merit that maybe can 't afford that so i 've changed my mind that was a mistake and i was thinking probably along the lines of how philanthropy and i 'll get to that in a second so i don 't think it should be about who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are more deserving maybe again not speaking about this one specifically because this may well come back when we 've got the policy developed and we 'll reassess it and it may well well get up but that 's for time to come but for now i absolutely uh support this recommendation but just on options for mr shannon in this case uh there 's always a philanthropy uh contribution to the new museum of art which i think we previous director of art gallery might have raised with him and he i don 't think he was interested in that but i think that rather than just saying flat out no just say well look not a not a memorial on a sandstone block or a seat or something but there 's always an opportunity for the gallery to have your family name there it is only for 10 years but then there 's a option to to renew that so i think rather than just saying no so well you know not not this one but maybe the other one so i 'm happy to support this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if i could just add as well um i guess in my first discussions with mr shannon and he has been sort of talking to us for quite some time i sort of underestimated some of those issues that would come out in those policy discussions so i think we do need to take that time to work through those okay thanks alicia council smith oh yeah thanks um mr may um yeah look i feel for the family i have been contacted by a relation of john and margaret oh no sorry of ross shannon and it appears that our council is the only one that hasn 't jumped on board i think they 've also approached other councils where they 've been associated with like isaac 's and central highlands i think and i appreciate that we need a policy otherwise it can get untidy like a lot of things but i really feel for the family and obviously they did have some connection to crescent lagoon which is was interesting reading but i just wanted to ask ask alicia with the recommendation this is pending further policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the policy is developed or will i have to reapply so back through the chair i would anticipate that the policy once it 's developed it will and and i um acknowledge what he 's saying is many other councils do have these type of policies and once you establish a policy it sort of says where those things can go and what sort of things we will look at um so once we do have those uh policy definition in place well then i can certainly go back to mr shannon and see whether he is still interested at that stage that was what i intended by the resolution it 's just i 'm not i wasn 't willing to recommend something um to sort of just get him through his time frames so could i suggest um alicia that send a letter after the after this decision just to say that we 're going through that process but um we 'll be yeah we 'll look at it just wondering does that need to be in the recommendation i don 't think so i think lisa we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make contact in the first in he emailed me just yesterday so i 'll get back to him thank you thank you very much alicia so council wickerson you 're happy to move uh do we have a second and councillor kirkland i 'll put that those in favor opposed motions carried unanimously thank you alicia moving on to 11.3 the tender consideration for rockhampton museum of art weekend event thanks john through the chair good morning councillors so we have a report here that seeks council 's approval for the tender consideration plan outlining the purchasing process that will be utilized for the coordination of the rockhampton museum of art opening weekend we recommend that pursuant to section 235b of the local government regulation 2012 council approved the tender consideration plan for the purchasing process that will be utilized for the coordination of the rock cancer museum of art opening weekend just in the commentary there you can see the museum of art will engage with our regional community and visitors across the opening weekend through programs that encourage participation and appreciation of visual arts providing access to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heritage of our region the opening event will communicate this and welcome community for a weekend of engaging experiences of art culture displaying various exhibitions highlighting many synergies to the exhibitions and programs offered at roma across the weekend so i think probably might need to read the rest for you all right thanks very much there is a real buzz around the community uh in anticipation of these uh this opening so great to see see the wheels in motion council rutherford um just a question if i could please mr mayor and that 's probably around um external activities that are being considered at the time is there many external activities outdoor activities being considered for the opening or is it through the chair yes we are considering those activities right now our new gallery director started yesterday so we 've got a range of contingencies on how we might utilize that and what we 're considering now is making sure i guess that the project of building this the campton museum of art is very important for what 's inside the gallery space but you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things might i guess for one of a better term bleed out just outside that so we 're certainly planning to meet some of that potentially within the courtyard behind the customs house also the e street link and then maybe potentially a little bit to the front of the rockhampton museum of art however we 're going to be very keen to make sure that any disruption that does occur across that weekend is quite minimal as far as closing the riverbank goes and and balance of sort of we have applied for some degrees of funding but also the division of the gallery director i think just making sure that we demonstrate beautifully i guess the statute the stature of this building the collection that we have within it but also demonstrate a little bit how these cultural institutions can help build that precinct field so we 're just trying to make sure we should fit the right balance there also considering we 're still waiting we 're pending the date so we 've got some plans that will move in shape yeah um thank you mr mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it 's a precinct um as well as the art gallery um so that 's great here but i 'd also like to um probably just a word of caution that time of the year is very hot and very very unpredictable um with weather so um just to be aware of that it 's not not a time where we can really confidently say that it 's going to be comfortable and all those things we 're taking into consideration and just thinking about um the budget situation of council we 're also really really mindful of how we can sort of hit the right level with everything that 's going on yeah so what we 've done in the safest manner that we can always thanks very much councillor and uh thanks john uh council wickerson the portfolio chair yep thanks mr mayor um just to congratulate staff on putting a a diverse program around because i think it 's important that this isn 't people have this perception about galleries and museums that they 're very high brow and i think even with our previous article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it 's the whole community 's uh gallery not just councils or the other the elite you know art people although they 're their owners as well um but just probably candid to that uh and i think it 's relevant i 've had chats this would be a good opportunity event wise to have a a very high level gala opening balls once in a lifetime opportunity such a prestigious uh facility uh and would also you think lend itself to some good fundraising opportunities with people that would really like to be there i know we chatted briefly yesterday i think at the night event with the governor and the professor whether they would like to come back up again apparently there 's some issues but be careful around that because a governor will trump up any other politicians about who custer ribbons have to be a little bit careful but i 'm sure they they express an interest of being there but um i just think this would attract a lot of people that are willing to pray pay a premium price to be there and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council brother had some ideas about guest speakers that might pull a crowd too so i 'm not sure whether we were in that uh in that level of discussion at this stage no no no through the chair what we 'll try and ensure not only describe the use of the building in the space but also ensure that we can hit the magic mark of having it feeling open and accessible to all of the public do have a special event which we 're planning to be around the gold award which is our established product and then also ensure that we have a more civic opening event an element for to meet the needs of our funders so all of those three things will try and hit all of them that 's the plan good thing thank you it 's great to have a plan thank you gotta start somewhere yeah now you 're right thanks john i 've just got another question yes sorry no problem thanks very much mr merger through you to john john once again this is uh great to see that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's lot of people looking forward to it and i think it 's great that we 're trying to make it a civic opening to to cover all aspects and demographics um but i 'm just very mindful that obviously this you know we 're spending rate pays money to um you know to fund this uh i understand that with yeah there 's money budgeted for it but you know as we do these events you know i 'd like to just sort of ask that you know quite often we don 't do a wash up after these events to sort of see you know as councils we go along to them we see how how they 're attended and that sort of stuff which is great but also like to have some sort of feedback after the event in regards to what the vendors that were there thought about it you know did they um was it worth their while um and also during this wash out it gives us a good opportunity to find out what we can do better and what we can change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see a report after the event if that 's okay yeah that may be something we need to run across the board uh council i think that 's something there that 's uh important in the decision-making and uh going forward so it 'd be great to see some feedback uh after a debrief about the impacts and uh benefits and disbenefits of the event so yeah yeah let 's work on that without a doubt that 'd be great mr um mr merits just once again we you know we we can make decisions that we 're making sure we 're being um you know making good use of the uh of the ratepayers money thank you thanks very much john uh goodbye secret mover councillor wickerson second uh councillor mathers i 'll put that those in favor emotions carried thank you councillors moving on to 11.4 the gold awards 2022 thanks very much dan thank you mayor councillors good morning uh just following on from the previous report in relation to the rockhampton museum of art the report before you this morning um relates to the processing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is due to be part of the opening of the new museum of art there in early 2022 the process um in terms of payment of the 50 000 prize monies for this prestigious award relates to the bequest that council received from the estate of the late moyer gold the trustees of the mervin and moya gold trust provide council with payment of those prize monies for which council then administers and awards to the winning artists so in order to comply with council 's procurement policy and procedure resolution is before you this morning for consideration to in effect put that in place but happy to take any questions thanks very much damon uh council wickerson as the chair i 'm missing just happy to move as as recommended thank you seconder councillor smith i 'll put that those in favor pose emotions carried thank you thanks very much damon and moving on to 11.5 i came to the museum of art long gallery commission thank you mayor councillors this report provides a summary and details in relation to the commission that has been proposed and organised for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coinciding with the official opening there in early 22 i 've tried to set out in the report the circumstances um relating to that particular commission um don 't propose to go over that in any great detail of course again if there are any questions happy to take thanks damon questions counsellors councillor smith oh yeah i 'd like to thank damon and uh whoever else was at the workshop for enlightening us i understand it a lot more now and i can understand that after a year or so we might be sick of looking at that painting i just wondered um if it then goes into our collection is that a photo of it or is it a small version of it that goes into our collection and is that included in the hundred thousand so as part of the commission that we receive will be essentially a schemer of instructions i can perhaps liken it to a manual of sorts that will have all the materials instructions and other documentation including photographs during the commissioning process and photographs of the completed work to be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that artwork to be reproduced uh either by rockhampton regional council or other institutions that may require that or request that collection item as alone i think i think we 're all going to become quite uh student artists in the future so um judging arts and what it all entails but uh no we 'll wait and see where that goes councillor wickerson and councillor kirkland uh thanks mr chair likewise just to thank daim and i did have some concerns going through this and um and thank you for addressing many of those and also i want to thank the general manager we 've had many robust and rigorous conversations about art in general and uh and i appreciate that process too but um i just wanted to take the opportunity to put on record that council 's committed to contractual arrangements made by previous gallery director and i think there might have been the art gallery trust not the philanthropy or just the timing of it uh which we 're sort of obliged to to follow otherwise there 's all sorts of other legal issues if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy about that but and that 's a discussion to be had still so but that said and given the uh ephemeral nature of it that we 've talked about diamond that um and the report doesn 't mention when that final stage of that ephemeral process will occur that just that when that is being considered whatever that time frame might be if that could come back to the table just for just a bit of a final sign off and it it may be shorter or longer or whatever but just to come back before that that final stage of the process occurs and council again that 's a good good point and uh yeah one that we we need to understand that it 's not a permanent permanent uh fixture and something that 'll be there for a time period and we just need to understand that when the new director is there he 'll uh no doubt bring a report back and um i 'm sure we 'll all look at that with interest so i wouldn 't mind if i could just to add that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don 't know how to word it appropriately but to bring back maybe a suggested date for that final stage of the uh of that particular commission because it does have an end point i didn 't initially i thought i was going to put a um a time stamp on it but i don 't want to do that as the general manager has pointed out that the new gallery director will have uh quite mammoth task of putting tasks for putting together a whole program for the gallery which may need that space so i don 't want to undermine that at all but uh i 'd like a bit of a heads up of when when that happens just for the potential uh community i 'm sure as the portfolio um chair it 'll be something that you 'll be involved in as we go through the process through the chair so just to respond to that one so where you will establish that is in the exhibition plan for the gallery going forward so we treat the long gallery just as the other galleries so council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to see how long that has ended intended from there so it will actually be as part of the program or exhibition program moving forward yeah this is probably an associated point and it 's again not not specifically to this one it 's about the process of it that i really applaud the philanthropy board that they engage really closely with the rumble people because this is a first nations uh peace uh and that 's great we should do that and it 's to avoid any cultural uh offense or or issues of moderation and absolutely applaud that but just thinking more broadly than that future the future acquisition process i would like to to explore that further and i don 't want to make any recommendations today because it would be very premature we haven 't had the discussion needed but just to look at that process whether we have the arts community and we have the uh the rumble community uh engaged to make sure we make the right decision but as representatives of the whole community um i think we need to have an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any means but just to have that other perspective and whether that 's a joint board that we come together a joint committee or something i don 't know but probably for discussion for down the track again i don 't want to offend the musician but it 's not about that at all it 's about broadening that engagement just to make sure that we 're making the best decisions in the public interest because it is a public gallery it 's not a private gallery thanks david did you want to respond to that yes through the chair council wickerson um as part of the process that we 've been working through is addressing the um in terms of moving forward the collection management plan in terms of council 's permanent collection and also governance and processes and policies around the acquisitioning and de-essentia sessioning of items of art and that is something that will obviously work with the new director alongside john and alicia and look to bring something to a future council workshop and then to the table for endorsement around what that might obviously look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving forward thanks very much damon thank you council wickerson councillor kirkland um thank you mr man it 's just probably just a comment really and i i thank you councillor wickerson for those requests i think that they they are great requests i applaud those and damon i look forward to hearing what those policies seeing how they are shaped and uh look forward to being a part of adopting those look i really just wanted to say that the uh philanthropy board have done a magnificent job in in getting that hundred thousand dollars in just five months from from the commencement uh of going out and looking for donations so i really wanted to say thank you to them for their hard work that was my comment today and congratulations to everyone involved thanks council kirkland councillor rutherford comment also mr mega as i i guess i 've been quite outspoken on this one in workshops and and and i 'd also like to acknowledge the philanthropy board and um in getting that money together um to pay it that said i 'm not sure i um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on something that is going to be painted painted over you know we 're talking about a hundred thousand dollars here that will be painted over in a period of you know what whatever is that 12 months or two years and i just don 't think that that is a good signal we should be sending to to our community so this is it we can 't we can 't change it it is what it is for now but certainly moving forward i would hope that money invested in artwork is money that remains an asset in our gallery and i i note that the instructions to repaint it will be handed on but you know someone could repaint the mona lisa but um you know this it 's certainly not going to be the mona lisa so you know the artwork is all about the artist um so i i don 't think that there 's that 's necessarily a sales pitch for me um in any case so um i 'm happy to support this but um not not happy in in how it happened no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those workshops and something there that we were uh i think we all share those same concerns uh but uh again uh understanding that the the this process has moved on without too much involvement for us but i think we move on now and make the most of what this this works going to be because i 'm sure our community is going to appreciate that as we take it forward um so that said i think we 've exhausted all the questions thanks very much for presenting the report damon i 'll seek a mover council wickerson secondary council of kirkland i 'll put that those in favor those opposed motions carried unanimously thank you moving on to planning and regulations 11.6 now who is against the latin with the conflict in this one uh good morning mary councils moving on to the plenty and rig part of the part of the day which we 've all been looking forward to i 'm sure uh the surrendered uh an unclaimed animal policy report where we workshopped it uh earlier earlier this year but the uh just in brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rspca as a animal uh agency to be entitled to the incentive to rehoming dolls of hundred dollars and catch at fifty dollars and also to change the way that we give the incentive money to the animal agencies instead of uh each agency filling out a form per animal when they re-home it what we 'd like to do is do it every six months just one form with all the animals make it easy if the agency make it easy for us and also cap that figure of a hundred dollars for a dollar and fifty dollars for a cat and give a percentage of of what 's in the budget uh that they 're the only changes to the to the report so good on you thanks very much doug uh portfolio councillor mathers thanks very much mr mayor um i 'd just like to say thanks very much to doug and his team for the work on this one mr mayor i think it 's really important that the rspca along with you know the the other uh animal protection groups uh that are involved i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more chances we 've got to re-home animals um so i thought it was very timely that um you 've made these changes and brought to the table doug so thanks very much and i 'm happy to move it okay thank you question counselor i know just to comment that i think that 's a good move doug with not having to process every single one i think that 's time consuming and a lot of red tape and that 's a really good good result what you 've come up with i 'm happy the second yeah thanks second council smith and thanks again doug and the team uh presenting that report uh it will be uh we 'll see but that that said uh i 'll put the motion those in favor oppose motions carried unanimously thank you council we 'll invite council election back into the room 11.7 no complex on this one thanks very much amanda thank you good morning mayor and councillors um the proposal the development application we received is for a proposal to convert an existing warehouse into a medium impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if i 've got this um that 's the location um it 'll be in the um in the first largest shed in the middle of the site the proposal includes the use of a wash bay along the western wall of the warehouse under an existing shelter unenclosed carport structure while two enclosed spray paint booths are proposed on the northern wall of the warehouse which will be internal internal to the building the existing footprint and the impervious site cover of the building and hearthstone areas will not be increasing as part of this development application and all vehicle repairs will take place within the existing building there 's a um just your site plan so the car parking external to the shed will just be used for parking purposes only there won 't be any repair work undertaken in that outside area and there 'll be as you can see the wash bay area outside which will be under as i said an enclosed structure and then the remaining of all the works will be undertaken in in the enclosed building the site is zoned low impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the zone the the low impact industry zone recognizes that medium impact industry uses may occur in the sign in the zone where the nature of the operations uh do not create any greater impacts than the low impact industry as stated in the planning scheme public notification um so there were seven properly made submissions including a petition of 44 people and one not properly made submitter i 've identified the location of the immediate submitters um obviously i couldn 't put all the submitters mapped on on the powerpoint presentation but this shows all the ones in the immediate surrounding area um all the other submission submitters are you know scattered throughout various areas of the region as outlined in my report i provide a summary addressing the concerns raised essentially the main concern was amenity impacts from from it being medium impact industry in a low impact industry zone specialist reporting have been has been provided which demonstrates proposed development will not generate adverse noise or odor air quality impacts that have potential to affect the amenity health and safety of the residents the proposed spray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be wholly conducted in a brand new insulated pre-fabricated spray booths which are designed and built to the minimum requirements and standards within the shed no spray painting will occur outside of these spray painting booths all vehicles will repe be repaired wholly within the warehouse no outdoor areas or hardstand areas will be used to repair the vehicles in addition the number of vehicle movements to and from the site is not unreasonable and for what is expected in an industrial zone in an um in it for an industrial use and industrial zone furthermore adequate um conditions have been placed on the approval to ensure the amenity is protected so if you look under the operating procedures heading in the conditions we 've conditioned hours of operation which are less than what um the scheme says we 've also conditioned just to cover ourselves as well that all vehicle repairs be carried out within the existing building no storage or parking or loading can occur in those common common property areas that are shared with the other industrial uses within the complex all tow trucks must enter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is a b double route we 've got nuisance monitoring conditioned on there plus we 've got some conditions on there if you look under surface coating and spray painting on um you know that about regarding the spray booths um that they have to be constructed to australian standards and a certificate certificate of the spray painting booth must be built and installed in accordance with those standards and provided to council prior to the commencement of the use as the proposed proposal generally complies with the provisions included in the codes and the planning scheme and we 're recommending it for approval subject to the conditions outlined in the um recommendation that 's it any questions thanks very much amanda questions counselors counsellors rutherford thanks mr amanda the um spray paid panel beading uh business is that zoned or is that considered medium impact industry or light it it is considered through the charity is considered as medium impact industry because of the spray painting component of it okay so then why and you pick the very sentence that i picked out as well so if if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we saying that its nature is low impact yeah because it 's different through the chair because there 's different degrees of industrial uses that provide additional impacts the scheme does allow medium impact to occur in a low impact zone when it can demonstrate that those impacts are going to be of a similar nature so in this instance for example spray painting they 're doing it within an enclosed spray proof in an enclosed building to begin with so the impacts are minimal if you compare that to for example a mining site that has all this mining equipment that operate 24 hours that do spray painting and all other additional activities in relation to repairs on that mining equipment and as i said they as they normally operate 24 hours um versus this business and their traffic generation possibly could be be higher um that will have a lot more impacts than someone who 's doing some spray painting in a in a booth in an enclosed shed um that 's only operating within the hours specified in in those conditions there so impacts are quite minimal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um so they put the type of categories of uses within the low medium and high but as i said you may even have some high impact industry uses that their impacts can be mitigated to a point where they have similar impacts to mediums so it happens across the board and that 's why the scheme keeps it quite open there that we can each application is assessed on its own merits and we have that ability to approve it if we think those impacts are minimal thanks amanda thanks mr me thanks thanks amanda thanks again for councillor smith oh yeah just um with the proposal in detail uh amanda yeah it mentions um uh two air vent stacks will be located on the western side of the roof now they too let the air in or take take um excess paint out or mostly i 'm not very up to date with spraying boots but um they will be probably most likely both i would assume but we have had air quality testing um reporting has been done on what will be um if there will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back that there won 't be anything and there was no mitigation um measures recommended and the spray booths are obviously designed in accordance with australian standards and to ensure that there won 't be any environmental impacts from from from the um booths yeah thanks just to be just a comment you know it 's always a it 's always there 's always going to be um queries when we do industrial that back on to residential and we 've got it everywhere just another one thanks mr mr chair why do they need to drop off cars on a sunday uh seeing it 's a residential area people like peace and quiet on a sunday so why can 't they leave them till monday morning why does it have to be done on a sunday i think you find the nature of their work is that there if there is a car accident for example those vehicles um the tow trucks need somewhere to take them so they won 't be actually undertaking um any panel beading or spray painting on those days it 'll be just purely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has collected the vehicle um it will go straight to that site to yeah leave it basically in the car parking area there so how do we know they 're not going to just through the chair how do we know they 're not going to be transferring cars from their southside depot or whatever on a sunday like is it only when there 's an accident and how can we strengthen that up so that it 's only you said it 's intermittent gonna be intermittent but how can that be policed well we have condition that they 're not to be operating on sunday um [Music] so if there was any i suppose increase in activity on the site we could cover that under that condition if we thought that they were um unreasonably entering and exit the site in in a manner that um concluded that the activity was actually um the use was occurring am android i highlighted the same same area and i just curious to find out the hours of operation on the sunday you stayed at sporadic and and um irregular uh could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sometimes around that or well i 'm not sure what the times are for the sunday and it 'll be you know a truck beeping in and reversing early on a sunday morning or late on a sunday evening i 'm just not sure what the hours of operation would be on a sunday uh yeah if they were we 're just dropping off a smash smash big i think i think for the proposed use that may um cause some issues because those if an accident happens you can 't predict what time a vehicle accident is going to happen and then they 've got to drop the vehicle off somewhere and we don 't want vehicles stored you know in random places throughout the region so at least there 's an allocated place to take them we 've also got a highlight to and and realize alexander street is a b double route with 10 000 vehicles that go through that site of um a day as well so um they will only those tow trucks will only be entering from alexander street um and coming in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of operation on the sunday though it could be we haven 't got any hours we got no operations on sunday um they said they would just as i said they won 't be operating as such they would just be coming in and dropping those those vehicles off um whether they can drop those vehicles off at a different location but it 's very difficult if they did drop it off at their another another site they still then on monday morning got to transport those those cars from that site in and that means another another move you know tow truck mr mayor i 'd like to further query that because when you have a and i 've had a few prangs probably in my life some of them not my fault you 've got to do the claim first your insurance company then tells you where your car 's going to go so if you have an accident on the weekend i 'm just trying to understand how they would know to drop them off at that um place to repair it because um you know you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurance company will tell you where to take it and on a sunday on a you know weekend they don 't work so i 'm just trying to understand um how they would know to drop it off there because because of um you know dealing with insurance companies no i don 't think you can put that to the application council i think that 's a insurance business side of it where it 's not part of the uh the planning process so i 've just got one more mr mess sorry to take up all the time uh my favorite thing with industrial is landscaping and i know you 've said that this refer to the landscaping plan but it doesn 't give us an example can i please see where we 're going to have landscaping yes especially with the existing landscaping on the site i don 't know whether it be very clear on the first saw little things that look like three round trees i was thinking though it might have been trees but i 'm not really sure yeah it 's probably sorry that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go for a second site inspection this morning um as well to have a drive by um but there is landscaping where that tree is on in the middle there basically there is a little landscaping along the front bed it 's quite difficult with this site because if you see um where the tree is that 's within their property it 's all hearts down it 's a hard stand area which is already established plus the access road in where you 've got the landscaping um yeah the landscaping on the other side of the the site that is all within common property so that 's owned by the body corporate and has to be maintained by the i would assume by the body corporate um because it 's all those sheds within that vicinity and within that same complex so the only um that landscaping we don 't have much ability to increase increase that because that 's you know to do with the whole complex as a whole as i said they have got some landscaping internal to their lot boundaries which is all along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't actually be able to get it 'd be where the car parking area is in and they 're required through that access road to turn into the car parks obviously there 's no ability to put landscaping in front of that okay so the site is a little bit restricted on how much additional landscaping we can provide so up the top there that 's body corporate yes so what about you see that light white line um around the shed yeah it 's probably not so the whole access strip does that work i 've tried to hang on maybe the on button would help you got a flash there we go so see that white that 's a boundary there and along there so all this area here all this um landscaping area all that is um body like common property in that little island of landscaping that 's all within the common common property which is part of this building here in this building here oh okay so just through the t so common property for that industrial blockchain yeah okay so there 's no landscaping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in thomas and street no there 's already there is some grassed area um but yeah no i wouldn 't call it substantial landscaping um there is a tree and there 's garden beds basically from about here that go sort of around that front area there internal to their site that 's the only landscaping they got internal to their site all the other landscaping is within the common property and as i said it 's quite difficult because their site is already established and it 's all hard standard already so they 'd literally have to dig up and remove car parts and considering the site isn 't fronting um the street as well um we believe that there 's sufficient landscaping along and buffer along that boundary there um because it 's set back quite a bit from the building yeah okay there 's one more question yeah is there a fence already along the back of thomason street yeah from memory i did as i said i did go out this morning but yeah i don 't think it 's a um solid solid fence but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mr may yes um i do have a couple of questions for you amanda the firstly i noted that you mentioned earlier that the zoning needed to demonstrate businesses of a similar nature uh would you mind telling us the nature of the businesses surrounding this particular application yeah um so the we 've got a gym a hardware hardware well not hardware sorry warehouse and then there 's um i think there was an auction place i 'm not sure what 's occurring through here but there has been previously like a um it was industrial but had sort of like a commercial commercial nature to it as well operating from that and then over in these other um other sites at the rear of this site there 's probably a mix of low and medium impact industry there because you had um obviously backs off on two sites like james jim kelly that were obviously they 're not operating at the moment but they had a range of industrial activities occurring there yeah i think probably my concerns are more around that that entire 57 alexandra street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residents more so that that those businesses that are surrounding in fact do demonstrate are businesses of a similar nature and it sounds to me by some of those businesses being retail and and storage and a gym probably don 't they 're not consistent with that that 's my question around you know observation and clearly it 's your call on that but i also wanted to ask you about the the same thing as mayor and um and council smith have mentioned the trucks coming in at 7 30 in the morning beeping and with their raising their trays and letting trucks letting vehicles off on a sunday i would consider given the business types and everything that are there those residents are now going to be exposed to something that they 've not been exposed to before and i don 't i actually question whether that is consistent and i 'd like to ask whether there 's a gate on the entrance from thomason street that 's going to prevent trucks from going through that way it would potentially be i don 't know another access point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their choice to go through that way and again disturbing those residents that previously have not been exposed to to this type of disturbance i also note that the conduct you know conducting the business is going to be from 7 30 in the morning every single day which is is concerning as well i 'm again i 'm not 100 convinced that this is a consistent business another observation that i 'd like to note is that i 've been out there and have had a look at what the other businesses are and i 've also had a look at um the the fact that the applicants have already fully fit out the the business with signage and everything else is that normal when we haven 't seen the the application come before council for the actual business is that is that how things actually are meant to happen is that yeah it normally happens through the chair it 's not ideal obviously we prefer people to get their land use approval before they undertake you know i 've been out on site they 've painted it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does happen when businesses are under you know time constraints when they 're you know opening or um moving their businesses to different locations at this stage there 's nothing council can do about it because they 've submitted an application for their land use approval so this does happen a fair bit where we even if previously we 've taken compliance action once they submit an application there 's nothing we can do until that application 's decided um so yeah it does unfortunately happen um as far as your other questions i 'll just make sure i 've covered them all um with the hours of operation um we 've also got conditions on there regarding nuisance monitoring so if there are any complaints with the residents they do have to put some mitigation measures in place if we do find that there are any issues also a lot of the businesses around there would assume i don 't exactly know the operation of the gym but they 're um this morning when i i drove in there all the businesses were seem to be operating so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operating if not the same hours but more than what this facility is proposing and i suppose in low impact industry zones you can get a range of activity so i 'm not looking at this just just what 's in this small vicinity i 'm looking at what is low impact industry as a whole throughout the region and what the scheme specifies as low impact industry and what impacts i suppose determine whether it 's medium or high as well so we look at traffic generation for example that site if that was a warehouse with a floor area of that size would generate the engineers have reviewed it probably almost double the amount of vehicle trips per day than what 's currently or what 's proposed there now so okay um if i may thank you thank you mr may um well that 's concerning as well in the event that they potentially will exceed what they 've suggested they 're going to be doing potentially um through the chair they can 't they 've got no room if you have a look at the floor um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is there another one or maybe i 'll remove that one sorry there was one with the floor pen but in internal to the site there 's obviously bays where they 're working on the vehicles there 's nowhere i 'd suppose to expand outside of that shed because there 's no room but as i said their vehicle trips are probably less than half of what a warehouse so under that zoning at the moment it 's zoned low impact industry a warehouse um can go or had existing use rights for a warehouse to begin with so warehouse could go in there tomorrow without even coming to council and with that floor space as i said it 's it 's approximately double the amount of vehicle trips or over double the amount of vehicle trips that this use would propose and as i said there 's nowhere for this use to expand because it 's all internal to this it 's very i understand it 's a very large shed but everything 's happening within that shed it 's physically impossible for them to do more than what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all maneuvering um has to happen within their lot um they can 't let it over spill into that common property so that that means there should be no impact for those um nearby businesses within that complex my other question was around those car parks whether those car parks are for customers or whether they 're for the wrecks they 're going to be towed in on the trucks and whether the whole thing 's going to be surrounded by wrecks or whether they 're all enclosed inside the the actual facility out of sight i don 't know how that work i don 't know how they could do that and further to that wall i 've got the mic uh the the uh have the applicants actually applied for this facility in another area that 's uh medium impact industrial have these particular yeah through the chair um i 'm not sure whether they have i don 't i 'm not familiar whether they 've applied any anywhere else and um with the car parking so the car parking will be a mix it will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car parking will be utilized for staff there will be vehicles that need repair work or mechanical work parked in there that they will rotate and drive into the shed and and as i said all that works will be undertaken within the shed and the shed is a very it 's um probably a bit whether i 'm sure you 've been out on site but it 's very big shed and the floor space in there um fits several i 've sort of done a rough account of the amount of vehicle spaces and there 's there 's a look to be about 40 you know there 's quite a lot of space in there for them to undertake the work so okay um mr mayor i do have my one last question thank you so much for indulging me um the the the conditions that you 've put on this um how do we monitor that do we wait for complaints or before going out and double checking that they 're adhering to all of the things that you 've said or is there a follow-up check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a as you 'll be aware a compliance section so they do once we approve an application and we 're aware the use has commenced they will do a compliance inspection on the site and go through the conditions some of these conditions are they sit these conditions sit against that land forever and just because one day they 're complying you know if there is any issues down the track then we would send compliance out and and um go through that process if there is any issues but they would definitely do an audit of those conditions once the use commences and then if there 's any we 've got those conditions against that property basically for the life of the youth and if there is any issues rage raised in the future um then with those conditions there we can take enforcement action if need be thank you for answering my questions thanks mr mick thanks councillor kirkland council rutherford dumb question please mr may and that 's because unlike councillor smith i try to not crash my vehicles but um so once a vehicle has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and takes it to this this place so what happens if that 's in the middle of the night yeah i suppose if there is any issues with with complaints in that regard we got the noise monitoring condition in there yeah so but but we do got to remember remember alex they 'll only be entering from alexander street and those um and it 's there 's quite a big um buffer like there 's quite a big setback from those houses in is it thomason street um and alexander street has b double um it 's a b double root so it 's as i said about ten thousand ten thousand vehicle trips yep um there a day my concern is my experience has been it 's not there 's lots of places that have traffic noise and people tend to learn it 's a constant and they learn to live with it reversing beepers however are a totally different thing particularly when it 's in the middle of the night or in the early hours of the morning so and generally by the time these businesses are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is living nearby to have anything changed um you know anyone that 's been at this table for any length of time will tell you how difficult it is to deal with some of those things so i i get i get the proposal i get everything else um and i could live with everything else yeah i don 't know if i can live with the times being 24 hours and i think the point council smith was trying to make is that if you have to wait to choose where you 're going to send your vehicle once it 's been crashed why why does it have to go to that site there and then in the middle of the night yeah through the chair the way we 've conditioned it we 've we haven 't allowed them 24 hours operation they they review these conditions knowing fully well that we 've only conditioned those hours and that they may have tow trucks entering the site after those hours they 've got there 's probably a small element of risk on them if if there are complaints and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we could restrict those movements if there was complaints made and there was noise impacts from from that so we have got the ability with the conditions to mitigate that if there is any issues in the future and the way they explain to me i think it 's that rare as as it was pointed out normally with the insurance companies i you know you normally just don 't randomly drop them there i don 't think it 'd be a regular occasion that it would be occurring um that they weren 't concerned that we had those hours of condition like those conditions they actually um asked to have those hours reduced down so just in goodwill for the for the submissions so i i would have to ask if it 's that rare boy then can they not yeah why do they need it i think it 's for through the chair i feel for their operations i suppose i 'm talking a little bit on their behalf but from discussions i 've had with the applicant for their operations the the instances as i said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vehicles i mean we can restrict it we could put something on there to restrict it but i feel they 're likely to come back and negotiate on that but we can see what they come back with but yeah uh do you think again rather than any questions or you still um no i i think that 's it mr mayor i don 't know whether what our options are to discuss about the restriction the restricting of those hours and whether you know there 's some discussion that could be had there and and that the table would be more comfortable um with that i believe with the conditions we got on place that they 're going to be adequate to cover because we 've got noise nuisance monitoring conditions on there plus we 've restricted their hours of operation so i think there 's enough on there if it became a big issue that we 've got enough condition there that we could go down the compliance avenue for it sorry i 'm a little confused so we we have hours of operation but we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they said it 's so rare that they 're going to be randomly as i said on the odd occasion dropping off someone after dropping some vehicles off after hours i suppose the activity itself isn 't taking place but because it 's associated with that use as i said if we got any complaints about noise noise or issues with that because we got that nuisance monitoring condition on there one of the mitigation measures would have to be to cease the time that they 're um dropping or could be the time that they drop those vehicles off so we have got conditions so the place to cover it yeah there 's a clause there to basically say if there are complaints that come through we can we can put some mitigation and they 've got to come up with the mitigation method measures um but simply if it is from if the noise and nuisance is from the tow trucks the only way to mitigate it 's not as though if it was noise from the use occurring they could shut their roller door and and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mitigate against that would to be actually not enter the site within that within that time yeah so we have got that condition on there to cover those instances and that may be park offsite somewhere else until yeah and that could be uh could be an option if that those complaints come in is that clause in there um no all the clauses in there about the the nuisance yeah monitoring if they if they breach that is that clause already in there now that that will be what happens the consequences no but um we 've left it fairly open because of we just talk about mitigation measures what those measures are we don 't identify but that also we 've got to remember that that news monitoring condition also covers the activity itself as well so if there 's a complaint about not something in regard to the tow trucks that the mitigation method measures may be different so we keep that open and then we can um obviously um if the complaint occurs we would deal with it then councilman thanks very much mr mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mayor it 's um it just shows you how important the team that angus 's team is uh doing ins as in regards to town planning moving forward you know it 's we can 't unwind you know having industrial uh areas you know that are backing onto residents but i think it 's um crucial that we make sure that you know our town planners are not doing the same thing moving forward and i 'm sure they 're a great team so i 'm sure we won 't be dealing with that but that 's that 's the nature of the business that we 've got here with rockhampton and the way it 's set up at the moment but we 've got to be mindful of you know doing the right thing by the the residential neighbours and the and the um commercial neighbors say um as well it 's concerning to me that the applicant has gone in and already started setting up but we can 't do too much about that because it 's it doesn 't stop them from um it doesn 't stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tow trucks i 'm not an expert in the in the automotive industry at all but i have got quite a uh quite a lengthy uh experience in it uh under normal circumstances most of the tow to my knowledge most of tow truck operators have a holding yard so if they go to an accident you know menses for instance is on elfingstone street there 's a few different places generally they have a holding yard so if a car is picked up from from an accident the car is taken to a holding yard and then the insurance company works out where it goes and then it gets tow truck from there to whatever the panel shop is that 's going to do the repairs so i would think that the movements that we 're talking about here should be very minimal but because they are minimal maybe it is something that we can talk to them about restricting you know the hours of um tow truck use if it wasn 't on a sunday not early or not late at night or something like that because to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running their own tow trucks most of the contract tow truck drivers around town do it and they 've got their own holding yards so it 's something that we um you know that that we may be able to talk to the to the applicant about yeah i think that 's a process one if those complaints come in and if they 're generated then uh options to look at the mitigation of that that issue from there is it 's clearly in the the approval that we 're able to um to move on that councillors and then councillor smith yeah thanks mr mayor i was just going to say basically exactly the same as council mother said that these tow truck operators do have holding us the ones that i know of anyway because the other problem is if they drop say an expensive vehicle off in the middle of the night and there 's no one there to receive it uh whose responsibility if someone comes and takes the mag wheels off it or worse you know so i think that that wouldn 't happen that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare occasion but if it is that rare the impact if we put the restrictions on now about the delivery of those vehicles in the middle of before we get complaints i 'll be more comfortable with that i mean if it is that rare it 's not it 's not going to impact their business usually and then it 's up to the tow truck operators to hold the car as we talked about earlier in the debate that you know they probably wouldn 't know where they 're going to take it anyway so i don 't understand why they would be dropping it off but if it is that rare why not put the restriction in there with the conditions before it becomes a problem because there might be someone sitting back and they never complain but they just put up with it and we 'll look after those concerns too so and then if we we do put in the conditions that might force the debate with the with the people lodging the submission and we 'll thrash it out then rather than wait for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deal with it retrospectively i think you know there 's some come up before with car washes and things with lights in windows and it 's always messy to try and come back later on after the fact and do it but we get ahead of that first amanda you mentioned before that that may not be acceptable or through the chair yeah i i mean it 's hard i i can 't speak on behalf of of the applicant but as i said discussions i 've had with them um and the way we 've conditioned it i think there we 've conditioned we 've done a risk assessment of it and and how to look at it from what we think the impacts would do and we we feel that the conditions do cover do cover it um they as i said they 're at more risk because we we could simply just say these are your operating hours no you know um no tow trucks potentially if we we are um attached that to the land use they weren 't they weren 't as i said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that they could enter the site after hours to to drop off because they know that it 's not going to be that regularly and obviously they don 't think there 's going to be any impacts to the surrounding residents um but yeah as i said i can 't really speak on their behalf and what how you know what their operations and and whether how much that will impact their operations um but it seemed to be something that that wasn 't going to be regular and they didn 't as i said they didn 't have concerns with why we 've conditioned it so they had ability to negotiate on those conditions or get them amended prior to coming to this council meeting and they didn 't yeah they were quite happy with what was proposed councillor smith um yes so thanks mr chair amanda i 'm trying to understand um condition 8.5 so unless people who have a complaint contact counsellors how do we know how many people have contacted general enquiries to complain about um a nuisance noise etc so you 're saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months so they can keep going you know annoying the neighbours for three months before it 's investigated and then it comes to council in 14 days well we i 've never seen one of those reports ever no i think yesterday yeah through the chair yeah to be honest we don 't um we put that condition on there in these instances to to safeguard us you 've got to remember a noise report 's also been provided for the proposal and there wasn 't any suggested mitigation measures in that that is the three months is if there 's a one one-off occasion where they make some noise it 's probably unreasonable um you know the noise has to be a continued issue so it 's over a period of time um and then they 've got to submit it to council there 's i don 't remember us ever needing to use or take action on on those conditions it doesn 't happen very often because in most cases they have provided noise reports and then we have assessed the impacts that 's just an additional safeguard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unexpected um circumstance where there is is some issues with the proposal thanks amanda councillor i think we 've exhausted all the questions there and uh thanks very much amanda for answering that um counselors on neo uh [Music] with regards to the officer 's recommendation could i have a mover move cancel election seconder councillor mathers put that those in favor those opposed emotion is lost it 's a rep cancelled yep you will have to have reasons there um that 'll have to be placed on record um they 'll actually be planning reasons as well mm-hmm um whether we need to record who voted in favor here that 'll you don 't have to you could be emotions lost but the council will have to determine the reasons why uh he went against the officer 's recommendation and for the refusal it might be time to adjourn this yes we might we will need to do that the motion has been lost counsellors are mindful of the time we might uh call for an adjournment and uh come back at 22 11 if that 's okay uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie or i 'll move i 'll move and we will be taking the german for 15 minutes put that those in favor thank you [Music] do [Music] [Music] [Music] now that we 've

recommendation that it be approved with the additional condition being inserted into 8.1.3 the condition is that any movement of delivery vehicles must be restricted to operating hours as per condition 8.1 seeking a second up so should we just mean okay adding an additional item there to 8.8 the movement of delivery vehicles must be restricted to the operating hours as per condition 8.1 uh happy to move secret seconder uh second councillor wickerson can i speak to it if i may thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done all due diligence and certainly put together a very uh tightly conditioned response to the applicants and that there are measures that are now in place that will mitigate any of the breaches of the conditions and i congratulate the officers and i have absolute respect for the officers and their legal knowledge around all of this space and certainly where we stand with the planning regulations and so with that i 'm happy to move and move forward with this additional condition that sched said no other speakers i 'll put the motion those in favor pose motions carried thank you councillors unanimously we move on infrastructure 11.8 capital projects report for

and the alliance just looking at the list yeah it 's the second one on the list the alliance and maintenance facility as part of the project peter yep okay okay thank you morning mayor councillors um this is the capital project report from project delivery for october um i 'm not going to go through individual projects i 'll let you ask questions the important point at the moment is capital expenditure is quite low but we will adjust the budget to reflect the program over the next month or so so um a number of the capital expenditures will have to be moved the next financial year i 'm happy to take questions there is only one project that i 'm going would like to talk about and that is the cultural precinct activation works but to talk about that we would need to go into confidential so if counselors there 's no other questions to any of the other projects that are there we 're asking to move into closed session with regards to that uh project so just um i don 't see any lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or that we move into close sessions i just need to avoid it we 've been having some ongoing discussions with you joining property owners so this is the background for the reasons for taking into close no we 're not closed session yet so this is the summary of the reasons why we 're going into closed session is that we 've been having ongoing discussions with the adjoining property owners of that it joins our property down in each street the discussion that we 're likely to have will potentially cause prejudice to the interest of council and also we are providing some legal advice on the way through there mr mayor so it 's proposed that you close the this session of all this part of the council meeting under section i 've got to remember the new ones uh 254 j 3 e and g of the regulations and from that so if you want to do that match you need a motion for that one okay happy to do that could i seek a move in a second with removing the closed discussion move council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need a second motion to go into closed session put the first one those in favor propose motions carried unanimously uh i 'm happy to move that we move into

unanimously thank you two items report the alliance and now morgan 's supporter thank you peter so the two items were alliance wasn 't it yep so alliance um we are waiting for a funding agreement to be signed so there 's a contractor that 's been selected by alliance but we can 't move at the moment until we get a signed funding agreement that 's where it sits ross isn 't it federal yes sorry peter what was the update on that one it 's a federal government uh the 25 million so if you see the report i 've got 25 million pending so that 's why it 's that has to be signed off by the government and ourselves and it 's taking a little bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they 're not the most responsive times are they peter 's there um if there 's election and caretakers and all that sort of thing involved in that if the agreements haven 't been signed by both parties normally they go into a bit of a park and what we found mr mayor is that sometimes they never proceed after an election yeah all right thank you peter and the next project is mount morgan water so that project is has been kicked off um and we 've engaged ecom to undertake the work i 'm hoping that we get an initial report of some form where is it here i 've got 17th of december so depending on the state of that report i may just email that out for information and we 'll talk about it in the following year but the whole project is aimed to be finished by the 15th of april so it 's a very rapid project and they are uh they 've got a lot of resources in in on at the moment okay okay thank you peter no questions to any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project monthly reports the alliance maintenance facility and the morgan motor security be received uh i 'm happy to move seeker seconder council of kirkland i 'll put that those in favor propose motions carried unanimously thank you we invite councillor smith back into the room please oh ok uh smith you may have just warmed the seat for a split second because we move on to the airport precinct feasibility study project so um i think you 've declared a conflict in this one thank you sorry that was uh my bad building up the ten thousand steps thank you very much peter our flux yesterday um i went and checked we will be getting a report and it 's probably prior to the 16th of february so early next year which will contain the number of properties affected you know the levels and potential for both options so we will have our information we 'll also have the information relating to the cost to construct either of those options as well so we should have i hope all the information early next year okay council brother um just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great to hear so thank you for following that up mm-hmm thank you councillor wickerson thanks mr smith just to clarify for you to pay that 's pre-ring road calculations or and that was a bit of a flinching game but um that will be on the assumption the ring road is constructed is constructed okay because it 's it 's ahead of us yeah early when we were doing this there was a bit of tewing and growing but it will thank you thank you okay thank you no further questions in regards to that report officer report i 'll seek a move in a second move cancer rutherford second and councillor mothers i 'll put that those in favor opposed motions carried unanimously thank you councillors moving on to eleven point ten sorry um councillor smith and she just doesn 't have a conflict in this one we hope tender consideration plan for the completion of the glenball water treatment plant solar farm project and we 'll go to you with this one thank you peter okay uh so this is a tender consideration plan for the completion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um it 's uh looking at taking the opportunity to use the existing contractor on site alliance automation there is some potential savings and synergy by using this company as i 've said yesterday and previously a full report on what we can get as a solution and the amount of solar power will be reported to council prior to going forward thank you peter i think we had some questions councillor wickerson thanks man i threw you to peter just to clarify again have we had any conversations with this potential tenderer about use of any pre-existing equipment and do we know whether i think where there 's some i 'm going to suggest we go into complementary again um okay we might take that offline then that 's interesting okay um cancer there are some sensitivities around this one and just uh if we need to we may require if the questions uh become in that space we may need to move into closed session but uh being mindful of that we don 't want to jeopardise the council in any way so if there are further questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy to move that we received the recommendation seek a second councillor wickerson i 'll put that those in favor propose emotions carried thank you peter moving on to budget governance and other matters at 11.11 is it current grant programs and projects recommendations martin crowe or peter building our regions with peter online uh martin online sorry yeah i believe in davies will be taking the lead on this okay we might um would you like to speak to the report please uh thanks very much uh thank you um mr mayor and counselors um yeah the report that i 'm putting forward is just to for your information about a number of grant programs that have um recently been announced and the projects that have been identified uh to seek funding underneath each of those programs the uh i 'll just run through them uh quickly that the grant programs and the recommended programs and that 's the building our regions grant which will we 're proposing to fund a portion of the north rocky sewage treatment plant uh which covers uh its detailed and report what parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million dollars in funding um with uh the 10 million dollars to be made up by our contribution at this point the the grant is at an eoi stage so we put in an expression of interest we find out if we 're successful and then we put in a detailed application the next grant is the preparing australian communities program which is to fund i guess a disaster mitigation programs and uh underneath this program there are three i guess types of uh disasters natural disasters that that could be funded um and we are eligible for um only two of those which are uh are um cyclones and um uh not bushfire however um and then uh the other and the the project that we 're putting forward for that is the grace near um both water supply security which is to increase the amount of available water um at that location um uh then the other um grant program the next one is the uh one that is another round of the heavy vehicle safety and productivity program and the bridges renewal program uh there are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the report that are being put forward for funding um they all have uh budget allocation so far so we 're seeking the maximum allowed underneath the program for funding for those the next grant program is the north queensland disaster mitigation program and uh that will cover either um planning or uh or construction projects as well um and the we 've got a number of priority projects that have been identified which include moore 's creek catchment and south rockhampton catchment floodplain risk management studies and the climate risk planning for rockhampton region and then the final grant program is the cq bushfire 's flexible funding which is another one that around us come around and this is for funding a community education disaster management officer we 're seeking 100 of the grant funding for that um and that position would um undertake a number of community engagement and education programs so those are the the projects that we have associated with each of those grant programs okay uh thanks alison uh and sorry uh would there be any questions there councillor smith oh yeah just um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ didn 't we get didn 't we apply for a similar thing in another grant program not long ago yeah there 's another application i think that 's uh that 's out there as well that 's correct dean yes that 's right um this the another round has come around rather quickly for this particular grant program which probably makes it seem like we 've we 're there again so yes yeah so this um funding is for bushfires only and um but that person will work hand in hand with the employee the staff member we 've already got in disaster like how does that work in with um through through liz in the uh the disaster space i think that would actually be a continuation of the work that 's currently being done by that officer would enable us to extend that that appointment and uh continue that work thanks martin okay thank you sorry cancel that you might lose that uh that light in the division but uh apologies for that let 's cancel election thanks mr mayor and three years through to ann i just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the wandel walking network plan where about roughly would be located is it around the showgrounds or um i might refer to um to martin for that but i can just tell you a little bit about uh how we arrived at that particular location in that the the grant program funds um the development of a working a walking network program plan which must be uh based around certain identified centers and they 're quite explicit about the type of center that that needs to be built around which some of those include schools um uh cbd transportation and whatnot so um one of the things that we in in talking with uh stuart and aaron and others uh about what would be the most beneficial area for this um it has to be within a two two kilometer radius of that center uh and it was felt that going through this exercise would actually provide counsel with a lot of information that could be used uh over a number of projects that are related to that area but also the process of developing that network uh plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for other particular kinds of projects but i 'll go i 'll defer it now to martin to go specifically about the wandel area then think i suppose um through the chair the primary destination we 've we 've picked there is actually the hall state school hall state primary school um we had a number of choices there we could have we could have based around the uh the rocky high state school uh the wandel sort of uh commercial area the showgrounds but just by location wise the hall using a two kilometer radius from that particular point picks up a lot more secondary destinations including parts of the cbd hospitals uh a lot of the other schools um and sporting precincts and the like so in some ways this is a real isla program these planning guidelines have only very recently come out we haven 't used them before we 've sort of considered you know wandel 's probably the area that has the least footpath network at this point in time and and the least planning so doing this as a pilot for that area seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a good process using these state guidelines are really using a gis based tool to try and pick up the preferred route selections if it proves to be a really good process and we would run that across the rest of the urban areas that 's that 's the strategy at this point in time secondary question um i guess there 's obviously a lot of different uh areas within the rockhampton region that would have qualified i 've read the guidelines quite specifically and uh and just i guess my suggestion would have been given the amount of work that 's been done around stockland in north rockhampton um the missing link near the north rockhampton cemetery would have been an ideal one which we 've ticked the box on all of these ones on the criteria i 'm just surprised it wasn 't considered or was it considered i think we looked at a number of different through the search right sorry uh council action white i think we looked at a number of different areas and i believe that planning isn 't already in place for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what drew us more to the wandel precinct is that we weren 't as advanced in our planning for that area and it was probably the area that has the least footpath or existing footpath network so we thought we 'd get the most benefit out of doing some planning work for that area rather than some of those other areas of of uh of the city including north rocky where where we have in the past i suppose done a reasonable amount of planning around that so that 's not to say we 're going to go we won 't go back and use this process to to redo those areas that 's i suppose why we want to do pilot i suppose in the wonder precinct and see how beneficial it would be to running out across the remainder of the urban areas that 's okay thank you i just need to get a bit of an understanding of why it was selected and if it wasn 't done and identified as a missing link or a pathway in the next couple of years then and i understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i got a bit of a question but i feel almost a little greedy asking for it and it 's about to the north rocky sewage treatment plant upgrade works um and if we 're going for a bucket of money that only gives us 2 million of the 12 million cost of the project and generally once we start a project you can 't get additional funding so i guess my question is is this the best bucket for us to be i think we 're looking for a number of buckets and i 'm not sure whether one one bucket will be uh sufficient i 'll let peter clarify i wish the two was 20 or 200 but um this program that 's the maxim you can ask for right it 's specifically for water and sewer projects and we have picked i should have checked the words before i jumped up we have picked a piece that we can compartmentalize so we won 't be restricted by applying for other grants because the project has started if that makes sense yeah i got that from the report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most we can possibly hope for is 2 million out of that 12 million um so i guess if that 's the best we can do that 's the best we can do i always just hoping maybe for something a bit more i agree yeah a lot more anyway council election thanks mr mayor just that comment just with all these different grants out there i was just surprised especially leading up to olympics in the future that there wasn 't a sport and rec grant that had been applied forward to upgrade lightings on the sporting fields at the council facilities uh is that something that should be a bit more of a priority in future and this is evan here i don 't think we 've had any come through of life have we for olympics or sports funding no uh uh there was a uh a lighting one that uh we were considering however um looking at the ability to fit within the constraints of that particular grant we weren 't able to get an application that would have satisfied the requirements of the grant itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people the queensland um government sport and rec people and um they 're aware of of our needs and um we 're working very very closely with them so as these particular funding things come up we we make sure that we put forward an application that is likely to be considered and this time around what we what we had just was not able to meet the the requirements thank you thank you and i think we 've uh as we move on to our next generation there 's a project in there that we 're still working on uh that we need a little bit more detail um to be able to progress that and i 'm sure there 's opportunities uh going forward rather than this round that we will be looking to uh to seek that sporting uh funding okay councillor there 's no further questions to that report could i seek a mover in a second to adopt that move councillor kirkland second and councillor smith i 'll put that those in favor promotions carried thank you move on to the last one 11.2 the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflict with the flynn list but i need to just add uh the mount morgan water security to my conflict board of security and the australia yeah if we could leave with those items out of the um russian and bills yeah sorry it 's going to be difficult to exclude them yeah it really will be could we deal with capricornia and then do with flynn we should be able to several separate bundles so if we just do capricornia first and then when we leave into flynn um we 'll uh cancel smith will declare in that whole yep that whole area basically yeah okay thanks jen okay um thanks very much man and counselors um so [Laughter] we are getting serious um so this report uh proposes the adoption of a list of advocacy priorities for the federal election um and we 'll do flynn and capricornia separately um the workshops have the priorities have been workshopped by councillors and they 've come from either priorities that council have adopted earlier this year or that were identified as essential to the community as we work through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projects that will support jobs and growth for the region they include both essential infrastructure as well as social infrastructure projects and the report is seeking the endorsement of these projects as councils priority projects for advocacy in the lead-up to the federal election so if there are any um questions about questions again on those priorities think you 've done a good job then um i think we might move into the sorry have a query with the showgrounds redevelopment we 've looked at you know a couple of options but we 've got nothing um there 's still a little bit more detail to come back uh cancer nuts tomorrow we 're having a workshop i know are we oh no not another one yeah so we 'll be discussing that at the workshop tomorrow okay yeah good thank you thanks alicia uh then so i 'll we might move on to the seats of flynn do you need a movement okay i 'll move uh uh secret move in a second for the uh for the advocacy ones for the capricornia move council wickerson second and councillor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unanimously thank you and we might move into flynn but councillor smith will leave the room okay thank you um again thanks very much we 'll move on to flynn yeah so um largely the same these um have been again most of these have uh come from council 's previously endorsed priorities or they 've been working through during the workshop process yeah and that 's uh they 'll be distributed to the candidates after this they 'll be uh ready to go so um counselors are any questions with regards to the items in flynn if not seek a move in a second move councillor rutherford secretary councillor mothers i 'll put that those in favor opposed mason 's carried thanks very much jen and the team for putting that information together i think it has really highlighted and that the time that we 've put into this uh really does allow us to uh to work on those priorities regardless whether they 're successful or not there 's still priorities that the council will need to to keep forward moving forward but hopefully we get some uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know key to uh providing these critical projects for our community moving forward so thank you thanks very much okay councillors we move on notice motions nil 13 questions on notice nil urgent business and questions uh 14.1 councillor kirkland thank you mr mayor um councils as per my email speculated yesterday i 'd like to present a motion the nature of the motion um i believe means that the matter can 't wait for another scheduled council meeting the motion reads as follows a special counsel meeting sorry reads as follows that rockhampton regional council submit a letter to our state premier following the offer to queensland councils to provide feedback on her government 's proposal to introduce covert 19 restrictions for unvaccinated persons from the 17th of december 2021 advising that a over the last week councillors have been inundated with communications from local community and business owners expressing strong and unreserved concern about the social and financial impacts that the new restrictions will have on businesses patrons and employees b business owners and employees represented in their communications that vaccination should be an individual 's choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the workplace for exercising that choice c examples from the communications received expressed that mandated restrictions will hinder businesses from operating to their fullest potential due to loss of the ability to conduct business as usual and loss of critical staff some to the point of closure d local businesses remain unsure of their obligations and liabilities for employees under work health and safety legislation and two council respects respectfully seeks the support of the premier in taking into account the voice put forward by the business community and that she reconsider the current decision of introducing mandated restrictions from december the 17th 2021 seeking a second up councillor council actually compared to second council 's now ceo i think if council is just a bit of caution um around conflicts of interest if you potentially do have one or want to raise it with the council to be worth while doing it now yes so um if i may miss mayor i 'd begin by informing council that i myself am a local business owner the position may be considered a conflict by some yet as the proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that i have a conflict of interest in addition the matter i wish to present represents not only the entire rockhampton regional council but in fact the entire state of queensland and as such i do not stand to gain or lose any more than the greater populace i 'm happy for councillors to put that to the vote if they feel necessary councillors we need to vote on the perceived conflict there could i seek a movement a second with regards to councillor kirkland staying in the military staying in the room move councillor mothers the seconder councillor rutherford i 'll put that those in favor information is carried thank you thank you council election likewise mr mayor um i 'm a trustee of a trust family trust that uh operates uh it leases it out to a business a not-for-profit club that leases so itself would be a defined as a business and as such similar to councillor kirkland i 'd just like to bring it to the table for a vote to see that i could remain during this discussion council election again do we have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put that those in favor merchants carried thank you councillors did we i 'd like to move that the matter lay on the table um pending in my reason for that is there is a live letter that through the directors of the central queensland organizations of council penned last friday to send to the premier i 'd like to read that and and then move that the mata lay on the table until our next council meeting next tuesday pending advice from seeking advice from that latter outcome i 'll read the letter dear premier i write as chair of the central queensland regional organizations of council to raise grave concerns about the economic and social impacts sorry i 've been advised that the procedural motion is just straight to the debate straight to the to the vote so i 'd uh move that the matter lay on the table pending advice from the letter that 's been sent to the to the premier from the uh central queensland or regional organizations of council uh with their concerns um i 'll put that to the vote those gifts excuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procedural motion there 's only a mover there is no debate questions the motion is put directly to the table as a procedural motion made it has a petition there that he liked the table they were separate to this i didn 't know i didn 't know it was coming yeah you 've moved a procedural motion unless you need to draw that one now council i 'll continue with the procedural motion that um i 'd seek the the outcome from that letter from the central queensland organizations of council with regard to that i 'll put that to the vote those in favor those opposed call a division myself council wickerson council rutherford councillor smith vote in favor uh that 's in favor of myself council wickerson council rutherford councillor smith those opposed rutherford smith myself those opposed cancer mothers council kirkland and chancellor blackmon thank you council as we move on um to the closure of the meeting uh i 'd like to thank everyone for your attendance and close the meeting thanks very much so does that mean it 's laid on the table now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to not get to present this it 's a separate itch it 's still under as is um uh in the um just hanging on council i 'll just get some clarification on the ceo whether that 's related to the same um issues i still had something foreign i had no idea this was coming it was just given to me yeah that 's the urgent business separate matter okay look i 'm happy to okay we haven 't officially closed so uh thank you for the host probably rolling on a bit too uh councillor kirkland that is the motion that i put yeah i would it was the meeting next tuesday meeting the table too yeah we 'll fix it up mr mayweather yeah we 're catching up uh now moving on to another matter councillor mathers uh thank you very very much uh mr mayor look i do apologize i know this is probably uh not the way it should normally go but i i was handed this petition halfway through the meeting today so if i hadn 't known it was coming or if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handed it in and spoke about it when council rutherford spoke about her petition um mr mayor the first thing i 'd like to say is i applaud you and the your fellow mayors for penning that letter that you have and that you 're putting forward to it i think it 's definitely a step in the right direction uh i myself have been backwards and forwards like all councillors you know we 've received a number of uh a number of of emails and correspondence with people voicing their their opinions i would also like to say that a lot of people have been using words inundation and that sort of stuff and you know really i think i 've at my last count was about 150 odd emails so even though these people have been very loud and voicing their opinion which i really appreciate and that 's what a democratic society is there for it 's still a very small percentage of the population as well so i 'm very mindful of that but i did have a meeting or a chat with the people that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand forward to the table this um this petition um just i 'll quickly read the petition so it says mr evan parted ceo rockhampton regional council the mayor and councillors with the undersigned respectful request uh that the mayor and rocambi regional council tony williams are the sorry the mayor of rockamp regional council tony williams write to the premier of queensland and ask her that her government proposed mandated a proposed mandate of segregated society from the 17th of december 2021 not be bought into being so i 'd just like to uh table that table that petition and also put my support behind writing a letter to um to the premier once again i i think this um this discussions that we 're having i don 't think it needs to be about whether people should be vaccinated or not vaccinated i 'm very much my supporters behind the small businesses and businesses not being forced to have to choose who is vaccinated and who 's not second council of kirkland put that those in favor emotions carried thank you thank you cancels all have that letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's it 's work had been done by the directors of the cq rock that said no further business i 'll close the meeting and thank everyone for your attendance [Music] [Music] [Music] do [Music] so [Music] taking the good with the ups and

to item three the apologies and leave of absence uh item 3.1 leave of absence from councillor neil fisher from the 23rd of october to the 31st of december could i seek a move and move councillor wickerson seconded councillor election i 'll put that those in favor opposed motions carried item for the confirmation of the previous minutes of the meeting held uh could i seek a mover in a second with regards to the accuracy of those minutes thanks councillor smith secondary councillor wickerson i 'll put that those in favor propose motions carried declarations of interest in matters on the gender councillors we have um councillor wickerson has uh indicated that he has a conflict on an item 9.6 rockhampton regional planning scheme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has recently purchased some property on the riverside waters of stage four and uh you believe the conflict of interest there i propose to leave the meeting stay away for the meeting while it 's held and while the matter is discussed and voted upon um thanks councillor we have another council of rutherford then councillor smith mr mayor mine 's the same item i live in close proximity to that area and i think um i 'll put it to the table as to whether or not um you believe i should go or stay you know i okay so council other council so i believe it 's probably a long bow to say that that your decision for the wider public good is compromised by your proximity with your residence so i 'm happy to to move that you stay while the meeting 's being conducted could i seek a second councillor election uh any discussion i 'll put that those in favor motions carried so i think we need to record who voted in favor there um myself councillor wickerson councillor smith and councillor latin all voted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conflict yes thanks council rutherford councillor smith uh yeah um to me i have another read this morning 9.3 talking about the alliance at the airport on the map it shows the whole airport precinct even though this precinct is on the other side of the road other side of hunter street it clearly shows hunter street coming off the airport boundary so i think i would have a conflict there because my my niece and her husband own two houses in hunter street which is in close proximity to development yep so i would um leave the room you 'd like to leave the room and while that meetings being um the details counselor your child nephew it 's my niece uh jackie liebish and her husband ross leavish and number 60 number 48 and number 60 hunter street which is in close proximity to this development thank you i 'll see you later thank you thank you very much mr mayor mr mayor um 9.3 riverside waters um i personally don 't believe i have a conflict of interest but obviously rutherford lives close to there and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously by relationship there may be something there so i just wanted to uh bring that to the table okay so yours is 9.6 is it yeah 9.6 again oh sorry 9.6 sorry about it uh again i believe and as previously mentioned with you council rutherford that in the public interest the greater good rather over the residential one is not i believe is not there so i 'm happy again to vote that you you wish to stay in them yes yes um and uh again i 'll take a second to council election i 'll put that those in favor i 'll put that again those in favor opposed emotions carried thank you thank you uh again councillor williams yep now councillor she abstains where is that yeah we 'll put some wording in the um in the minutes this to me to say that the council brothers had declared previously yeah even though a few obtained from that it is technically a negative yeah it 's not covered under the act okay another little one of those glitches we 'll have to over there to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deportation bill uh petitions nil uh moving on to 9.1 the master billiard master builder sponsorship from advanced rockhampton and i think we have greg with us today for that one did you want to present or is it basically a straightforward reporter there 's not a lot in there unless there 's questions counsellors um yes councillor wickerson uh mr may just i like to move a um an alternate motion for that um just that rockhampton regional council is the primary sponsor for this event that 's a mistake and so i 'm just wondering why a unit of council would also be co-sponsoring it seek some clarification on that or remove that as a motion determined can um the brockhampton regional council yeah and very happy to to sponsor master builders that 's one industry in cover times is doing very well and deserve our support absolutely and the amount is not significant either but uh a bit of this yep okay um so you wish to move that you know yes yep any second or on that cancel election i 'll put that those in favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my laptop just my froze on me uh now moving on to the airport 9.2 specialized supplier rockhampton airport smith detection uh ross would you like to present that report this one is hopefully fairly straightforward um there are the the heart got the actual hardware the physical um scanners are actually from smith 's who run the software so it 's just hopefully the idea is to tidy up the specialized supplier because it obviously not doesn 't make not practical go out to tender for work okay thanks ross cancer questions i know councillor actually had that one more it wasn 't in store when when we first done but that technology wasn 't available at the time so this is a retrofit onto the um to the system but that said um you 're happy to move cancer election take a second up councillor rutherford i 'll put that those in favor opposed motions carried unanimously thank you councillors moving on to planning and regulations uh 9.3 reduction in development and assessment application fees for operational works oh this is the one you want okay thanks councillor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airlines have submitted an operational works application in relation to the construction of the maintenance hangar at the rockhampton airport the calculated base fee was seventy thousand six hundred and ninety five dollars plus zero point two five percent of anything over five million dollars um so this has given the total application fee of 119 848. uh eight and 74 cents sorry um so development assessment would like to propose a 50 fee reduction which more accurately reflects the cost recovery with assessing the application and the administrative work and inspections that follow it is recommended council accept the application fee of 59 924.37 for the assessment of the proposed development thank you kathy um again here we get to the 37 cents i 'm not sure but uh yeah it 's just part of the process so a number of lights on there so we 'll go to some questions and then uh council of rutherford um mr curious as if the 50 uh cost covers our costs how come the the original price was double that um so that is our fees schedule um it is based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they we have to plus the over a certain amount so all operational works is i think done on in that way i 'm not really sure how the actual structural fee schedule is tanya might be able to determine through the chair the calculation of the fee is actually um based on the amount of the work done and the cost estimate of the work is 24 million dollars that 's why it gets so high all right thanks councillor uh councillor wickerson all councilman you 're getting this mate councilman very much mr mayor um yeah look i um i asked a few questions about the about this yesterday as well nervous explained to me that tony was saying that there 's a lot of engineering work involved in in this job so obviously there 's costs involved but because that point two five percent um of everything over five million dollars escalates it exponentially so look i 'm all in i 'm all for obviously council recovering all cost uh and also if we can make some money that 's what we 're you know we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sort of thing but i am in favor of this um mr mayor and killing cindy for the reason that i 'm hoping this sends a good message to um alliance that we are very much supportive of this program and also it might send a message to other developers and people that want to bring business to our area that the rockingham regional council is happy to negotiate and do whatever we can to attract whatever business we can so i 'm happy to move this one thank you thanks cancer mothers council wickerson um thanks just me similar this is a such an important project for the region and happy to support this motion but a little bit anxious about uh setting precedence with it and the one line that says that this 50 reduction in more closely aligns with the actual costs of the of the uh the process the assessment of it um can you assume from that that our costs for every other development that we assess is also not up to what we charge and we 're just worried that someone in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolution and say well uh what are your costs for the assessing so is there something unique about this project that i know council 's sort of closely involved with it that would justify that reduction and happy happy that it 's there but just worry about moving forward just that one particular line dania these applications worth millions millions of dollars don 't come through very often i don 't think it would set any sort of precedent in relation to fees most projects have fees well under that so basically under the local government act it 's pure cost recovery so that 's that 's what we 've done and other projects may have more engineering works than what this one does so i don 't think it will set a precedent for discounting application fees i put through the chair um council uh wickerson that on previous occasions over the years council on these larger um costly projects there has been fee reductions given to councils either through mcu or operational works previously so it 's the same process we used so you 're happy to second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there 's no further questions i 'll put that those in favor pose emotions carried unanimously we 'll ask councillor smith back into the room please thank you uh councillors 9.4 item has been uh withdrawn so we move on to item five the adopted infrastructure charges resolution and angus i 'd like to present to that report mayor councillors um through the chair the report this morning seeks council 's endorsement for a number of parameters to help guide the drafting but a new adopted infrastructure charges resolution the general parameters are around the quantum of the charge in relation to the charge areas indexation of charges between application and payment the commencement date and transitional arrangements um i won 't go through the report in detail but you 'll see there 's a number of options that were generally presented within the report those options effectively range from effectively potentially a minor change to the uh the charges and the resolutions through to significant changes in alignment with the prescribed cap that 's set by the state government uh happy to take any questions in relation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move in a second with regards to that one move council election second and councillor mothers i 'll put that those in favor i do like to speak against yep yes i need a speaker for the motion uh mover do you speak in favor or just mr mayor just your light counselor sorry i should have moved an amendment because i was all for um option three i think by going the higher one um i don 't i know it lists some uh councils that have adopted the highest one i don 't see gladstone there i don 't see livingston or any of our neighbours and i think people will develop elsewhere rather than northampton if we 're going to go into to the dearest rate also when we were doing the workshop i pointed out that i don 't think it 's fair that you 're only using one level for everybody whereas now we 've got three different levels for charging and i think um that 's going to be a detriment to a lot of things i 'll just um cancel that did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge of the maximum but then there 's the discounted charge yep that 's only for 12 months for two years you 're probably anxious to clarify angus up to 2023. so the um the recommendation proposes that we set a commencement date of the first july 2022 and that in the period from the first of july 2022 to the 30th of june 2023 um that we have an incentives policy which provides a 15 discount across the uh the charges to provide a transition rather than a single large step second let 's ask the question it is only for 12 months that 's correct yeah that 's how i took it as well i just think um yeah we 're going to miss out on some development by doing this yeah financial position cancer is there is the thing that we need to be mindful of yeah i realise that uh spoke against the motion um another speaker sorry for me to wrap it up uh there 's just a question on this report that i 've got unless i 've changed we had a discussion yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one that was meant to be 21 grand and reconfiguring a lot was the other way they had it around the wrong way so it should have been two or less uh bedrooms was the multiple dwellings to a less for twelve thousand dollars the initial twelve thousand dollars it 's a point of clarification in the table in the conclusion the um the amounts relating to the multi-dwelling units with three bedrooms or more compares it to the current charge area two so the current charge area two has a lower rate for multi-dwelling units both one and two bedroom and three bedroom and above so just to clarify agassi the option one in that that 's been presented in the recommendation yes so the first option in relation to the charges is aligned to option one in on page two and three of the report council matters ah thanks very much we had a speaker for you speaking against no sorry i was speaking for i thought councillor um latin was just speaking speaking for is that okay question of speaking not speaking for speaking for is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i do understand um uh councillor smith 's concerns but uh in regards to this and we spent a lot of time going over this with angus and ourselves through the workshop and you know i do believe um you know going to this higher level we 're not far away from what our neighbours were from memory uh angus in regards to the costings so i believe livingston is approximately twenty six thousand for a um reconfiguration reconfiguring a lot yeah yep that 's correct and uh and also what i 'm hoping is is that you know giving giving this 12 months notice for a little bit more notice that might actually uh incentivize some of the developers out there to move a little bit quicker put some of that stuff in and we can we can maybe get a little bit more planning happening as well so i 'm very much for this for this proposal thank you okay counselors the um debates on i 'd probably speak against it as well i think um my preferred option would have been just to move to uh uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was where we were talking about uh in that space rather than going to the maximum and then working on it from there so my position but that 's it i 'll speak against it so council latin would you like to wrap up debate um i think that we 've had enough discussion on it i think um at the interest of the the suggestion the recommendation from the officers i think that is the way forward for our region okay cancer that uh council rutherford speaking point of clarification please mr mayor possible because um i thought i heard angus just saying in our previous discussions was that there would be a um a reduction a percentage reduction when it was first brought in um so that it was a transition and not a jump is that right angus is that 's what yes for further correct yeah 12 months yeah yeah so all right thank you yeah okay councils um there 's no further debate i 'll put the motion those in favor those opposed emotions carried i 'm record the council smith but you cancers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ version 3 councillor wickerson step to the head of the mainland thank you cameron good morning uh mr mayor and councillors so the report for you this morning is for version three amendment to um the planning scheme major amendment to the planning scheme uh essentially over the last 12 months officers have been working away at various changes proposed amendments to the actual planning scheme itself and version three the report so what we 're looking at is a series of zone changes home-based business to be allowed in industry zones further clarification relation to industrial land use definitions amendment to the subdivision provisions to align the state regulations to include the north rocky flood management area stage 2 area within our maps and we have a number of inconsistencies in interpretation improvements to the planning scheme so the purpose of the report for you this morning is to obviously we 've already prepared the major amendment to now submit the nature and details of that amendment off to the state government for state interest review that stated review occurs for 60 business days after which it will come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that point in time we 'll um reconvene with council perhaps have a workshop to go through any outstanding items from from the state government and also discuss uh ways uh step forward in relation to public engagement of version three thank you some questions cancer rutherford um mr merritt it 's a little bit of a left field question on on this one and um i 'm hoping i haven 't missed it somewhere along the line um kem we had talked a number of times about putting greater restrictions on telecommunications towers and that we kept it we kept being said wait until we do an amendment um of the planning scheme and we 'll address it in that and i haven 't actually seen that been addressed and here we are ready to submit this amendment and we we haven 't done that unless i 've missed it uh sorry just just for the through the chain um telecommunications provisions haven 't been included that 's for a further workshop unfortunately these amendments we 're trying to group them together into like amendments and certainly there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the commercial center study and we can also include to the communications tower as well but we haven 't proposed this in this one unfortunately so how far away will that be uh just through the chair i 'm happy to pursue that in a workshop and discussion first um i 'd imagine that it have to be probably early next year the workshop for it how how long before we would tackle an amendment with that in it but uh well for the chair that depends on how well the workshop goes but if we decide on amendments um look there 's no reason why we can 't put in a version we can put in rolling amendments so it doesn 't really matter we could put in another version five six seven and to incorporate these other changes so it could be it could be early mid next year um it 's a bit hard to say yeah because we 've got a number other series amendments to incorporate as well okay so i i might be missing something because or has something changed because i thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were waiting to do a major amendment with everything included uh it 's depends on the amendment itself and we where we have to do reviews it can be quite costly but given a lot of the amendments have been done internally it 's basically staff wages and resources that 's the cost to council but yeah i guess we 're trying to package up amendments with like amendments it 's just easier to undertake a public consultation process when you 're consistent with the types of amendments you 're doing that 's not to say we can 't do a future amendment on telecommunications towers all right thanks mr may okay thanks kevin council further questions with regards to this recommendation if not um portfolio chair mr move or yeah that that 's fine there 's a second council election i 'll put that those in favor opposed motion 's carried thank you my and uh invite council wickerson back to the room unanimous sorry yeah sorry thank you moving on councillors 9.7 the major amendment version 4. again cameron thank you good morning councillors and mr mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the major amendments up of course so version four is in relation to our flood catchment overlays so as councillors would be aware we 've had previous workshops the last one being the 13th of october running through the flood overlay maps the obviously council 's commitment to producing information in relation to areas of flood and of course as part of this process as we incorporate into the planning scheme um happy to take questions on the flood catchment overlay thank you cameron councillor smith yeah thanks mr and i probably asked this question before cameron um so you mentioned grace mayor and then you 've mentioned matt morgan as well um our smaller places like bejewell and stanwell that badly flooded in 2013 where are they actually captured in the scheme of things so these particular mapping changes are based on studies and modeling that 's been done those areas further further work would have to be done as my understanding to calculate and make changes for those areas at the moment the planning scheme has a flood plain investigation area that capture captures quite a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have further updated information at that point in time we incorporate that into planning schemes so i guess this amendment 's incorporating what we 've done so far in relation to north rocky the future river south rockhampton grace room mount morgan uh you just uh cameron originally um after the floods and a cabra township is another one uh if someone 's gonna build a house there now uh is there a flag that comes up and says that you 've got to build it up to a certain height in those say those three little areas that are badly flooded if it 's triggered by overlay there is okay i 'd have to have a look at the pacific areas of cabra and to see which areas are encapsulated by the by the overlay um so i 'd have to look into further detail but i believe that there has been some modelling done in those areas and any future information that comes to hand would certainly incorporate that into the planning scheme as well as with all the modeling that 's been done it 's also on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flood searches so all available information that council has in relation to flood when people put in their flood searches that information is relayed back to that particular applicant i 'm still not convinced um but so just in summary i mean i can only incorporate into the planning scheme the information i have yeah um regulation sorry sorry cameron yep if there 's more work done in any areas does it have to go through this major amendment to be part of the planning schemes probably the worry i have that we call this has been a major amendment um and it 's a lengthy process so if you discovered more data outside of all these areas does that have to go through a pla an amended amendment to be recognised to regulate development yes now bear in mind with this particular major amendment because there 's so many properties impacted we felt that we should go through a proper public consultation process there 's over four thousand properties impacted on some of these overlays so because it is a exercise in community awareness and engagement as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we also we can go through minor amendments to a planning scheme we can also put on temporary local planning instruments particularly if there 's a area of risk and they are more shortened processes than a major amendment but we felt that given the amount of properties impacted in this particular scenario that we felt that a proper detailed engagement was undertaken in this instance because of so many properties and bear in mind south rockhampton doesn 't have this overlay at the moment and neither does mount morgan uh and north rocky and grace may have been reviewed peter yeah through me i just want to explain the studies that have been done were done and there 's two different things here you 're talking about some historical flood knowledge in those other areas which is used to guide development potentially so we make it available but we have to do a formal flood study which models up to a certain standard to then create the overlay so as was just pointed out we don 't have these even for south rockhampton today so that 's what this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it will have to allocate funds to do catchment studies in those other areas and determine a flight overlay for the 100 year and other size floods so there 's two different things going on here this is a formal process to establish a layer based on modelling and those other catchments you 're referring to council have not been studied at all in any detail to produce this there is minor investigations but not a complete study thanks peter councillor motors thanks very much mr mayor i just wanted to say i 'm very much in um in favor of this i think it 's very timely um that we we 've had this update and it 's great to see it i know there 's been a lot of work cameron with getting this together but i just think it 's great to see that um our overlays flood overlays are a lot more accurate than what they have been in the past we 're still only dealing with the data and the modeling that we 've got in front of us i understand that but i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward with for the rest of our region as well so a good work and i 'm happy to um support it okay move counselor maters do we have a secondary cancer rutherford we 'll put that those in favor promotions carried unanimously thank you moving on to item 9.8 summary budget management report for the period ending the 30th of september 2021 thanks manny thank you mr mayor and good morning everyone so presented is the summary budget management report for the 30th of september 2021 the operating revenue is currently at 40 of the adopted budget where we should be around the 25 percent due mainly to our rates and charges being levied earlier in that part of this year private works and recoverable works are at 19 of the budget and grants and subsidies are at 31 which are ahead of the budget all other revenue items are within the proximity to the budget our operating expenditure is currently sitting at 23 contractors and consultants at 18 materials and expenses are above the budget at 32 and uh administrative expenses are around the 19 our capital income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and those other items that are capital in nature but our capital expenditure is currently sitting at 11 of our carryover budget so we have some work to do in terms of our capital expand expenditure program through the year our total investments are sitting at 114.7 million for the end of september and loans at 140.7 million we saw 16.9 million spent during the first quarter of the financial year however we need to see that increasing momentum as we move further into the year uh questions council smith yeah thanks um mr may just with the capital you 're saying we need to ramp it up in the next um while to get um that spent and i 'm just probably questioned to peter uh how confident is he to do that i think peter 's uh mentioning probably there 'll be another report coming back on the footpaths and uh and what 's happening in that space but i 'll hand over to peter peter through the chair how confident look we definitely will ramp up but in all likelihood i suggest that we will be revising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year so the there will be a presentation at the next workshop on frw on the water portfolio which will update on those major projects and i suggest we 'll be shifting some of those to the next financial year thank you cancers no further questions to marny i 'm happy to move seek a second councillor wickerson i 'll put that those in favor opposed motions carried unanimously 9.9 final management report for camden regional council 2021 and thank you money thank you mr mayor so this is the final management report in relation to our 2021 financial statements well the period ended the 30th of june 2021 which has been received from the queensland audit office the um on behalf of thomas noble and russell as their delegate so the actual financial statements will be presented later on in the annual report however in this final management report there was no new matters identified and three internal control matters were actually closed out during that period we still have two matters that require attention being the capitalization of the capital work in progress which we 're working through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data within our it network so there 's progress on both of these and we 're hoping to resolve a lot of that detail and and close out those matters by the 30th of june next year there were some savings for council in terms of the final audit fee because all of our audits were done remotely during this last financial year given the restrictions and lockdowns that we faced and and that our auditors were actually based in northern new south wales didn 't help either so in relation to that really the recommendation is for council to receive the final management report for 2021. uh thanks molly just a question on that is if there was a saving made there is that something that could be continued in the future or is it the more the face-to-face that uh that 's required to have those audits undertaken uh mr mayor this year we are in our fifth year with thomas noble and russell so they uh have been our auditors for that period of time it 's expected that the queensland audit office may change out our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so it may not be that we can actually do the first order remotely i would think given introductions and just getting used to our systems so we 're not aware of who that will be at this point in time and haven 't received any advice from qao at this point in time as to the change out of those auditors but at this point in time that 's what our expectation is okay see that as it develops thank you councillor latin and council rutherford um thanks mr mayor happy to support this one um i guess the savings attention your question the savings was just essentially the airfares yeah okay cancel rutherford uh mr may just a slight amendment if i could to the to the recommendation and that 's just where it says the regional council be received and the organisation be congratulated on a great outcome now we 've had some um swings and balances that uh that need to work through this one and trying times and cabin to throw that into the mix it 's been uh fantastic work by the organization so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay cancer for no further comments i 'll put that those in favor emotions carried unanimously thank you councillors moving on to 9.10 the revised policies for entertainment and expenses councillor smith mr me can i um leave a motion that this lay on the table until it 's workshopped because there 's so many track changes and then we normally workshop a policy before we change it yeah yeah now look counsellors if that 's yeah like i say there 's lots of changes there we probably um take a while to go through it but the workshop 's probably prudent um that just understand where those track changes are going i thought our little question box may have helped in the in the report but uh just to say where some of those are going but yeah there 's a lot of detail there a lot of work that could go through so um you move that emotions lay on the table the second at council election again yeah i 'll probably support that as well so put that those in favor motions carried thank you um for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one councillors it 's just a policy review so we can um do another workshop on that we 'll do a workshop on that to uh to go through those changes cancel election yeah and carried unanimously yeah okay thanks councillors moving on uh item 9.11 the 2021 operational plan for oh cherie sorry uh do we not have to have a date an actual date on there no there doesn 't have to be a date councillor brotherhood preferably it would be but i think we 're fairly full if i can remember our schedule yeah so we 'll try and schedule that one as soon as possible so yeah all right i just thought when we would lay something on the table we had to have a put an action in there to come out overcome that date the reason why you 've taken it to a workshop was to actually look at the track chain or the chunk proposed changes thanks thank you listen good morning marin councillors this report is providing our quarter one operational plan progress report there 's two parts to the report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is requesting council 's approval of some amendments to our current operational plan um stepping you through you 're familiar with the format of the progress report so the report sets out detailed commentary and summaries in relation to each counsellor portfolio as well as contains that traffic light style report to determine um and show whether or not council is on track of meeting its operational plan targets previously adopted it is only quarter one however the report shows only two percent of our targets are currently not on track so a good result at the end of quarter one and also within that report is our performance plans for each of council 's business units so like we 've done in previous reports the plan for the presentation of the report is for each of our general managers and ceo to provide a brief overview of their particular areas i will start with our s gen which one it was our ceo he 's giving me pointing fingers yeah no i 'll take it are you happy to go first yeah thank you um council as it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major things sitting there within the probably the whole of council um there is a few from what we what we counselors will understand is some influences that are going to influence on the delivery of our operational plan that weren 't planned as we did in an operational plan so some legislative changes have been coming in for um comet and whatever else they will impact on us but generally speaking overall things are tracking a okay alyssa 's said is that most things are actually on track so i 'm probably happy to move over into one of the gm 's so next is our executive manager for advance rockhampton greg if you 'd like to provide an update thanks alyssa and mayor and councillors as the ceo said quarter one uh a lot of activity uh in the economic development uh tourism marketing and event space uh probably just to cover off in in some particular order in that tourism marketing and event space being very focused on the mountain biking the fishing and the destination marketing a number of videos which have been distributed a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of social media engagement which as most of you saw in the workshop recently uh our engagement there has just increased significantly uh as we know with events uh nrl games were certainly uh seems like so long ago but uh you know what a great quarter for for rockhampton and central queensland with the nrl games being held here and and again with announcements in the last week with brown park uh bides very well for the future engagement with the nrl as well we continue to engage with the nrl on an industry engagement side of things the precinct survey was completed earlier in the quarter with 435 responses the economic development survey which is currently being tabulated just about finished 1120 responses which is an amazing response for a survey of that type we signed the small business friendlies council and we issued the investment rocky video as well the agri-business front a lot of the energy was spent securing the rookwood land holder support and grants program contract which is now underway and and run by advanced rockhampton in partnership with uh or in contract with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neon and one with cq power we continue to engage with all those project players as they also run their engagement with power link along the way the innovation space the ai hub that partnership was signed we also start to work very closely the mayor and i with the ai hub especially in the defence sector they have great links in there and will continue to engage as part of that and dovetailing into the defence we did submit that report to the defence department and we 've respec received a response um dare i say the words it 's now in the uh bureaucratic merry-go-round which is not a bad thing because it continues to put rocky on the radar in in the hallways of canberra so the more we get on the merry-go-round probably the better because they 'll know more people will know that rocky 's in that space uh continue to work with cq rock on finalizing the tender and recommendation to see q rock mares on the defence strategy and industry capability statements along the way probably the final one and which which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i have an email right now to sign off the successful proponent for that so we 're moving along in that space so i 'll open it to the floor for questions no thanks greg it has been a um until you go through all those items that uh you don 't really appreciate how much work 's been undertaken in both the department and the in the group and really is putting rockhampton on everyone 's radar um through the events and also our involvement in the uh the economic development space so congratulations to you and the team um and this is a great way and again it gave the ceo 's side of it there from that corporate part is uh is work that 's been undertaken that i think people are busy ferreting away at their jobs they don 't really uh appreciate when you 're combining all those efforts together uh it really does put council in a good position going forward can answer any questions to greg or thank you thanks greg thank you councils i 'll hand over now to our deputy ceo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mr mayor um as evan said still first quarter now so still fairly early days um one thing i did want to point out though is where our in our customer service area with the whole large body work has been done in that area to bring our statistics up while we we look at one of the statistics here about the calls answered still aren 't where we want it i must say we have brought that down to the 45 second but very much closer down to that point so we are expecting to hit that target fairly soon but in saying that we 've also we have half abandoned calls and and reduced the um as i mentioned it reduced that average speed but we 're still exceeding that first point of contact so that 's a key one for us some other issues i 'm not issues but other key statistics i suppose we look at is that our suppliers are 91 are paid within trading terms they 're still maintaining that over uh 90 um our it our service level internal service levels at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 90 percent um but so we 're just a touch blabber still it 's still a good level um the other the finance areas um you would um marnie 's just delivered a couple of reports there so that 's been you see where they 've been tracking fairly well um and we 've done some further work on our long-term financial forecast so um one large we 'll see in that a traffic light there 's a whole bodies of work going on there um i won 't talk to anything in particular but happy to take any questions that uh mr matthew are anything thanks ross council questions on that thanks ross doing a good job thank you and then our community services summary from our general manager thanks alicia thanks so councillors of the year is flying by quickly but we are progressing our goals um in the operational plan so firstly a shout out to three officers that have offered substantial assistance to me in this reporting period the first two damon morrison thank you and jacob weir um they have significantly progressed preparations for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will open early in 2022. i 'm pleased to report that we have a new director that expect is expected to start before the end of this month so in the reporting period we reached physical completion of that building and the team are now working from the site so we expect to have the artworks moved in by the end of this month the third shout out goes to drew stevenson who 's helped me in the community assets and facilities area and has made a substantial impact in a short space of time um again we 're expecting a new manager in this space before the end of the month without the one team attitude of these three people both these areas would not have progressed as much so i 'm very grateful for that um a key project in our plan being the botanic gardens and zoo has had a substantial boost with the announcement of one and a half million from the building better regions fund um so that 's for a formal entrance and gathering space for the botanic gardens at botanic gardens and zoo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some big shoes to fill and now is finding his feet our meerkat encounters the recommends in providing they are providing very popular which is great to see and all going well our new baby will be another boost for that zoo popularity the heritage village reopened and has held the multicultural fair with some success we 're looking forward to the christmas night market on the 27th of november and the new lights out there making these events possible and new opportunities especially during our hot summer with the announcement of the 2032 olympics there 's many sporting associations that have become very active in town in efforts to improve our local facilities and take advantage of future opportunities with the forum run last week by a federal member and pending our discussion with council tomorrow i 'm flagging that we might need a potential change in the operational plan um particularly if we want to make efforts into this space last but not least the court has seen significant progress on our sustainability action plan and i 'm pleased to see some key installations at some of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the last two weeks but we 've seen substantial success in taking out the national sustainability communities and tiny communities and tidy town awards in the category of water and natural environment management councils will know to change proposed to the action around climate adaptation and resilience it 's proposed to incorporate councils action towards climate change into the review of the sustainability strategy rather than make it a separate strategy on its own that 's it for communities happy to take any questions thanks alicia questions councillors again when you group all those activities it uh it really does there 's a lot of work going on in the background to highlight the uh the work that 's undertaken so again thank you lisa and your team thank you and lastly our general manager of regional services this is where the rubber hits the road good morning mayor councillors okay another busy first quarter for regional services um overall operations have been as normal across all of those areas and i 'm just going to highlight a couple of key things that are going on so in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for main roads it is putting a bit of strain on our design resources because these cycleways were not designed so we 're just keeping up and designing just in front of the construction crews but that work will continue to until march 2021 we completed the art gallery this quarter so that was great and the airport is very close to completion in the water portfolio um well the highlights yeah we continued to truck 30 to 40 trucks of water up that hill and just before anyone asked me there 's no damn inflow as a result of the rain last night okay it 's going to take a lot more rain than that to start flow we 've gone out to tender for the design and construction of the north rockhampton sewage treatment plant and they we close now and starting to be evaluated capital expenditure for frw is very much down at seven percent um and it will be a low expenditure this year but i 'll talk more about that in a few weeks in waste some exciting things there we started our fogo all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get that up and running and it started just in october and you will get a report on how that 's progressing but there 's 750 households that are on the scheme and it 's going quite well we completed the process for the tender for the mountain morgan water security and we have engaged consultancies which is a ecom as a lead and another company called bdo who will do the economics underneath this so that 's great that that 's progressing and right down the end in the waste world there was two other things [Music] we have commissioned now sell the next cell so that we will have sufficient air space and capacity going from may next year so that 's good we 've all the liner is coming over from i think it 's saudi arabia which is the only place that we can get that particular lineup but it 's on its way and the other good thing that 's just happened in the waste is we 've done our polystyrene unit it 's finally arrived we 're commissioning it so we will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into landfill and that 's all i 've got any questions counselors questions peter now again peter not getting a lot of work happening in the different departments there but uh little excellent work being undertaken thank you so just to recap councillors there are two parts to this report that concludes our progress report summary and attachment to contained in the report is a marked up set of those proposed changes and just some tweaks basically to the operational plan actions our general managers are all here if you 've got any questions in relation to any of those specifically other than that i 'm happy to take any questions if not those changes yep i 'm happy to move uh seek a second with regards to that council election i 'll put that those in favor oppose motions carried uh 9.12 the adoption of the 2021 annual report uh thank you mr mayor yeah before us today is the uh the formal adoption of the 2021 annual report included in there is a whole lot of statutory information that 's required as well as the financial statements certified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here just ways probably nothing really to highlight you 've gone through the report any questions or comments counselor smith yeah i just um thought it was really read really well thank you yeah inclusion of the photos is always good um updated photos of counsellors was good um but i thought that um yeah really good i 'd say probably the best one we 've ever produced okay and yeah congratulations whoever was working on it yourself thank you for that i 'll pass it on there 's leonie and uh match team put that together yeah yeah really thank you and i just wondered mr may can i get a hard copy please copy of the annual report no problem possible okay counselors any other questions comments move in a second move council smith 's second accounts to the rutherford i 'll put that those in favor proposed motions carried unanimously where we have five past um no notice emotion they 've questions on notice uh urgent business questions counselors closed session we have a number of items there to be dealt with in closed session item 14.1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negotiations 14.3 virgin office lease 14.5 virgin cargo and freight site 14.5 specialized supply for rockhampton museum of art sutton gallery australia part of the party limited 14.6 property matter and 14.7 legal matter update and there is a supplementary uh closed item on there i just haven 't got 14.8 which business opportunity rockhampton airport uh business business sorry we 've done that at the end but urgent business now yeah no you 're right i 've gone over it sorry oh no you did mention it was just this quick um our cancer is mr may this relates to the um approved artwork to go in the long gallery of the new museum of art now when we had our that was presented to council some time ago but the path that wasn 't presented to us and we 've only i think collectively found out when we had a walk through recently is that proposed output for the long gallery uh was initially only going to be there for a period of 12 months and then painted over i think that 's been extended now by our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel that that 's still um a bit offensive uh two years for this uh artwork that we 're paying with money from the philanthropy board and i understand that that 's money that 's been donated by sponsors uh with the full understanding that is to be painted over but regardless the community will see council spending a hundred thousand dollars on this piece of artwork that is ephemeral it 'll be gone in two years time i don 't think that sends a very strong message when we 're trying to cut costs for the council even though yes it 's somebody else 's money the community won 't understand that and we haven 't got to look too far back to when uh artwork that was put on a private building and i won 't mention the exact one but in the cbd for fifteen thousand dollars and it was painted over by the owner of that building uh what sort of critic criticism council received even though we had nothing to do with that process this is one that we will enter into knowing full well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one or two years that that 's irrelevant um the community will not understand that that 's the prerogative maybe of the the sponsors to this program and and will well to them if they 've got the money to afford to pay for something and then it gets painted over in two years time the other issue on that that i have is that to do that work would seem a lot easier if it was done maybe on panels that could be either painted on the ground and then hung up just like any other artwork you won 't have scissor lifts and working heights issues and i don 't know the actual period when it 's to be understood it will be finished by the time the the gallery opens in march but then somewhere else i thought it was a six month project so that it may well go into time when the public are in the building so there 's a whole lot of issues about working from elevated work platforms and and licensing and ticketing that you would think on the face of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then we assemble those panels like a large jigsaw if you 're like and this is a large piece of work as we know so it 's not something you can do just from a ladder not you should be working off the ladder anyway so for a whole range of reasons i strongly object to the idea that we put something on the wall there that then is painted over in a year or two or whatever so two options are to put it on there on the wall and leave it there forever i know that 's not ideal either because galleries like to to circulate work around it and i agree with that but i really think the council should strongly consider um going back to the artist and i think they their preferences to paints right on the wall and i don 't know whether artists normally get to make that call but i don 't see any difference to the artist whether it 's painted on the wall or on on panels to go on the wall i don 't see the difference why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the period we can take the pieces down we can store them if they 're in panels and then put them up at another time it just seems like wasteful and since an extremely offensive message to the community that i know there 's some families in my division that they 're struggling to put food on their kids lunches you know so uh to waste a hundred thousand dollars so publicly and with our approval is just it just doesn 't sit with me sorry cancer wasn 't a decision that was made by the table it was one that yeah yeah i know but if we sit back and do nothing we 're complicit in it all the same so understood but to leave it there as a permanent one probably not an option either no i 'm just putting that 's the two options that i see but yeah mr ceo probably it 's probably not urgent business in its technical sense within the yeah even though if you could actually wait for the next schedule but anyway that doesn 't that 's just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by council either to notice a motion to the next council meeting or today call for a report on some details to provide the other counselors there 's probably two or two options there for counseling yeah i 'm happy to appear a notice of motion for next meeting but i just didn 't want it to commence in the meantime and like other events that we 've had that were then committed and locked into it there 's nothing you can do so i just i don 't know when it 's going to start but if it 's going to be completed by the time that the gallery opens i imagine that 's fairly soon but i don 't know just probably just to to cut through it is just a notion got a call for a report on this if you want to move that motion now you can call for a report yeah if you like or i can just move a notice of motion for the next meeting that we insisted it 's on paper i haven 't got enough information about it why it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision for that to to go ahead i 'm just not sure um you know how how it um how developed the where it and the reasoning around what i would say i guess that would come from a report for me to make a formal decision about where to go from it okay mister we 're happy to move a motion that we call for a detailed report about the rationale behind it for the next full council of me that 's probably the best way to get all the information then everyone 's got an opportunity to uh to go through it before we make any decisions on the fly fair enough okay uh we 'll get that get that deal detail um counselor mothers yeah thanks very much mr may i look on very similar lines as well mr mayor i 'm happy to second that um i was pretty well gobsmacked when we did the walkthrough and that was i was made aware of that as well i understand this is how things work in the art world i really do and i understand that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's money that 's been raised i totally understand that but it 's just um it 's still money and it 's still money that we 're spending for on the long term so i 'm agreeing with certainly um calling for a report so we can delve into it a bit more thank you okay that cover the um cover the intent there counselor okay uh councillor may the second okay cancel i 'll put that those in favor oppose motions carried thank you okay um i just realized i i would have a um conflict of interest with number with 14.8 same as 9.3 he 's talking about the alliance at the airport with the relatives okay so i seek to move into closed session the medium be close sorry if you could just go back to the top of that recommendation to the public to discuss the following items considered confidential in accordance with section 254 of the government act uh and regulations for the reasons which is 14 which is 14.1 14.2 14.3 14.4 145 14.6 and 14.7 um i 'm happy to move seek a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried 14.8 uh with and i 'll seek a move in a second that we 14.8 that we move into closed session as indicated in the reasons previously moved councillor wickerson secretary council election i 'll put that those in favor uh the motions carried and a motion to go into closed session move against wickerson second and myself um put that those in favor promotions carried i think we should have had councillor smith here for that one um cancer would take a quick uh councillor wickerson and i seconded it yeah council will take a 10 minute recess and be back by 11 10 25 thank you everybody feeling fine

running just a little bit late so we 'll uh we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing some media on the show this morning so they 'll be here in due course um moving on to item four the confirmation of the previous minutes from the meeting on the 25th of may 2021 be confirmed move cancel election second councillor mathers any uh i 'll put that those in favor against carried thank you moving on to item five with declarations of interest in matters on the agenda uh we just have one uh from council official fischer uh that he has i 'll hand over to you councillor fischer and uh thank you um i have a declarable conflict of interest in the council of gender item 8.1 um council discretionary fund application for the rockhampton horticultural society incorporated i 've been the patron of the rockhampton horticultural society for about a decade and in that time every time that i 've put in a request to council for money from my ci um cdf i leave the meeting for that decision to be made consistency but also within the rules now i will continue to do the same okay thanks councillor fisher councillors if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they want is there is something that comes up during the course of the the meeting please uh raise that to the attention of the the committee councillor mr may i 'm not sure whether i 've got a conflict with you know with my discretionary fund because i 'm i 'm actually chair of the uh 150 committee for graceful state school i 'm not sure okay we might um we might need the words around that council smith and then we 'll um if you like put it to the table for um for a vote okay um because i 'd like to increase that amount so there it is there councillor smith so you want me to speak him yeah [Music] or lightness and we 've just been doing media and was a little bit held up it was raining earlier on too rocky show uh yes so uh gracefully state school um they 're old one of the they 're the oldest school in our rockhampton regional council area um and they 're celebrating 150 years this year and it 's been taken forward by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running a 150th celebrations and probably a lot of those expenses we 're not aware of yet and i have some money left over my cdf and i 'd like to um donate a thousand dollars to to them and appreciate mad mr may you donated 500 as well um that 's probably all i can say i i i have a conflict in that i was asked by the uh principal of grace my school to be chairperson because of covert the celebrations um should have been organized like last year but because of covert we didn 't start having meetings till early this year so we 've had to really rush a lot of things through and and probably she asked me to be chairperson so we could take everything forward we are they are writing a book to commemorate the occasion as well and um yeah trying to do a lot of things so it 'll be a memorable year okay thanks council smith so mr it 's the explanation to the table should be around how you all deal between your personal interest and the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table really needs to hear okay so i have no personal interest in graceful state school i mean i attended there a long time ago and my nephews did a fair while ago as well so i don 't i really haven 't got a personal interest in the school other than that i go there to present prizes and present leaders and anzac day and end of year so that 's my only personal interest in the in the um school and i don 't believe that you know that i have a um a direct personal interest in the school and i think you know my interest in the public is far greater councillors any questions around council smith 's councillor wickerson thanks mr chair three just to clarify council smith do you intend a thousand or five hundred did you say a thousand yeah a thousand dollars yeah the the resolution says 500 but i 'd like to donate a thousand dollars okay so i might have missed that um councillor councillor kirkland um i 'm just considerate of the the rules that around conflict of interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is something that we should be putting on our register of interest which obviously then makes it a conflict of interest is it within council duties or council have appointed you as being chair or was that something you volunteered yourself uh no the council didn 't appoint me i was asked to be chair by the principal probably because because of my role as counsellor and a counsellor for grossmere but we 're not an a we 're not actually an official committee we don 't move motions we are a committee that was just appointed by the pnc okay and you 're requesting that council um determined that your your decision is not it 's not and you want you wish to include that you vote on the matter um so that would be um we want to be counsellor remain in the meeting for that for that vote to be taken well i suppose they said i 've gone this far and just clarified they 're not legally clear and interesting is that council smith either you can ask the council to stay or you can elect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council needs to hear is whether or not you want to have them determine whether or not you participate in the decision making including invading the matter or that yourself declaring in and leaving okay so a just if there is if there is any concerns i 'm happy to go yeah um look i actually see uh council smith 's role is more like a subcommittee rather than it 's actually a committee it 's something new that we 'll all uh get asked to do during uh this term but i 'm kind of wondering there that just for that transparency and this is going to be a very high profile event particularly grace mere with the media around the high schools and things like that that it may be just for your own uh transparency there that may be leaving the meeting yeah i 'm happy to do that it would be we 're just not on yet yeah sorry counselor it 's just your your request counselor whether you want us to make it seem there 's been concerns i 'd rather go okay now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determination on that then if you want to leave the meeting on the on when that item again cancels it 's a it 's it 's an area where cautions probably um urge on the side of caution rather than than going by the book so some of these times it is uh it is more prudent just to remove yourself from that discussion well that 's what i normally do normally in that room anyway yeah i thought it 'd be good to study for a change it would be nice to stay for once [Music] decision on that so we 'll move on to those items counselors there 's no public forums and reputations which are nil presentation of petitions nil so we move on to uh the council of delegate reports 8.1 so uh councillor fischer has a conflict with this one okay counselors he 's uh against officials left the room that 's uh offers a recommendation that approved uh 357.70 from councillor fisher 's discretionary fund for the rockhampton horticultural society for prize money at the agricultural show council fisher has left the meeting so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that recommendation move councillor wickerson second and councillor smith um speakers four speakers against i 'll put the motion those in favor carried thank you we 'll invite councillor fischer back into the room cutting a cup of coffee it was in unanimous decision so it was councillor mathers yep councillor wickerson council rutherford councillor smith council of kirkland and council of action and myself yes let 's just wait for cancer fisher to come back into the room and then we 'll move on to the next item which 8.2 with councillor smith will yeah do i go now wait for councillor if you like you welcome the game that 's the downside of leaving the room isn 't it that um these things occur so i think councillor smith has asked for a uh increase in that allocation so yeah that uh the recommendation is that a donation of one thousand dollars from council smith 's discretionary fund towards grace new school uh 150th birthday celebration scholarship mover in a second and moved councillor fischer second to councillor wickerson put that those in favor please suppose thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wickerson cancer rutherford councillor kirkland and cancel election and myself okay thank you council we 'll move on to officers report uh advanced rockhampton the capricorn tender quote for cons consideration plan okay uh greg would you like to speak to that report please yes good morning uh mayor and councillors uh this is uh just the tender and consideration plan under under the act uh that we must submit through council basically just showing how we will uh go out to quotes and or tenders and expressions of interest for anything to do with the capricorn event so it 's not the running of the event it 's just the tender consideration plan okay just to process um greg that needs to be uh submitted and to the table so i 'm happy to move his recommended secret second at councillor wickerson i 'll put that those in favor against carried unanimously uh moving on to item 9.2 the 2021 rockhampton agricultural show approval for payment of prizes yes councillor smith asking if i 've got a conflict of interest being a member of the committee no that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're wiped with that one council smith uh again greg yes sir mayor and councils i hope this is a there 's another formality like the previous one uh it basically is just seeking approval because of the number of prizes and the small amounts and nature of them uh that price will be paid in cash rather than as the policy currently says will be paid in other forms uh annette and tash and the team have been guided through the policy and the handling of cash and the procedures around that so i probably don 't have a lot more to add that it is really a unique event as we know the show and on this side it does require cash rather than fbos or other forms no that 's uh that 's understand sustainable greg just um with that that style and and um what uniqueness that that shows bring so um council if there 's no no questions on this one moved by councillor smith i have a second councillor mathers i 'll put that those in favor against carried thank you councillors unanimous decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driveway and verges in wackwood street park avenue um peter coeffered good morning mayor and councillors okay this report is in response to a notice of motion that was raised on the 13th of april calling for a report on wackford street and in relation to pathways the background of this project is that following cyclone marsha there was a significant flood event that occurred in wackford street and the surrounding streets council resolved to investigate and look at mitigation of that project the outcome of that investigation was a fairly major re-grading of the road was required to create an overland flow path away from the properties those works were designed and constructed over a period of about 18 months work commenced in may 19 to 19 and concluded in april 2020 because of it being a retrofit there was a lot of difficulty in creating this with middle impactor services and driveways eventually that work was done in terms of design and each individual driveway had to be designed in conjunction with the owner to try and get it to the best outcome that was possible effectively we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end result has been that that work has been completed there has been one owner dissatisfied that complaint has was lodged at council around october last year it has been also the subject of a administrative review internally and the ombudsman both of those reviews have determined that council has acted at this stage appropriately the request by the owner is for the construction of a garden bed on the road reserve that would reduce the slope and maybe reduce maintenance by for the owner because because we 've steeped the driveway technically that the section to be made is slightly longer because it 's a little bit longer so that 's all i think i need to say councillor kirkland um thank you mr chair uh yes this is in my division and um the the resident concerned contacted me and so i 've been out numerous times to check the property and being in my patch i 'm actually quite familiar with the area and i feel that perhaps there this comment has been made or what 's the precedent that it said if i were to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just want to pre-load that with a little bit of commentary if that 's okay with you mr chair so the original gradient has considerably changed and if i were a property owner and council came along and changed the verge of my property it effectively changes the the appeal the market appeal to that property and so i would be expecting that council would provide for me something that would maintain or achieve a similar market appeal personally if this were my property i would be expecting council to remediate to to uh to be compliant to my request of reducing that verge reducing that gradient now where to represent all of the residents and where to represent them all and give them all good consideration that 's our job as council i note that uh here in this review it says that uh the ombudsman has said that the council 's risk you know that they 've done the right thing and there 's nothing else to be done however i want to take us to our operational plan page five this is where we 're talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and actions have the customer and community at the front of mind we engage with and listen to the customer we support each other to achieve the best outcome for the customer in this instance the customer has come to us and is not satisfied so i would also like to point out the three r 's here at council that we quite often refer to responsibility respect and reputation and i believe that our reputation is on the line when we have customers taking us to the ombudsman i 'd like to put forward information i think we 're getting into debate it may need to move move the emotion right and then after the motion and do it yeah yeah can i ask a question yeah question first council smith oh yeah um look i haven 't been briefed on whackford street but i i 'm well aware of it and in the report i was hoping to see the millions that we spent on this street trying to rectify their flood mitigation i just need to ask um peter if this great uh the gradient on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um we we can 't lower the gradient of this property it 's the geometry that exists there so um there will be no change to the gradient of this property we 've we 've lowered as much as possible with this and other driveways by taking the driveway within the property boundary which lowers it but it won 't affect flooding the only change that could occur here is if we constructed additional retaining walls or something like that in our road reserve can i just make the comment that um in plenty of instances in my 17 years on council especially when we bitumen a road we build it up the driveways all change and council do their utmost and on one road yeah that will be debating more than a question so if you you need to um put the word um so through you to peter a couple of questions around the garden bed and i 'm i 'm in favor of garden beds generally but will they have we seen designs of it do we know if there 's still a clear access way for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constructed question one um there is no design i 'm not going to say we can guarantee there will be still pedestrian access because i think there 'll be a concrete retaining wall across the pathway um yeah there 's been no investigation because the driveways the twin driveways has built um council officers believe we 've gone above and beyond what is required and it 's accessible to cars is the is the the crossfall of the footpath now um does that create a risk for pedestrians in your opinion um not really no it 's it 's not i don 't think it 's a heavily trafficked area but i don 't see it as a risk no it 's just a grass verge so it 's not so steep you can 't walk walk on it without flipping over yeah probably it 's the third one too if if the garden bed were to be built how high would it be to level it down would it would that create another risk of traffic or pedestrians falling off it can 't answer that no there 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah thank you okay i 'd like to propose that council design and construct a garden bed on the verge to reduce the gradient do we have a seconder cancer rutherford now speakers four yeah okay so i 've probably already have spoken to everything i think uh that we 've all heard that i believe that the if it were my property absolutely i would be expecting a little bit more from council to remediate my property back to where it was it was actually one of the showpiece properties in the street and it 's now not definitely not just a question councillor is there a cost limit or um what would you do that 's a good question mr mayor um not quite sure where to go with that do i need to nominate a cost to the to the that 's a bit i don 't think that 'd be possible i think i think if we just do the design um i don 't know mr ceo i 'm seeking your advice on that whether i have to nominate a figure i think it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council want to go we 'd have to scope it up and give some type of limitation around it because there 's no money in your capital budget peter probably a question there 'd be no money for it so that 's one part no there 's a little bit of variation within it but and i don 't want to pick a figure because i think i could get it wrong okay i see some other lights on other questions or they um is it the procedural motion that we 're following uh the process were they questions or speakers um again probably more explanation i i think so probably speaker okay i 've got a question question cancellers is it possible to see an overhead of where we 're talking about because i just can 't picture this garden then um where it would go is it possible just to see an overhead of that street in that property peter through the chair my only concern with that is we this is a um open report and we will potentially be identifying a property an individual councillor mothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a statement about it on i 'm wearing formal uh debate at the moment so i 'd speak against councillor rutherford yes can we um suspend it in standing orders that 's what i 'm looking for thank you suspense we have a second uh cancellation move councillors rutherford second and councillor wickerson that we suspend standing orders i 'll put that those in favor against carried cancer mothers thank you very much mr may um i drove past last night and had a bit of a a look at the property in question uh and one of the things one of the questions through you to peter just before i ask the question i did actually spend a bit of time just looking there and notice that there 's a property on the side of the property in question and the gradient that is from the footpath up to the fence line is the same on the other two so so it 's it 's not that this one property is steeper than any other properties there 's three properties in a row um to my eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steep but i do understand that the person in question may not be as mobile as as as the neighbors next door so i totally understand that one of the questions over i don 't understand what a um what a garden bed would do for that in to my mind if we were going to do something if we were going to do something that we 'd either put a retaining wall dig down at the fence line and level it that way or or we 'd put a retaining wall up at the road edge and go and go across but you know you wouldn 't want to do that because then you 've got to you can 't park against the road so i don 't see what a garden bed 's going to achieve i would think if we were going to do anything it 'd be more about cutting into the the property side of the of the footpath but to my eye the gradient you know we 're not talking like this we 're talking a a a a certainly a more than walkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd realize it 's we 're not it 's not steep and it is quite a wide footpath uh i understand it could be hard for the for the residents so i 'm in two minds here i 'm not sure thanks councilman it 's council rutherford um mr mayor a bit of a statement but it has got a question to it as well i think and um so the resident also contacted me and i think um it 's getting a little elderly and the fact that the the road reserve footpath area has increased in size it means it 's more for him to maintain he 's also very um quite proud of his lawn in his garden and he 's having trouble when he waters this the water is running down because it 's now sloped it 's running down and running through onto the the road so it 's it 's hard for him to keep green it 's hard for him to maintain so um and he 's getting frustrated by that i think this has become a little bigger than it needed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that really he was just after some trees and some mulch to catch the water and and reduce the area that he had to maintain and and would catch the water to stop it from from running away so i don 't think it was a really big request i think it was just a matter of certainly the way he put it to me putting some some trees and some mulch down um on that slope to try and you know reduce the area and and as i said catch the water from running away so a question to peter is is in your opinion that not possible um well the request received by council officers wasn 't to put some trees there i mean if he wanted to put some trees there he could have had him in and growing by now we would have approved that properly but the request was the construction of a garden bed to change slope which means retaining walls okay so that that 's not what um what i got uh the the request to me was could we plant some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sure what the councillor fisher yeah and actually what council rutherford has so just said is in my own division i 've had a number of uh areas where we have done some work particularly where footpaths have gone in and council has made available mulch and trees but have not gone to the extent of actually constructing retainer walls or gardens but i know council williams and ice worked very closely with residents along towson road when the pathway went through there the similar sort of complaints were first put through and peter 's team worked with the residents they were able to to address uh the changes of the slope and uh i know mulch was made available and and plants and the residents actually looked after that themselves um so i think that was probably something that i see is more more doable than to go to uh sort of the experi expense of of doing an individual retainer wall because i can sort of see that we 're going to be this will sort open a floodgate of uh other grievances throughout the entire rockhampton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mr man thank you i 'd just like to bring it back to the original reason we might we might uh uh resume um standing overs and so we go back to the debate then so we can wrap this one up so uh i 'm happy to proceed your measurement that we that we resume um the meeting i 'll move that i 'll put that to the table as in favor i 'm carried okay so we 're back into debate uh we you 've spoken to the motion counselor kirkland do we have a speaker speaker against councillor smith yeah thanks mr mayor um this is this has happened on a lot of occasions um when we especially when bituminous road people 's driveway changes i could name a lot of roads where that 's happened to uh in my division over the years and council does their best to make sure that those people can still get back into their properties and and if there 's further works to be done on a a property owner who who paid to get extra work done but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place so i think you know if we do this for this person it 's certainly setting a precedence but it 's also going outside what we normally do and like it 's been to the ombudsman and they 've said that we we acted correctly and i 've got complete faith in our offices that they 've made the correct decision here and i think um it 's like all these people um in the rural areas if you need more done more you pay to get it done okay another speaker for the motion speakers for the motion so i 'll let you wrap up the debate councillor kirkland thank you thank you mr chair so i 'll bring it back to the original works that started out at wakford street were to provide a new advantage to the residents who were previously disadvantaged by works that some of the works that council had done so the new works in wakford street advantaged the residents on the opposite side of the road and have now somewhat disadvantaged the residents on the on the lower side of wackford street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i read about earlier i just want to remind that to to speak out that in a business situation sometimes we get dissatisfied customers and sometimes it 's necessary for us to look after that customer in order to show them that we care and that we 're considerate of their grievances this grievance has gone as far as going to the ombudsman and then there was still dissatisfaction with that and they 've come to councillors and they 've asked to put it to the table i 've brought it to the table today because i in good faith believe that if this was my property i in fact would be requesting that council remediate further to assist in reducing that slope or making that slope manageable so i would like to appeal to council to think on the the three hours responsibility respect and reputation and what this precedent we 're talking about precedent what the precedent of of denying um this particular application would mean rather than the precedent that it would set for others i wanted to i mentioned earlier in uh when i was talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people across council across the region have the opportunity anytime individuals to come to us and to appeal for things that they feel that they 've been unfairly or unjustly dealt so this is one of those and i believe this is one of those times where we need to look after the customer first okay thanks kinsler kirkland i 'll just wait for the minutes to gonna take it to catch up okay thank you councillors the formal debate has concluded uh i 'll now put that motion uh those in favor those opposed motion is lost thanks counselor moving on to item 9.4 the material change you use for a dwelling house building envelope canceller maters did you want to speak to this one or just live with the officers i think the officers should be able to run through this already okay thank you morning councillors um so the subject application is for an mcu for drawing house it 's for a building envelope for a drilling house at 625 montgomery street lakes creek okay the proposals for a 652 square meter building envelope to accommodate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of the hill on a relatively part uh flat part of the site with access to be gained via an internal driveway which connects into a private access in an unformed road reserve and that are links up with dolly street on the south there so this application required impact assessment as it is affected by a special management area overlay this is because of the industrial uses in the area including lakes creek meat works and borrel the site is uh has a significant separation distance from these uses it 's about 350 metres from borel as you can see i guess you 're looking at west southwest and uh also over a kilometer from the meat works many processing facilities there are a total of two probably made submissions made against the applications with both submissions related to the same property they expressed concerns with slope stability drainage erosion bushfire hazard and clearing of vegetation however the submitter 's concerns have been addressed by the applicant and where necessary suitable conditions have been imposed to mitigate and manage associated matters proposals consistent with the rural zone generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compromise the strategic framework for the playing scheme therefore it 's recommended for approval this application i have a question council smith probably um that planner wouldn 't have been here in those days but is this the property that we went up that time in the car to have a look at yes so either that access or wherever it is it 's going to be bitumen and from the internal one gravel so i 'm not sure if that i think the way we went up was from dawley street montgomery street was the the road that we went off the road yeah this the proposal is not to form montgomery street it 's the other side the side yeah okay but that is correct in the unformed raid reserve they will have to do sealed bitumen and then internal they can do gravel to get up the hill so where you say internal where is that point oh let 's go back to the planes to show you um it was more so just saying there 's a dooley street we have an unformed road reserve so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 70 meters will be bitumen uh we 'll see what benjamin and then internal where it sort of winds up the hills all gravel internal to their boundary that 's a quite wooded area would they remove all the trees out of that road reserve to construct that road i think that area is actually relatively clear there 's not a lot of trees in that area in the road reserve part i don 't think it was substantial but yes they will have to remove what 's necessary to accommodate the access yeah i think you 'll find that it is quite wooded um with some large trees on there that 'll need to be removed and again there 's the sediment that if that creates a hard stain for that water to run off where that water catches onto dooley street um that 's all be captured in that design from that construction in terms of are you talking about erosion like yeah so we 've we 've got a geotake assessment done off the site of the access um they said versus now versus what it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's very minimal change there 's going to have to be detailed design elements in terms of the access construction that they 're going to have to consider so to make sure that water 's spread that 's generated and these sorts of things when they do when they go in there if they figure out that the actual surface isn 't going to be suitable they 're going to have to replace it with suitable materials so there 's not going to be erosion and those sorts of things it 's a lot of those are more detailed operational works considerations the slope stability demonstrated there 's minimal risk given the uh given the slope given the soil composition minimal risk of those sort of issues but those things will be investigated when they do technical operational works when they do the detail design they will figure out the um the specific designs of the drainage and everything like that have you been on to the site to look at that that road reserve i 've seen the road reserve yes i 've been up to the pad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haven 't been internal to see what that 's going to look like it 's it 's impossible because it is quite dense but yeah i have visited the site yes yeah okay just just worried about erosion on a steep steep uh steep hillside and heavy rainfall where that water will be directed or where it could possibly end up especially with the number of those residents at the bottom of that steep hill um what any impact if any if they 're removing vegetation and putting a road in there that could potentially um have erosion if it 's only you say road based material on that internal internal will be road boats okay i 'll just have some concerns around that i see a number of other lights on so i 'll go to councillor mothers and then councillor wickerson thanks again thanks very much mr mayor um mr mayor i agree with you in the in the fact that the raid reserve is uh heavily wooded um but in regards to erosion i was actually more concerned about that 300 meter mark going into the private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's obviously directly behind a couple of the properties but i sort of see in the report that it 's been set out that there 's got to be proper drainage system there to disperse the water so they can 't collect into one area and cause erosion so that was my major concern with it but i have to be led by the officers and the fact that that will be you know if it goes ahead that will be built our inspectors will go and make sure that that water is dispersed correctly because i think that 's that 's our main issue as far as drainage goes more so than the more so than the road reserve road itself and that was included following um following the geotape assessment that was a specific thing that they recommended so that was what we included as part of their recommendations thank you thanks cancer made this council wickerson um thanks mr mayor through you uh live in the just on google the the actual access to the pad now is off montgomery street it looks like it 's moderately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than build the new one up it sort of runs up or in terms of i don 't think it was achievable slope spores for them to do that um i think there 's yeah there is uh like road reserves council road reserve surrounding it so there 's probably some informal trails and things like that that they have been using we got up there from yeah i believe montgomery street we had to go that way forward drive a lot of fun but yeah it 's it is quite steep to get up that hill so it was going to be easier for them to actually go the other way and wrap around slowly up the hill yeah um i was noting the report i have concerns about the bushfire risk with it i know i think there were fires through that area last last fire the steepness of it and the the vegetation they would sort of lend itself to being a good fire in the report it says that the the new access road up with the switchbacks would actually aid rural fire brigade getting up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that that 's yeah i mean it 's we 've got maximum grades of um i think roughly 17 which is what the rcmdg allows um speaking to the fieries i had conversations not something on record but in terms of that they thought it would actually improve their ability to get up the bridge the the submitters were talking about being an issue but it 's actually going to be much easier for them to get up there given they 're going to have a constructed access um the updated bushfire assessment figured out the setbacks and the design so the actual the actual constructed access will have some separation from vegetation either side to make sure it doesn 't cross over either so that 's all part of like the um bushfire code and the queensland fire emergency services sort of guidelines so that 's regarding the house itself and the access as well so there 's no crossover across the access so everything 's going to be designed in accordance with that and that 's the same thing with turning circles as well that 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay thank you thank you thanks councilworkers and councillor fisher yes thank you mr mayor um i was probably a couple of things one of the areas one of the deficiencies i think we we have is that on some of these fire risk areas i 'd love to have a little bit more scope there are plants that are natural fire plants that can actually act as a buffer there are also plants that many people use in virus areas that are highly flammable i 'd love to have a mechanism that we could in our approval even sort of recommend that you know with landscaping and sort of buffers along driveways and things like that that we could have these natural fire breaks i when these type of applications come in that 's always the first place that i look and i was encouraged by that the road could actually be a benefit for uh getting the small fire tenders up uh to control the fires and anyone that sort of lives close to the bush fires over time that 's always a bonus but it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could flag that our plant palette um if that was upgraded that we could also look at that to actually give uh planners a little bit more mechanism where uh you could sort of give an advisory note or something like that that could actually assist people in this in these sort of applications it has some difficulties but i think that i actually saw benefits in the actual fire management just one comment on that um so when that part of the bushfire assessment around the house like they have a fuel free area so that can be certain plants and things like that having you can still have trees but it has to be you know spread out a certain distance so that 's all part of the bushfire plan that they they provided yeah okay council there 's no further questions could i seek a mover in a second or with regards to the officer 's recommendation move councillor kirkland second councillor mathers i 'll put that those in favor those opposed nations carried thank you moving on to 9.5 the request for a minor change extension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from my changing extension the currency period for d20 2017 it 's one into three lots and access easement at 66 alpha road parkers so the applicants minor change request is purely related to the access arrangement for proposal at one so the existing approval they were going to get access from mcmillan road there to the to the east and now they 're just proposing to get access through proposed lot two because that would require them constructing mcmillan and um doing some work that all of the street as well so the uh the second part of the request was an extension the currency period which is basically just going to keep their application active until the end of the year for them to complete it um so summary the proposed changes the conditions are included in the report and um this is recommended for approval subject to those conditions thank you councillors any questions to bevan if not could i seek a move in a second or with regards to that report move councillor may the second council of latcham i 'll put that those in favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green waste management michael thank you ken slatson did you want to talk to her that michael leave the report thank you good morning mr mayor and councillors uh so the purpose of this report is to seek council endorsement for introducing greenways fees uh the key objective was to at the beginning when we looked at this was to recover a reasonable level of cost while providing an affordable solution for the responsible management of green waste so currently the management of green waste costs council a little over seven hundred thousand dollars per annum and as council will be aware we currently do not charge for for the acceptance of green waste at any of our facilities so a number of options have been looked at um and the recommended recommendation being put forward is introduce fees and charges on the basis of thirty dollars per ton for both domestic and commercial greenways customers with an equivalent per unit charge per load charge for domestic customers this recommendation we would expect would raise 500 000 worth of revenue which would reduce that cost to council from that 700 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fees and charges were recovered within the report there 's a number of reasons why this recommendation is being put forward i won 't go into detail on those but certainly happy to answer any questions thank you okay thank you michael questions councillor councillor fisher yes mr mayor look this one was something that was very close to my heart and i know that when we first went to uh dropping the fees for green waste it was something that during budget deliberation and i know the mayor of the day basically said if you can find the savings we 'll do it and at that time the cost of uh sort of working with the green waste and processing the green waste at rockhampton facilities was under 250 000. i think was probably closer to 200 000 in that time from when we first introduced those to now it 's gone up by three times and just in this really tough local government uh economic environment it 's just come to one of those ones that just the cost of that processing of their green waste has become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hard decision and i i know the work that michael and his team have looked at every way but sometimes you just get to a point where it has just got to where the cost of processing green waste is is something that we we just can 't sort of expect the collective of all ratepayers to actually chip in so this report is one that really sort of puts it you know the cold hard facts of the changes of just the economy of processing sort of many of the things in green waste i 'll be supporting the resolution or the recommendation thanks canceler fisher councillor smith probably um mr may just to comment um i i agree and you know we 've been through it with the workshops and everything but i am concerned about illegal dumping i think that 's what will happen and that was a problem in the 2009 bushfires in northampton so i am concerned um i think a lot of people were a little lighter in their backyards now in the rural areas and probably cause bushfires but it is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of illegal dumping to clean up ken so i think we could review um that scenario in 12 months time to see how let 's hear that uh the impact of of of this could be so um i think that 's an option to to consider um should that should that occur then we could review it again councillor rutherford mr mayor i was thinking on the same lines and maybe even a dot point here that this be reviewed um in 12 months so that we know what impacts whether we 've reached target you know i guess revenue wise but also what other impacts have come about from it yep because that 's what we 're actually doing so yeah okay i think that uh that gives us that uh opportunities to come back and and reset if uh if need be but uh that that allows that um process to cover some of those dots councillor rutherford that says fees which is part of it but i 'm just wondering whether we can add something that also talks about um any impacts or effects process maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mayor through just a comment and i absolutely agree with what council smith was saying about the uh to acknowledge that there is it 's likely that it 's going to be more illegal dumping but just to commend michael and his team for being proactive uh i noticed the um the campaign already started these digital boards out and i 've had some media on it so that 's a good idea to get in front of that um to preempt the recommendation resolution today but just to try and get a message out there to keep an eye out on that because like counselors i expect it will come you know people are lazy and and i won 't want to spend a couple of dollars to pay but they 're good to get in front of it rather than react to it later on okay counselors if they 're no further questions can i seek a mover in a second or with regards to this recommendation move council election we have a second council of fisher put that those in favor carried unanimously thank you councillors moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ update as the 30th of april 2021. thank you christine sorry not used to sitting at this scene presented to you today for adoption and management 's quarterly update of the risk registers and the annual presentation of the corporate and operational risk registers each quarter the risk registers are reviewed and updated by management and those that have a high very high or catastrophic current risk rating and or those that are undergoing treatment are presented to council for adoption usually via the audit and business advisory committee meeting process depending on the timing of their meetings additionally every risk is presented annually so council can determine that its risks are being dealt with in an appropriate manner and they are in agreeance with the tolerance levels accepted by management so the registers are presented for adoption and happy to take any questions you cassand councillors questions to concern again that such a large organization that carries along with a lot of risk and residual risks and and the level of risk and making sure that they captured and understood throughout the organisation as we move forward is something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that report coming back to highlight any areas that that need detention but it 's great to uh to be able to have that report provided back on the number of risks and where they 're associated and what the what those actions entail counselor kirkland thank you mr chair cassan i note that um the in our little pie charts there 's a lot of red throughout here with regards to community services and regional services is that something that we need to be concerned by or can you elaborate on that a little bit for me so the there isn 't really a lot of red it 's orange i 'd be more worried if it was red so our color scheme is like a bit like a traffic light system but there 's a few additional colors in there so if you see red it stands for catastrophic orange would be a high um yellow is a moderate and green is a lie so sorry should have gone to specsavers so no no that 's fine so if you have a look if you have a look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually telling you if you see that there 's a lot of orange in that with a few little red ones right down the bottom and so that 's the top graph the second graph you 'll see that there 's a lot more yellow and the orange has been lessened the number of orange has been lessened so what 's that showing is that without any controls management has assessed the risks as being at that value with council putting in mitigation and controls and processes behind to manage that that has reduced that orange to a more manageable level so yes there will be orange there because um from a cost analysis at some point you can keep throwing money at things but it 's not significantly going to reduce the risk the risk is going to be the risk so you don 't want your risk sitting like at that catastrophic there 's hopefully something that you can do to bring that down so i suppose the long end that was the long answer in in in the short answer was if you 're happy to accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind it then the orange isn 't such a bad thing thank you guys man thanks cassin council there 's no further questions to that report i 'll take them over in a second and move cancel action have a second the council of kirkland i 'll put that those in favor carried thank you moving on to 9.8 the proposed fees and charges for 2021-22 okay thanks very much manny thank you mr mayor good morning mayor and councillors so today we 're presenting the 21 22 fees and charges for adoption by council as you recall councillors we 've workshopped the fees and charges and had some commentary around this when we were framing our budget our proposed increases to fees and charges have been around the two to two and a half percent uh as applied however there have been some exceptions to that percentage increase such as in uh our dog registration fees which have gone up by a ten dollar lump sum and also our development and planning application type of fees which have gone up around the 10 in the fees and charges we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separately by michael earlier so that will form part of the overall published fees and charges however our our presentation today is excluding those greenways fees and charges pending the decision of council there were a number of changes that were identified in the summary that was presented with the report i 'm not sure whether anyone has any questions to that but we do have a couple of alterations to those that have resulted from recent discussions around the heritage village and also in relation to weddings charges which were struck out of the original fees and charges which are to be returned when we publish those those documents i 'm not sure alicia whether you wanted to talk about the heritage village fees thanks mani so i 'm sorry that i missed yesterday 's session um so from tuesday 's workshop last week we had some discussion around what the proposal is and that was to reduce the entrance fees to the heritage village because of the timing with the agendas they had already gone through as per um it 's the proposal that we 'll bring back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making an amount i would propose an amendment here but it 's not straightforward there 's quite a few lines that needs to be amended so i 'll bring that back to the next council meeting the other one was wedding oh just in terms of weddings yes and um my apologies that that had there was a few other lines on that same page that had been inadvertently deleted that we 'd rectified but that one was missed so that would just mean that the fraser park weddings is like 122.50 so just finally closing out while i 'm standing here with the microphone is around the child care fees that was a question and just comparatively against our competitors we 're already above for our competitors so there 's sort of just that pressure there in terms of competitive competitiveness so that 's it for me thank you thanks lisa um manny have you finished i 've got some lights on yeah no i think i 'm finished unless there are questions that we need to address okay uh councillor smith had a lie down first thing council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come out of left field for me and i could have um had to go early when we had a workshop or whatever i missed it was um the white goods we 're charging now for white goods eight dollars for fridges freezers and um microwaves etc and i think that 's something else that 's going to be dumped because people have had it free for so long i definitely don 't agree with that one it 's it 's a new one yeah but i don 't think so no it 's new yeah it 's right at the start of the report so so we didn 't workshop that one so to me that 's that 's as important as green waste you know whether we 're going to charge for green waste and i think we should have workshop whether we 're going to charge for white goods i think peter 's got a response that councillor smith 's comment that i think that fears has been existing for some time yeah no yeah no it 's no they 're free they 've been free for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new it 's a new feature can we take that one on notice and also the 10 increase in dog registration i remember talking about whether we were going to charge pensioners or not for the they could have two three dogs but i didn 't remember the other going up ten dollars so ten dollars on top of what we already charged yes so so why the large increase quite a large increase um and some people you know they 've got two dollars 20 dollars increases yeah so it was merely um improved cost recovery and improved budget position to bring that back yeah so we had excluded that fee for the pensioners so we definitely decided uh that and that 's in the proposal here but yes we were also proposing to increase the fees for dogs for 10. and yeah i thought we had discussed that at some length companion dogs too i think there was a you know like if it 's a uh seeing eye dog or things like that then they they 're excluded as well there 's only just uh and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and animal control so it 's just trying to um to accommodate that so peter 's got a uh comment back on the white goods i 'll just add a bit more on the white goods i 'll get uh michael to explain it but where you 've seen the figure where often it was a cso so council was paying for it that 's the so it is a new fee we 've flipped it from a csa to a fee yeah so all what so all white goods that have gas in them so fridges freezers and air conditioners we pay a contractor to come in and and collect that gas and take it away to be appropriately disposed of so that costs us in the order of six dollars per unit and as peter said we 've been charging council of cso for that ever since i 've been with council so this year when we 're just looking at all of our fees we were trying to reduce that cso and again go back to the user 's pay principle okay thanks michael um council election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just got a couple of things to highlight i 've tried enlarging there 's a line here water usage rate for water that is not used for residential purposes is that three dollars a kiloliter it could be a five but is it a three and is that full then obviously commercial so we raised it from a dollar ninety to three dollars that 's your money uh sorry council action are you looking in the summary or are you in your summary in summary yeah there 's a it 's a it 's a bit blurred the figures cancer we might uh well i don 't know i 've got a second one as well so the next one is is an opportunity i see for the table uh when it comes to the swimming pools so without impacting on the actual budget it doesn 't impact at all on the budget we could look at the entry fees to be free like many other councils and towns be at early beach be it proserpine many other other centres have free swimming pools and this is an opportunity without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entry fee to be free to encourage more people to use our great facilities council is it who covers that cost though it 's the rest of the ratepayers at the moment under the new contract the amended contract the actual sc gets that money to offset the cost of running the pool that 's the thing against the brotherhood as a chair of parks i 'll ask to speak to this there definitely is an impact to budget because if the leasee can 't collect that money council will have to make that up um with what we give them to run the pools so that very much is an impact to budget i propose that in the future we look at a work have a workshop on the swimming pools um the operations and whether they 're not that 's part of the process we do that all the time so if there 's something there that you believe we need to ask for a report yeah i think that 's going to be the appropriate way to um to address it rather than um at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ season i just said there was an opportunity so yeah not sure we 've got to have the report on that just before we make a change like that um it 's not something just a strike of a pen it 's got to be understood the impacts and ramifications of a of a change of that scale and magnitude but we 'll um we 'll definitely if there 's opportunity there to reduce cost savings then we 'll always consider that uh ross did you have a question yeah mr mayor what was uh as a suggestion if you want to move forward like we had um council mentioned yesterday that they 'd like to look at the detail of fees just to get a better understanding of it for a while so we 've got that flag for the 29th of june to do that at the whole council session that 's been locked in now to that unless there 's any fees here that really stand out as really opposed to it if council were to adopt them they can change them any time during the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the time first of july is when they sort of the changes kick in um but we can pull out if they 're really opposed to any and then we can change them as we go through that the year as well they don 't have to be just as a suggestion yeah so council we like we mentioned yesterday that uh we did want to look at the the line items and go through a little bit more detail so we have that opportunity and as as ross has alluded to their fees and charges can be uh changed throughout the year at any time so uh this is an overall um resolution or recommendation um we can have that workshop and then if there 's anything there that we need to resolve or investigate then that we can move from there yeah just one final thing if i make it and obviously we 'll get confirmation of whether it is three dollars or not but if it is i 'm very concerned jumping for the water that 's from a dollar ninety to three dollars if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money yes it is three i can confirm that that 's three dollars a kiloliter um which is actually when you compare it other places will be charging up to five dollars a kiloliter for for water for out of a standpipe which would be what this is it 's bulk water is this is this commercial that 's not commercial sandpaper not standpoint standpipe oh sorry my misunderstanding yeah thank you so we 're well under the what others are charging so it 's not uh it 's not that that great councillor rutherford i 'll see a number of lots council of wickerson and councillor fisher thanks mr chair uh through you i just need some explanation more than clarification money just on uh car parking at the airport just why the increase isn 't a more uniform percentage increase why is it and it 's not even sort of a linear increase it 's sort of a bit all over the place i just didn 't understand why so yeah okay through the chair counselor wikis and i understand that marcus has done a fair bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in comparison to other locations and how it might actually um compare particularly because of um occupation and timing and and things like that so he 's done a fair bit around that that has reflected what it needs to be as he thinks based on the usage of those of the facilities and the timing okay councillor fisher yeah um and look i 've got to actually commend marcus because he put a lot of work into not just coming up with with sort of just a one-size-fits-all but actually just comparing our competitor airports and regional queensland and uh hopefully building now that part of our business so um i think that that 's one that was sort of above and beyond goes to what the original task from the council table was um i liked i still have concerns about the heritage village and the entry fee at the heritage village is one that i do feel that uh we need to to have that like the zoo um and there 's a uh free entry um there you go we have two dollar entries at certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just not getting the numbers through and um i think if we 're going to have a workshop i 'd like to raise that one as still one that i see prickles on um yeah it 's one i 'm not gonna die in a ditch uh fighting but i would love to have a little bit more discussion and i know that when that came up just recently there was only half the councillors at the workshop and it would be good to have a little bit more discussion and that councillor rutherford um yeah mr mayor i 'm a little bit concerned about the three dollar water charge as well because i think we 're hitting our rural community at a time when they 're in drought and that water is very precious to them now you know i don 't know what that necessarily means for us this has sort of popped in and i i take the point that it 's much cheaper than other places but the timing really couldn 't be worse for our community so i 'm just wondering whether we can have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council it might be like there are a number of issues that have been raised at the table today so that workshop uh from the 29th if we can capture the uh the sentiment from the table i think we 'll we 'll workshop that in detail and again like the fees and charges can be changed at any time so uh if we can um add that to the to the workshop and then go through and and understand the reasons why those charges are coming all across and i 'll take take your point that uh yeah if if it is what the what the overall cost coming from those standpipes are um not aware uh and what that impact would be how great or or how small that is just an understanding what that uh what that is but then being mindful about what other areas are charging as well just to make sure that we 're not out uh under pricing ourselves in one area as well so councillors i think we 've we 've probably stretched out a number of issues there today in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a second to adopt the officer 's report and then have a further meeting on the fees and charges we can discuss those other items at that time so move councillor kirkland second on councillor wickerson i 'll put that those in favor those opposed carried unanimously thank you councillors moving on to notice emotions nil questions mill urgent business questions counselors anything come out there we do have one item to be dealt with in closed session and there 's a recommendation that that the meeting move into closed session to to the public to discuss the following items which is considered confidential in accordance with section 254 j 3 of the local government regulations 2012 for the reasons indicated the chief executive officers performance review i 'll read the other in accordance with section 254 j3 in the local government regulations 2012 that is considered necessary necessary to close the meeting to discuss the appointment discipline or dismissal of the chief executive officer performance review of the chief executive officer so i 'm happy to move that we move in the closed session second and council of fisher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and

assessment under our delegation for january 22. thanks very much tania i just hold it the ceo of my daughter uh has just purchased a property um and i remind me i 'll ask a ceo to the deputy mayor to uh take the thing but i 'll need to record it first yes that 's correct that my daughter 's purchased the property at 40 um it 's only recent so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there there 's a removal of a house uh from that property there so i 'll uh declare that one and i 'll leave the room for um the decision on that as a neighbouring property too yeah so we 'll just identify it as the development application d 9 20 22 mcu removal of dwelling in house character demolition overlay yeah okay that 's it yep okay so um i 'd say did we just move that one or the whole items well it 's up to yourself up to the council table you could leave the whole lot or just exclude that one there this is always the issue we have with these reports yep as it 's just a report i might exclude myself from the whole this whole item and then come back after that one so i 'll leave the room now and then leave that one for the decision so we 're getting just sorry miss maybe we 've just missed a couple parts then so you 're just going to leave this one separate or you 're just going to leave the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah tighten it up rather than try and separate it um you have to name the person here that 's pretty okay councillors um tanya we might just uh question you to to just run through this report yep good morning councillors um this is the decision to under delegation report for january um there are some that are impact accessible that may come to council for table for a decision the recommendation is the report be received okay councillors anyone have any questions to any of those those items in item 10.1 no moved councillor smith seconded cancel action all those in favor and that 's carried i should have actually asked you that my apology let 's do this okay thanks councillors we 'll move on to item 10.2 minor change to a development permit for a material change of use for multiple dwelling 18 dwellings okay good morning mayor and councillors we 've received a minor change application to a um development application or permit for multi-unit dwellings that we approved which was approved at council in august last year um there 's only fairly minor changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to retain the existing dwelling on lot three decrease the number of three bedrooms bedroom dwellings from 17 to 16 and reduce on-site car parking from 47 to 40. um so if we go can i go to the next one so that 's a location on penny quick street and the next one um you 'll see that 's the existing site plan and you 'll see there 's two units um fronting penny quick street there and with the next slide i 'll move that through here um you 'll see that they 're retaining the existing house fronting penny quick and and not building one of the new units there so that 's the reduction in the number of units car parking was simply just a reduction in just due to that unit and also for the fact that they had additional car parks on there that weren 't required under our scheme so therefore the app um we consider the changes reasonable and recommending it for approval thanks amanda um portfolio spokesperson councilman there 's a comment there any comment counsellors amanda did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move councillor motors uh seeker seconder councillor smith i 'll put that those in favor opposed motions carried unanimously thanks very much amanda moving on to 10.3 the naming of the pass road for grace meer as who has that one martin no we might have to crack a whip you 're on [Music] [Laughter] the um the naming of the overpass road grace me um i think that 's the first time i 've been caught apologies uh counselors and mayor yeah caught talking i 'm not much of a talker um yes i 'm presenting this on behalf of stewart who 's unfortunately away today 's apologies from stuart but this is in relation to a customer request we 've received for a property out gracia near the grace may overpass who prior to the overpass being built had a property address that were fronted capricorn highway since the overpass was built their driveway access now fronts the road that connects the overpass and so they sort a change of address from council when council went and looked at its gis system we had a name there uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the gis system is that come through on the tmr construction plans so it was essentially just an as constructed plan and a name given so there 's never really officially been a name adopted for that road um i suppose to cut a short story short it would be there are a number options available to council and this this particular property owner is waiting now for council 's decision on whether they continue with bridge access road uh probably more likely known as the grace mayor industrial access road is probably the second option third option is we do have a policy that suggests that council go out to consultation the reason where i suppose thinking about short-circuiting that is that this particular property owner has been given a name already is halfway through changing all their addresses over and things like that and we 've asked them just to put that on hold while we get a council decision on what the name should be going forward so from a council officer perspective the pragmatic viewpoint is that and it 's our understanding that it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that be the name that it 's given but uh in council 's hands thanks martin and again i think it 's a good report around that that decision-making process and thanks for explaining that uh first i 've seen a number of lights on i firstly go to councillor smith as the uh both the infrastructure chair but also the uh the member for for gracemere as well so uh any comments from from yourself councillor smith just need your light up just need your light cancer um the grace me community voice uh at one meeting um put a suggestion in to name the bridge as well but it was sort of similar to that it was they were trying to keep the name malki that was always known as the melky area m-a-l-c-h-i you see the milky um nine-mile road etc but i don 't think that ever got legs sort of thing so i think just to name the road at this stage would be good yeah okay thank you uh councillor fischer and then uh councillor rutherford cancer fisher yes mr mayor i know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but i actually think this is a very smart naming because it does help to promote the gracemere industrial area and i think that this was probably timely um with what is happening to to the west of of gracemere so i think this is a really good idea and sometimes there things outside policy actually work out to the benefit of the the greater community and this is one of them and through the chair that 's probably the reason we don 't like bridge access road it 's very nondescript it 's not describing the location giving an indication what what it 's really servicing thanks cancellation no again not um together the you know we don 't like to go outside the policy and in public consultation it 's a big part of of local government and what we 're about but when uh when we have a situation like this one it does make sense to uh to look outside the box so to speak cancer rutherford um yeah i guess i sort of had a little different opinion there in that i figure if this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked them which option they would prefer i don 't believe we 've asked the particular reason there 's one resident that 's involved yeah uh no i don 't think we 've consulted with her in relation to the name as such we 've only basically asked her to hang fire at the moment on changing all her addresses yeah and that 's probably was just my my concern given that we 've been told one address name and they 've started to use that now whether we hold on it doesn 't matter whether it 's a policy we follow the line of the policy or whether we name it ourselves it still means this person is going to have to go back and um change their address so i was just curious as to you know whether they would um prefer just to continue on as it is or or not cancel some yeah i 'm not sure there 's any more discussion around that but i think it 's it 's really self-explanatory the the reason and again i think what councilor fisher 's comments were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promoting that great smear area and that access in there is what it 's all uh it all points to really does uh does make sense so uh look uh council smith would you like to move sorry ok ok well we 've just got some clarification around the um the way that it comes out of the policy so we might move it move to our next well if you lay them out on the table until um later on clarification yeah and then we 'll come back to it i guess okay guys okay because it is outside the policy council there may be some requirements that we need to do anyway so we 'll get that clarification so we 'll leave the matter lay on the table and move on to our next item and then come back to that one as i 'll move that we we move on to the little lay the matter on the table and move on to our next item and seconded with councillor kirkland i 'll put that cancels those in favor and pose motions carried unanimously just wait for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved and councillor kirkland seconded and the motion was carried unanimously karen council move on to 10.4 the morgan water supply security uh councillor smith has a conflict with this one and we 'll leave the room for the decision so we 'll do that one i 'm not sure his hands so i 'm sure we 've all got some questions with this one it 's been a um a while in the making but it 's a it 's a step on the pathway that we 've been um working on and the process that 's involved in that as we um look for a long-term strategy on the water permanent water supply for the for the man morgan community uh so i 'll hand over to andrew would you like to walk us through the report please thank you yes councillors when we after this we might move that we suspend standing orders so we can have some free um discussions in that but uh we 'll just hand over to andrew to uh to walk through the report first thank you andrew thank you mayor councillors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mount morgan uh water supply security project in the development of a business case uh in line with queensland treasury 's um project assessment framework so a preliminar evaluation has now been completed and the findings are presented in the report so i 'm just catching breath the council have uh commissioned aecom um to develop the business case and that they along with the council have done a comprehensive option analysis and modeling activities and a long list of options i have been presented and after assessment of all the options against a multi-criterion economic analysis the following options were shortlisted and assessed during the premium evaluation phase so base case option one do nothing base case option two continue water carting however at a supply rate of 1.2 mega liters a day which is double what we 're doing at the moment uh option three is a portable water line um connected to the gracemen network option four is a raw water pipeline connected to the stem or dam and option 4b sorry is a raw water pipeline connected to the sun water pipeline system so resulting from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most viable and reliable long-term solution for the water security at mount morgan so it councils now that they suppose a decision point on what option or options to take forward into the business phase its officer 's recommendation that council proceed to develop a portable water solution from gracemer as the most viable solution through to the final business case um today i have janice moody from associate director in water for acom has been the lead in developing the prelim evaluation so chancellor 's got a bit of a presentation and obviously uh answer any questions i 'm moving forward janice you might um yeah we might go to janice genesis presentation and then cancel then we 'll go to questions after that good morning janice thank you very much yeah mr marin councillors thank you for for having me today and to andrew and the team um so i 've been leading the the prelim evaluation and and moving into the business case phase i 've got abby carolyn here who is our team lead for water in our rockhampton office and abby 's been heavily involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um i 'm probably trying to condense a lot of work into a brief presentation um i 'm open to questions along the way if you think that 'll be the most suitable means to go through it rather than hold off to the end we can leave it as an open discussion and happy to answer questions along the way so um i 'll take you through what the project assessment framework means the methodology that we 've undertaken what we 're trying to seek from the project the options process and there 's a lot of focus on that and the rigor that 's gone into that how we 've shortlisted options and then in line with the framework how we 've evaluated those options okay so the project 's been conducted in accordance with the queensland treasury project assessment framework so um it 's it 's a pretty standard framework that 's been around for a number of years it aligns also to the building buildings queensland or the new uh department name their infrastructure frameworks so um all the work that 's been done like depending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approaching the work is adaptable to those other frameworks so normally within if you 're going through step by step in in a in the project assessment framework you would start off by doing a strategic assessment of service requirements and then moving to preliminary eval so what we 've done as a first step in the project is doing that sasr up front as a workshop with council with council 's project team and just so that everyone 's clear on what the objectives for the project are before we move into the optioneering phase so once you do the pre-limited valve there 's a whole point where you need to decide whether you 'll take it through the business case how you 'll fund that process um you know and they 're they 're on there 's other elements in in the like if you end up with a project that stacks up and you want to get funded then you have to do these the remaining steps there which is around supply strategies um where you could potentially source the project contractors designers all that sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then you start monitoring the performance of it and report on that through your benefits realization so it 's a fairly structured process so our pe has focused on looking at potential solutions for the mount morgan situation looking at appropriate costings so it 's not um we 've engaged vision as a quantity surveyor to actually do proper costings on on the project with the risk that we 've identified through the project um so that the variability in the cost is captured through the process you also have to look at your your non-cost aspects so you you pretty standard sort of triple bottom line quadruple bottom line um analysis so um social and environmental assessments um as well as the benefits that you 're gonna achieve from it and then your delivery model analysis is around how you deliver it how you how you deliver the design the construction um whether that 's a public private partnership um which tends to be for the much larger projects whether you go to design and construct straight construction traditional modes of delivery so that 's been done by our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done with vision and again all right so noting that council has done a lot of work over the years around mount morgan i guess the history with mount morgan is that um the number seven dam came to to to light when um the mine was coming to a closure at the same time that the town was experiencing a drought so um historically fletcher creek where uh was used as a supplier uh with a ball field there but that has been sort of demonstrated to be um basically dry by the time number seven dam gets dry so utilizing fletcher 's creek to supplement number seven dam is isn 't a feasible option and i 've got some information later on to demonstrate that um so number seven dan came about basically mine was closing handed over the council and um you know it was used as a mind supply and whether like the reliability was tested at the time but um i guess in terms of a water supply for a community it 's probably a difference of context to to what we 're looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ review we 've reviewed a lot of options that have been looked at historically as well as some more recent ones that have been looked at by council including this this work we did an investment logic mapping exercise which is part of the strategic assessment of service needs so what that process does is identify the key requirements for the project what benefits you 're trying to get and then what potential options there are to to resolve that so that 's done up front um demand assessment so we 've worked with the planning team to look at historical demand in the future demand projection growth within the community and you know any potential step changes in demand that we would have to cater for in providing a solution to the area looking at options a technical assessment and then the options filtering process multi-criteria and pe development so through the investment logic mapping process number one looking for sufficient water supply for mount morgan community we want to improve the road safety so the trucking at the moment is having an impact on road safety and conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morgan strategy so by providing secure water supply sort of underpinning that strategy and the outcomes desired with that one thing that came out of it was um queensland fire emergency service and their ability to actually respond to fire events so while you 're in a mode of trucking um when you 're designing a water supply system you have to have a certain amount of volume maintained in the reservoirs just held as reserve and that 's been difficult for council to maintain well while you 're doing this trucking and then an underlying objective which is related to your regulatory requirements under the water supply sector reliability act it 's making sure you can meet your customers customer service standards so it has to do with outages and pressure to the system and things like that that 's live sorry all right so and analyzing the demand so the green wiggly line is um our historical water usage up at mount morgan so it 's jumped around a lot over the years the gray line is a projection of that demand so about 330 liters per equivalent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residential person so any any of the non-residential users get converted to what we call an equivalent residential person okay so in looking at that in comparison to what you would ask a normal developer to do in a new development um council use uses the capricornian development guidelines which uh indicate 500 liters per person per day okay so already mount morgan is below that standard and we thought it would be appropriate to ensure that we 're planning for that 500 per person per day so it is higher than their historical usage but that 's also likely attributable to the long-term drought that 's been experienced in that community so they 're they 're pretty used to hardened demand conditions janice just sort of a question there councillor rutherford um janice i was just going to comment and i 'm assuming you 've accounted for it but i a lot of the matt morgan community have rain water tanks and they use that regardless of whether there 's water in the dam or not they tend to use the rainwater tanks for drinking and things like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water potable supply the water usage is likely to increase um anyway yep yeah so do you think you 've allowed enough i think that there is so we did look at rain water tanks as a as an over arching option and to do that you sort of you run the rainfall through a system where you you 're accounting for that storage in the tank and that demonstrated that you can 't actually sustain a rainwater tank with the climate that 's there at the moment so if that was a component of your demand it would be a very small benefit that they 're achieving okay all right thank you council might just move to suspend standing order so we can just open free discussion around this one anyway as we move forward move councillor fischer 's secretary councillor kirkland yep i 'll put that those in favor proposed motions carried so we 'll move into back to the report just as suspended standing orders thank you sorry janice but that 's up to the presentation that 's right now you 're right you 're right yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't working all right so level of service um in planning for water security you target a level of service so this shows how you how um the different criteria with i guess within planning and regulating water supply um relate to different actions of council so overarching is your level of service so it 's ensuring that you can get the amount of water that you need with a sufficient um or an acceptable amount of restrictions supply and an acceptable frequency of experiencing both restrictions and emergency conditions okay so it is different to your normal customer service standards which is i 'm going to get 22 meters of pressure when i turn on once up um and then kpis is is how you 're measuring against the customer service standards so we use level of service to plan the water supply system overall and that has um underpinned this you know this whole study so in 2016 nrm did a regional water supply security assessment they did one for rockhampton they 've done one for mount morgan and that pretty much progressed throughout the whole state if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is much lower in terms of the frequency of entering into emergency conditions so what we 've said during our investment logic mapping process is that um and i guess from the feedback from the community consultation was that we don 't want to experience any more than level three restrictions in that community which is pretty reasonable in comparison to rockhampton as as you know part of the wider community so our target was keep it above level three and all match what we 're getting in rockhampton because you know same rate based same you know make it make make it equitable across the community so the results from the the security modeling you know showed reaching emergency conditions one in 60 years one in 25 years by the time you hit 2035 demand and then compared to rockhampton one in 92 years so that 's the sort of difference that you 're getting from number 17 compared to fitzroy barrage security what the nrm work doesn 't account for is water quality okay so number seven dam as you 're aware is silted up at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um struggles with you know the high stability water a lot of color complaints coming through which is attributed to the low you know dirty water damage so if you then took 15 which is a nominal nominal level that we 've spoken to the operators about as to what they think is safe to put through the treatment plan without causing too many issues then you 're looking at having to do that every one in ten years okay so very frequent so coming back based on that we 've been targeting a level of service to hit that level three amount okay next slide so in terms of option generation we sort of group them into three areas can we um can we do anything with the demand at the moment okay so in these situations you always target non-infrastructure first and then you move into infrastructure as the last resort looking to secure water supply arrangements through other solutions can you transfer it towards fruit so rain water tanks this effluent reuse all those sorts of things okay so a non-traditional supply next slide so i won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base case we had base case one which is your current situation but also your current level of service so noting that trucking is you know it 's potentially something that could be a viable solution um you could accept that that 's um that 's reasonable going forward but to do that we want to make sure that we 're comparing apples for apples with the same level of service so then we brought in option two to show that you would have to truck at a higher amount and a higher rate to match what the other options to level the service is going to provide next one can i just um ask there what would that level of service um leader edge per day per person be with the increased level the option two that you have option two is 1.2 megs a day which is equivalent to your level three um in terms of per person that 's how many liters oh um i haven 't got that detail it 's double so i think it 's 160 is it at the moment 600 liters a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry the chair currently we 're cutting up 0.6 mega liters per day this increased carting would take 1.2 mega liters per day so it 's effectively doubling what we 're currently supplying through the trucking and currently per household it 's about 160 lit that 's what i yes that was the question so you 're looking at lifting that up to about 300 that would lift it yeah it 's about double yes and that would effectively take them up to what is normally their average demand in any case that community currently uses when we 're not in dry conditions around that 1 to 1.1 mega liters per day so to be their normal operations if you want to put it away so when i 've done basic human use type calcs in the past you 're looking at anywhere from 20 liters up to 100 liters per person so for a i guess a modern community or you know in in our western world it 's you know you 're probably getting borderline as to basic human use up there at the moment um so then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some water balance modeling around number seven dan okay so is there anything we can do operationally to maximize what we can get out of it okay i 'll take i 'll take you through those results shortly we looked at demand reduction and the performance of the dam associated with reducing demand and then we threw in a curly one about relocating the town okay so it 's it 's um you know something that 's not likely i mean amenable from a community perspective but it 's always something that you know it 's good to have that there to answer that question okay so um you know what 's the cost associated with that what 's what 's the impact um you know that sort of thing so next slide then we started looking at our infrastructure options so uh augmentation of the dam so the dam has um with your dam safety requirements there 's a need to increase the acceptable flood capacity of that dam by 2035 so that involves spillway augmentation and potential lifts and things like that we have looked at that option @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacity need is there as well okay we 've looked at the impact of de-silting and then moving into our pipeline options so we 've got drinking water pipeline which is the connection to gracemere which is shot through to the preferred options we 've looked at different raw water pipeline options so the so there 's a few configurations on the on the water pipeline so um the first being connection to stanwell raw water supply down they 've got a raw water supply that feeds their plant off the fitzroy river uh option b there so the way stanwell gets their water is um from another part of pittsburgh river so there 's a sun water pipeline run from the eden ben weir section of the fitzroy that goes out to stanwell there 's an intake there so we 've looked at connecting directly to that intake at some border which is a little bit closer to you know just an another question dennis councillor rutherford yeah thanks janice i was a little confused about that i actually picked that up in the report on page 100. that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so it not not from eden ban at all there is no pipeline in eden sure um so that pipeline does connect at laurel bank there the intake yeah so the allocation i understand comes from eden ban where and i think that 's the reference that you 're um that you 're making there so that option is to connect to the pipeline from laurel bank um closer to the um the stanward dam so um that it 's b is it yeah so the two two rule water options one 's to connect directly to stan was water supply dam and the other one is to connect to the the water pipeline some waters pipeline but yes it does connect it at laurel bank yeah so um i guess that was my concern because i thought well if it was being based on a pipeline coming from eden bain that 's a much longer pipeline than laurel banks um so you know is are you sure that the the base foundation of your mythology is okay is correct yeah so it and the connection 's not actually at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pipeline lengths are comparable um but correct if we were to go to edenband it would be substantially longer and um and wouldn 't be feasible um so i think you 're going to go into a little bit more detail around the individual reward options um so if there 's any other questions once we go through that i 'm happy to answer yeah all right thank you thank you thanks council rutherford thanks janice yep so the other option to do with that part of the river and stanwell was looking at hydropower options so stanwell have been um investigating potential for a hydropower pipeline between their raw water dam and number seven dam um that would involve quite substantial diameter infrastructure in comparison to what we need and when we spoke to them early in the project they said it wasn 't viable from their perspective so that one hasn 't carried through nine mile creek dam is a historical dam site it 's located south of of number seven dam um sort of between there and fletcher 's creek we are um some historical documentation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dam would be something like four times the price of a pipeline connection so for that reason we 've we 've not continued uh with that option uh and fletcher creek we 're upgrade so we 've i 've been had an inspection of fletcher creek wear and a lot of the current infrastructure there would need substantial refurbishment there 's also evidence um in comparing um flow records and level records at that site that it 's leaking quite substantially as well so it appears that it 's it 's going straight down into the aquifer when it 's there and and um the reliability of the balls there on isn 't sufficient for the demand that we need council rutherford another question yes thank you james just before you move on to the next slide the um the hydropower with stan will and i know we have to be careful because we can 't sort of discuss daniel 's business but um for what reason is are they not interested is it did they feel that they had to build the pipeline to mount morgan um or was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you help me with that i 'll get it to talk on that yeah sure so um as janice alluded to the pipeline size for a hydro solution would be substantially larger so for we 'll get into the detail but we 're talking for this pipeline in the order of about 250 millimeters or slightly smaller that for a hydropower solution you 'll be in the order of meters three meters um our understanding is typically for a hydro power solution you would want the source to be quite close to the the point of generation in this case it 's quite um quite far apart so the cost of the capital infrastructure land acquisitions and and all of that um wasn 't looking like it was it was going to stack up from stanwell 's perspective and because of the substantial pipe size increase compared to even if there was some sort of cost share arrangement or something like that it sort of wasn 't looking like that would stack up um yeah and i think there was extra cost in the turbidity of the water um stirring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well peter did you want to make point on that it 's all of those things and it really just comes down to what an enormous cost and also um us having a third party that we 've got to try and deal with he 's a commercial business he 's going to actually be challenging as well so yeah it 's rolled out quite early yeah yeah thanks peter mr marin that 's great information to have thank you for that and i i i think it 'd be good to even have some of that in in writing in a report because that was the community 's favored option um i think even though we couldn 't give much information on it because we didn 't have much so it would be good to be able to answer their questions on that and you know that 's you know really good information that you 've just given thank you cancer we might look to um to provide more information through further media to to explain a lot of those options there after we 'd had a public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them engaged as we go through there about those why those options haven 't been explored uh to a further degree and and the reasons around that so yeah good point thanks janice there 's more um and this is the last slide of options so um uh a desalination planet port alma was was flagged during early phases of the project um in the in the original memo that went to council so we explored that and you know what would be involved with that and um you know substantial amount of approvals and things like that involved along with a pipeline that would be probably twice twice as long as what we would need to service matt morgan from our other options uh effluent reuse uh it 's always a you know a tricky one we looked with that at what was potentially available at gracemere as a recycled water stream uh and that was insufficient to provide the demand that we needed at mount morgan um and then you know over and above you would have the the community yuck factor and potentially you know not acceptable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but sort of demonstrated that there is a bit of distance that you would have to go to actually obtain the ground water from our review of various pumping records from registered laws you know within communities not just mount morgan but in surrounds the yield that you 're getting from the boars is is fairly low and you would end up having to create quite a complex um warfield to achieve the flows and that 's also on the basis that you can find the water okay so we haven 't pursued ground groundwater any further councillor fishing mr mayor i think that 's another one of the messages that needs to be given to the community because that is still probably reyes was on the radio this morning where one of the residents there was was saying well why waste council wanting to have the platinum plated option when we 've got groundwater and i think sometimes those messages we need to get out to the broader community to explain that actually this research has has covered those points cancer i think council fish is right those people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good water supply from those bores um i think what 's not considered is the the quantity that is is needed and um i think getting that message out would be good yeah yeah and you know to get that sustained supply that you need for a secure water supply it 's it 's it 's not going to achieve it and then if you have everyone having a bore or what have you then you 've got drawdown effects and impacts on your neighbour and that sort of thing as well so there 's all sort of complicating factors now f2g so if it fits right into gladstone pipeline uh was was an extra option that we would come up with noting that um that 's basically going right past our doorstep um so to speak um when ghoul glaston area will board gets that project underway um so again that 's a very large diameter pipeline and we looked at potential to take you know a small tape from that pipeline um there 's a few a few things with that is um whilst it 's progressed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being funded by the state was an issue given the urgency of the mount morgan situation and then um that sort of induces a risk for council if if we do pursue that option that um if if that one falls over then you know we 're potentially putting the infrastructure from the from the connection point upstream okay so there 's a potential cost for us to cancel in the future if that doesn 't go ahead from a technical perspective though um in the work that abby and team have done um it sort of demonstrated that it 's a longer pipeline and that there would be a lot more infrastructure required so our other pipeline options have um two main pump stations and you know between 20 and 30 k 's of pipeline this one needed at least three pump stations and a significantly higher head which means a huge power requirement by comparison so on that basis we didn 't pursue that option any further as mentioned earlier we looked at individual rainwater tanks and again through a water balance modelling of local climate not shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mine water reuse option um the mine water option is you know a potential to essentially recycle and treat the water that 's stored on the mindset that 's a finite volume of water so um and with the heritage minerals proposal at the moment they 'll be reusing that water so it 's essentially not available any further so quick rundown of the water balance modeling so what we do with the water balance it 's like a big bucket of water we consider the rainfall going on top consider the evaporation leaving as well as the demand leaving the dam and some seepage through the base of the dam as well just through standard assumptions what we 've done here is we 've applied a historical record um 112 years of rainfall data on the dam on the left hand column you 've got the volume of the dam so full supply is around 2 800 mega liters okay and then the other horizontal lines on there indicate level one two three four five six restrictions okay so you can see so that 's without doing anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'm sure you 'd be intrigued with that one night uh yeah well when i looked at this in the report i couldn 't understand why um now it 's not right down the bottom why that line has not dipped right down to below 500 in this date 2022 it 's probably not quite that far in the rainfall probably yet because it 's still sitting up like 2 500 mega liters um in the storage and it should be right down the bottom at 20 22 yeah at twenty-two i 'd have to check the end date of the data set um i think it ends um we use the data set that the state used for their 2016 modeling so that 's probably the ah okay yeah yep all righty thank you i think it 's uh and it 's really a snapshot of the historical um ups and downs that they 've had with the water over the years so um but yeah you 're right it 's probably not accurate to the current situation you 're right in that it 's it 's probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um probably a good addition and update would be to provide that you know the last five years for example as a yep sorry if we 're going to other levels of government we it would be great to have an updated um one of those if it 's possible to get it because at the moment that almost reads like we 're sitting you know halfway where we 're not we 're yeah we 've bottomed out completely yeah we can overlay um real data onto this as as far as we 've got as well just to show um the correlation that we 've got between the model and real data okay next slide please okay so in reviewing the results we also reported the evaporation of the dam over the same period of time so if you look at the evaporation as megaliters per day you 'll see that you know you 're up to nearly five megs a day evaporating from that dam depending on the level that it 's at uh which is you know two to three times your demand so any options that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly to the dam you would have to supply this amount as well okay so three times the amount that you would need than if you were supplying directly to town a lot more demand to to put water into the dam to to keep that at a level that you need for the community um just through evaporation and added to that cancer rutherford thanks miss man i 'm i 'm crossing some questions off as i go so if you don 't mind and a lot of you 're answering a lot of my questions so thank you i did wonder but and i noticed the one before was about rainfall so does the rain fall in a natural catchment like to the dam does that counteract some of the evaporation this will be the evaporation after the rainfall okay so on on an individual day you say i 've got this much rainfall coming in i 've got that much evaporation going out and so that 's the sort of net going into the dam yes so it is accounted for yeah so the evaporation the the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get on a rainfall yes thank you okay so we then looked at if we stopped using number seven damn for water supply what would it look like okay so um you can see that we 're just hitting the level one restriction level which is about 50 capacity in the dam okay so um you 're sustaining the dam at higher levels okay so if you can provide an option that um takes the need for the dam away all together then you 'll end up with the benefits that you your you know your your aesthetics and your recreational benefits of maintaining that damn at a higher level okay so uh sorry the colors are a little bit difficult to see so um i 've got a lime green line there which is our our base case so what would how well the dam at the moment and then what we 've done is we 've um changed the time at which we implement the restrictions so say level one is at fifty percent we 're saying let 's put the screws on at sixty percent okay so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the performance of the dam and you can see that there 's hardly any difference in in the outcome so imposing restrictions earlier in the community is going to have minimal effect on the dam and we did try that at a number of different restriction levels as well and had barely any impact because that evaporation is such a huge component and has such a huge impact we then also looked at a long-term demand reduction so taking your your current you know liters per person or you you design them out of 500 down to 450. uh 10 um somewhere between 10 and 20 is is um a pretty typical figure of what a water service provider can try to achieve however noting um there 's been a substantial amount of work in mount morgan already in fixing the pipe network so leakage reduction is usually a very large component of that demand reduction and that 's been largely achieved already in the community so achieving any further demand reductions when you 've already got a community um using a pretty low amount of water is going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's again has minimal effect on the performance of the dam so you 're still going to hit those level three restrictions and not have any relief from those restrictions next slide okay so this is a time series of fletcher creek weir so when we got the state modeling we we took out the stream flows um and at fletcher creek where we 've overlaid them with the performance of number seven damn so this is an option that 's been looked at previously as well but we 've had a little bit more data this time so the orange line is basically the time at which there 's flow available at fletcher creek the blue line is number seven damn noting that the um the nrm monitoring station doesn 't go below that 245 0.4 level or whatever it is that 's why it 's flat lining okay so it 's only recording up to the higher levels in the dam but basically all this one is demonstrating is that once you 're starting to drop to those lower levels in number seven there is no water in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from fletcher creek into the number 7 dam it 's hydrologically too similar to to provide any benefits um yes i was just wondering whether you looked at water quality um as well and and my concern with fletcher creek is that if the mine pit overtops it feeds to fletcher 's creek and fletcher 's creek naturally is very alkaline so um does the water quality then become too great an issue um to treat for it to become a really a viable option for water do you know we didn 't really look too much further into water quality into the effect of what you 're um you 're alluding to mainly because it was it was ruled out early on on the basis of quantity and the significant capital investment to get it to the point that it could actually provide any any benefit at all um yeah so no in short we haven 't done a detailed water quality analysis on fletcher creek on that basis i do recall and and i don 't know if it 's specifically for fletcher creek but in some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salinity but the conductivity of the water was quite high which indicates um either salt or other minerals that would need to be accounted for yeah and that has also been used as a as a reason for dismissal in the past as well yeah all right thank you next slide okay we then finally after reviewing all our our options from our literature review we 've um we established some threshold criteria with with council 's team um and these relate directly to those objectives that we 're trying to achieve for the project so can we get the water is the water going to be good quality how much regulatory issues would need to be managed through the process to actually make it you know a turnkey operation community and community impact as well as cost okay so next table next slide please okay so i 've alluded i guess in talking about the different options as to why the different ones were ruled out so you can see that um anything to do with um augmentation that i didn 't show the slide with um augmentation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we trial different raises of the dam up from one meter up to four meters and it basically you end up storing that sort of the top component but it evaporates so you still end up dropping into those levels so basically anything to do with number seven damn it didn 't provide the volume that we needed relocation of the town has been ruled out due to costing and community acceptance issues nine mile creek dam as mentioned earlier you know for potentially four times the cost of pipeline options um also quite long time frames with eises and and you know getting approvals to actually build a new dam fletcher creek we are based on volume desalination cost as well as regulatory issues with the treatment process required the management of brine all that sort of stuff associated with desalination effluent reused has failed all criteria um groundwater on volume fits right at gladstone volume and cost and the other two so volume and mine water resource was was volume and community as well okay so next slide so then we proceeded with these shortlisted options so so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our scope we 're allowed to look at three infrastructure options anyway so we we have taken them all through to the evaluation process for the prelim evaluation okay so the do nothing option trucking as is increased trucking uh potable water connection to grey smear and then the two raw water supply options okay so this is something we looked at as well so um with the situation you 've got with the dam you can choose to either supplement it in the times that you 're gonna enter into those level three restrictions or you replace the supply altogether and not use number 17 for water supply okay so if you 're supplementing those there 's potential operational considerations that you have to consider in you know how you operate that pipeline um can you can you turn it off easily can you turn it on easily can you turn your treatment plan off at about morgan easily and on again there 's a lot of priming timing and pre-work if you 've got a membrane plant the membrane brains dry out all sorts of stuff okay so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do some cost analysis on this a replacement supply for the potable option was a better outcome and it also operationally is about a better outcome where you 're not intermittently operating the current treatment plan at mount morgan for the raw water supply options we 've used a supplementary supply and again that 's basically when you hit the level three level in number seven damn you would switch over to your raw supply lines okay next slide please cancel relevant thanks mr may um just the treatment plant yes so i read that um if it 's a potable water supply we decommissioned the treatment plant in yet morgan i was under the understanding that the water would need to be once it travels uh a certain distance say the yapoon pipeline it needs to be retreated or at least re-chlorinated at the end of that so how do we decommission a treatment plant um given the distance it has to travel yep so we 've allowed for an abbey uh jump in if you feel um so we have allowed for re-chlorination at the downstream end so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town and that enables enough retention time so that you can you can dose and it decays before it goes into the network so we 've basically allowed for an assessment of re-chlorination at that end and we are looking into that in further detail so that the cost of that infrastructure is included with the solution all right did you have a question nope you 're right another question then too and it 's probably about the um the water the bulk water that would be used so the water allocation to go to mount morgan is potable so that comes from the region 's water allocation however if it was um raw water then there is an option maybe for um flood capture you can at an additional location for flood harvest so has that set of suns been done at all raw water versus portable water hot potable water portable water potable water um in short we haven 't looked at the flood harvesting as an option i is that a situation where it goes from say high priority water to medium priority or i don 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water once the fitzroy is is in a decent flood run or whatever you can take water and store it over and above an allocation which would mean we could take that water and store it in the number seven dam and then that doesn 't actually affect our allocation as such okay i 'd have to take that one away to consider it further when i 've spoken to the department in respect to allocations so um for our portable supply option we 'd be utilizing um you know the main rock hampton location at the moment yeah um all of our costing has been done on high priority costing as well so worst case water charging from uh either the status or sun water um with respect to the two raw water options they would require us to acquire an allocation okay so um that can be quite an involved process there is reserves available um within that component of the fitzroy and the fitzroy plan but then you have to follow all the rules of the fitzroy plan so um we with sun water operating sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um firstly ask if they 've got allocation reserves available um and then you still have to step through the process of the water plan which involves um this gives me more hydrologic modelling to demonstrate that taking that extra little bit of water at that point doesn 't impact their ability to supply every other allocation holder so i was under the understanding that it 's our allocation up to eden ban so sun water is actually taking water from our allocation so if it 's potable water coming from raw sorry if it 's raw water coming from um laurel banks or whatever that 's that 's our allocation so why would we need to it depends on from what i understand and i have to work through it further with the department is it does depend where you take that supply martin martin might be able to yeah i think it 's sort of both answers are right i suppose in some respects so we do have allocation that sits in the barrage and we could use that allocation to supply from laurel banks because it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we want to use sun waters infrastructure there would be a commercial negotiation there yes as to whether and how they charge us for it and whether the state would consider them supplying us water would be coming out of their 24 000 mega liter allocation so there 's that sort of a negotiation that would happen generally speaking we 've got enough allocation uh to cover this yeah from the warren but it 's that that negotiation of how we utilize sun water system to shift that water and then whether that is taken from sun was allocation and not council 's allocation yeah if that sort of makes sense i think the important point to remember too is that sun waters allocation is behind eden being but their straw is actually in our glass so um you know that 's yeah their straw is not in their own glass it 's in ours yeah okay thanks janice the only other thing i 'd probably just add around the flood harvest option is that if we can definitely like take that away and have a look but um there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water options as they currently stand um i assume that would be significant additional storage through potentially augmentation of number seven dams so your capital cost for that that option would be yeah i don 't think it 's definitely we need bigger pipes and the cost to do that to flood harvest would be yeah not not valid value for money going forward i don 't think we need to to explore that one um at this stage yeah right thank you okay as um janice said we we went into a infrastructure technical assessment for the three shortlisted infrastructure options to enable us to do a you know a cost comparison so the option on the screen here is the potable water option um keeping in mind uh this is very early days in terms of design development so there is a fair amount of refinement that would be required in in the following stages and some of that we 're doing currently as we speak for the um as we progress um or get ready for the the business case phase so this this option here connects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connect at the luca street pump station if you 're aware of where that is and there 's a reservoir on on-site there and it would generally follow the the road corridor based on the assessment that we 've we 've done today there 's a bit of work that we 're currently looking at now as to how it would make it up the range and there 's some some opportunity to use the historical rail corridors to to do that and it would then make its way through through town and connect to effectively the um south reservoir which is which is at the treatment plant current currently as we 're talking about um previously there would need to be some disinfection or re-disinfection at that point there is existing infrastructure that 's there and we 're going through an assessment of that to determine if that 's sufficient based on the quality of the water by the time it makes it to the um to that reservoir and in terms of decommissioning the plant i guess the disinfection component is quite a small part of the overall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the majority of the the treatment process and leave that that portion there and whether it needs upgrade or not is what we 're currently assessing um i can go into more detail but that 's the effect of of that option pipe sizes for the preliminar valuation as i mentioned we 're around the 250 millimeter in diameter we 're currently looking at refining that a little bit further so we 're not it 's not a significant pipe size um and we 're in the order you haven 't got those mentioned they 're due listed there 20 around 27 kilometers for the most the options are very comparable in length any questions before we move on next slide please so excuse me uh a uh a 4a is connecting directly to the stanwall water supply dam so again um a little bit of work that would need to go into exactly where at that dam that would would connect um but we 're looking to uh utilize the as it heads from the the dam to the sorry the north north is facing to the left so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking to hopefully utilize the um powerlink corridor there 's a bit of a consultation that we 've we 've tried to instigate at this stage to avoid you know significant vegetation impacts through that area and then at four mile road using the road network and from there on in it 's very similar in alignment to the the potable water options bit of refinement around what parts of the historical rail corridor we might be able to use making our way through town and connecting to in this case it would be to the treatment plant there would need to be some raw water storage and some augmentation of the treatment plant so um the water coming from the fitzroy river i 'm sure you 're all aware is um significantly um has a higher sediment um loading so higher turbidity uh the treatment process at mount morgan is made for the the quality of the water coming out of number seven which is a much lower turbidity so there would need to be augmentation to that treatment process if we were to consider these options and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front end of the process to try to get rid of that sediment in the water before you go through the the standard process so there is a um and it 's a fairly significant up upgrade next slide please and the final shortlisted infrastructure option was is effectively the same thing in terms of it 's a broader water connection except it would be as we spoke earlier connecting um just upstream in the in the infrastructure network and to the sun water pipeline which is the the blue line that you can see at the bottom there um we would need um to have a buffer tank at that point and an apologies i didn 't um probably touch on for each of those options we will need a number of pump stations to achieve the the lift or you know to get us all all the way from the starting point up to to mount morgan um all options require two pump stations so they 're very similar in terms of those infrastructure requirements one at the start and um and then there 'll be one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utilizing a council quarry parcel to minimise land acquisitions a question yeah thank you mr mayor i i think this is probably the question i 'm getting most from residents in rockhampton the confusion over or just not understanding how many pump stations and uh that are required but also they 're starting to get this the question of we all want to be able to help mount morgan but what is going to be the cost of actually that operation of getting that water from grey smear to mount morgan and uh i 'd like to put someone on the spot and sort of ask something that we could go to the residence and say okay this is not going to be something that could be a deal breaker can i and that 's the question the question i 'd ask cancer fishermen it 's one that um a lot of people would be asking about the operational costs so that 's uh peter i might jump in peter did you want to have one more detail yeah thanks peter i mean look at his early days and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get further costings and development but um in the report i think it talks about a dollar 20 or dollar 25 yep so um if you 're looking at operating only costs a dollar twenty-two yeah so just for comparisons um we are very cheeky so ours is is it now is 82 cents per kiloliter but if i looked at around surrounding councils mackay is a dollar 86 for its first tier 276 for its second tier so it to me it 's not out further question so um you 're probably looking what about 40 cents a kiloliter per takeoff across the whole of rockhampton region is that what you 're looking at or is this just mount morgan what you just said i kind of felt the report was sort of quoting that morgan so what i 've done there is uh we haven 't looked at a cost impact the rate base we 've only looked at um the pure cost cost of the project per kiloliter to provide it up up to the community so the operating component is a dollar 20 that assumes you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is about three dollars which is still comparable to your um your excess water charge 2.70 so it 's it 's in line if you looked at your trucking you 're trucking something like two and a half thousand three thousand dollars a kilo yeah yeah out of the world so it 's not unreasonable compared to other water supply spins um mr mayor for me this probably is i 've been picking up on sort of some of the you know there 's lots of comments going through the community and uh and particularly on sort of some of the radio stations about what it 's going to be this is probably another one as far as that going to the community that 's actually a very a very affordable you know to be able to uh supply that water into a community that 's actually very affordable that as you said it 's it 's comparable to most other regions and and i think that 's been another one of the negatives that 's been circulated and i know i 've had a number of people sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and i think we need to be able to get that message in when we go to the community that this could be supplied at that around about this sort of figure when we um when andrew and i were talking earlier before we came down we sort of looked at a per property sort of connection charge if you 're if you 're a developer coming in and said i 've got 1500 properties how much to to put this water supply connection in and it was about um all up including capital and operating about 20 000 per property which is which is pretty much in line with um you know my knowledge of development rates and provision of water and storage infrastructure um as a as a trunk headworks type charge so um everything seems to be you know lining up a reasonable number okay it 's it 's not surprising i guess or alarming as to how much it is mm-hmm thanks yes council election thanks mr mayor just to clarify the dollar twenty per kiloliter that 's on each morgan resident or is that across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a charge we 're talking about the cost to run this system is a dollar 20 a kiloliter which is pretty good pretty common yeah so we 're saying yeah the option that 's why we 're recommending this option to you it stacks up at a reasonable cost to provide water that 's a different different question about charging oh that 's that 's the cost to get it up there yep not the actual cost of the water is that on top the 82 cents a kiloliter it is the cost of the pump running the pipes and putting the water up there and consuming water but it 's not related to i thought your question was about what 's the water bill going to be it 's a different question so yeah i mean you would take um i guess the outputs from our financial modeling into your financial model yeah to determine what your appropriate rating structure would change yeah so when you evaluate your your options with within your preliminary evaluation framework you 've got all these different criteria on the left so do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corridors we 've done desktop searches are we going to impact anything significant within the alignments that we 've selected and obviously that 's informed as well public interest is a strong component within pes and business cases it looks at different things like um other decisions being made accountable and transparent pretty well pretty well by doing a process like this you meet that requirement social sustainability are there going to be issues long-term projects or benefits for example public access and equity so that particular one is sort of looks at things like the do people in the community have a right to a water supply and if they do then and what does that need to look like and is that equal to what the neighboring parties are receiving in that particular situation that 's where that level of service parity comes in between privacy implications and we 'll look at this further in the next phase it 's a lot about um during design construction and operation are you going to be impacting the publicity so he 's privacy impacted and it tends to be something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then obviously economics which is to do with your costs and benefits and then financials um due to um corridor impacts and approvals processes we 've just got some i guess markers to deal with going through that power power to impact um so when when our partner bdo looked at the economics probably overstated the benefits slightly in that um they 've considered that you know the trucking continues on and on and on okay so um we are looking to refine that to get a better handle on that impact but the outcome in terms of ranking of options is the same so essentially if you look at you know the cost benefit ratios you 'll notice that the watercoloring option is causing more impacts you know potential traffic safety and environmental factors that would quantify as part of that assessment bcr less than one which isn 't surprising for water supply projects it 's pretty rare for a water supply project for vcr greater than one unless there 's a really specific commercial advantage that you 're going to get at the end of it so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potable water supply is preferred or number one option followed by the raw water supply options knowing that base case isn 't meeting the level of service that you 're trying to achieve and that base case two has more of an impact than you 're trying to resolve we have to bring that last line back okay counselors questions i think we 've answered quite a few as we 're going through but uh thanks very much for that presentation janice but there 's lights on councillor rutherford um thank you yes can i before i ask my final question i hope it 's my final question thank you very much um for the presentation and for all the great work that went into it um can you please just remind me what is the what 's the annual amount of water we would be looking at our design amount is 588 megs per annum and your current allocation of number seven is 584 so at your 30-year horizon you 'll need a little bit more all right thank you very much cancelled any other questions against the fisher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been going through all my questions and you 've actually been answering a lot of those questions as we 've been going i too want to commend you for for the work that you 've done um this has been a very difficult issue for the whole of the community and very divisive and i think a lot of what has been addressed in this uh report actually allows those fears and in fact in some places probably will sort of bring public support further together probably the last question i had on my list was with what you perceived as that uh potential cost uh of that so it almost makes it where it could almost be a private um option there a private supplier of water purchasing water from ray smear and uh doing that that it could be sort of something that a joint venture with council with another operator could actually almost ease that cost of um if money wasn 't to come from other government bodies that that could be entered into a as a like a public private public private machine jv i know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with our partners and it didn 't come up as preferred okay with one one sort of complicating factor with connecting to an existing supply council is already a water service provider so if anyone else comes in they have to go and register as a world of service provider there then has to be a contractual agreement with council and the i guess the bounds of the contract and the risk imposed by that as to what your contractor takes on versus what council takes on council will probably still end up taking responsibility for the quality of the water and so you 'd end up paying twice for all the the um all the regulatory needs that you have to meet to be a service provider if that makes sense it 's kind of weighing up the cost of potentially borrowing funds yeah as to a joint venture yeah that would and it was just those sort of figures and i 've been doing a little bit of sort of looking at other uh more unique opportunities around the country yeah and particularly for you know sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some some options so it was just that was the very last question it 's it 's still an option that um will be further considered at business case phase anyway um it 's like basically the the preliminar value evaluation is a high level look at everything and then you get to to bc and you you really pull it apart so um it will be looked at again um and if um you know if if council want like we can get bdo you know to present or to to explore that in a lot more detail with um with your finance department or who you know whoever controls the money thank you very much yeah thanks again fisher councillor kirkland and council rutherford than kirkland um thank you mr mayor um yeah i just want to commend and congratulate you on a very thorough report i think that that there 's an awful lot of questions from the community that are answered within them as to what they would think would be a good option are answered within this very detailed report and i look forward to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explore that to find those answers i think also this is a great document mr mayor for here to go taking to tables that need to to be looking at it on in our lobbying moving forward all the arguments are very solid and and it 's going to reinvigorate our lobbying capacity to have this report also for funding and to validate the expense of cost i think one of the things that stood out to me in this report was um certainly the fact that as we 've discussed um council of bishop the 160 leaders a day really isn 't um that 's not something we should be sustaining that should be more and if it 's more than that 's more money and so absolutely we need the help of of the next two levels of government to help us with a better option and this is a really good um option for us moving forward the pipeline so um i did see that you explored options tapping into the off doing an off take from the fitzroy gladstone pipeline and it was ruled out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of your reasonings behind that was definitely the cost risk of it then being as you 've already highlighted to us something where council are going to be could very much be held at ransom with that so i think that uh that was probably a wise decision i was going to question you about whether some things around the pipeline and tapping into the pipeline that they will be taking the new pipeline from the fitzroy tapping into that because it 's a very similar option to ao4b a raw water option it 's very similar to that and i thought and then when i read about the cost risk i thought i understand now why um that 's that 's being ruled out thank you very very much mr mayor i 'm happy to move as portfolio chair once councillor has finished council rutherford um yeah i i agree with councillor kirkland there i had other questions too about you know what were opportunities maybe with raw water or with the gladstone pipeline but given the presentation that we 've just had i get it now so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me up here it says the total cost um so for the potable water connection is 21.08 million in our report it 's saying 39.4 million so what 's what 's the difference so what um because the the path works to a 30-year time frame for the you know the net present value assessment and what have you so the financial and the economic model ends at 30 years these pipelines have a life of 80 to 100 depending on material and construction method and things like that so you also have the benefit of an asset at the end of this so that 's then taken off the residual value of that asset has taken off the cost so that 's that 's why that lowers thank you we have the ball in our court now we we 've just got to take this information on and start to advocate and lobby um other levels of government to to get on board and support uh the good people of mount morgan and uh providing a long-term water supply for them um i mentioned it today that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's similar to what the barrage has meant to the to the community of rockhampton um you know permanent water supply to me and morgan community something there that we we 're all striving for and uh this will uh it 's a step in that path uh taking us towards that so um again uh jennison uh sorry abby i really appreciate the uh the presentation and uh you know answering the questions from the table they 're all prudent and uh something there that now we 'll gather that information pass that back on to to the community but uh with the federal election coming up and uh seeking funding for the full business case uh hopefully we can get the candidates to uh to support that and uh and assist council and the man morgan community in taking that uh taking that next step so that said council i might move that we resume standing orders um i 'll put that those in favor opposed motions carried i just i moved there 's no further questions with regards to that one councillors um we have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh any uh i 'll put that those in favor those opposed emotions carried unanimously uh thank you councillors it 's uh it 's a great great step forward and um thank you councillors thank you very much i 'm sure the mount morgan community will start to understand that we 're really committed to providing a solution for for their waterways um just invite councillor smith back in first i 'm just conscious we 've got um we 've got a fair bit on our plate still so um whether we wanted to go through push through until we get to the closed session item and then um and then go for a break in between or go now and wait yes that 's right we still have another matter there as well okay um i 'll be guided counselors did you want to press on or take a break down yeah okay i think thanks council official we 'll just wait for councillor smith to come back and then we 'll go from there laptop uh council we we we have a a matter we 've dealt with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will go back to uh and lift that uh item off the table which was the naming of the overpasses graciously we 've gone through and evan firstly i 'll move that we go back to that item uh which is 10.3 um move council of kirkland second in council of maters i 'll put that those in favor motions carried that that matter 's been lifted off the table and uh after uh uh the ceo has uh reviewed that there is no requirement to um to record it uh with that as far as outside the policy and the need to to go out there so i 'm not sure whether we had any i think we 've lost the officers now that we 're representing that report if there 's any further questions around it we might um just seek him over in a second with the officer 's recommendation there uh councillor councillors uh smith you 're happy to move do we have a seconder council election uh put that those in favor as opposed did you want to record the merchants carried thank you councillors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is the policy amendments council decision making structure thank you dan good morning mr mayor councillors the report before you this morning is in relation to two policies the councillor portfolio policy and the sorry council of portfolio policy and council meeting procedures policy uh have proposed a number of amendments to those policies largely to reflect council 's recent decision to amend its decision-making framework and particularly in relation to the introduction or reintroduction of committees the report outlines a number of the or a summary of the the changes that have been proposed as is typically the case when we undertake a process of reviewing policies there are a number of incidental amendments that are typically uh updated at the time to reflect whether it be legislative changes or ultimately changes within the organization as well i 'm happy to take any questions in relation to particular amendments i would just like to to note that in the report i had included reference in the council meeting procedures policy to a change as it relates to the the mayoral minutes there 's actually no change to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other than removal of the word ordinary meeting which has been updated in the definitions section my apologies to councillors for not picking that up in the report that was an error on the part of the report writer and i 'll have words to them after uh the meeting here today um but happy to take any questions thanks damon questions cancer rutherford um yeah mr mayor i had um i had a couple i 'm trying to scroll to to see the highlighted ones um so we 've taken out council meeting and we 've out of everything and just put meeting so does that include workshops or um is this just really about our formal the formal meetings formal meetings yep um the other one um damon was about the media policy and i was just a little concerned that that may have restricted our ability to do our own media should we choose to and if the media come directly to us there 's a line in there slightly slowly it 's coming up i believe that might be 5.3 yeah um so damon i did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would you like to answer me on that yes so councillors um in the council of portfolio policy um there 's provision there uh in relation to clause 5.3.2 regarding media undertaken within each individual portfolio particularly i understand councillor that the particular references in the final line of that policy which indicates all media will be undertaken in accordance with council 's media policy and media procedure the council 's media procedure provides for mayor and councillors to be spokespersons for those matters prescribed in the portfolio policy so it circles back to the portfolio policy that obviously lists out the individual portfolios in the areas of responsibility there there is also though provision there that portfolio counsellors are the key counsellor council spokesperson on those portfolio-related matters so as it currently stands if any counsellors are wanting to undertake their own media so whether that be initiated by individual counsellors or at the request of a media outlet that comes individually to to counsel to councillors if it relates to your individual portfolio then under the the current media policy and media procedure that 's fine to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media policy and procedure also provides for that to be permissible outside of i guess those general provisos that have been included there around making it clear if you 're commenting on areas outside of your portfolio about being of a personal opinion and respecting the council decision making and the like so notwithstanding being subject to the media policy as reflected there in the council of portfolio policy there 's certainly no restriction or prohibition or issue with individual counselors looking at initiating your own media or in responding to direct media enquiries and not going through the internal process or through the media team here at council okay council rutherford um can i just ask a question around that yes no you 're right councillor kirkland thanks mr man um just with that that you 've been talking about that 5.3.2 the exception to that is if there is uh that it 's a broader regional impact and your portfolio and that goes directly back to the mid and the reason i 'm clarifying that is because i was contacted by media about the mount morgan facility but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had to go to the mayor is that correct an apology sorry i did miss including that other proviso that the portfolio policy does have some other provisions in there regarding what is typically the mayor the mayor being the spokesperson for and that 's those major regional um decision making whether it be in relation to partnerships with other levels of government for example natural disasters and they 're outlined in that policy there as well thanks again councilman thanks very much miss madges through you today and if that 's okay damn can i just draw your attention to the council of portfolio um 5.4.3 uh it just says the the a detailed briefing note has been removed and replaced with appropriate information in regards to any reports that are going to the table for the portfolio to be made aware or that they might be introducing to council meetings i 'll give you a moment to have a look at that just while you 're looking through that it just says the deputy chief executive officer general managers executive managers and managers should ensure the portfolio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meeting for any reports that the portfolio counselor is introducing yes yeah i 'm just wondering i 'm just that just concerns me a little bit in in regards to detailed briefing versus appropriate information you know who who makes the decision on what 's actually appropriate information so just to recap i guess in terms of where this proposed changes come from at the initially when this portfolio policy was introduced was at the very commencement of the introduction by council of portfolios as i understand it the process that has typically been followed in relation to portfolio counselors meeting with the the responsible gm 's and managers and addressing matters that are coming to council in relation to reports that the proposed amendments are largely to reflect what is currently being put into practice separate to that there is the councillor acceptable request guidelines policy that provides for councillors ability to be able to request information whether it be through the ceo or other levels of through the organisation so there is still that mechanism for counsellors and also portfolio counsellors then to make requests for information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you may feel that the information that you 've been supplied in relation to a report that is is coming to council is insufficient then there is still a mechanism there to be able to um seek and obtain additional information um i 'm not sure if that answers or addresses your query or concern damon thanks very much for that no and i appreciate you you know you know talking me through that so but my issue is is the fact that you know sometimes it 's um i find you know i wonder why we we 're giving the information but then we have to go back to dig more or ask more information when i would prefer that the all the information is just made available to us in the first place that 's why just i understand it 's just wording but you know we 've changed from a detailed briefing to appropriate information so you know what two two different people can think what appropriate information can be completely different um as opposed to you know i know if it 's something that 's coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portfolio i want to be across every every part of it or it 's certainly as much as what i can be so that 's just my thoughts on that and through the chair i guess my only other comment i can make to that is also the subjective nature around what a perhaps a detailed briefing note means from one person to the next as well but i certainly take take that it does have the word detailed yes versus appropriate information okay thank you uh cancer rather than cancel election um yeah it 's probably i 'd like to um sort of go a little bit further into what council may this has just just raised and that 's sort of you know a lack of information and the reason you know we 're not doing the portfolio meetings at the moment is really to free up officers time and you know to focus on some of the bigger issues that we 've got but there is still a need for portfolio portfolio chairs to have briefings and information and i just worry that um with this reduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will we only be briefed on a report um that 's to come rather than more broader stuff that we need to know as portfolio chairs mr ceo the councillors can make a time with any of the gm 's or leadership team to be briefed on anything so it doesn 't limit that i think what council rutherford is saying though is she 's she 's needing to ask for that information should not she be provided with some of that what information that 's the issue i 'm not sure every counselor wants something different um and what you think might be a issue around the public or impact of the public might be a different view from what the general manager may be saying so i would just say generally speaking make a regular time with you with your general manager or leadership in person to actually catch up with them regularly to have a general discussion about what 's on the agenda what 's coming up for reports and what 's actually happening so that 's not happening i 'm just not sure is there yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a portfolio when you went into whether it was a committee meeting a portfolio meeting you would know if there was an issue with mowing schedules or waste pickup or whatever you know those types of things would be would be there because they were being highlighted monthly um there are there are lots of things so unless you know the right questions to ask we 're not getting the information anymore because it used to be provided through committee structure meeting structures and we 're um we 're not getting that so that 's that 's the thing that concerns me yeah so if you recall councillors when we just didn 't make the change that they introduced that standing committee is in march there will be a monthly operational performance report that will come through the part of the second council meeting of the month which will be the third third week of the month that will have the financials and all the data that we can actually provide out there across the organisation so we haven 't had that yet we haven 't had that no okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so i think we probably just need to need to monitor that as we go along that we 're not losing any information reporting to the council or the portfolio chair at that time thank you council rutherford council of latin and cancer kirkland council mayor continuing on in that theme i do have concerns about not being detailed a lot of the times before a um we have one of these workshops or whatever um previously we were given detailed briefings and you meet with your managers and and you get a better understanding of what 's going to come before the table and a lot of the times i find that we don 't get enough time we only get a couple of days notice on what 's going to be discussed and it does i feel that it 's not enough time to to fully consider what 's going to be discussed and as much as you 're meeting with your managers if it 's only going to be appropriate information it 's not detailed enough and that 's my concern if you look at the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don 't believe that any since the introduction that policy that any detailed briefing note was provided to council that was a that to me that would be a term that you 'd actually have something written a memo some type of format we 've provided to the appropriate portfolio council assistant since the introduction of portfolio arrangements i don 't believe that that had been given just looking around at peter and whatever else is that right damon no through the chair the feedback that i 've received has been i guess perhaps a different approach taken depending on the particular portfolio counsellor and largely it has been through meetings and the exchange of emails and other material but in terms of a detailed briefing note that 's i guess a template that is consistently used across each portfolio then that hasn 't been the case and again why they 've been then looking at trying to reflect what had been the the existing practice and um from there okay look i think we can we 're hearing something there evan i think we monitor when that reporting coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monitor that you 're not just reinforcements the councils the portfolio councils to make regular meetings with the um appropriate general manager yeah yeah okay but and again council be guided i won 't be at those meetings so we 'll just just let us know as we go through as there has been a change and uh you 're getting that uh that information uh to hand councillor kirkland thank you mr may i have a couple of questions just on the council meeting procedures document if i could um the first one is item 5.6.1 the delegated committees could you just explain that a little bit more to me please because it 's i may be misunderstanding in my reading so i would just like you to unpack what that particular point means a little bit so there 's the delegate in what sense council of kirkland delegated communities if the majority are in favor of the proposal so reports and resolutions of a delegated committee do not need to be submitted to a council meeting for consideration or endorsement provided there 's an absolute majority in favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so through the decision outside of a decision making through the chair as councillors may recall previously with the committee structure that was in place they were non-delegated committees the recent adopted position by council with the two committees being reintroduced have been that they are now delegated committees so previously beforehand we used to have reports going to committees there was a recommendation coming out of that committee that would then go to a council meeting what has been proposed now what council has recently adopted was for delegated those committees to be have delegated authority so resolutions that arise out of those committees um no longer require going toward an ordinary meeting normally unless of course in those instances where there hasn 't been an absolute majority that 's what that provision is yeah so that makes sense it 's probably because of not having been under that system previously in my own experience the decision of those communities is the decision of council yeah yeah that 's probably the specific easiest question because the three new councillors haven 't had that the privilege of that previous success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did want to ask about uh just got a same as counselor rather but i 've got that much highlighted here it is to do with the to do with the petitions i 'm just trying to find which it 's in the same document there 's an item in the petitions that i wasn 't sure whether it was a new thing um yeah so we 're in item 5.5 which is include the postcode of all petitioners that 's not on council 's website um is that a new thing i just think if we 've got petitions through the chair my understanding and i 'm sorry alyssa 's team uh introduced these particular provisions but my understanding was that the existing information both on council 's website and fact sheet were being introduced into this policy essentially to formalize what has been the the existing practice so without having that fact sheet or sorry the website in front of me i 'm probably not in a position to be able to answer specifically whether that was previously a postcode only other than i assumed it had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here um i don 't know whether you need to table that i don 't think it 's necessary um but definitely from what i can read here that 's that 's not previously been in there so if people are wanting to present petitions from here on they need to know that those postcodes need to be in yeah a good point i think it 's um important i think that 's probably just more about um representing the people of the region yeah uh when those petitions are being formed it makes sense why it 's been included absolutely but yeah you 're right it 's not it 's not picked up inconsistent in the guidelines and needs to be noted we 'll follow that through councillor kirkland thank you um okay item 6.4 and the same um my question was does that i where it says if a motion is being moved and seconded the mover of the motion may elect to withdraw the motion um does that conflict with um 6.1 where it says when emotion has been moved and second it is subject to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on notice i 'm happy if you need to take it i noticed but i just felt that it was a little contra ending probably that 's a bit of an etiquette it is a bit of a conflict there yeah but there 's some time is a bit of an etiquette around that you might have got to move in a second or it 's becomes then the part of the council table discussion or debate yeah and then it might get to a point somewhere as a part of the discussion it might not have been a good idea to actually have that motion on the thing so sometimes the chair or another counselor may say hey would you like to withdraw so you could actually go back and have the council table do what does the 6.1 you can just say not deal with this matter and ban kill it or it can just be a polite way of saying withdrawal or walk away from a bad idea sometimes yeah so in the event that it 's been moved and doesn 't get a second or whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdraw it at that point because that 's the qriket moment isn 't it you know that we all want to avoid so might be oh okay well yeah perhaps in hindsight we should just withdraw the motion yeah the cricket moment i good analogy here thanks councillor kirkland okay damon that i think we 've exhausted all the questions there so councillor fisher just the uh the use of the mobile phones i know that that 's in there i don 't know if anyone raised that while i left the meeting um look i can understand the reason i 'm not having mobile phones but i know um even during this term there was uh a couple of times that there were there was airport business that was happening during a council meeting and also a council workshop that was text messages sort of coming through that myself and the deputy ceo had to leave the meeting a number of times so i 'm just wondering how that provision could be and it was cancelled i think it comes back down to just courtesy and just say look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just notify the other councils at the table at the time that now i 'm waiting on an item there that 's you know need to be dealt with and i 'm sure everyone 's we 're not in that space that we 're going to argue about that miss mayor i agree with councillor um fisher on that because i i had that highlighted as well i 'm wondering whether it was even relevant because we all have our phones what numbers it 's um item 9.1 9.1 it goes all the way down the bottom to the last sentence the use of mobile phones and obviously you know we 're in a changing environment where sometimes yeah yeah i don 't know it 's necessary i just i think pretend potentially it 's not relevant anymore yeah no i think that that intention there is not to actually take the phone call while you 're sitting here at the table we had in first term of brockhampton regional council there was a number of councillors who would turn around and start talking yeah yeah so that 's that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much not to have it on you but it 's yeah it 's that actually or as an item is coming up to be debated uh a certain person would pick the phone up and pretend to call on and walk out talking on the phone leave them so you didn 't have to vote on an item that was very yeah and that 's that 's not with us any longer but uh again i think it 's there just as a legacy one i appreciate that i just note that we 've all got our phones here and that on the occasion someone 's ringing we just tap yep in a meeting can 't answer it it 's etiquette back to the person trying to contact us to let them know we 're not ignoring them yeah okay cancer also did you want to think oh yeah and it 's not necessary i was actually going to go one further than that and you know it 's it 's different when we had paper agendas um everybody was present because there was paper agendas now we have electronic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people on a computer when there are offices or someone presenting you know i find it a little bit offensive to our to our offices that they 're standing there presenting and people are you know sitting on their computers and you know i i don 't think it 's to a point that we put it in the policies but you know generally if people could just um you know think a little bit more about um yeah being present at the table rather than being on their computer yep yep i have to admit i 'm probably one of the worst offenders does that because i 'm often sort of just you know doing that but i i didn 't realize that that but yeah i 've looked around i 've seen others doing the same but i didn 't realize that that it 's part of the part of sort of just technology catching up with the items that they get yeah i thought mayor after our visit to the parliament house you might want to introduce some question time yeah he said no i don 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but uh very interesting my visit to parliament house and watching question time and how that went that uh we don 't need it at their level uh i can guarantee that anyway uh if there 's no further questions on on that one could i seek a move in a second or with regards to the policy one move councillor smith second uh councillor kirkland i 'll put that those in favor oppose motions carried unanimously thank you councillors cancer we will move on in the essence of time notices of motion uh notice a motion cancelling the official proposed travel um look i 'm happy to move this one it 's something there that i 'd uh i 'd engage with councillor fisher i 'll take a second first before i speak to it councillor smith uh asked to uh to uh while he 's on his trip to uh to winton there to also look about some of the drive inland options with other councils there with the dinosaur and the the trail there there 's great opportunities for the drive market as we 've seen with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just another string to our bow when we 're talking about tourism and working on those inland travel with those neighbouring councils inland there 's great partnership and one we want to foster and promote and it 's great opportunity uh not only in the art space but also the drive market as well so um really wearing two hats uh on that journey to do that at that time i just can 't afford to um to take time away from the office at the moment so he answers any questions to that one um about the capricorn highway upgrade as well um council officials work with those councils to um get that upgrade going as well and um it relates to our council area especially the gagango area that 's um you know the scene of a lot of accidents on the go go range especially but i know further out needs a lot more um work in the early stages but hopefully they 'll um upgrade sections of in our area of the cap highway should be following the thought the guidelines there did you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you don 't have to if you would prefer not to no i have before i 've been pretty strong on notices of motions following the guidelines so i think it might be a way to do that if that 's the case uh i spoke for the most did you want to speak against emotion no um did you comment though [Laughter] and i i think for this one you know it 's it 's not a huge amount of money so um you know i 'm i 'm happy but in principle um i think we 're in a climate where we need to be really really careful about um where we are going and how much where we 're spending um so i i i think in in principle i don 't necessarily agree is this one um that bad no it 's it 's quite within um a reasonable budget so um yeah yeah no i understood again i 'll i 'll wrap it up again that uh yeah we need to be mindful in this space has been mentioned and i think it 's one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is there for that purpose so we can really understand what 's happening outside of their their boundaries so i think it 's captured there but we 'll uh we 're able to um deal with it from that level so i 'll put the motion those in favor as opposed emotions carried unanimously thank you councillors we have a an item to be dealt with in closed session it 's a late item that 's coming um okay council i need a uh mover in a second that we move into closed session deal with the matter that we move into the closed session it 's a legal matter in accordance with section 254 j3 brackets e the local government 2012 that 's considered necessary to close me and discuss legal advice obtained by the local government for the legal proceedings involving the local government including the example of legal proceedings that may be taken by or against the local government could i seek a movement that we move into close session move councillor fisher second council of motors i 'll put that those in favor emotions carried unanimously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed session councillor kirkland second councillor smith i 'll put that days in favor propose the motions carried thank you council we move

[Music] hi i 'm olivia and i live in the rockhampton region every day we do things that keep us and others safe like wearing a seatbelt or looking both ways before crossing the road but how do we do this in a disaster my friends and i know that disasters are a part of our lives our family and teachers have taught us how to stay safe in all different types of disasters that we might experience within the rockhampton region we can be impacted by a range of disasters including floods bushfires storms cyclones heat waves and pandemics it is important that we all learn how to prepare and stay safe during a disaster flooding can occur through continuous or heavy rainfall the ground becomes soaked and unable to absorb anything else causing the water to build up and flow into rivers creeks and drains my grandma remembers several floods in rockhampton yes olivia most of the flooding that occurs in the region is caused by the fitzroy river the de rumble people named the river tonuba flooding in tanuba may come from heavy rainfall within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any rain but how can we stay safe grandma if it 's flooded forget it floodwaters can move rapidly and can often wash away roads making the water deeper and stronger than you think you should never swim or ride your bike through flood waters if you are in the car ask the driver not to drive through the flood waters actually thinking of disasters and floods it reminds me of a story that my friend jack told me jack do you remember the story yes i do olivia back in 2018 my family and i were asked to leave our home in gracemere and go to a safer place because of a bushfire nearby oh no jack that sounds a little scary bushfires are dangerous bushfires are large uncontained fires that break out in vegetation as a result of humans accidentally or deliberately lighting fires or because of a lightning bolt striking the ground that 's right olivia some things we had to do was close all of our windows to keep the smoke out of the house and listen to warnings and alerts sometimes you need to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rockhampton region experiences storms that can cause heavy rainfall flash flooding lightning strikes and hail in april 2020 my family and i had to close all the windows and stay indoors because of a hail storm storms may cause damage to homes vehicles and belongings outside that are not properly secured because storms can be very destructive power lines can fall down roofs can be damaged and debris can be scattered on the ground it is important not to go near fallen power lines and wear closed in shoes if you have to leave your house [Music] in 2015 severe tropical cyclomarcia caused a lot of damage to the rockhampton region and many people had no water or electricity for days i remember eating dinner cooked on the barbecue after the cyclone cyclones are low pressure systems that develop over warm oceans in the tropics of australia there are many ways to stay safe during a cyclone like staying indoors gathering in the strongest part of the house and listening to warnings and alerts make sure you have prepared an emergency kit for times like these [Music] i know another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that jack heat waves heat waves typically occur in summer and are prolonged periods of extremely hot weather that 's right jack the rockhampton region is experiencing an increase in the frequency and duration of heat waves making it extremely important for us to understand how to stay safe during these conditions playing outside can be very dangerous during the middle of the day so my parents only let me hang out with my friends early in the morning or late in the afternoon when it starts to cool down we also make sure we play in the shade wear a hat and drink lots of water throughout 2020 my friends and i learnt about pandemics when krobin 19 arrived in australia pandemics are highly contagious viruses that are easily spread and can be very dangerous me and my friends experience a lot of changes when krover 19 began and we had to learn a lot of new rules the most effective way to stay safe during pandemic is to regularly wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and to stay at least 1.5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house ways to stay safe during a pandemic can change very quickly so it is important to listen to the advice given by doctors and scientists so now that we know about the disasters that could happen how do we stay safe grammar while it is important that we are prepared and have a household emergency plan like practicing fire drills at school a household emergency plan helps you understand exactly what to do and where to go for each emergency or disaster that you and your family might experience you should always have a family emergency kit and evacuation kit oh yes i know what that is mom and dad get me to help them update that every six months our emergency kit is made of all the things that we might need if we are unable to leave home when an emergency or disaster happens and our evacuation kit is made of all the things that we might need if it is unsafe to stay at home and we need to evacuate like jacked in the fires that 's right olivia these are very important kits and everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they should be regularly maintained when preparing for a disaster it is also important that your house is ready this can include helping grown-ups to clean around the house regularly it is also important to secure loose items like trampolines and swings that could be blown away in a high winds during storms and cyclones checking on your family friends and neighbors to ensure that they are also prepared is helpful in ensuring that everyone in the community is safe in the event of a disaster our pets are just as much a part of the family as we are so it is important that we keep them safe during disasters as well we can do this by thinking of our pets when preparing our family household emergency plan and emergency and evacuation kits being prepared for a disaster seems like lots of work olivia it 's okay jack in a disaster there are a lot of adults to help our parents can help as well as people from the police council ses fire brigade and paramedics that 's true olivia i know after the fires in grace beer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my dad about it and he made me feel much better yes trusted adults like teachers and family members are great to talk about these things with you can also get more information about disasters at the rockhampton regional council 's emergency dashboard it has some great resources so you can be prepared for any type of disaster in the rockhampton region [Music] you,"(-23.3786203, 150.5088889)"

favor opposed carried there we go i 'll move they 're going around really well now we move on to item 10 the officers reports item 10.1 brockhampton agricultural show greg would you like to present the report please thank you morning mayor and councillors uh this report uh comes about from a motion uh last month and uh i suppose it 's a very detailed report uh talks uh talks through all the costings and resourcing for the event and uh and compares the 2019 and the 2021 event as we know 2020 was uh cancelled due to covert and uh i say it spells out the number of visitors to the event and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably uh entertain questions rather than go into all that detail that actually is in the report councillors and mayor if that 's okay yep thanks very much greg councillor kirkland um thank you mr demeth thank you through you um greg the 2019 figures are they accurate um given that this time around we had really good opportunity to gauge the numbers through just to double check on that yes they 're as accurate as we can find detail for councillor yes beautiful thank you and i just noted that um when we were at the show a lot of the showman skilled people were talking about insurance and about the fact that they were having difficulty for the rides and that sort of thing getting insurances so moving forward will that be an expense that council would be expected to pick up if they can 't secure those insurance no since we wouldn 't cover their rides in the that entertainment that would be borne by the provider so in the event that they couldn 't get insurances how will our community be safe they wouldn 't operate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is that just about every every single year the the show is held no matter if we run it or uh society runs it is that workplace health and safety queensland go over and review a lot of the equipment that comes through the doors or through the gates as well as our safety team assist those on the way through so that doesn 't say that accidents won 't happen but that is one way of minimizing any issues council if i could probably yeah this is not rockhampton specific so i mean that 's the probably the important part and the answer to your question is if that means they can 't be uh supplying their their wares here they certainly can 't be anywhere else which means that the death of shows in general across across especially across queensland but probably across australia so i think other levels of government would then start to get involved as we know the federal government is on the insurance commission along the way in gen but insurances are all across the spectrum thank you for the question yes thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolution back in 2019 takes us through to 2025 and there was the continuation of the five dollar fee there i just wanted to ask the table does that continue through to 2025 or do we have options to change some of that fees and charges always can be change cancer at any time i think councillor smith 's got a full shadowed motion coming up after this report i think there was another report that was to be tabled so thanks uh at this stage it 's it is what it is thank you miss marin if i might just close off with some comment too to this report i want to say thank you greg for bringing the report to us and i think it 's really great for the community to see we 're talking about those support resources that you it 's difficult to kind of gauge how much they cost but looking at that page 10 there the the venue management and the safety perspective finance and all the rest of the things it 's a really good thing for the community to see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because sometimes when we see that yes we 've incurred a loss that could create some kind of negativity but when we look at the overall benefit that the community has received that 1.8 um million dollars it kind of balances things out and puts things in perspective again when we see the additional over and aboves that we we go to so thank you for bringing the report to us happy to move that the report be received mr mayor if there 's no other question kirkland again the importance of having events on throughout the year is something on the calendars that we make sure that our community feels that it 's a livable uh area as well so it 's something there that cancels the strides very hard and through advanced rockhampton and the team and across the council where those other supports are called on from time to time to assist with the staging of those events it does make it a lot easier but it 's they are difficult and hats off to all the staff and the team that pull those together but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um that step in to run those show committees and so forth there 's a lot of volunteer work that probably goes unnoticed as well so it 's a team effort and i 'm not sure everyone appreciates that when he walks through the door and you pay your ticket to get in okay thank you uh councillor smith um mine 's probably all comments uh mr may um you know with we look back on the last 12 months from june to june we had covert in there we 're trying to organise and you know cover got kept getting in the way and uh weren 't sure uh if there was even gonna be a show at one stage because some uh agricultural societies in queensland actually pulled out it was just too hard with the covert um but after the show i actually uh spoke to peter curtis if you notice he 's on our committee he 's been around rockhampton show he tells me for 60 years ever since he was six year old uh he 's involved in not only our committee but the committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running it in the early 2000s he was actually involved as well he 's the senior vice president of queensland ag shows um and what he was telling me was something i didn 't know and i noticed that some of the showies move in two weeks before the show and it 's actually rocky 's classed as a maintenance depot where a lot of them that aren 't following they all follow different circuits they come to rocky they use mechanics electricians that boiler makers because people who sell hot dogs aren 't mechanics and they get their vehicle serviced if you look around their vehicles are worth a lot of money a little bit different to the early days when they went around in old trucks and that they 've got all modern equipment that needs servicing and their rides have to be serviced and inspected as well so they use rocky as a depot uh to do that two weeks before the show and um that gives our our businesses and rocky um some some business and i know that 's appreciated but also i 'm concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years we 've paid out ninety three hundred thousand and it 's all internal mainly the wages bill to get volunteers as we know and we keep saying that young people aren 't stepping up so the show society in queensland recognized that and they 've brought out something called next gen and i know when we had the um showgirl finals in rocky last in 2019 there was some people there from next gen and they were lovely young people so there 's only um rockhampton area central queensland and western queensland who aren 't involved at the moment but peter 's going to get rockhampton going in the next 12 months it 's encouraging young people to be volunteers they train them they give them confidence in running the shows and they 've they 've got to a standard now that um the next gen are actually running events and raising money for show society so that 's something exciting that is going to happen during the next 12 months and hopefully we can get more volunteers i know we 've got nearly 100 volunteers but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people can be encouraged to be volunteers next year and that will bring our wages bill right down yeah thanks for that information council smith it 's good to understand that it 's not sure we all get to appreciate what what what the show brings and and what we do need with uh volunteering and the staff uh time involved in that as well uh so council kirkland has moved oh sorry council wickerson has a question yeah thanks mr mayor comment then followed by a question uh firstly through you to greg thank you very much for the detailed report this is so good to get that actual feedback after the event of what the actual indicators are we predicted before but good to get that measurement upwards so thank you for the detail of that and thanks to uh councillor kirkland for removing that to make that so uh but reading through the portals uh i guess a little bit surprised at how many units of council uh get actually get involved probably the unsung heroes of it including councils around the table think we all spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not and on the committee but also uh in the ring chasing cattle around and horses around and chasing us around so uh yeah congratulations but the question is greg and this goes i think at the bottom of page seven just about that economic impact of it uh see yeah you 've got the the figures of total visitor spend i probably need a bit more explanation about how that 's the methodology how we come to that is that based on a per visitor uh average and i was i guess i was surprised that there was a little bit of a loss uh to direct impact is that money that goes you know for example on the show men 's guild that goes out of the sea that 's why there 's a little bit of leakage there it is it is uh there 's a number from that point of view again uh direct and imp indirect uh economic impact have a number of factors within them of course and a lot of that is what money stays in town and spent versus what leaves the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like i can try and step that out a little bit more in an email if you like but i was very heartened to see that economic number uh because you know as has been said around the table so many people are involved whether that be internal here at rocky regional council in delivering this event you can see that in there not just ar but all across council but then there 's the volunteers that 's so you counsellors but also you know without the showman 's guild there 's no show either so you know there 's those sort of factors uh so if that economic impact was 500 000 we might not be sitting here going well that 's wonderful but with 1.8 million dollars it 's a it certainly is a lot of moving paths it 's very resource-hungry whether that be internal resources or external to make it happen but it 's something that is delivering for the city so we just got to work out how we resource that and make efficiencies each year as as you can see on that table you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for less money or at least less net net money on our budget between one year and the next or one show on the next so hopefully we can continue to make those improvements again our revenue numbers are even higher again this year uh this coming show uh in 2022 so they 'll you know there 'll be challenges there but that 's also about trying to continue to improve that expense side of the budget as well but delivering a great show and uh as the mayor said council smith has a motion that 's sitting on the table at the moment we can discuss that at the appropriate time as well that that may uh that will have an impact uh if passed as well thank you and just finally understand that it 's more than the bottom line we talk about this with every event that we do it 's that livability and the and the confidence that it puts back out in the community particularly this time you know with the with health crisis around it just shows a bit of confidence and leadership that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're right uh council wickerson and i think it probably highlights um when you look at the the calendar year the events that have been undertaken this year with uh beef week and rocky nats uh and then the rocky show uh nrl um there 's lots of preparation that 's been going on behind in the unsung heroes of those people that work in there for the council that uh that go on to do unknown to say uh it missed the ceo if there 's something there that you could take back to the staff would be something there that we do really appreciate the efforts that they put in this year with uh undertaking all those events council rutherford um mr mayor i was happy to um second but if i can also add um thank you once again for the report but you know we 've often discussed that um our community and and our region is more than just built hard infrastructure you know i think by far it 's it 's about um the livability as you said and these events come with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ livability of our community really is is invaluable you can 't put a dollar figure on that because you could have the nicest looking built infrastructure but if there is no heart and soul in a community it 's not a nice place to live so i i think um the investment that we 've put into these um these events you know it shows in our community and um i 'm happy to second this thank you very much yeah good mayor if i could just add to that i suppose that the last weekend just passed is a great example of that i mean three fantastic events in the sill four if you count the waddle day festival as well but you know several of which we were part of in a support fashion so in nrl pbr waddle day festival and big boys toys i mean well what a great weekend and it had people certainly not just out and about but talking about the region and how wonderful it is as well so that 's i think that 's so important and that 's council relevance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the city and you know whether we 're running the events in this case with the show or whether we 're supporting them in other ways whether that be as a entire council or just advanced real captain and dare i say it um greg putting rocky on your radar i love it thank you man yeah uh council election thank you mr man just say uh three through two greg um thank you greg for the report and it obviously shows the cost benefit analysis of the show in the region and that 's great to know just a question um admissions were 33 000 people for the for the duration of it but yet just looking at the admission fees and that 's equivalent to 28.5 000 people why the discrepancy it 'll be numbers through the gate uh somewhere there i i can 't tell you unequivocally but it will be numbers through the gate and there will be a number that are counted that may be workers and such like that so that at the end of the day they 're still attendees at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your question on notice and and dig in a bit further okay thank you councillors no further questions i 'll put that those in favor please carried unanimously thanks again for the report and thanks again for for calling for that report moving on to uh communities and heritage 10.2 the rockhampton museum of art philanthropy board member recommendation thanks very much damon thank you mr mayor councillors good morning the report before you for consideration uh relates to the appointment of a new member

square meters in size and includes two bedroom one bathroom open kitchen living area the house will be provided with an on-site sewage system and will be connected to council 's water network and gain access via tolerance street the application was required sorry um so the subject application was required due to the site being affected by a special management overlay this overlays in place because

kilometers from the subject site concerns were raised about the on-site water and sewerage services however the applicant provided that there 's enough water and enough area for sewage services the submitter also raised an issue about the current car parking and veranda for the hotel and not enough parking for the hotel the hotel 's actually excluded from this application so we can 't take that into consideration the turning lanes were incorrect or insufficient dtmr was a referral agency for this application and they are happy with all the turn circles and sweat paths he had concerns also regarding flooding the front part of the site does partially flood from westwood creek but all the infrastructure is well outside of that area he also raised some concerns that we can 't actually consider such as increased robberies petrol sniffing those sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conditions in the report thanks very much tanya councils questions council smith and council rutherford council smith oh yes uh tanya you said um main roads are happy with the um so they 're happy with what 's in the application for in turning in and turning out through the chair yes they are they 've got to do it according to the capricorn um standards etc that 's that 's correct there will be a turn in from the west yes and a flip lane yes there will be me yeah thank you that was my concern with the with anything like this thanks council smith councillor rutherford um mr mayor i 'd like to move this if i could it 's um a great development for the westwood community they 're very excited about it i think the issues that were raised have been addressed adequately um and it 's uh it 's brought a very very good vibe to that community so i would ask my young counselor colleagues to support this application thanks very much and julian noted councillor rutherford um councillor mothers uh thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that i think this is very good for westwood community it 's it 's great to see some sort of um building going on there and it 's it just helps promote the area as well so i 'm i 'm happy to second it okay second and council mothers council if you have further questions i 'll put that recommendation those in favor opposed carried unanimously thank you thanks very much tanya here for the next report as well yes i am thank you we 'll go to that okay the next report is in relation to a minor amendment to a preliminary approval overriding the planning scheme for the horizon rail yards back in march council approved that development it 's a little bit different in that 's one where there 's effectively a mini planning scheme for the horizon site and it splits it up into precincts um so you can see there it 's divided into a number of precincts through precincts each precinct has a table of assessment for development applications that may be needed to be lodged in the future the application and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're in industrial use and the railway yard local plan considered educational uses for part of the site linfox was worried about reverse amenity impacts and that occurs when you 've got an existing use and you come up with a new more sensitive use so that they can 't complain about noise and odour and dust and those sorts of things so lynn fox and council got together and we 've agreed to amend the local plan code um which is marked in changes in the report um effectively there 's been a few changes in the definitions to include a sensitive land use definition which includes educational establishments that only tafe or university so under the old local plan code it could have been a child care center it could have been a kindy anything like that so it 's just basically now gone down to tertiary education establishments the transport related facilities they included a mini definition of that so in relation to that the local plan code changed for the two definitions and then there were just consequential amendments through it to um to make sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there thanks tanya and uh it seemed logical for those educational ones to be that at that level anyway so uh makes sense council has any questions to tanya on this one i 'm happy to move seek a second up second and councillor mothers i 'll put that those in favor pose carried unanimously thanks very much tonya thank you moving on to border and environmental sustainability 10.6 environmental sustainability strategy for 2021 year in review and uh we 'll ask christine and again probably take this opportunity to thank the team for the tidy towns award and the work that 's gone into the backgrounds there and councillor cacklin i 'm sure she 'll let go of that it 's great to receive not one but two awards fantastic so great work there so i 'll hand over christine thank you thank you may and good morning councillors it 's my pleasure today to present the environmental sustainability strategy year in review this highlight report really checks in on the progress against council 's strategy and the significant achievements that we 've had in the year that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public exhibition of this report sorry you finished your report there thought it was going to be a large uh large uh explanation but no thanks very much christine councillor kirkland as a portfolio chair would you like to thank you yeah thank you mr mayor happy too this is this is one of council 's most comprehensive reports that we present and the this year 's year in review document we actually showcase a lot of the photography that came through our local environment photography awards earlier in the year it celebrates amazing victories and delivery of initiatives that that actually mean real savings and benefits to our community so environmentally we 're looking at educational programs transitioning away from single-use plastics as an example and our fogo trial is another example we 've got socially footpaths and tree plantings that encourage that healthy physical activity as opposed to driving in the car that being said we probably all drove here in a car today and economically of course the solar farm and that 's going to return significant energy costs back to the rate payers to to council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 22 on this it promises to the region that we 're heading in the direction of continued deliberate stewardship and improvements of that natural social and economic environment ensuring sustainability as we move forward working together with the community with council practicing what they preach i like that the change starts at home and it 's a continual question to us of what next what else and what more can we do i want to extend my thanks to christine and laura and indeed all of council for actually leading the way on this and our most recent celebration as you mentioned may receiving two national awards i think that 's a first in this type of thing environment for us to receive national awards for the natural environment management and the environmental sustainability and water those two awards through the australian sustainable communities this is a big title through the australian sustainable communities keep australia beautiful tidy town awards it further testifies to the journey that we are on congratulations to the community of the region of rockhampton regional council sometimes you know we can get so focused on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know we can see what impacts us personally and perhaps complain that not enough is being done yet we actually don 't look out and see that there 's quite a lot happening out there so that being said we 've still got a long way to go as i have commented before more that we can do and i am really happy to move that this report be received and made available for the public thank you councillor copeland very comprehensive overview of the the strategy and it again um my take on it i 've noticed the staff commitment to the to the strategy and that really is something that um when councils implement something and if it 's not carried through from the staff level um you feel like you 're you may be heading up the wrong path but just to see the enthusiasm and the staff um involvement in that it really tells us that they 're we 're heading in the right way in the right direction so councillor smith and then councillor wickerson cancer thanks mr b i 'd also like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and probably this goes back to 2016. that was the first term when councillor wickerson was the environmental person we 've come a long way since then and i think that from 2012 to 2016 we didn 't have an environmental section so we 've come real come a long way kicked a lot of goals and with winning those two awards i hope we 're going to put ourselves in the like the lgaq magazine tell the world what we 've won we we don 't let enough people know the good things we 're doing here like you open that up and you read about councils doing something that we did 10 years ago and everyone thinks it 's marvelous so i think we should um make sure that we get really good exposure out of this blow our trumpet yes i think we should too i um guarantee that um thank you councillor smith council wickerson and again um acknowledgement from your um i know it 's a portfolio previous involvement in this space but thanks mr mayor i don 't know i 'd love to commend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with christine and and co and lisa sitting there quietly and we 've come a long way right from the very start we wanted to make environmental sustainability just a natural part of the culture and not only council culture and we can see when we have our leadership team that every unit of council again gets involved and they 're having their own initiatives but it 's become just a natural thing to do we don 't have to think anything special that we 're doing it 's just ingrained in what we do every day so that 's that 's a great achievement but also then you see that leadership spill over into the community with the four thousand six thousand hours of community uh input uh through volunteering into programs uh the engagement of all the schools i think when we started we struggled a bit to get uh 12 schools to enter into the calendar and now we 're trying to find more months in the year to fit them all in so they all want to prize but and even just the projects that those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planting few trees or a herb garden whatever now they 're they 're quite advanced and very uh forward thinking so those sort of measures show that we are making inroads a long way to go but man we 've come a long way too so again congratulations to the whole team with great work and i 'm sure it 's going to continue under great stewardship thanks councillor kirk council wickerson councillor rutherford mr mayor we it 's not a trumpet we have we 've got to keep blowing and i think that 's the thing we just uh probably don 't focus on it enough thanks councillor brotherhood um happy to move cancer kirkland and the second council wickerson i need i need to focus i had a text message i was off there and it 's gone but uh that said thanks very much uh council no more questions i 'll put that those in favor oppose carried unanimously thanks again christine welcome thank you all [Applause] now moving on to budget governance and other matters 10.7 commercial center study and cam giving miranda it 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this one but i 'll give you a clap again thanks mr may uh and uh good morning councillors so i believe this matter was lifted off the table this morning the commercial center study 2021 uh as councils are probably aware we had a discussion uh last month on the contents of the study itself and we 've gone away and made a couple of uh primary changes being a check of the data and including parker 's shopping centre as well as some updates around uh reference to households in the hierarchy the the purpose of the report is is for the study to be received uh the attachment is the executive summary um so if there 's any questions thanks again councillor lucham thank you much so kevin it 's great to see that um those uh figures have been updated and are more accurate than uh zero percent last time um so it 's good to see that that has been amended and uh and likewise some of the uh the uh recommendations have kind of been a little bit modified because of that so but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'd just like to say that i 'm glad the the numbers are more reflective but what it does say to me uh is that there are different methodologies that uh and it depends on the methodology you use depends on the type of figures and outcomes that you get from it so i guess if i can take the report with a bit of pinch of salt uh because there are parts of it that with under different methodologies some some areas are more vacant than implied in this report itself so but across the board i 'm generally happy with it thanks very much cancellation council of kirkland um mr mayor are we able to add to that motion to change slightly not but not change the intent the emotion it 's only the report we 've received so if you wanted to put a dot point in there yes if it 's possible yeah let 's see how it goes yep um so i 'd just like to add a dot point that we received the report as part of the ongoing economic reviews and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full report available on application let 's grab that publicly in public anyway i only the executive report though no the whole report goes public here uh the proposal is just the executive summary would be made available so the reporter we made available obviously all reports are made available um so that 's the intent okay it doesn 't need to be currently councillor mothers thanks very much mr mayor um through you to cameron cameron i just wanted to say uh thank you uh and good job i know you uh yourself and the team started off with a report that um was less than um what 's what i 'm looking for what you know wasn 't 100 correct and i know you 've done a lot of work behind the scenes to get that information back to us um so it was more reflective of the reality i just wanted to say thanks very much because i know we all put you through the ringer over that one a little bit so just thank you to you yourself and the team for that okay cheers thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then councillor smith yes so they get the the executive summary is going live what will be from today uh so what what when we say the full report is that all our preamble etc is that what you 're talking about they can get a copy of the full report kim that 's correct the the proposal is um to make the report available to obviously those those key stakeholders which is just the executive summary at this stage if councils wish to change that we can certainly change so can i just clarify that is it going public on our website is it public on our website uh not not currently but we can make but we can do that if councils wish to do that then we can make it publicly available we already have a number of studies already publicly available that were done as part of the original planning scheme notice that i thought that was the idea of putting it out for public consultation yeah my suggestion there is to make the whole report publicly available at the itiable just a query mr mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh viewable to the public now yes so yeah sorry for the chair yes the the report is this report is available with the executive summary but not the study but we can make the study of publicly available or the requested counselors and like with the report that 's on there um will that also include that disclaimer that it is just for information yes reflective of our policy yes sorry for the chair yes that 's correct councillor wickerson we 'll have a a note across it saying for information purposes only it is important to to recognize if we do make it publicly available that the recommendations are subject to further change and discussion and deliberation by by council so there 's no commitment to those recommendations they 'll be simply discussed at a later date yep okay thank you okay no further questions can i seek a mover in a second with regards to those reports move councillor kirkland second and councilman put that those in favor pose carried thank you moving on to season charges 2021 amendments thanks very much mani thanks kim thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in relation to changes to the fees and charges one is in particular relation to the special mortar media reading for on-site inspection fee to make it consistent we had it in two places on the fees and charges area and it 's supposed to be 105 dollars in both areas so this is just to align that consistency the rest of the report is in relation to heritage village fees and charges following the receivable by council in february of the business review review report and summary report and talking about the higher commercial hire functions at the sharing shed and the broader heritage village site on a dry hire basis there are a number of changes that are put forward as par as part of that review and recommendation for the higher fees which are listed in the report if questions wish to be asked about those council election thanks mr mayor and three to nimani i 'm happy with most the fees except 35 36 37 which referred to the heritage village sharing shed and on comparison to previous financial years prices on what we charged that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about dry hiring it and comparing it to other fantastic facilities that the rockante regional council has such as scotia house virginia house the showgrounds this is significantly more to higher and and the dry hire seems to have a component an additional component of staffing embedded within that so it 's not as simple as scotia house you pay 350 as an air conditioned venue and it 's purely a dry hire this one that 's been suggested is is a bit more embedded than that and i have concerns about how how the price has increased from last year to the new fees and i i understand they 'll be workshopped in the next couple of weeks or so and yeah welcome that yeah well alicia would you be able to give us some details on why it 's a higher cost than just a dry hire from a building like the um bohemian house scotia place i know that um through the chair john webb was going to be online i don 't know whether he 's there yeah oh john would you be able to clarify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chat um thank you good morning um when we spoke about dry hire the reason the terminology that we 're using there was that we were not going to be providing any food or food service we do know that there 's occasions where we may have to provide the beverage services if they can 't find somebody else to provide the alcohol service the level of planning that is expected when people fire this venue isn 't just the same as the bohemia house or the north scotia place they still expect to come and speak to somebody they still expect to come to speak to somebody and then plan their event um you 'll see from the pricing structures we have three different levels of intensity so to speak that would be required to support the higher of the venue and that will be based upon what the fire 's requirements are from us on the day i don 't believe that there was an expectation that because of the quality of this venue that we would hand the keys over for the weekend and there would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dry high perspective was really to reduce the costs that were embedded in what we 've had to pay in order to achieve food and beverage pricing so what we 've done is looked at three different levels of intensity of what people expect with the venue it may very well be that people will just pay the lower amount will then be able to sort of restrict the level of support that we do need to give them for their event and then thereby you know making it as as affordable as possible so that 's the explanation i 've got at the moment council legend thank you mr supplementary to that i accept that it is a specialized facility and people would there are some people out there who would pay any amount of money for the the beautiful function area that it is um but i kind of fear for the price if it was obviously more in line with the other facilities we have possibly it would be booked out a lot more through the year except because it doesn 't have air conditioning it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i fear for that figure as a comparison of how much it 's gone up from last time um so going up from last time there were very few occasions when we did hire the venue and all we charged was the venue high um and we then had you know in the food and beverage pricing there was then an attempt to get more for the service really what we 've done here is been very clear that we 're not to present doing the food and beverage and we are still going to have to book and manage the venue to a level of expectation which is very different from what people expect of bohemia house that 's for that that basic 2 200. but certainly councillor if we then find that this is doesn 't meet the market we can certainly review from there we do have bookings at the moment and we were sort of forecasting where we uh estimated that the price was going to be and we have not had one negative piece of feedback about the that base 2 200 price it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do have an hourly rate that 's to try and have business for smaller meetings and and i guess morning teas in that style of event during the day and we 've really built that price in there to try and facilitate those a more affordable option and that 's on an hourly rate so we built that capacity in there but very happy after a while we can come back and reflect upon the prices and whether that 's been whether that 's achievable or the right the right path thanks john councillor wickerson uh thanks mr mayor i think like others initially i was a bit skeptical of those prices too because it was a big jump up from what we were used to but when i first queried that a little bit looking around not at venues in rockhampton because they are very different to what the shearing shed is they 're just in capacity and the attached village with it people often don 't just book the shed it 'll be in conjunction with the wedding or photo shoots or whatever else through the um through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ product but places similar to rockhampton and places similar to heritage village elsewhere are commanding this sort of money and and more so i was sort of um pleased to see that but i guess the the proof of the pudding john will be are we getting uh active bookings at those levels and that you 're satisfied with if you 're still online yes certainly sorry just too um we 've certainly got about at the moment between now and this time next year without having launched a new pricing we 've got about 16 to 17 bookings already so i 'd anticipate that we 'd start to get some good usage of the site and then we can the way our new process is going to work we can review how that 's going yeah okay thank you well i 'm happy to review that in in 12 months i 'm going to have that review i should say and just see if we 're satisfied with the uptake of it if obviously we 're not getting that interest at that higher rate well obviously it needs it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're very keen to see the heritage village uh to be more commercially viable and probably never make a profit but at least to offset some of the operational costs of it uh this is one obvious way that we can do that so we 'll try it for a while and just see um see if we 're happy with the results yeah thanks councillor councillor rutherford i was just wondering i know you said you didn 't um check anything local but as far as competitors for that type of venue lazy acres henderson park have we checked comparison pricing for those facilities i 'm not sure thanks yes we have looked at some of those it does vary quite wild broadly depending upon what 's on offer but we are certainly within them i would say the middle of that market there or towards the lower end and by then also not doing the food and beverage and potentially also not the alcohol and embedding that within to our service price and betting to being positive into that we 're able to allow people to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they may wish to use or may not wish to use yeah that 's true makes it a little bit more flexible for people of different cultural backgrounds to use the site as well thanks very much john for that explanation okay councils i don 't think we have any further questions could i take a move in a second move councillor wickerson second and councillor kirkland put that those in favor pose do you want to record that cancellation cancel action record his vote against that national okay cancers will move on the notices of motion we have a notification one point eleven point one council saying latin with the rockhampton regional council floral emblem council election oh hang on we 'll take them over in a second or first you happy to move second councillor wickerson thanks mr mayor and uh happy for this um recommendation that we uh just delay it a little bit so we get the uh rockhampton regional residents a chance to have a say on this floral emblem and and also other things that may come up that have symbolic representation on behalf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while we uh we we do this properly we have proper consultation okay thank you speaker um we need another speaker against i think it was just a comment really comment happy for a comment [Laughter] thank you mister i just wanted to commend um councillor latcham for taking the initiative to do something which clearly there is a sentiment across the community of concern around this and and and i also want to say thank you for changing the motion to to incorporate conversation that we had at the workshop so well done thank you i 'm happy to second that good outcome and i 'll okay that as well cancer kirkland councillor wickerson uh just a query three mr may um against the legend you said and other symbols i 'm just wondering what what that might include we talked about floral symbols are we looking at other the crest crests okay it may expand out to other things if there 's an interest in that time between now and then um there 's an official burn believe it or not um there 's other things but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the crest has been raised since then yeah yes if you have a mascot to count me out i 've been there done that yeah through the chair primarily the crest was the other one and there 's also had been some talk on um oh yeah symbols as well so okay so the plan will come back to council but before we get into that now we 've got uh when time permits okay no worries we have mover in the second half no further questions i 'll put that those in favor opposed carried unanimously thank you questions on notice urgent business we have uh two items to be dealt with in closed session councils the contact renewal for the ceo and support for beef australia 2021 can i see you can move that we move into

meeting of the last day of february so um i 'll call for a leave of absence we we don 't have any counsellor i haven 't heard from councillor wix and but councilman is caught in traffic he shouldn 't be too far away so i 'll just see councillor wilkerson coming in now so looks like we 'll have a full house uh i might do the acknowledgements and uh firstly i 'd like to begin by acknowledging the country the traditional cascadings of the land in which we meet today the der rumble people and payroll respects the elders past present and emerging i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local government area the gangalu nation people the bharata kabul barra and yetimarala people i also acknowledged the torres strait islander people landed in the torres straits but he lived in work on aboriginal land council is moving on to item for the declarations in interest and matter on the agenda as it 's a budgetary i don 't think there 's any declarations there but if there 's anything comes up uh during the course of the meeting councils will uh by all means raise them at that point uh moving on to officers reports officer report 5.1 the grace means south rockhampton sewage treatment series strategy review i 'll hand over to peter to walk through that report thank you peter good morning councillors and may uh okay this report is seeking council to endorse the long term strategy for grey smear in south rockhampton there are two two resolutions the first is the actual endorsement of the strategy the second resolution is to reallocate 14.5 million and if you look at your report it will say 14 that was an error in my behalf but it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a minute um shook we 'll give a brief presentation and step through that strategy there are two other corrections to this report could you just if you have a look in within your report under commentary you 'll see a 2027. that should be 2030 and the 2042 should be 2033. they don 't make any material difference to this these numbers are evolving over time and we will eventually bring you a 10-year asset plan which will outline this in a little bit more detail so work is on behind the scenes i 'm trying to work out the timing of this the key about the strategy is that council adopted this strategy in 2014 what we have done is reviewed that strategy and and seen if it applies and it 's still the best option for today and essentially it is so the strategy that you are adopting is what you actually adopted in 214 the next steps after that will be concept development and developing as i said a long term asset renewal and upgrade program i 'm now just going to hand over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you okay thanks peter welcome to shook okay good morning mayor councillors and all ceos and other officers um what i 'm going to present it is at this moment is the grey smear and south strategy as peter said that this strategy was in fact adopted by consul in 2014 but for some reason its implementation hasn 't been as it was expected at that time we are now nine years from their time so in order to have anything every strategy has significant number of assumptions so nine year is a long period we had to validate those assumptions and we had to see whether that strategy is still valid okay so we did engage an external consultant and one of the member of that consultant was the member of 2014 team of sinclair knight and merge who did that so we did again reviewed that strategy with whatever assumptions we made whether how they resulted for reconfirmation and validation what we did examined from that strategy and the long-term strategy is how to solve the problem of south rockhampton stp as processing train of south plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant both old plants getting upgraded in grey smear both processing train and keep grasmere third option was that we have a new plant we upgrade both the existing processing trains but close down the grasmere so we have a bigger new plant both up existing process strains are upgraded but we close down the grass meal okay then the fourth one was that we know we consolidate we consolidate everything into one new state of our treatment plant at south close down old south plants close down grey smear and we have a brand new plant of a big chunk so these were the four scenarios that were considered even in 2014 we reconsidered them again here okay and we used multiple criteria to assess which option came back and we come back the major thing that you will see is the cost what is cost and what are the associated risks with these options cost is one part but the risk so first option we new plant plus one train of refurbishment and having grey smear upgraded it is 111 million the smaller new plant but both existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have a bigger new plant we take the new plant from here both process trend here and we close down grace meal that is 130 million but then the fourth one that we construct a brand new 50 000 or 55 000 ep north rockhampton stp state of art with new technology and no legacy carry on a clean new start line okay for next in a healthy way it 's 117 and after so that is one thing what are the risks associated with this before we make a decision before you make a decision what are the major risk the risks are operational okay all other options so construct a new plant and close down grey smear is the recommended strategy that is the strategy number four why the question you people are asking why why we do this all other option involves multiple plant at two sides with a significant operational risks of course new 50 plant will be a single plant it will avoid all refurbishment costs because refurbishment cost is a black box okay till we empty till we offline did we look into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no different than lottery ticket okay so refurbishment cost is a big risk the benefit is the economy of scale okay one single plant bigger plant do not linearly extend the operational cost but it significantly decreases operational cost which is a major cost which council has to bear for the next 50 years and the third one is that the this is the considered the best strategy and that is why it is recommended but this requires funding okay so each one has got its own risks and that is why considering all balance of probability this is the strategy for a long term for grey smear and south how the operationally it will work because council has the environment license of console says that in grey smear the effluent must be used for irrigation purposes that commitment need to continue and in future the stringent standard that are coming for all effluent from these treatment plants is that discharge to waterway should be eliminated or minimized reuse of effluent should be maximized or guaranteed to protect environment have improvement and integrated water management cycle is most efficient and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water which is very high cost you can convert it into effluent reuse so these are the things we are in a long term strategy that has been considered adopting this strategy is not tomorrow it 's a it 's a significant work has to be done so what are we going to do in the short term okay the question is the short term so several short term issues have been identified and the most important short-term issue that need to be fixed till the new plant is commissioned is to make sure how we are going to address the regulator 's concerns that is in grey smear we are non-compliant okay and we need to do that grace mere plant we have to have zero discharge that means hundred percent utilization of effluent so we have to guarantee how we are going to do it within the license condition that is the first issue of ours regulator have in writing complained that the number of complaints are not being satisfactorily addressed so we have to make a permanent solution for that okay till such time we bring our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant issues because grey smear is running beyond its design capacity we need to reduce the load so that it can work within much within its design capacity so these are the most critical issues for us in the short term to address but it 's not easy okay because grace mere sorry south is not very healthy south is also limping if not can 't walk if i use the analogy okay so to do that thing is up the major issue is that it has got significant odor hydrogen sulfide gases that are being generated there which has really made certain area out of bound for these operators contour it is stringent aqua health and safety regulations are coming and that means we need to address that hydrogen sulfide issue immediately okay plus south rockhampton at this moment is running beyond its design capacity that was forecasted in 1976 that means it is it was designed for two trains of twelve thousand five hundred ep total to twenty five thousand it is running at twenty four and a half thousand before we bring grey smear load so we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be validated done adjusted so that it can take that extra load for next eight years okay and minor other operation issue that we have to do so we have to do these issues there but this is not the issue because the grace mirror is not sitting there and south here and it will orbit in between is a network okay so when we bring the um other issues that will be the network and other network issue is how we connect grey smear with south because we are not going to trucking yet the load of grey smear to south we have to make sure that we have a pipeline for that this is that this was all in the strategy in 2014 nothing new we started the pipeline but never finished and then there is in between is a very critical arthur street pump station where the most of south runoff or is catchment areas sea which comes in collected in arthur street and then pumped with a single by the pumps to the south and that arthur street pump station which is in fact is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it is about it is not in a good condition it 's already in the wheelchair it can 't walk so we need to make sure that we have as a short-term strategy a brand new uh arthur street pump station because it has to survive for next 50 years so we have to first construct the arthur street pump station as a part of shorter strategy pipeline so that we can then join south and grey smear okay so this is the story is there and these works these two works is a prime short term measure to connect it and they must be completed by this time which is not having much time okay so this is a so where we are right now your question will be where the hell you are right now so where we are right now the grace near to south pump pipeline started in 2015 but never completed and arthur street so this is to connect them and at both end we 'll have to do the short-term measurements so just to stabilize the entire network in a short term so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-term strategy well thought about it think about it well designed it get license approvals and then construct it in a way that we have a keep all the through our journey we keep your risk consults risk low medium low okay and regulators have confidence what we are doing okay so with this what peter said we would like console to accept this uh long-term strategy accept the short-term measures and actions and then reallocate the grey smear current budget to south so that we can sorry north so that we can start north because north is our backup we have to have north rockhampton 's seaweed treatment plant upgraded as early as possible so that should there be anything fall over we have got to fall back with sufficient extra capacity to take this okay thanks so shook i 've got a number of uh lights on there so thank you thank you councillor smith and then back to uh council of latin council smith yeah if we could go to i think the second page um with the amounts it just didn 't didn 't really add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new uh 25 000 ep for the south rocky be 114 yet double that is 117 what so on the second yesterday yep it 's got um 114 million for a new 25 yep yep yeah refurbishment of south trains these are the main things so you are yeah in this it is not the plant cost it is this refurbishment cost yeah it is this refurbishment for that um cannot start immediately it needs a lot of work design work planning work okay how we are going to bring it and the approval from the regulators okay and these conditions need to and that will require minimum minimum two and a half to three years yeah just to expand on that so the north rockhampton upgrade is fully designed and as tendered all of these plants are aged and had had north not started we probably would be talking about south but north is urgent just as much and we need to build a additional 25 so that we can then go in and refurbish the old two trains because it is a very old plant so and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant in our whole operation that we can then go right this is refurbed it 's ready it 's going to be reliable so that that 's why south if you we we are moving as quickly as we can on south and and that started now but there 's a long design concept development citing approvals process to go so we will move as quickly as we can but in the interim we are stabilizing south and grey smear to keep them running while we do that work and are we confident that the epa will let us build a new one itself yes yes yes we 've the regulator has seen all of this and are very much on board with where we 're going so we 're applying for funding for this new project we will be applying funding under all things and that 's it right now this is just giving you information to adopt the strategy okay we will come back with a lot more detail and how we fund this over the next 10 years and we are smoothing it out this south plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start so um there 's a whole another layer and at the next infrastructure committee we plan to give you a presentation on the asset renewal program for sewer and water which is a little bit of a different question to this one which says adopt the strategy the the reason why this has been pulled out and is being put as a special counsel meeting is we have tended north rockhampton we want to engage that contract the reallocation of that 14.5 allows us to engage and let that contract and we plan to do that subject to this report being approved today and the reason is there 's some urgency and some also um currency of that tender if we if we went to tender again as you know what was going on with prices it would it 'd be more expensive yeah so just to say that i have talked to peter about um you know while all this is happening that we could still get the effluent water for the grace for golf club go through all that again that we 've just been through with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been assured that that 's gonna happen we need to improve the treatment of our water and but we will be maintaining it that connection to the golf club and hopefully enhancing the more water we can give those groups and other groups out there the better for us and our ability to assure the irrigation to them is how soon we can stabilize grey smear and satisfy them and the only way we can stabilize south as our grey smear is to take extra load that is coming on this plant is to bring it to south and it is running within its capacity currently it is running beyond its capacity so first of all to stabilize we have to take that extra load from it bring it to the south thanks councillor smith uh and last thursday i was down in brisbane with the ceo to uh to talk about funding uh with minister scanlon 's uh advisers about the north north rocky series treatment plant and looking for funding from that space it 's also a priority in our federal election campaign for the north rocky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funding on both federal and state levels for that project that 's not to say once we 've got the details on this one that we won 't be um looking to uh seek funding for those as we go forward as well thanks council smith council of latin and i 'll go to council wickerson thank you mr man through you through to a shook with each of these four different options there 's obviously pros and cons for each one of them i understand why you would go with the one one for from an operational cost savings point of view um but with that there 's there 's a risk when you leave your eggs in one basket i believe and have my question i guess is has any treatment plant ever failed before and if it did i don 't know you 're going to obviously look at a 50 000 ep one but if it was to fail obviously would have wider implications that yes the the main thing there is these plants have within itself redundancy built each plant if you see north south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have one process string you should always have in every plant two process traits so that a it needs a proactive and appropriate maintenance and operation so that both trend goes healthy alternatively okay and should any once a train can fail the other one can in an emergency can go through the full load which have that much of it shocked up yeah it 's good continuously it is mandatory requirement a node design will be approved if you don 't have two trains thanks water supply and seaweed supply thanks for shook and uh thanks council election peter did you want to i was just going to add a comment too in that these plants typically that 's the fire side these plants tend to just deteriorate over time so as the load goes up they they don 't kind of fall over and that 's why our plants are still running they 're just being put under load and deteriorating it is no different than bridges and others when the bridge conditions uh deteriorates we adjust the load limit its capacity when the sewer statement plant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduce the capacity to stabilize that 's why i 'm saying the gray smear need to be stabilized quickly before anything followed thank you council uh wickerson and councilman this year yeah thanks man threw you to a shook a similar line as councillor latcham are there two trains at the the new yes it will be it will be noon a mandatory requirement okay we cannot approve a design with one trade okay um second question is the new plant will it be will we demolish the old plant and then build a new one on top of it or do we have the space there to build it while we keep the that is what we have to keep the existing one running okay till the new one is fully commissioned and then we in the middle of the night cut over okay and then we can demolish that what we are looking at uh council of wickerson is is we are seeing it how to how to integrate this plant how to maximize use of underground infrastructure from existing to the new one okay how we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ optimize the design on the current site and these are the thing that is going to do appropriate time and appropriate investigation rigor design peer review everything in the next two years or yes and getting to the regulator costing it again and again to see we have got a best solution because it 's not only what we see outside it is how the underground structures are there and how their capacity is but if there are some good elements we retain them for example i gave you people a short term measure of um which is the h2s gas so we have decided that we will consider this construct this new facility as a short term but with a view that this new facility will be part of the new plant okay so these are all the things we are going to have to do continuously to optimize it okay last question on south rockhampton uh are we going to look at some localized flood mitigation for that i know during the last stop we came fairly close to not being able to use it but even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a lot of excitement because planning approval will not be given if we are consults own that if we don 't have those operating as elements of the plant above the maximum flood level which is q100 so all those electrical mechanical component operating have to stay above the 100 flood level just to manage it um that thing in the flooding area the plant remains operational okay just to clarify that the site itself may still flood in and around the time because site will uh always it is a flood plain area but we need to see that in the when the site floods the plant remains operational so that as soon as water goes down it operates it is not broken down yeah i understood i 'd like to jump to the airflow effluent pipeline now um is that costed at some future stage we 're going to pipe uh treated effluent back to this so there is a very there is a three stages of that pipelines will happen between grey smear to south currently the pipeline that is started in 2014-15 which is incomplete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring the 6000 ep load currently from there to a sewage pump station which is at blackwall or on arthur street only and then from arthur street goes to south but when the new plant comes in and the next 30 years the lower that grey smear will increase considerably so as a part of the new south rockhampton stp we will have to construct a pipeline new pipeline from south to grasmere and grasmere pump state uh treatment plant will be converted into pump station so grasmere load comes to grasmere treatment plant but that is not a treatment plant it 's just a pumping station it will pump straight to south and this pipeline temporary which we are using right now okay this pipeline will be converted into bringing effluent from new south plant to grasmere okay okay so there is a a lot of transition has to be done in a plant and that is why okay thank you thank you cancer and cancer kirkland thank you thank you mr may are so many questions i 'll try to uh i 'll try to reduce them a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ med to a shop um first question i have is in regards to the pump arthur street pump station so we 're saying we want to pull i think it was um eight thousand ep or six thousand ep from grace mad the load um to south brockhampton um but obviously we 're talking about 10 million odd dollars to to to upgrade the uh to rebuild the pumps off the street pump station and also complete the um pipeline the pipeline um obviously we 've got to make sure the sewage treatment plant southward campus series treatment plant can handle that extra load before we go and spend that money at what point is that going to happen and you know how certain can we be that that we 're not going to spend the 10 the 10 million dollars and then find out that that 's just going to give us a lot shorter life span on the south side treatment plant so consular there are two aspects two part of your question okay i 'll ask into part a is the the capacity and part b is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number one the capacity wise the the work is happening and it has happened two weeks three weeks back the grace me south rockhamptons structures are in a good health condition what is not good health condition there are the processes and the mechanical equipment okay that is going to fall over so we don 't want to change all the equipments there we only want to maintain those critical element for example in the sewage treatment plant the most critical element is aeration plant so we are going to change the aeration capacity of those reactors okay which period and with that external consultant have assured me designers that that can happen that is so south with those short-term measures will be able to handle this in for short time okay that is one part second part is why are we changing so can i just interrupt you just for two seconds there so the augmentation of their aeration part of the of the um train is that included in the 10 million dollars yes all right sorry so so what is arthur street why we are changing arthur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategy or we don 't stop this strategy arthur street in itself in itself alone is in a very dire condition okay arthur street is an awk health and safety risk arthur street roof of that pump station could collapse any day entire its reinforcement of that roof is gone missing because it has been eaten away by corrosion and all the acidic gases because of lack of maintenance operationally and i 'm not going to go into the details of that okay i 've seen that and that is a very very high risk so we need to in order to stabilize the south rockhampton area because entire south rockhampton sewage from network comes to arthur street and then it gets pumped out there okay and if it collapses we 've got a major problem so we need to do that immediately okay and that is one of the main thing was h2s gas and it came to our light otherwise our net that came to us light when h2s gas was being identified by regulators should be controlled in south so we were there how to control that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we went there to look at arthur state and that is when this problem all came out so arthur street is in a very very dire stage and we need work is already started design is happening because we need to sink that well before next wet season peter did you want to i 'm just going to add something there and that is we are two weeks ago we have we 've had people looking at these plants they 've got all the drawings there they 're behind the scenes doing the concept development to truth this so that will be done um we 're not going to build a pipeline and move 6000 ep to something that can 't take it they 're doing a hydraulic assessment a treatment assessment to make sure that the plant can do this for the next 10 years the age of arthur street consulate just for your information if people may not even imagine that one arthur street pump station was designed in 1937. it was constructed and commissioned in 1940 51 and i got a hold of those old drawings okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintained oh planned yeah yeah councilman thank you thank you very much mr smith yeah and look i appreciate that i understand if the punch station needs to be renewed it does i just want to make sure that we 're going to have some sort of surety that the the southside series treatment is going to better take that capacity and it sounds like you know that we 're looking i can tell you the amount of rigor that necessary okay why we have come back okay that i 'll do my at most to make sure that rigor is there yeah that rigor is there that checking is there okay that a peer review checking is there on the in terms of design complete recurs and that is the those are the international standard that we have to adopt for these major infrastructures just a couple more if that 's all right mr may um so a shook because this is a short term um fix more or less the reducing the load from grace mirror is that going to fix the issues that the constituents have there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing once we do reduce that load yes it will absolutely and why i can say absolutely is the source of odour it is not to fix the dry wet that is on the carpet it is the find the hole and fix in the roof the hole so what we have trying to fix the hole and the hole is that for the last 10 years for last 10 years the biosolids have not been up managed there so we are engaging a quickly a contractor for all treatment plants not only grey smear to clean the sludge lagoons where the treated sludge goes okay and clean them up and then condition those sludge lagoons and then make sure there is a proper operation plant that they are cleaned regularly okay okay and that will address the source also till we decommission gray smear we have a proper odor control system on the intake where the raw sewage comes in so these are the two holes where the order emits so we are going to fix those two holes all right thank you just two more mr mayor if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service treatment plan if if we are to reallocate that 14 million across the north side so that we can do um this may have been i didn 't see it in the report or anything like that but uh what are the costings or projected costings for us for the augmentation of the northside service treatment plant how far is the foreign look towards that the thing is it will go a long way it will not be complete because the complete budget for the north rockhampton part a and part b that means new process train of 25 000 ep plus upgrading the two existing trains of 25 000 ep each is to the order and all other lagoon and every management order is of the order of 75 million okay we have with this budget of and odd million currently with this 14 million it will come out to us about 62 million okay and we will still be short but we can carry on for two years it is the last year we will require more money okay but if we don 't abort the contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the price contractors of tenders which we have negotiated they won 't be hold holding it and look i i shook i totally understand that and it 's something that we need to do my my concerns are you yourself said that you know because we 're doing um uh we 're only refurbing you know we 're building one new train and then we 're refurbing the other two trains yourself said we don 't know what the refurb costs are going to be until we get in there pull the thing apart and see so those figures we 're talking could blow out exponentially that is that is why i am reasonably confident with my experience that what i have seen it the level of contingency that we have provided in this 75 million okay is on the borderline if we have to replace one of them okay so there is a sufficient provision for the treating the worst case so the confidence of this budget of 75 million is 90 or 95 percent okay there is a highly unlikely that i will come back to you standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen no no i appreciate that i 'll remember those words i do quite appreciate your concern okay and that is a valid concern okay but where i stand i think the level of rigor has been put in as significant yep and how many serious treatment plans have you constructed to shook in your time oh i lost the count of that i am currently involved in six the most critical um treatment plan that is the third is going on is a batman bay in new south wales okay that is going on on on the surf beach that is a treatment plant is going on and a number of there is no treatment plant from in sydney if you know a consular from waterfall till the border of new south wales eden that has not been upgraded and i 'm not involved as a senior executive of relative consoles whether it 's the show eleven console it 's okay you name it or the urban de la shower console or even in the vulva and ashok i totally understand that i 'm not questioning your abilities or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to cover everything for out for our right players you know you know we know our financial situation at the moment and it is a quite a privilege that we 're able to you know help you people getting it out this one okay it is the question of rigor it is a question of managing it is important control you know yes do you have another question no i think thank you very much um thank you mr mayor uh ashok can i just say firstly um well done in the presentation i i as you all would appreciate as portfolio chair have been in the background having lots of discussions around this and and diving a little deeper asking a lot of serious questions and the shooks presentation this morning is a very well-rounded estimation of where we are at and where we are going i do have a couple of questions around dollars and then a couple more more serious questions so around the dollars of the sludge um management and the correction of that both at uh grace me south rocky north rocky has that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that process been included okay you see there 's there 's a two aspect of that lagoon has two aspects look i 'm just going to say that there 's a whole layer below of costing of all of these projects that we pulled out of a presentation that you 're going to get at the infrastructure committee that talks about the capital costs the operating or maintenance costs for sludge management we 're out to tender on a number of these items as well so there 's another presentation to come which is about the whole asset project stream for sewer and water and that 's where it 's all contained so so there 's more to come much more there 's probably another 20 slides that we we 've blocked here because this is this report 's very specific do you agree and support the strategy that you adopted in 214 do you are you prepared to reconfirm it you 're not locking any dollars in the only dollars you 're doing is moving the 14.5 so that we can get on with north yeah the rest is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent and can i just like just say that i actually think this is the best part and the strategy is a very good strategy and i am having with all the knowledge that i have raw data be it um absolutely in in support of this direction and i i would it leans into some of my additional questions if i may mr may thank you um certainly that the 10 million million estimation for arthur street um i know we 're not going to talk dollars in strategy terms is all we 're talking today is strategy moving forward in principle absolutely agree with all of that is that 10 million of arthur 's street you 've got 14 million 14.5 going from grey smear back to north rocky that 10 is another layer that you 're referring to peter did you want to answer that that 's the piece that i 'm coming back with which is the long-term asset renewal replacement budgets and projects so that 's separate the key thing here is we currently have that budgeted of 47.5 and the 14.5 are in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have the funds to do this all we 're doing is saying moving it we 've got a project that 's ready to move let 's get this one going we will come back and show you a long-term spread of how projects and how we 've smoothed it out with all of these projects some capital some operating but yeah i haven 't got that picture here for you today so really the north side north side being managed and then we 'll move into planning for the south and uh i 'm wanting to bring forward some questions yeah um my and in this forum so to close out with my questions 2014 this strategy was adopted nine years ago and here we are my question is why are we so late in moving forward with this strategy and uh the second question you 've mentioned arthur street sludge management that there was not uh proper management the sludge and then there was not maintenance proper maintenance of history could maintenance and proper management of those facilities have mitigated where we are they 're my questions yep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peter oh look my comments there 's two it 's very easy for a council to adopt a strategy it is hard to implement and i can 't go into the the why but it was deemed that one component was done which was the west and the rest looks like to me was not seen as a priority by um by whoever was in at that point in time yep so it 's it 's difficult for councils to fund this kind of infrastructure this is not unique it 's not sexy infrastructure is it and you can go right up and down the coastline they they struggle yeah evan did you i think if you want to elaborate any further i think you 'd have to go into closed session yeah yeah fair enough i just wanted to uh use this form to ask those questions because i know that the constituents are going to ask those questions of us as well okay thank you council smith thank you oh yeah thanks to me just another couple of things i did talk to peter about the ep as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because we 're going to build south rocky to 50 000 and that 's actually the population of the two areas now so how do we take into account the growth um predictions and and why do we land at 50 000 and not more i will answer a question that one counselor this is a quite a standard system how the population growth in the south rockhampton or rockhampton as a whole and in the catchment area of rockhampton that is served by south rockhampton sewage treatment plant those all projections were calculated what population was in 2014 and what will be in 2042. now again we have calculated what population is now and what it will be in 2050 so that is south similarly thing has been done for grasmere okay and those populations are then converted into ep and those are added they are all in the detailed report okay so south populations is going to plateau okay south populations are going to plateau and they will be are currently 23 000 and they will plateau at twenty nine thousand okay whereas gray smear population is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 000 and it is going to go to 23 000. nearly 13 000 at the moment 11 000. well the last figure also was 12 000. okay and then so those are the predictions data come back from the forecast from the different sources and the console adopts it and those sources have been validated and then they are converted into eps and are added so in the load for new treatment plant there will be 29 000 ep will come from south and 23 000 ep will come from christmas and and that is the load the plant need to be designed okay thank you any further questions yeah no just a comment none of that was in the report not the ep yes yes those details are this is as peter says it is only for the strategy and those can become in a detail i 'm quite happy to you know discuss and show the full report there is there is no problem on that that is why i am satisfied that appropriate rigor has gone in yes okay and that is there and those assumptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um robust and they have been validated they have met right now up to 2020. we got the strategy review we didn 't actually get the pro the whole strategy did we that wasn 't for that wasn 't given to us the whole strategy the whole strategy the whole the whole document we just got a review yeah yes we haven 't got the whole strategy no no no no just they 're the quite thick report and quality numbers and graphs and all those things and that is that is i 'm quite happy to talk one thing that did occur from 2014 to now is the population growth predicted back then was quite high and it hadn 't occurred so that 's bought time as well yeah i don 't i don 't actually remember it coming to council 2014 but then we were so into the amalgamation that year really hard to remember and then what else we uh they change the budget process around that as well cancel out yeah cool mr mayor if you could see if i could um councillor smith if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of west rockhampton series treatment plan that was a part of that whole strategy um taking that offline council maters thanks mr mayor just two questions this time if that 's all right um three you two are shook so uh a shook look um as far as those the different options that we 've got option four does make to me you know a lot better business sense have we got any idea what the cost savings would be in regards to operational costs because you know operating one plant versus two plants yes yes you see main thing what has happened it is it is it always have the maintenance of the resources okay whether we have any breakdown or not there is a routine maintenance that needs to be done inspection and checking if you have a two plant then you have to physically go there to two things okay and if you 've got a larger one it doesn 't mean that you need to have double the or triple that inspection because your plant is bigger okay so that 's a direct saving of resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so there are a quite an accepted practice that if you consolidate and you got economy of scale bigger then you will have significant saving because main savings are your two okay and that is a power chemical in terms of your cost and then the third one is the labor okay so once you are running the smaller plant it doesn 't mean that it should be reduced but it stops at certain level and then it goes and then it becomes uneconomical so that is why any plant which is less than 20 000 ep are uneconomical to operate and maintain and that is why this particular to keep the grey smear running and also have a south which is less than 30 000 epr is was very very operationally inefficient quantification exactly has not been done qualitatively yes okay and why because the data currently which is their actual data is not correct and complete so we have to have a current data to make sure those extrapolations are done but the level of current data and the history is not reliable complete and yeah i understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd sort of like to keep in mind is obviously we 're going to have to make sure we have a look at our operational budget because if we 're in this situation because of the ongoing life maintenance of hasn 't been in place it 's going to cost the council more money to operate these plants whether you were old could not agree more with you could not agree more it is very good to buy a ferrari car but you should have a proper garage and a mechanic to maintain it yeah that 's exactly and that is what okay and that is i would say you people are getting very big decisions okay but it 's operation and the cost is to be considered upfront thank you and my last question mr mayor if that 's all right so can we just quickly go to those costings that we had just a minute ago if that 's right and i 'm sorry i 'm just i 'm i 'm going back and harping on about the 75 million full north side treatment plan and i 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at there you know 35 ep to refurb one and the existing train the potential refurb of great smear serious treatment plant now we 're talking about on north side refurbing two trains and building one brand new one for 75 million but yet up there we 've got 414 we 're refurbing two uh and a potential refurb of grace may so that 's three refurbs but not a new build for 114 the one up above it for 110 million is we 're refurbing one sewage treatment plant and the existing uh process train and a potential refurb of great smear series treatment plant for 110 yet we seem to think for 75 mil we can do one new train and refurb two on north is there any reason why where 's the cost saving coming from on north side okay the main thing of cost here if you are asking the cost here why it is a cost is high okay compared to north one is the new technology and the new plants there what we are doing right now is and that is why that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still have got the risk of failure high okay there these risks are out here those risks are out in in south you have got these risks in in in north in north you have got these risks in you cannot outsource this and these costs are the cost of getting those risks eliminated totally and i okay and that is the one thing and this is a purpose design okay right from the green field side so those costs are are normally high but aren 't the same risks relevant to north side as what they are to south side yep but that means they wouldn 't be covered at 75 million if we 've had to cover them at 114 and 110 on south side i 'm just maybe i 'm missing something the main thing which is happening is the way the north is configured and the way the south is configured that plays a significant role in the past okay okay and the way the new no south will have to be configured in that site itself okay lays a cost so there are many factors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two plants yeah okay and the significant ground conditions and other things need to be taken into account all right mr mayor if you don 't mind just so i 'm not holding up no no no i 'm not holding all the jokes process now i think what i might do is i 'll just take this offline and maybe talk to you and one thing i must add this 117 also includes a pipeline to bring the grey smear back in i thought that i thought that continuation the pipeline was covered under the 10 million no no that is a short-term meter yeah ep needs a big pipeline from grey smear directly to south not to arthur street pump station so that 's the second that is that is included in this in this plan okay included in all these costs okay okay in these are less because we are keeping the grey smear so as soon as we cut the grey smear the cost jumped because the pipeline 13 kilometer and a pump station for a capacity of 20 51. not two days okay okay and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you very much council rather um thanks mr mayor and mine it 's probably more of a comment and and i i agree we don 't have much choice here but for the outcome however i 'm a little concerned about the lack of information in the report um and then trying to go back looking for information was very difficult it talks in the report that we work shopped in november 2021 um i tried to find the information and i i couldn 't so even to go looking for stuff to to deal delve into this report was very very difficult now ashok has provided a number of stuff here today which is great but we have asked previously for this sort of information to be in the reports not to be not to be presented at the table and i think this is a fairly important discussion we 're having and i think the the questions actually show that we needed more information than what we were actually given here um you know and i think we we have asked before and i 'd like to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these reports mr ceo we 've got to highlighting that and it keeps coming over again that we 've got to be providing the council with information so they 've got enough to base those decisions on and those questions that are coming up may be answered um if they have the ability to be able to uh read the information in the reports prior to the to the meeting so uh it 's only prudent it 's it 's information the councils are entitled to it 's the information they should have yeah thanks mr it 's also our history you know when years to come when people look back and go where did these decisions how were they made the only thing we have is what 's written you know the presentation is not is not there and i think it 's important and i i struggled to find when that pipeline if there 's a process that was talking about bringing that pipeline from grasmere to rocky and why did it stop and where was the decision around that um i 'm just not sure if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either thanks council rutherford councillor kirkland ah thank you mr mayor well we 've had really awesome discussion this morning and a lot 's been highlighted i 'm happy to move that the strategy be adopted as per the officer 's recommendation there thanks cancer kirkland do i seek a second with regards to that one council of deputy mayor councillor fisher uh i 'll put that those in favor as opposed motions carried unanimously thank you councillors thank you shook uh and we look forward to that at uh the next infrastructure meeting and uh again uh if we can get a lot more more detail and information provided um that would be fantastic councils we have an item to be dealt with in uh closed session that 's item 7.1 the federal government roads and strategic importance initiative councillors could i seek a mover in a second in accordance with section 254

council smith uh i would like to inform the meeting council smith did you want to speak i haven 't got the number sorry i 'm just trying to get item 10.11 is it the 10.11 talking about the mount morgan heritage minerals it doesn 't mention poison creek road where i have a conflict but it does mention burnett highway razorback road gordon lane and poison creek road is actually in the middle of that of that road network so i 'm not sure whether i 've got a conflict of interest or not i 'd just like to take it to the table due to the fact your your brother my brother and um sister and her husband and all the property on the western side of poison creek road so councillor you 're wishing to participate in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got some questions yep okay so from the meeting um council will put that that that councillor smith may participate in the decision including uh by voting on the matter uh so can i seek a mover in a second with regards to that move councillor may the second and council election i 'll put that those in favor emotions carrie thanks councillor so thank you councillor oh we 'll have to name everyone in favor so as councilor williams councillor mathers councillor wickerson councillor kirkland and council election uh 20 dollars into the bin [Laughter] and find that one too the lease is for the 10.8 the freehold lease for the trustee rusty lane renewal parks grace may hack and pony club yeah i think i i um ascertained last time i don 't have a conflict with the painting club but i do have conflict with the other stay in tennis club because my um nephew works for um tennis queensland and there he has a lot of association with the other stay in tennis club so with the uh the freehold lease for the grace me hack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting or would you propose to leave well i 'm going to be leaving anywhere oh okay so with the great with the grace my hair company club it 's another painting club and i 'm in um the boulder can panic club an instructor and um i don 't believe i 've got a conflict with that one so that 's not a paid uh it 's voluntary voluntary yeah so you wish to stay for to participate in the discussions and with the party club but not with the tennis okay well we 'll just get the wording for that and um i 'll seek a move in a second for councillor smith 's wishing to participate in that move councillor kirkland and seconded councillor wickerson i 'll put that to the vote those in favor opposed carried unanimously so we 'll go around with the names councillor mothers council wickerson councillor rutherford councillor kirkland council latcham and myself yeah your third item councillor smith is the ethelstone tennis club yeah that 's the one i just you proposed to stay away from stay away with that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflict there with councillor shane latsum informed the meeting he had the declarable conflict of interest at the freehold east with the athol sustained tennis club uh again and cancelled latin you propose to stay away from the meeting not participate thank you um council rutherford you have a light on do you have a conflict well yes except just through the ceo i thought once we had it voted that it was you don 't have to come back again and do it no no you don 't have to sacrifice right yeah but it 's for us to remember all of those conflicts of interest it 's pretty hard for us to do so council should just remind us that we 've already dealt with it or whatever else so i thought councillor smith had done that last time so that 's helping council we just we need to be reminded of the offices so we can 't remember all your conflicts of interest so you have to go through those ones let me know the night before or let linda so it was a different different matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceo last time with the pony club yeah i didn 't think i had a conflict so i probably didn 't mention it didn 't mention on that now that 's been recorded very last time yeah i need to keep a big folder for my comments so i don 't get confused okay so just to clarify i don 't need to raise mine again yeah does it no if you just wanna okay yeah um so i would have on that lease item as well um i would have um victoria park gymnastics and trampoline club yeah yeah that 's been decided previously by council yes yeah yeah we 'll pick that up and put that in the minutes councillors like linda 's fantastic doing this and she remembers a whole lot but really we need the counselors just well as part of that send me a note at night time to say we 've dealt with council dealt with x previously this was the outcome and then we can just include it here so it 's on the public record it probably wouldn 't hurt yeah if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the file of that as well for all of that yeah okay moving on we 've got quite a large uh agenda this morning council as we move on to item uh six lifting matters uh off the from the table uh 6.1 so this is the one we 've got a uh it 's an administrative one it 's just this is just administrative one you 're not actually done decisions okay i need to move in a second move council wickets and second and councillor mothers we 'll put that those in favor opposed carried unanimously thank you councillors moving on public forums reputations nil presentations and petition stills councillor delegate reports 9.1 council of discretionary fund

association experience and 700 to legacy tree planting uh secret mover in the second with regards to those move councillor smith second and councillor wickerson put that those in favor pose carried unanimously thank you uh 9.2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to friday 10th of september 2001 inclusive uh happy to move seek a second councilor mathers i 'll put that those in favor opposed carrie thank you uh item 10 officers reports of advanced rockhampton 10.1 lockhampton river festival attend a consideration plan 2021 to 2023 it is pretty much um as that report there same for that contender consideration so i 'm happy to move uh seek a second council of kirkland put that those in favor opposed carried unanimously 10.2 rocky nuts tender consideration again planned for 22 23. uh i 'm happy to move seeker seconder councillor wickerson put that those in favor oppose kerry there 's no questions moving on to 10.3 small business friendly council sbfc yes yes 10.3 so counselors any questions or regards to that one small business friendly counselors counselor just are we not presenting reports uh those two would if there 's any questions if you want on those two but if you would you like a report on that one i just thought that pretty self-explanatory those tender considerations unless there was questions cancelled but if you 'd like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a report on 10.3 please this is a different one to the first two councillor i just thought the first two were pretty uh standard reports thanks yes morning mayor and councillors uh if there were any questions on 10.1 or 10.2 annette pierce is on online if required uh in relation to 10.3 the small business friendly council this is something that has been running around for a little while and we 're stitching up the loop that about 15 councils are now signed up to this it 's being run by the queensland department of small business uh and this really has been running by the small business commissioner maria shed so she most most of the major councils are now signed up or considering signing up uh it has a number of benefits one obviously we give the perception that as we are a small business friendly council um we we also then gain access to resources from the small business commissioner 's office uh we also get uh exposure on the sbfc website as well and then as in the report the flip side of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a perception that we are an unfriendly council so we certainly wouldn 't uh we wouldn 't want to give that perception because i i don 't i certainly do not think we are an unfriendly to small business we 're certainly supporters of that so i suppose from from my point of view it is my my recommendation for council to sign up to the sbfc program okay thanks greg councillor kirkland um thank you mr mayor i just wanted to ask greg were there any annual fees or membership fees associated with this no no councillor there 's no annual fees at all it 's it 's really an initiative by the small business commission so no cost to council there will be a small reporting function that will be handled by advanced rockhampton each year but uh i 'm led to believe that 's not an arduous task it 's really reporting on what we may have done during the year with small business and i think that 's something we would report on normally thanks thanks greg uh council rutherford um i think you 've almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i think it 's it 's great so there 's no issue there but often these things the devil is in the detail and i 'm just wondering while i read in the report that a number of things we already do and and we can easily answer is there likely to be something pop up and i know it 's crystal ball stuff but um in the future that sort of commits us to something that um we weren 't prepared for i suppose to answer your question counselor through the chair of course uh i don 't know of anything that may pop up i did represent council at the sbfc conference and it was really an informative type situation there it doesn 't mean that a minister or the small business commissioner can 't come out with something but i think uh they would need to consult member councils uh for the want of a term uh before they made any radical decisions that started to burden councils more so or added cost um because each council would have to consider their position again at that stage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the council if that was that 's the case yep yep thank you uh councillor wickerson uh thanks mr mayor through your degree good there obviously there 's benefits there for council but the benefits to our local small businesses we got a mechanism to promote that to our own people so once what 's in it for them yes council once uh once we sign up to this uh we 'll get access to all those resources from the small business commissioners office and she assures me that assuming they 're not in lockdown again that she will also make a visit and do a session for us and for small business so last year i think it was in my first month here the minister and the small business commissioner came up and did a small business conference that was their gathering information gathering exercise to then launch this program that they assure me that they will be back to sit down with small business talk about what those benefits are and including advanced rockhampton into that exercise to make sure we 're selling and also understanding those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah just uh greg page 17. i just uh i thought it was uh interesting you 've got our local government association has all these registered local businesses and the list of them because we 're all sort of told that retail trade was the biggest employer yet it 's it 's at the bottom of the list and i 'm really tough that agriculture fishing and and forestry is is second on the list 13.7 but i suppose that 's every uh property that 's got this registered as a primary producer that would be their numbers in there i can understand construction being at the top but i was just interested in those figures and um where we should be looking because i keep saying that healthcare and social assistance is the emerging industry and yet it 's it 's only seven percent i just wanted was there any message in those figures at all it 's probably something that will come out in the workshop later in the month councillor smith sorry and through councillors uh you 'll come out the workshop later in the month when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these sort of statistics but those are straight from that uh that profile id uh statistics website so so there are some growth industries in there that we 'll make sure we add into the into the economic development strategy process yeah just through the chair thanks for that information greg that 's a pretty good report okay thanks very much council smith council if there 's no further questions can i seek a mover in a second with regards to the officer 's recommendation move councillor smith second in council election i 'll put that those in favor opposed carried unanimously thank you councillors moving on to communities and heritage item 10.4 the community assistance program round one alicia would you like to present that report councillor wickerson did you want to as a portfolio chair good morning councillors this is round one of the community assistance program so the applications have been received and they 've been evaluated by the panel and then put forward for recommendation largely um there is the theme in terms of the continuing events theme but probably just flagging for anyone who 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community assistance program we met to do that last week in terms of refining some of our criteria so it should be my anticipation is that the next round we will see those new criteria moving forward um councillors i also circulated further information around a couple of events which you had questions for last night but i am happy to take any other questions for you okay thank you alicia council has any questions around any of those ones they 're all answered from yesterday council election thanks mr mayor i guess my only question is the mount morgan promotion development inc the soundscaping the mount morgan railway museum i noticed there was only one quote in there was should there have been two quotes or more so that would have been brought into the criteria in terms of the consideration i guess we um in terms of that criteria ideally it 's two quotes but not you can 't always get that um so that brings into the criteria for the recommendation thank you councillor rutherford happy to move mr happy to move for the secret sector councillor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unanimously thank you councillors moving on to 10.5 the silo rejuvenation project follow-up report uh thanks very much lisa thanks mr mayor so this one councillors we have pulled a report together and we 've also discussed this last week in terms of some of the detail at the workshop i guess from the initial proposal we certainly had concerns over i guess the vesting of those cyclones and whether or not it would become council assets or liabilities as the case may be in working through all the considerations uh it is simply would look like a donation to get a piece of art or promotion onto the silos so there is no sort of asset ownership it would be a straight impact to our financial operating statement in terms of the value over as to how much so the project itself is the hundred thousand dollars or what they 're um i guess seeking um we haven 't made judgment and i guess i 'd defer to greg as to whether or not it 's worth i guess that investment from a tourism perspective or um so happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only piece that i guess we haven 't heard from in terms of our previous workshop i might um talk to annette fnap would you like to speak to that comment from alicia about the tourism value of of the solo project thank you oh sorry annette we can 't hear you it 's um must have your mute on no sorry still not coming through we might have some technical um [Laughter] is that better can you hear me yes yes yes thank you did you hear the question did you hear the question there in it can you hear me yes yes we can she might be able to hear her can you hear me now yes yes doesn 't look like the uh that that one 's going to work um thanks greg love technology um annette and i had a brief conversation about this uh from a tourism value uh we 're certainly not negative on the tourism value we don 't think it offers uh significant value uh it certainly adds to the rockhampton region offering from a tourism perspective um some of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can you hear us i don 't think you can hear us some of it will come down to uh how much of that car park space is actually given over some of it will also come down to access to the site and some of it will also come down to the amount of truck and other traffic around that site making it accessible to uh to the everyday person that wants to go and visit the silos so firstly it will certainly add to the regional offering uh very hard to put a number of potential visitors or an economic impact from a tourism point of view on that at this stage okay thanks can you hear me now yes we can hear you in it okay sorry just adding to that um i think um sorry and i didn 't hear some of what greg said but um it really it does add an attraction to the region i 'm sure that 's probably what greg said and it does add to the trail we would be the most northern um silos in in queensland um so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the art trails and certainly it 's something that explore rockhampton could promote um and would add to our um other initiatives such as drive-in land and the other drive markets uh and obviously could be promoted both over now explore rockhampton and promoted by the visitor information center so it adds value whether it 's a driver to the region um i would think the benefit would be more around that see the silos as part of their their visit and from that we would um target getting them to at least stay the night in rockhampton or or spend some time here and then that does add to our visitor economy okay thanks in it so i guess mr mayor in terms of the recommendation um it was sort of to defer to the next revised budget but in terms of a value we haven 't made any assumptions in terms of whether it be a joint project with other parties or whether it be a whole of council project and i guess that 's for recommendation and discussion to the table okay thank you councillor kirkland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 've expressed previously that i think that this is a fabulous opportunity for us to to brighten up that northern entry into our city and certainly to capture potentially capture some extra tourism as a result of people putting the posts up of their photo outside the silos there 's been a considerable uh con sentiment from the community that they also think this would be a great addition to to our art stream if you like for rockhampton so i am very keen to to put forward just a slight amendment if i could and perhaps stimulate some discussion around price it wouldn 't be an amendment of actually emotional emotion proposed emotion no there 's emotion that 's not that 's the counselor that 's the officer 's recommendation so let 's just propose a motion there that uh council consider funding the sixth solo artwork project at lilly place parkhurst and to talk about the value can we do that now or i 'll just put forward a value of a hundred thousand yes yep to the value of one hundred thousand at the next revised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revised budget any funding would be conditional on council 's approval of final artwork so you 're happy to move do we have a second or with regards to that motion let me seconded councillor wickerson um i 've got a question question councillor smith yeah um in the um a list of you know the expenses where they get this hundred thousand i 'm just wondering where it um states uh the preparation of the surfaces like those old solos have been there for 100 years and i can 't i i think it would cost a lot of money to prepare them for the painting or is that included in the 89 000. yeah that 's included yeah so through the chair um the discussion was that they 're also trying to get sponsorship from say duralux and they 're also facilitating or sorry using some of their own equipment in terms of that preparation which will certainly uh reduce some of the costs involved okay so that was my question as well through through you mr chair um what are the funding it doesn 't say what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we you know we 're up for the hundred thousand but i was hoping that other parties would join in um and fund it as well but we 've got no guarantee of that probably getting to into the debate side of it there we 've got mover and a second are there so question further question uh can i move we suspend standing orders yep happy to do that move suspend standing orders then we don 't need a second hand yep i 'll put that those in favor pose carried thank you uh lights councillor mothers uh thank you very much mr may uh look i i agree that you know this is a you know an interesting um proposition and project uh i 'm just struggling a little bit with the amount of money that you know we 've got to spend i think the money could be spent uh better but that may be you may be getting into debate okay sorry no that 's right so uh the um question yes sorry so the question i do have is obviously with with the artwork uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there but i noticed that there 's mention of um great kepler island and the coast being included so you know i 'm wondering whether it 's just something that we could either look at seeing if there 's other funding available or is this something that we could possibly look at um you know talking to livingstonshire council uh in going shares with you know to portray the entire region and share the cost yeah i 'm not sure you probably need to um put another uh dot point to the the recommendation or an alternative motion if that 's that 's your view on that um because it 's not captured in the in the in the recommendation okay so i 've got a further question sorry just to add uh mr med just to that in terms of the complexities because it is not our project so we would be i guess donating uh drew 's mentioned that we would do um i think a deed of agreement or agreement between us that they deliver and what they deliver so that is how we would control i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my view is that if we were to contribute the whole hundred thousand well that 's the size of the project so we would have complete say if we were to contribute say only twenty thousand or something well then we wouldn 't um essentially because there 'd be other players in that project to also keep happy so depending on where that value rests would be you know what the expectations are in terms of signing off that agreement between us which is why i put the proviso in there that we have if we 're going to do a hundred thousand then it 'll be conditional on our final output council election thanks mr man i guess two things firstly um has it been benchmarked against other solos that have been done is this a reasonable figure it 's probably my first concern the second one is given its location and that there 's a block of land to go in front of it it could be blocked out and i 've got concerns if that is going to be blocked out then the public probably won 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern i 've got over yeah again that 's probably getting close to to um debate councillor wickerson uh thanks mr mayor through you to alicia um the other alternative and it will make it uh much better than what it is but if we don 't do anything on there and assuming no one else picks up the project either it 's an eyesore as it is so i think that 's the negative side of it uh we 're not only making something that 's okay better we 're getting rid of that whole thing is that a question cancer is probably getting into automated sorry i 'll follow up with a question totally different will we be looking in the near future to finalizing our community arts policy our public health policy i think we did look at that at one stage um it certainly i believe is an action that is outstanding it 's probably not at the top of the list at this point in time with everything else going on but it 's certainly been out there in terms of public art if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that and the concept being is that with new projects that come in that then they also keep an allocation for the public art to beautify it at the same time rather than us come along afterwards and try and do something with it similar to landscaping which we 've talked about at length as well so it 's part of that project to make place making i suppose for the projects i just think some of the questions that we brought up about how long it 's going to be there and our tenure over we should be covered off in a policy for future stuff that comes up um i guess it 's a little bit different because it 's not it 's on a private asset this one yeah greg councillors uh through the mayor um just from a costing point of view the only project that i could really find was yelaban down in gunda windy mayor springborg approved through their council it was 195 000 for eight silos done over two stages that 's an extreme probably if i go back to council witness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to tie all of that up not so much through the policies item but through some form of agreement between us and jrt yeah for this particular one now further questions counsellors council smith um i 'll just to alicia what guarantee like um what what is say if this is approved if the motion goes through um it doesn 't the report doesn 't actually say we 're going to we 'll probably have an mou but how tight will our agreement be with jrt for access and for everything else to do with the solos i 'm just a little bit concerned about that the fact that it is privately so yes through the uh chair so it won 't be an mou it will be a deed of agreement um so it is a legal agreement between the two parties um so that next level up but um i believe drew is also online if he wants to add comments there yeah drew did you uh be able to comment on that rather than an mru a deed of agreement could you explain that please yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement so it 's legally binding we could in the agreement in our discussions with brad nevin of jrt was that we would state the square meterage of the car park um we in our discussions of the car park and that would be made available for public access um we did talk about how many parks they would be they then he then responded with well we would look at single we don 't want to say how many parks because they envisaged that it would be single cars um caravan car combos and rvs so they would just look at a you know quite a space there to be able to accommodate the combination of those three things the agreement would include insurance it would include the amount of time that that up would remain and be maintained on the silos um and like i say in the report you know we struck out about 15 years and possibly with that thought that if you know it was worthwhile to cycle back um to refreshing that after that 15-year mark so they the agreement 's going to would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a um a grant from uh from state government or federal government okay thank you drew ceo yeah if i could through the chair i might just throw a couple of things on the table here one is we 'll have to go through the budget have to get through the revised budget that 's probably the biggest hurdle we 've got as the recent weeks have unfolded things aren 't tracking so well at the airport as we 've got so that 's that part on there this next part is is do you wait for the hundred thousand to go through a revised budget then start the agreement over the discussions because there 's two two bits to that this one is setting up the expectation if you start now before you have the money in the revised budget or do you wait to go through revised budget and then start deed of agreement or an agreement there 's a bit of work around that one and that 's probably the what poses and if if you were to start the agreement now you 'd actually include that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement that would deal with the funding of the approval of final artworks the ownership and access and whatever else you just include some words in there and what about matching funding from other if that 's what council you probably do that seek other funding or whether we do the whole lot yeah that 's a that 's the question so what i 'm saying is we 're going to put some we 're going to put some of the cart before the horse or we 're going to wait for the horse to come through the the funding and go with that one yeah that 's a difficult difficult thing okay uh council if there 's no further questions we 'll um resume standing orders i 'm happy to move that and we 're going to debate uh i 'm happy to move uh going to the official debate uh councillor kirkland please speak to the motion uh yes thank you i think that this is a a wonderful incentive and initiative that 's been put forward by um some forward thinking uh business owners and for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this silo artwork is positioned well i think in answer to some comments there about potentially being built in that there is a property to the side which potentially could have some buildings built in but the frontage well it won 't be built in because that 's a natural detention base in there there 's grass and everything there then i would like to suggest that perhaps we add into it can i add into the motion from here or do i need to make another motion depends what it is and um just listening to what ceo said about the budget and certainly about that agreement making putting a point there that we 'd like to make sure that that agreement is in place to accommodate um the final artwork and and that sort of thing partnership and access yeah that 'd have to be an amendment in the second second don 't need to get it seconded for the amendment yeah movement second uh to do it if they break the movement second of that and if the council are happy with that movie that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so so we 'll just need to work so the any funding would be subject to um what would be some words there greg you 've got some words subject to a successful deed sorry alicia youtube yeah drew did you want to add something there you had the words rattled off before no um yeah there 's just a delay with me getting back uh on sorry um look i miss that part of the discussion so if we were to sorry so then if we were to add to the resolution that any funding would be subject to a successful deed of agreement uh with jrt yeah um outlines yeah funding would be uh subject to is it both parties agreeing to the date of agreement we can possibly play with that but um so which outlines the number of car parks or the car parking space available yeah um okay the length of time the artwork should be on display what else drew uh insurance and final artwork also yeah and yeah final i think i did say that in there yeah yeah it does i had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period of art rrc 's creative input greed car park size public liability insurance yeah we might get that sent through to us through to linda if you could so that 's that 's the second last bullet point in the report mr ceo with the question just a question to alicia would say jrt sell the premises we would have that be covered in the date of the agreement which that would be in the agreement perpetuate onto the new owner by mentioning the owner there i just thought we should with with the current uh land on lando not going to sorry councils you 're not going to cover every degree of a date of agreement in the council meeting but the intent just on top of that if it 's if it 's never sold because if we yeah so just through the chair the deal of agreement would be enduring so it would just be novated to the new owner if that lot what will be eventually lot 12 uh was to be sold my understanding is at this stage they have no plans to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this on the fly no no no it worries me because i also um worried a little bit about whether this becomes a competitive project in the revised budget or whether it automatically takes precedence this is what it could do if you yeah it 'll be competitive because you don 't know what other things you 've got sitting out there that 'll come through the revised budget as well no sorry so does this automatically say that this project is funded in the revised budget or because that 's how i read it the council considered funding consider yeah to me so it has to get through a revised budget process first definitely um definitely so if the mover and the second are happy with that and the council vote against vote for america okay councillors are you happy with the that is uh included in the the the motion itself excuse me yeah mr mayor if i can just cut in um i can 't see the resolution but just to make sure that it just says owner it doesn 't actually name so just wrapping up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the after the debate so you speak to the motion to start with and that 's in favor um speaker against the motion councillors i i have concerns and um mainly to do with their financial position i understand the um the recommendation is subject to the to the to the revised budget but just the um financial position we 're in with the covert and the airport revenue just don 't want to paint a picture that this this project 's a given that we do need to make sure that we have all all the information ahead of us and when there 's other projects there that we may need to be finding money for as we go forward with it uh speaker in favor of the motion council rutherford i missed mayor i 'm very torn as well but i think the project is a very good project and when we look at what it costs us to do beautification particularly at the entrances of our our region we know the struggle we 've had with the roundabout at yepen so you know a hundred thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is is probably on on par um so i think it 's it 's good value particularly out there because it 's you know the new works is a concrete jungle um with very little room for soft plantings you know landscaping or anything so i think it would play a very important role um in that entrance the northern entrance uh to the city i am concerned like you about um the cost and where that money will come from in a revised budget so i 'm probably given a little bit of confidence here that if if we carry this through it has to sit um and and be competitive against every project um so it just leaves it it just leaves it on the list and if then we can 't find the money because things are still tight or we know they 're going to be tight but there are other things with a higher priority then it it just leaves it sitting there for us if by chance we can find find the money and that 's probably where i 'm sitting at at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the office to say it goes back to the comment i made then suspended senator standing orders um there is it 's the indeed subject to funding because probably i could read that both ways at the moment i could actually start off and do the deed and you would actually give a false hope to or false expectation to potentially the owner that you go through all this and then the funding will come available in the revised budget or do you put the words in there to say that the d to subject the execution of a deed is subject to um appropriate budget allocation given that the revised budget so that 's what i thought i asked you just before and you said because the word considerably yeah then i 'm sorry then i 've come down and read the second line and it says any funding and that 's what my doubts into just to clarify that around okay sorry about council what do you just put once funding becomes available yeah once funding becomes available wants funding are the movers in the second are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date of agreement should be with the owner yeah again that 's probably coming from council rutherford 's um question there previously linda sorry um can council kirkland has the move are you happy with that change to the wording i think it 's actually by saying once funding becomes available is putting putting it into cement that we 're going to fund it by saying subject subject to funding yep subject to funding okay becoming available the successful data agreement with the owner yeah so and i 'm just being clear i am not moving on the date of agreement or any negotiations until we 've got to the point of revised budget that 's our intention here yes that 's the internet thank you alicia thanks that makes a little bit you 're happy with the the amendment change to that wording everyone 's happy should we have would it would outline like should is is one way or the other but wood is is wealth i think the word the subject at the start counselor should outline it but it doesn 't have to i guess my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us so that 's what we 're aiming for but at the end of the day the agreement between unless they 're deal breakers or each of us all of those can be subject to regular updates when we get to that point anyway that outlines conditions yeah yeah in actual fact the second paragraph is sort of superfluous until you do the first one it is but again it 's probably just given that to the officers yep at least with a second paragraph that does give some intention of counsel that will be considered and these will be the conditions so okay awesome okay uh so we had a speaker against go back to again councilman 's note uh back to the mover to wrap up to wrap it up wow that was interesting so uh yep definitely i think that this is a fabulous project i congratulate jrt on bringing presenting it and turning what is absolutely as council rutherford has said currently and i saw coming into town it is a concrete jungle coming into town at the moment and i think it will be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stop for a second have a look at our heritage village perhaps go across to the shops and who knows stay overnight and so it 'll be promoting our region and i 'm sure it 'll hit the facebook pages and others once it 's done and i look forward to the presentation and the completion of this project let 's hope that we can get it across with our funding and if we can 't then it 'll be there for a future reference so uh thank you very much everybody okay councillors concludes debate i 'll put that those in favor as opposed you want to record no okay thank you thank you councillors we 'll move on to item 10.6 attended a consideration plan for rockhampton museum of art alicia thank you so mr mayor i do have uh damon online for any of the technical questions but essentially this is the way in which we um address purchasing of i guess um art work or things where it 's not um reasonable to get competitive quotes it 's very difficult to evaluate uh because with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit our normal procurement processes so counselors this is a tender consideration plan which outlines both a number of artists as well as educators that would be called upon to provide services to us and each of those services are unique in their own right so this and as we 've discussed at our previous workshops this is where we rely upon the curator to i guess get a product into our future art gallery so that it does appeal to the widest possible audience and then how we judge that is basically on the success or otherwise of that venue happy to take questions or even daemon online also okay um councillor wickerson portfolio spokesperson thank you mr mayor i 'm in support of this happy to move in a moment but just one question is does this cover uh alicia um travelling exhibitions like when we first looked at the the whole gallery project we 're excited about the opportunity to get major exhibitions that we might see going around other places so this seems to cover individual artists but does it go for or there 's an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attract them to the gallery too yeah um so this is for a period of time through the math to counselor this is for a period of time so it basically covers us off for the first part of the opening of the gallery but as you can see because of the the previous resolution there and then time with covert and things have moved on we will continue to update those things at any point in time should new exhibitions become available remembering there 's a long lead time for those things thank you question council maters thanks very much mr smith um through you to just alicia the tender consideration plan alicia that you 're saying that does have a time limit um so is that a 12 month or uh so if this one is for the range of exhibitions from 21 22 and 22 to 23. okay somebody says to yeah 23. all right thank you no further questions move councillor wickerson do we have a secondary council of kirkland put that those in favor opposed carried unanimously thank you councillors moving on to item 10.7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10.7 sorry the resource i 'll [Music] thank you good morning mr mayor and counselors i 'm here to ask for recommendation that council submits an application through the resources community infrastructure fund for the mount morgan swimming pool refurbishment the grant closes later this month on the 27th and um a leadership team has been presented with a number of options that could be put forward for this or has looked at what options are available for funding underneath under this program and has uh decided that the mount morgan pool is the one that fits best the the um i guess the spirit and intent of the grant program um does anybody have any questions questions with questions to that grant application no questions council smith um just in the report it says um it 's open to resources communities so this so we 're saying that does that apply to mount morgan town itself or rockhampton regional council like would they consider mount morgan a resources community yes i actually did seek advice from the grant administrators on this um and it would be applied to rockhampton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we we do definitely qualify while we don 't have any mining per se that 's that 's being conducted in the area a significant proportion of um our workforce and our economic development is related to the mining industry and that is one of the criteria that they look for as well so it 's not just that you have resources uh you know i guess operations in your lga you can also be one that supports that and i think given mount morgan 's history as well um that qualifies mount morgan in particular um to be considered a resources community okay my second question is so are we going for three and a half because i sort of worked out we 've committed 2.5 and then we 've got 500 000 in the budget uh we 're saying forward um forward budget 4.5 we 're just a bit confused about the yeah we 're still on finalizing uh costs but the the estimate at this point is for a project that totals 6.5 million dollars 500 000 of which we are probably spending will be actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have in the budget currently is 2.5 million so 2 million of that will actually go towards the um the project leading to us probably asking for 4.5 million dollars for the project pool port thought okay so um would they give us could they give us just part of that um because if we 're around so if we 're sort of half successful what would happen then uh well i mean that 's it 's like i guess any grant program is kind of like that and that they may decide uh depending on on um i guess the subscription to the to this uh grant program and you know deeming who um needs the reason the funding more it could be that we could receive less than what we 're asking for or you know we could receive everything okay thank you councillor rutherford um and so i was just further to what you you 've just said it says that the fund can cover 100 of the project yes why would we not go for a hundred percent because looking through the guidelines they actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look more favorably on pro projects that do have a contribution to them and because we did have that in our budget contingent on fun uh you know securing funding that that was looked at as we probably looked at be looked at more favorably then do does the project um do we anticipate it to cost more because of the heritage listing and the age of the no um not that i know of i 'd have to defer to um andrew collins or alicia who have i guess a greater understanding of some of that but we did do a tour of the area um our approach is going to be that the the swimming pool it 's in dire need of upgrade there 's no question about that but however the area as a whole needs to be looked at as a you know in that precinct view of things and as a community asset the pool is really kind of the linchpin of that or acquittal critical piece of that community recreation area and we 're kind of putting this forward as this will be helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know a community space i think yeah sorry sorry and councillors just to add to what anne was saying because we did look at the whole site because it you want it to work as the whole site together so the playground 's pretty good but the squash courts that 's sort of right right in the middle of the two is kind of making it um a bit uh it doesn 't work as a whole site together shall we say but the other aspect or the problem is in terms of the grant is because remembering we haven 't done the detailed design so the the cost is largely unknown um at this point in time so we know a circa figure which is what we will use for this grant but until we get to the detailed design and decide what 's in scope and out of scope um it will sort of be largely unknown yeah this grant will cover some um design uh costs as well so the the the the project you know that we 're putting forward does include some design work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what the voice is but i 'm just going to add a couple of comments um we haven 't we 're right we haven 't done the detail design but we haven 't done the concept design so the next step for the council is to come back and workshop what do you think you 're going to get and what do you want up there because we haven 't got escape i 've got a site i know where that is an old pool i 've looked at that but is the pool is there wet clays is there heating is there what is it in this pool because we will dramatically change the cost and we can only do that when we 've done the workshop to to get the key principles of what you we 've made an assumption on no heating a standard kiosk minimal wet play you know it 's a it 's a basement yeah okay thank you and did you want to clear the comments no um just that uh um we 're proceeding with getting information together for the grant application @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just i i think we should certainly put the application in you know i think that 's a no-brainer at all i 'm just wondering whether um if we 've gone for base elements just at a guess i 'm wondering whether we should go for something a little bit more you should have kept the mic there 's two things it 's a small program 50 million dollars total and when i say basic i 'm saying what would be required for a normal community pool so but you know i am conscious that you might go we want this to be the same as south side you know if you do that we 're in trouble okay yeah and i 'm not um saying that for a minute it 's just that we all wait we never seem to have quite enough um quite enough money you know so i just wanted to you know we 're trapped again there 's a grant that 's ideal and we haven 't got a design or a concept needs to be yes we know the pool has to yep yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mayor um i do have a lot of concerns about another gold-plated project that maybe the community doesn 't even want given the the low attendance rates at the mount morgan swimming pool as i understand um probably doesn 't even justify it is it what the community needs if we get it for free yes but then the second part of the equation is what 's the operational cost to keep it going and if it 's not getting used much at the moment previously to have been closed that 's a consideration that has to be a consideration we 've talked about wanting to know what is the cost of running things and that 's a big consideration yes the project sounds great probably a splash park is all i probably need if if that 's what it is but i 'd be pushing more for 100 not any contribution towards it um yes it 'll be great for mount morgan yeah i think they they as mentioned before within that we we stand a better chance of getting some funding if we got uh a contribution towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this one been 110 years and really neglected for a long time so i think as far as that goes and i think there 's other options should this not be successful we need to need to work our way through that but not providing a pool is probably not not one of those options i think we need to to look at what we can go forward for that community as there are schools and other users there and again if something 's old and tired a lot of people won 't use it you put something new in you get a lot more usage out of it so and then the operational costs again would be considered uh part of that as what was previously previously provided in that space so um again yeah i 'd just urge caution on that this grant if we 're successful with it because we 'll give us something there that we can um provide to that community without having to um burden the rest of the ratepayers with that uh further questions just to add to that mr mayor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site itself because of a small computer small community and the low socioeconomics like it does take a lot of uh boxes in terms of the you know being able to have swimming lessons the schools available to it um just in terms of going for that full funding for such a project when we 've already prioritized it in our own budget and said right we will make this money available um to do something with the site i think it would be a bit of a stretch to pull back and say oh no you can fund it all now so this is about resource communities and we 're in a situation where we 're a resource community that doesn 't actually have a mind to put money towards it so the ones out west they 've all got minds that contribute to community projects so this is an actual gold mine that that doesn 't actually exist at this point in time and it 's not actually contribute like other other venues would or other coal mines and stuff would so i guess this one 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aiming for higher towards 100 percent council and as i mentioned just before there 's less chance of getting the grand if we try to go for the hundred bats it 's only a limited pool um pardon the pun but uh what we 're trying to to achieve is getting some great funding towards the project and then again we need to assess that once uh if we 're successful about what the what we can deliver through the uh through the design um can i just add one little thing there um because we don 't have minds in our area we have to make this um application as attractive as possible and the ways to do that are to by making a contribution and also pointing out what it will actually do for the um community of mount morgan and and the uh the grant is very specific about um that the nature of these projects has to benefit um the community and they are very much looking for things that benefit disadvantaged communities as well so that 's why i felt it was a good match @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'll go to councillor mothers thanks very much mr may uh through you to anne um and i 'm not sure hopefully you 'll be able to answer this question i look i agree though you know the pool is in dire need of of um of something you know a repair or rebuild whatever it may be but uh the concern that i have is that if we have two and a half million dollars in the budget for this it 's we 're talking about six and a half million dollars if we put the uh application in for the grant and we are only allocated say a million dollars are we then committed to finding the other three million dollars and going ahead with the with with the project or can that then be put on the back burner do we still still loosely just because they offer you uh um some money doesn 't mean you have to take it so um no you you can decide you 're not committing to anything when you put in an application you 're saying this we 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't offer you that no longer makes the project viable both in our eyes and in their eyes and they don 't want to see that go ahead no okay fair enough thank you council wickerson oh thanks mr mayor along the same lines with my learner colleague um if we the two things if we don 't get the amount of funding that we 're seeking or we get the the designs back and it 's way above that 6.5 million dollars and i 'm very anxious about going in any project where we don 't know what the the concept or the final you know we 've been there before it has never ends terribly well but is the funding is the criteria for the funding that it has to be uh new work i mean we describe it as refurbishment but does it have to be can we go back and everyone loves to have something that 's brand new but can we go back and then say look we might be able to restore what we 've got there with lining the pool and no yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or improvements or they won 't fund any maintenance um there any work actually has to be of a certain kind so they won 't do repairs they won 't do maintenance and things like that it doesn 't have to be brand spanking new which is why an upgrade will work but looking at this project we 've actually decided to change it from being an upgrade to being something else because we 're actually doing much more work here than just purely upgrading something the pool itself is a non-standard size um which means that it 's limited in terms of its ability to to hold swimming carnivals that you know of a competition and not knowing that you 'd have competition but you know it 's not the standard size that you would that most schools would need to have for particular records and things like that so um there is a need to actually put in something there that is is more useful and meaningful there and that 's more than just an upgrade then okay thank you councillor smith yeah thanks mr mayor um peter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at incorporating that into this proposal and the other question is will it will it be heated they have a heated pool there that 's sitting there empty so would it be looking are we looking to hit it as well no all i all i 'm saying is we have we 've prepared an estimate for this submission and we may have to make some assumptions we will come back and talk to you but at the moment it has a kiosk in it it does have a small element of wet play and it is not heated so that 's but it is to standard size it 's a modern pool new filtration systems all those things okay so i just wondered how big is the wet play we 're proposing because that sort of takes money off the actual pool that we have it 's quite a small area off the end running on the existing pump system so it 's not like a an alternate um independent wet plate it 's just putting a little bit there at the edge of the pool again we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what the funding comes back before we can uh yeah no it 's just concerned that 's taking funding of the actual pool which is what we 're trying to make better for the community the pool yeah thank you council ralph um mr mayor i 'm i 'm happy to move um i think we need to we we have committed to doing something here we need to start looking for sources of funding i think this is a wonderful opportunity for us to go to it 's it 's too early to really discuss the project what the project looks like and you know maybe if we get money we can we can cut the project to the cut the cloth to the to the funding maybe you know so i 'm happy to move okay um and second and councilor wickerson i 'll put that those in favor those opposed carried unanimously thank you councillors council just gone quarter past 10 doing a stop for a recess so we 've got a quite a large agenda there so we might take a 10 minute recess and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [Music] [Music] [Music]

the freehold lease and trustee renewals for the parks council rutherford did you want to as a portfolio spokesperson conflict of interest councillor smith and councillor election okay thank you alicia uh thank you mr mayor and i have justin online for any specific questions so councillors um this matter was presented to the last uh council meeting laid on the table and has now been lifted from the table so at our workshop last week we discussed i guess the number of facilities and the leases and the pros and cons in terms of approaches to some of these leases and at the moment the way you see this resolution is um basically the same as what was proposed in the meeting two weeks ago with slight changes to wording in respect to fees and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fees and charges document for council so the other aspect is that the majority of these leases all own their own buildings so i think it was 14 out of the whole so in terms of the condition of the buildings that wasn 't an issue because they rest the ownership rested with the facility themselves councils i am happy to take any questions we discussed quite a lot of detail at our workshop last week um but happy to take any questions thank councillors um questions counsellor rutherford as a portfolio or councillor councillor kirkland um oh thank you mr mayor yes i actually have no issue with the the officer 's recommendation we had a very robust conversation obviously around this in the workshop and and everything with regards to to this recommendation i do have some wording that i 'd like to add into a motion and i 've asked karen i 've got that over there and my reasoning behind this additional wording comes from that workshop where we we found that previously assessing the the leases there were some requirements from the lessees to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their constitution their agm minutes and member numbers and that sort of thing and i think it 's an important thing that we continue to do that and to implement that and make sure that it 's part of of the process so that we can establish each six years when we come out and do the lease renewals the viability and sustainability of of the organizations wanting to lease the reason for that is that we 've got so many um viable organizations so you 're going to speak to the motion or you do we probably need to move in a second if you 're going into speaking to the motion well do you want me to put the motion up then yeah all righty so this is something with the wording around yep so you 'll need a second um for those just let everyone digest it first yep can i just ask a question before i second it because i 'm just not sure clear with 0.4 in what that means um at the what may i answer through that is that right to answer that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be potentially wise for us to have a community leasing policy around what the expectations are so that that 's set in in um not in cement but certainly into the format of a policy to to review in future so that there 's no questions around what our leases are and why we 're what the structure of them is so mr mayor i i just i still not sure because once these leases are signed up they 're signed for six years so i don 't know what a workshop in early 22. um well it wouldn 't refer to this particular one so perhaps that would be a separate motion if you 'd like to put it as a second most separate motion item four no we need a second for this one before we start to sorry it 'll be up to the mover sorry mr may be up for the move if um council kirkland wants to leave four there if council kirkland wants to leave four there so take a note from that yeah so why don 't i i 'll remove four and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll make that a separate motion karen and i 'll just foreshadow that linda thank you so we 've got to move and have a second yes i 'll second your second second against the rutherford yep cancel the capital and speak to for the motion i guess i think i 've probably already spoken to a little bit thank you mr mayor right i 'll speak against uh again we 're going back to putting more red tape on onto our sporting organizations that are run by volunteers we had this in as part of canceled previously a requirement and it was voted on to remove it because it put more pressure on to the council to those sporting organizations that struggle um doing that to and the real advantage of that information being provided to council who 's going to look at it is the other question to to make those assessments and then would they put a recommendation to knockout to not support a club with their lease so they 're my reasons for not supporting that recommendation uh speaker for the recommendation councillor wickerson oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um those things that we 're asking of those clubs are documents that they should already have if they 're a constituted club or any bonafide club it shouldn 't be a huge i understand what you 're saying absolutely but i think it should be a huge impulse on each club to provide that to us you know every club should have a financial statement every year and a constitution minutes from their agm if they have one i 've just had some experiences in the past with clubs that um just as a general member uh that a bit shoddy with how they run their their meetings i think that 's not very healthy so i think this would be one way of motivating clubs to to to run their clubs viably and properly and if they don 't well there 's other clubs that are doing the right thing that we could probably make facilities available for so thank you another speaker against are there no more speakers against i 'll go back to the mover to wrap up the debate uh yes thank you and echoing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establish with us those those organizations and in themselves to actually be of a standard that represents the institution that they are um that that we would also have a viable reference or a credible reference when we 're deciding which organizations are sitting in the wings might be quite quite viable and can 't get a facility and we 've got someone sitting on a facility dormant because they we and we don 't know what they 're doing or what they 're not doing so i think this would be great information for us to have every six years to refer to and uh i 'd like to move the motion do anything to read the motion out no that 's fine it 's um part of that am i able to ask a question questions yeah questions yeah is that okay yeah thanks very much mr mayor um through youtube alicia just on page 74 uh alicia you just said um just says note that the nature of these renewals did not facilitate multi-use or other sport of other sporting clubs which would be beneficial uh when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't understand why that would be beneficial so through you uh through the chair sorry uh so back to that remember these leases are exclusive leases so um we talked last week about us playing a matchmaking type service in terms of if one club hasn 't got utilization we can sort of point them into the direction of that club but we can 't force that issue so that 's the reason for that comment okay and i totally understand um i understand that we can 't force that but i 'm just wondering whether we should make it so you know if we could make it so if the clubs were we 're interested or happy enough to do it you know there should be no reason why why that we couldn 't facilitate multi-use in some venues if some of the boarding clubs were interested or in financial hardship well i so from that perspective they 've got a lease document that gives them the entire rights to that facility through the six-year period it would take that organization wanting to relinquish that for us then to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we just yeah if there was a situation would relinquish that lease and then do a multi-use lease on the same premises okay fine thank you cancer rather than question um yeah and it 's probably just about a clause in the lease and where we stand around the use it or lose it type arrangement so someone holds a lease but is not not using the facility so in terms of the playing fields and the license you will recall that we 've got that no play type policy which then triggers um if that is triggered on the license on a field and then that would then trigger the lease of the building having said that there is no functionality um sorry no mechanism if you like um to trigger the no use rule in a building because they have quite enjoyment of the building um for that six year period yeah so it 's okay if it 's adjoined to a field where there 's a license that can be triggered then but it 's a standalone building so that triggers the building the lease over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a little weakness there but um yeah it 's not when we 're going to fix here and and now anyway so yeah okay councillors the debates uh concluded i 'll put that those in favor as opposed can i record my vote against that one please wickerson councillor rutherford and councillor kirkland voted for and i voted in opposition yep thank you and we 've got the other councils back in because the two council had declared a conflict with their conflicts and uh council yeah did you further foreshadow the merchant near councillor kirkland oh are these ones that was missed that was that dealt with this is a different this is separately overall it 's not talking about individual leases okay council of kirkland thank you miss smith so i 'd like to propose that uh put a motion forward to have a draft community leasing policy presented to council for a workshop in early 2022. you have a secondar cancer rutherford i 'll put that do you want to speak to it uh yeah thank you mr mayor i think that this is another part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure that we 're dotting our eyes and crossing our tees and to have a community leasing policy would definitely do that we 've already had complications um in the past with with leasing of of uh facilities sporting facilities whether they 're and as councillor rutherford has said there 's some weaknesses in that so i think that this should shore up any of those weaknesses and secure a really good policy moving forward for our community that they 've got security and so too do we thanks council kirkland speakers against i 'll put that those in favour those opposed motions carried thank you okay thanks very much alicia moving on to planning and regulations uh item 10.9 proposed animal inspection program i 'll hand over you doug to uh report thank you good morning good morning uh mayor and councillors the uh report this morning for the selective inspection program is uh seeking approval for our local laws officers to visit the properties of dogs that haven 't been re-registered for the 21-22 year this is a standard thing that we do every year and has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has any comments no i 'm not good thank you i 'm happy to meet that happy to move seek a second uh second counselor smith i 'll put thanks linda uh i 'll put that those in favor opposed carrie thank you uh moving on to the item 10.10 the development application for real material change of use for a residential care facility amanda thank you okay good morning mr mayor and councillors um this application is for um a proposal for a material change of use for a residential care facility at for 12 palliative care beds at the um for to provide end-of-life care at 38 agnes street just um as you can see that 's where it 's located there the subject the subject side is located in the low density residential zone and was previously a convent the proposed development will see the existing facilities on site upgraded and delivered over two stages one a stage one will involve the um they 'll demolish the left home like in the red they 're the rear of the site um they will also relocate their car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rear of the site upgrade the existing facilities as i said and then construct the 12 individual accommodation units ancillary rooms to service the development stage two will involve the construction of the lower ground level accommodation unit which will be at the rear which will enable families to stay on site while their loved ones are receiving care we had it went under public notification for 15 business days and we received four probably made submissions um in the yellow dots that 's where um where the submitters were were located the um concerns raised were regarding the consistency with the zone traffic parking and the bulk and scale of the development the proposal is consistent with the zone is unlikely to cause any additional amenity impacts sufficient car parking has pre provided on site there 'll be 27 car parks in addition the current car parking is being removed as i said from the front of the building to the rear which will improve the streetscape and the frontage of the site regarding traffic agnes street has capacity to accommodate the development in addition the traffic volumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current traffic experience on agnes street in a in addition the staff um shift changes will not be within peak traffic times so for when for example with the school their shift changes will be after hours or quite early in the morning therefore the proposed development is recommended for approval subject to the conditions outlined in the in the report okay thank you thanks amanda questions councillor wickerson um thank you mr chair through you um on the i think it 's page 121 we 're talking about car parking it says there 's 27 car parks i couldn 't see that on the site plan am i miss counting yeah i think there 's some under the back of the building as well yeah so yeah yeah okay yeah it 's a bit hard to tell by those photos because they 're depending on what angle because the the site falls away and then um so how the building is constructed um yeah somewhere in behind but there are yeah there are 27 car parks and that should be more than sufficient um for the site particularly that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously the care that 's being received there um yeah we believe that 's sufficient okay thank you okay thanks further questions yeah move councillor rutherford do i think a second councillor wickerson did you cancel my others uh put that days in favor those opposed carried unanimously thanks councillors uh moving on to item 10.11. the amendment application under the regional planning interest act for mount morgan mine project thank you tanya you 're right yeah you ought to stay in them this one carbine resources had the uh had the initial proposal and it was for over a million tonnes of pyrite gold and copper to be processed at the site that 's now changed another company heritage minerals has brought the lease out and they 're going to do an amendment to our assessing agency response effectively the big changes are no longer mining pyrite they 're only going to do gold and copper so it 's gone from 1 million tonnes per annum down to four thousand tons per annum that being a significant drop we 've changed our conditions um we 're only allowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's set out in the central queensland regional plan there 's a road maintenance levy of approximately 2 400 per annum that they have to pay there 's only three truck movements per week and the reason why it 's coming to council is because i don 't have delegations to decide on the regional planning interest act um the state 's the entity that actually provides the approval we just give conditions as an assessing agency so the conditions are recommended as in your report thanks very much tanya councillor smith question yeah thanks um mr may um tanya says on page 118 that the world heritage minerals will require a hundred tonne of quick lime per day that 's five truckloads so that 's ten truck movements a day as well so i 'm just wondering um where does that where is that factored into their contribution because that 2 800 what whatever it is for the year that sounds pretty cheap uh it is through the chair we had to do the applicant had to do a traffic impact assessment and we can only base our road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the traffic assessment report and that 's the figure that they come up to with um the truck movements per day through the chair but but can 't that be queried when when they 're saying on here that that there will be 10 truck movements a day taking this quick line uh up to the site uh dnr and m they use one truckload a day but heritage minerals will will require five truckloads a day and i wondered why wouldn 't that be in their traffic report i threw the chair i think it was previously there was 36 truck movements per day so they 've significantly reduced that down with the lime delivery per day and the three truck movements per week okay just another question through the chair uh is there a requirement that that load is covered as well because people were a little bit nervous about the pyrite being travelled through barrie now lime would escape a lot quicker than the pyrite and i just wondered for the sake of um people being nervous about it um other loads covered but the the empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing that we talked about with the priorities it wasn 't the actual yeah this is not polaroid it 's only the lime yeah but we 're just comparing it to what was going to happen before i just want to know are the loads going to be covered loaded and unloaded with the line through the chair i understand that the lime loads will be covered i 'm not sure about the trucks exiting the site empty because um through the chair when carbon resources were cutting gutter cut the polaroid um it was the conclusion that more can escape an empty truck that the you know the what 's the residue in the truck is worse than the full load if you google it it 's interesting reading through the chair we could possibly put a condition in the assessing agency 's response that all loads are to be covered regardless of whether they 're full or empty thinking of the people along bowery that that were um and up razorback road that were anxious before cancellers any other questions counselor rutherford um i i think this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there but i just when i was going through the um report it seems a little outdated now i i guess it 's because they 're putting an amendment to something that 's already exists does it matter that it 's outdated through the chair not doesn 't that information still relevant to our assessment so it 's just the changes that we look at through the amendment application okay sorry through the chair again it was a traffic impact assessment report that was the one that needed to be updated and amended and it has been all right thank you okay thank you uh if there 's no further questions can i seek a move here in a second with regards to move council rutherford have a second accounts the mothers uh put that those in favor those opposed motion carried things counsellors moving on to item unanimous yep uh 10.12 other changes to a development permit for a material change of use for hotel extensions good morning mr mayan councillors presentation yep thank you so subject application is another change to development permit d125 2017 for a material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 138 and 142 denham street ellenstown with the proposed development to be undertaken over three stages this is related to the red line hotel so the original application d125 2017 was approved in february 2018 for extensions to the hotel in an ancillary car park so those works have uh been completed and that represents stage one of this approved uh this proposal so stage two of the subject application will repurpose the existing car park to become an alfresco area which will be 180 square meters in size and a new car park is proposed on the adjacent lot which is a 142 denim street stage 3 purely only looks at actually enclosing that alfresco area in the future so this plan shows the extent of the proposed alfresco and proposed car park the car park provides 20 parking spaces and an insularly outdoor storage area as well the applicant provided council with a noise impact assessment for the alfresco aerial it will require the existing roof in this area to be treated with acoustic absorption materials furthermore other physical noise mitigation measures include a existing concrete fence so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park there 's an existing concrete fence there and boundary fencing adjacent to the car park and adjoining residential properties will be 1.8 meters high screened and double lapped so this designs anticipated reduced noise generated from those areas as well so the developments expected provide additional employment opportunities while enhancing the services offered to hotel patrons the development 's design and construction features in conjunction with administrative controls are anticipated to mitigate potential adverse amenity impacts generally generated by the development the proposed development will not compromise the strategic framework of the rockhampton regional planning scheme and no public submissions were received against this application the efforts are recommended for approval subject to the conditions outline the report thanks very much bevan councillors questions councillor rutherford or councillor wickerson um so it 's just a little the laneway does that mean that the traffic is going to come and go through that laneway no i didn 't mention that but that 's purely going to be for um service and delivery vehicles during daytime years so they 're going to be able to use that access to come in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's purely only going to be for service and delivery vehicles during daytime meals do we know how often that would be at all we 've got an indication to be like two or three something of that nature a day so we don 't anticipate to be extreme and they 're not heavy vehicles either so we didn 't see that to be necessarily an issue and there 'll be there 's a gate there as well actually where the um where the narrow meets the meets the back there yeah there 's actually a gate there as well so they should be able to close that as well okay thank you councillor kirkland do you wanna you 're right council kirkland oh thank you mr mayor um that was my question as well but also um i just wanted to make a comment really to see that it 's it 's good that putting in place extra parking when you 're going to be extending your facility is a really good thing to see thank you councillor wickerson um thanks mr chairman following up from my council brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opportunity to have a look at that yesterday yeah there is a fence on the what would be the western side of that service lane but there 's nothing on the other side it 's open to that property i think they 're actually using that lane to informally access their backyard too but i 'm just wondering as part of this application could that be a requirement to fence that as well um i know that there was no objections received from that property but maybe once uh delivery trucks are coming even if it 's only three times a day um oh it was something we considered it was just purely based on the amount of traffic we didn 't necessarily think that was going to be an issue um noting the neighbor is informally using that access as well but they don 't really have a legal right to do so so i did consider that but because of the level of traffic i didn 't think that was necessarily needed it 's only for daytime hours as well can that be a later consideration if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in if if a problem comes up i know we 've had other applications previously from from this applicant and they 've been very accommodating i think it was a property 148 had some issues with that last development we put through application we 've put through with some noise and they 're very accommodating to to make amendments to uh to ease that impact on the neighbor so just wanting is there a way we can write that if might just get the microphone if you could please sorry oh we actually have a condition in the approval that if there is a noise issue um a complaint about it then they have to do a report about that noise and whatever recommendations get made in that report have to be administered by council so if there is noise we can say right we need to put a fence up okay that covers that off thank you uh councillor mothers thanks mr mayor through you just too bevan just um quickly how many extra car parks do what are we actually getting with this because i i 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is uh replacing some car parks yeah so the existing car parks is i believe it 's 12 might be 11. i 'll have to double check so i believe it 's 11 but they 're going to 20. so i think that 's above and beyond what they 're actually required to do so when they increase the glow score there 's numbers associated i think that 's above and beyond that so there 'll be about nine extra yeah from what they 've got now okay thank you okay thank you council rutherford sorry we 're just um so who owns the access lane it 's property 142. it 's it 's like uh it 's private it 's a private access yes okay all right okay then council for no further questions mover and a second up move councillor wickerson second and chancellor mathers i 'll put that those in favor opposed carried unanimously thank you councillors moving on to item 10.3 budget governance and other matters uh mission to presented to the 2021 lgaq annual conference sure ross would sorry russ yeah thanks mr mayor between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information is is that is there what we 're trying what um michael is recommending is to bring that funding back into the into the fore uh we haven 't actually included anything we 're not this year 's budget is not relying on it but it 's still something that a long-term impact that and there 's correspondence there that that um between yourself mr mayor and the minister that um so that 's what their recommendation is just to put it through that process yes again the uh the tyrannies of distance in regional queensland is a big impact and the cost to recycle uh not reflective in in um in that and that 's previously why that grant 's been available all that funding has been available where the southeast corner is you know they 're close to the markets and the access to those facilities so um we do our very best in recycling and promoting recycling and you know to make that even more of an imposter to people living in regional areas uh is something there that needs to be considered and i think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without any real explanation is uh is a real concern and uh impact to the ratepayers of the region uh councillor smith question yes uh sorry mister i think that 's great yeah what we 're um doing there i 've just got another i 've had a thought about another motion but i haven 't put it in an email which i 've probably just forgot about can i mention that now or um no i think this one 's wrong yeah uh councillor latin would you like to move as recommended as a portfolio black person and second and councillor mathers i 'll put that those in favor opposed carried unanimously thank you councillors uh 10.14 letter of support uh request from drumble enterprises tamra application this is a respect a retrospective report uh again thank you councillors for your comments during that uh that email at the center in i 'll hand over to matt to uh to report on that thanks man uh thanks may good morning councillors uh as the mayor just mentioned this report is just seeking the retrospective approval uh for the letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ request last month in their application for a traditional use marine resource area to the great barrier reef marine park authority which would be a lot easier to say they 're applying for a tamra to grumpa we have now provided that letter of support which was circulated to councillors while it does sit outside our local government area supporting the rumble enterprises application is consistent with the outcomes we 've agreed to under our illua and the council table has also made a number of decisions around funding for boat ramps and supporting the indigenous sea ranger program which will all contribute to this so happy to take any questions if there are any okay thanks matt questions council um what does it actually mean and and i get that it 's retrospective so i i don 't even know whether it 's worth the discussion but what does this actually mean in practice so probably the biggest takeaway for them is that gives them agreed hunting take numbers for species on the reef green sea turtles is one that 's specifically mentioned in there there 's also some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar to how when stakeholders come onto rumble country we set a fairly high benchmark for them to consult with the traditional owners uh the great barrier reef marine park authority has that similar kind of sway now they can go to researchers and tourism operators and say have you also consulted with the traditional owners although they use the words traditional custodians to describe their say country so um can hunting take place in green zones i 'd have to come back and check that for you counsellor yeah so i 'd be keen to understand you know whether green zones are still protected whether endangered species are still um protected and who pleases um who pleases it yep yeah so i i just be keen to understand those things yeah absolutely i 'll come back to you on those ones thank you councillor wickerson uh thanks miss mike probably just a little bit my limited understanding that the the type numbers for traditional hunting are very very low we 're talking about you know one or two i think with uh dugong it might be and i think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hunting per se it 's about the the traditional connection to hunting rights and things so it 's more of a a cultural connection than you know hunting for hunting sake i think it 's not like well we might consider hunting so i think the impacts are very well managed and also very low but yeah happy to hear some more information yeah and i think this is the 11th if it 's successful it 'll be the 11th tamra agreement that grumpa have negotiated now and they 're also a 10-year agreement so they take that time to review things to make sure that everything 's working along the way so we actually um the drumble enterprise board are meeting this week um and i 'll touch base with them after that and get a bit of an update so i can also flag those questions with them then and get a bit of advice for your counsellor mr mayor if i can just um add information and understanding is a big is a big thing and as i read this it it really doesn 't tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand you know the bits of information council wickerson 's just shared and um and the rest of it you know yeah and again council i apologize uh just the the lateness in having this uh signed off to meet the timelines and uh reason for that emailing otherwise a formal report would have been there this is more just the tidying up of that uh that uh letter and uh bringing that to the tape and those questions are quite legitimate and uh we 'll follow up on those from the council that 's um that 's all part of being a counselor is asking those questions and seeking that information thank you uh so i 'm happy to move uh seeker seconder second councillor wickerson i 'll put that those in favor propose carrie thank you moving on to 10.15 fees and charges 20 20 21 22 amendments uh thanks very much marny so thank you mr mayor and good morning councillors um so today we 're just presenting an amendment to the fees and charges for 2122 since we adopted the fees and charges on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ june the local laws team building plumbing compliance customer service and frw have identified some issues which require amendment for consistencies as per the attached summary that was provided as part of the report to change those fees and charges were 21 22. so i i won 't go through each of them but they 're presented in the report as well as um in the attachment also okay cancers questions to the fusion charges and again these vision charges can be reviewed and changed throughout the year not linked to the budget proper if there 's no questions i 'm happy to move as per the officer 's recommendation seek a seconder second and council rutherford i 'll put that those in favor opposed carried thanks very much manny uh moving on to item 11 notice of the motion uh 11.1 councillor smith you mentioned you may i think there was a report associated with this one that was removed wait till that report 's presented to council so would you like to move that the madelaine on the table subject to that report i 'll second that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's coming um about the show show in the general we can put that into the words as we go further on counsellors no questions i 'll uh i 'll put that those in favor opposed thank you uh 11.2 notification councillor shane lakshman with the proposed travel um council election thanks mr mayor this is something that uh the council table approved several months ago oh hang on we 'll get a second uh checking over with that one second and councillor and uh councillor wickerson thanks mr mayor and uh obviously due to the lockdown in sydney i was unable to attend or we 'll be unable to attend it so just getting in early for next year for the approvals so obviously if it is approved it allows a bit more scope to get uh travel uh it is uh easier to book and cheaper normally when you do it further out than than at the last moment okay thank you counsellor speak against a motion questions question please yet because i i guess does that mean it 's coming out of this year 's budget or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tickets and stuff in this financial year it 'll come out of this year 's one is that okay yep okay yeah no worries right here thank you no further questions i 'll put that those in favor as opposed motions carried thanks counsellors uh questions on notice or created in business councillor smith you had a matter there with the notification for the lgaq annual conference i do apologize i wanted to send this around to see what people thought and it relates to um a counsellor who is acting me in the acting mayor 's role for more than a month i think they should be paid as a mayor and this probably came about and and i will just say at the start i have not discussed this with council of fisher but he was in the role for three months and i just think uh if either an acting mayor or another councillor is in that situation where they are step up into acting mayor like as well as a divisional counsellor he was also looking after his portfolio which was three and one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pay him more i 'm saying in the future i think if a person is in an acting mayor role for more than a month they should be paid as a man and i thought that would have been a good one to take to the conference do you want to see that across the state if that 's the case again the deputy mayor has paid an uh a higher yes right certainly not as high as a man i think that 's considered yeah yeah i just thought you know a month fair enough but anything more than a month i just think it 's a little bit unfair on either a deputy mayor or another councillor that 's in that role ross through the chair yeah that 's okay mr council decide that also to consider is that you do can make an annual submission to the um annual review through the remuneration tribunal and that may be yeah and that you can make those submissions and council can do that as well or or choose that way or both whatever but just that avenue as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than trying to to get automation across the floor at the conference without the full support if it fails it 's a if you wanted to go that way or you 're still keen to go i 'm not sure if um you know it 's unique to us what happened but uh it probably does happen in other councils and i just think it 's in other councils throughout queensland i just think it 's a little bit unfair on that person probably missing there for good through through this it probably is maybe worthwhile actually going through the ammunition tribunal first because they 'll provide the reasons why the deputy mayor gets x amount above the other councillors and that will then probably come back and inform some discussions around a potential motion to change the act and that wouldn 't be done this particular conference will be done at the next depending on what their response is from their remuneration tribunal that may be better to give you a bit more time to stretch out what you 're trying to achieve that better avenue rather than taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know the conferences it 's difficult with that yeah and uh that we can follow that through yeah question councilman thanks very much mr may yeah look i just once again being new but i would have thought that that 's automatically the position of a deputy mayor um you know that it 's their job to step into the role um if the if the mayor is not available it 's just what i would have thought yeah i think what council smith 's talking about is the unique circumstances where there wasn 't a man the mayor had resigned and they 'd gone up into that role so it 's maybe it may be different than just the uh whether it 's annual leave or due to illness or something like that yeah uh it 's a unique situation though yeah i understand that but it would be a very rare indication that 's right can i just respond they changed the legislation too so mr mayor it says that amir doesn 't have a division to look after and they don 't have a portfolio which happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little bit unfair i think for a month and that 's four long weeks and um cancer i think we 've got the intent of that there but we might just work on some more wording before we we 'd send that off to the um to the uh tribunal for for discussion council election thanks mr mayor and i guess that comes into as i understand it in the last six months prior to a new election the the council table has an option not to uh elect a person in that position not for me no maybe [Laughter] okay so yes chancellor wickerson sorry listen i think the wording of that first that paragraph is probably not quite correct isn 't it for longer than a period of one month did we do it yeah yeah can i just amend it say that that the deputy mayor or another councillor so it might not be the deputy mayor that might be away your acting mayor acting there you 'd have to have an acting year if it was a council table would have to um nominate that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wedding that we 're required to do before we send it down there um i 'll send that off sorry yeah i think the intent is understood and we 'll develop further around that and send that off to all councils before we do send it off you move councillor smith do we have a second second in council election speakers for the motion you probably did you 've had enough speakers against no speakers against speakers against councillor rutherford oh mr mayor i think i think it 's covered the deputy mayor um gets awarded regeneration remuneration um higher i think that 's taken into account i believe um all councillors step up when when need be i just think this is going down a track that we don 't necessarily um need to go down and and honestly i saw it as an honor to um have the opportunity to to step up so yeah i just i just don 't see it as a necessary thing with everything that we 're dealing with i don 't see this as as necessary okay another speaker for uh cancel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupations when you do higher order higher order jobs you normally get paid accordingly so in this case uh i think it 's it 's appropriate that they 're doing working at a higher order and as such should be paid accordingly okay speaker against uh i need to back over to the mover to wrap up oh yeah um thanks mr me i think it definitely is an honour to be able to step up into that role but i think um for three you know after a month um like people have their own private lives and maybe businesses to run as well like we all have another life and i think those people spend a lot of time in that role especially if they 're also looking after a division and a portfolio but that might be different with a lot of other councils but i just think people need to be re-enumerated for that for that extra work okay thanks councillor smith i 'll put the motion those in favor as opposed do you wish to record we 'll record the mavers and cancer rutherford record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to closed session items item 15.1 uh has been removed from the agenda due to needing further information provided in that report not uh it 's just come to light so that one will be removed so there 's two items there that and and also mr master 15.3 right here as well it 's only one item there 15.2 counters which is the tmr early acquisition of council land could i seek a mover and the second of that we move into closed session move councillor wickerson yep didn 't they move into close sets and we moved that uh to take that in that item into closed session pursuant of 254 3eg of local government regulations 2012. council rutherford question can i ask why this one goes into closed session yes why we 're not why boys moved into closed sessions yep um the first one the airport community probably just 15.2 go into closed session kelly kelly are you able to answer that one uh yes um the um report actually details about contract negotiation okay so that 's a reason why is it uh in accordance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one 's going in uh seek a move in a second with regards to that and happy to move to council wickerson we see over the secondary council of kirkland i 'll put that those in favor oppose motions carried

remover in a second with regards to the accuracy of those minutes move cancer smith second in councillor kirkland i 'll put that those in favor carry cancer something um when you go when you suspend standing orders and then come out of that suspension you only have a mover you don 't have a seconder yeah i 've never sort of probably noticed that much before yeah it 's a procedural motion that they reach in so yeah only they don 't move over the motion uh moving on we 'll do the minutes from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mover and a second please move cancel wickerson second in councillor mothers i 'll put that those in favor against carried unanimously council 's declarations of interest in matters on the agenda i know there 's a few as we go through the the lease agreements one so i 'll just get you to look on the board there councillors and confirm um those as we work your way through so council rutherford could i ask you to you want a decision out of that one um yes thank you mr mayor i um i volunteer coach at the victoria park gymnastics and trampoline club um so i don 't believe i have a conflict of interest i i believe i can be fair and impartial um in in that instance and i 'm seeking a decision from the table please okay could i seek a mover in a second with regards to cancer rutherford 's wishing to stay um move councillor wickerson secretary councillor mothers do you just take a little bit of time from the from karen to uh to record so just be patient councillors we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of leases all in the one um one item uh it will take a little bit of time to work through this morning i 'll move councillor wickerson second and councillor mathers to this yes you can we just got a question there can we take a question councillor kirkland um i 'd just like to uh direct thank you mr mayor if i could direct a question to council rutherford through the chair um just wanting to know just because of your long-term role um certainly and history of of in this sport whether you um anticipate that there may be uh an inclination for you to be biased if there was to be discussion around changes to the premises at any time or all the or the actual what we 'll be discussing later on today so this is just about the least lane that the venue sits on there 's a couple of things here one it 's my portfolio and i think i have knowledge of this area that is vital not on particularly this topic um i would happily leave for that one item @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wouldn 't worry me either but i do see that if you 're a member of a club you 're allowed to stay at the table so i don 't see what i 'm doing is any different from being a member of a of a club um so it 's just that i happen to volunteer coach yeah that 's my as my membership apart from maybe taking part in the activity thanks councillor rutherford i think it 's really good for the community to hear that clarification so i 'm glad you 've said that thank you thank you okay thank you um council if there 's no further questions on that council smith did question relied on oh sorry oh you 're right uh if there 's no further questions on that one i 'll put that to the vote that 's in favor those opposed motions carried unanimously we just need to record those names um for that to get through so council election kirkland smith yep no okay uh the second item council ellen smith councillor you wish to leave the meeting or participate in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a member of the um uh show committee and it 's all older this is declaring our public holiday which is always on the thursday of rockhampton show so you wish to participate in that to the vote yeah smith is council 's representative on that show committee so does that no there 's no conflict of interest on the matter but i think previously council smith you 've undertaken a couple of other roles that you believe there was a conflict of interest which was the judging and ring master i think yeah of ringmaster at the show and also um on the horse committee so i 'm on the other committees as well and yes there 's no conflict of interest in relation to the appointment by council council smith is our council representative to the committee um it 's just her other interests come into it voluntary role yeah yeah so i 'd like thank you like terrain okay so yeah mr mirror i could we 'll probably just have to fix up the top part of it there i think that 's what council rutherford is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee so there 's no conflict of interest to the show committee we 'll have to pick up to say that the member of the the ring master and then the your horse committee the horse committee yeah okay so we 'll pick that up we 'll do that and i think okay can i have a mover in a second with regards to cancer smith 's move councillor may the second councillor rutherford any questions otherwise sorry i 'll put that those in favor carried unanimously thank you councillors i will record that to councillor kirkland latcham mathers williams wickerson and rutherford i think it 's all time i had the same with the lgaq where i had a declarable one i 'll put that to the table should i remain for those votes when lgaq items come up but if it 's a if okay um third one cancel chain election so i 've got another one oh sorry councillor uh yes the next one uh i 'd like to leave for that one because i 'm a instructor and a member of boulder campaign club we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stay away for that one okay i 've also got um should have one anyway i 'll i should have another one as well there fire clay cabins was it no no west westwood um rural fire brigade 10.9 i think it is counseling 10.9 yep i remember the boulder camera or 5 ago we 're all connected to the fitzroy rural fire brigade group i don 't think you believe you have if you 're only a member of that group then it 's not um if you 're not on the committee or any paid role and that then that that 's not required counsellor okay thank you uh council shane latcham um declarable interest in items on the agenda uh you propose to stay away from that yes mr may just for consistency anything related to tennessee leave the room okay no worries thank you okay councillors there 's no further but uh please if there are other items that come up during the uh during the roll during the course of the meeting please um 10.6 i think you 've picked up 10.4 just for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest material change reviews yeah yeah in the trading answers that one because of the licensed sports club that has a lease on the tennis complex i 'll also leave the meeting okay thank you okay cancer for no just the light council of smith at the state tennis club uh i would have a conflict of interest in that as well because my nephew is um employed by tennis queensland and i think they have a connection he has he goes around all the tennis clubs and groups in the kempton area central queensland area sorry i forgot about that one and he used to have a um tennis school there as well so could that 's not a close associate of yourself even though he 's your uh nephew it 's not a closer however i believe that previously sorry council smith i believe in previous decisions of council you have left the meeting yeah and you 're happy to leave the meeting again because sibling is in the prescribed yeah the declarable talks about close associates and so and a close associate can be a wide range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that person 's dealings would make it a declarable conflict of interest but no you have previously yes yes thank you okay all right council i think we 've uh worked our way through those conflicts yeah we 'll move on to the items on the agenda counsellors there 's no uh public forum deputation no presentations of petitions with uh committee reports the audit business committee improvement committee 8.1 from the 15th of july councillors could i seek a mover in a second with regards to those minutes being through an accurate record of that meeting move councillor kirkland second in council election i 'll put that those in favor those opposed carried council smith were you in favor yep it 's all right you 're right uh on to item 10.1 uh the 2022 rockhampton agricultural show public holiday and the resolution is that the chief executive officer complete the online form nominating thursday the 9th of june as a special agricultural show holiday for rockhampton regional council region seek a mover in a second move councillor smith second and councillor mothers put that those in favor against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that was unanimous so councillor rutherford councillor wickerson councillor mathers cancelled williams council of latcham councillor kirkland and councillor smith okay 10.2 the rockhampton regional council bushfire management strategy council smith has a portfolio uh yes thanks um mr chair um really good report and um like to congratulate uh liz and whoever else was involved but i just wanted to know if you were happy with it being chair of disaster i think that 's the most important thing if you 're happy with everything in the report no it 's a it 's a fantastic result and uh you know being prone to to a number of bushfires over the over the years and as you can see on the on the table there the risk with bushfires quite uh prominent uh having this um strategy in place is something there that led us in good stead to to try and manage and mitigate against uh bushfires into the future um they 're one that we can start to reduce the risk but again there is a very high risk in associated with bushfires and it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and again thank the state government for the grant funding to to allow us to achieve that but um there 's always it 's always an evolving uh situation as well so we 'll we 'll monitor and keep keep upgrading and updating that uh that as we move forward but coming from where we were back in 2009 it 's it 's leaps and bounds ahead of where we were um in those days so it 's great to have this this document there that we can refer to and improve on over the years but credit to everyone involved and i 'd just like to uh if you 're happy to move councillors yes um mr t i just wanted to uh just a couple of little things that i did write down when it talks about mount morgan i wondered if baldicon could be included because the d rangers come you know struck walls on one side the derangers are on the other and boulder comb fire brigade works with kelly jungle fire brigade in that area it i mean it doesn 't have to be there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and i think i 've mentioned this one before and i think i 've mentioned it to councillor wickerson um upper yelm significant fires and the upper yulem and south ulum area but they 're not sort of listed as well and it does mention other in the report it does mention other areas and it picks up gracemere uh stanwell and and um cabra because of the 2018 fires and i just thought if we could add boulder cayman and upper and south ulum to that little list there and that would pick up all the areas where we 're praying to bushfire yeah talk to liz yeah liz we might um did you hear that question from councillor smith just about inclusion of boulder came good morning man good morning council smith yes i did we knew that it 's definitely noted by the fire management group this year 's priorities um are the jewel struck oil boulder comb bolton downs mount morgan and stamwell so at the operational group there 's certainly lots of work occurring there the strategy was was highlighting those uh longer term longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted there but they certainly have been considered and certainly can incorporate them too okay thank you thanks council smith thank you yes liz um congratulations on the work and uh martin i think it 's uh it 's great to have a document there now that we we can put our hands on quite readily where uh it 's taken a number of years and uh frustration at some times but uh it 's great to see that we are on track now and having this document available councillor kirkland a question um actually just a comment thank you mr mayor if i may i i just wanted to congratulate as has councillor smith uh the entire team on the massive amount of work that they 've been doing not only on this project but in the community as well as on our website with the dashboard that people can go to and have a look at within times of disaster and just in to get prepared as we 're all talking about now but i i just wanted to say i was a little bit nervous about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen as a cyclone and twice as likely to happen as a pandemic i was like okay we need to pray against a earthquake but um my time is the chair of the local disaster management group that 's the only box that hasn 't been ticked because [Laughter] we don 't want to even talk about it so i 'm touching wood while i 'm saying that but you know it 's uh so you know there 's a moral in that story don 't you don 't want to go there at all but it uh it is interesting to look at that uh that graph and what the the risks are so uh but as you can see the bushfire is one of the the highest highest exposures in that in that area um cancer wickerson thanks mr chair also to commend the team for all the hard work that 's gone into this report very comprehensive but just add a little comment there too that one of the many things that 's mentioned in there is this is one um a trench in our uh response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all the promotional material putting up when we go to the education uh sessions with the community the actual bushfire season is now extended because of climate change so it was forewarned probably by scientists many years ago that things like the frequency and the intensity of disasters that we have including bushfires that would increase and this is probably uh proof of that on the ground that and now we 're looking at instead of a fairly compressed higher risk uh season that 's extended out so um one of the many reasons why we need to review or put this management strategy together yeah then no that 's right that 's for sure um and again we can just have a look at the last few years about the nation about the bushfires and what 's happening across the country okay council if there 's no further further comments or questions i 'll i 'll move and happy to move and seek councillor wickerson or councillor smith councillor smith seconder um i 'll put oh did you want to take a quick chance i 'll put that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majors did you have a question oh sorry no you 're right you 're right um 10.3 the rockhampton ring road project councillors there 's a number of responses back to the letter that we received cancer did want to go into it it 's pretty self-explanatory were there any items there you wanted to just comment rather mr mayor i guess because we 've been critical in the past of the lack of consultation and information on this and this is a great step forward so i think in our correspondence with them if we could mention that council is appreciative of the information that 's been shared with us the consultation now and um the department 's uh willingness to take on board some of the issues that we 've we 've raised yes and uh again you 're right cancer i think it 's um important note that bus bus trip that we all uh went on in the corridor to have a look at the uh you know the the items that we were raising forward in that initial uh letter two um main roads has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're right we do need to be um uh recognize that that communication happening in the resolution we might added further dot point to that uh to acknowledge that counselor i 'll go on to a couple of questions while we put that together um councillor kirkland and council smith councillor kirkland um thank you mr mayor just to comment i just wanted to congratulate and thank the the to the uh the officers and certainly um fellow councillors for for continuing to uh appeal to the state to bring to us the information that we needed but also to push forward for those things that the community can saw as a concern and it 's really good to see that we 're working collaboratively to bring about a result that that is pleasing for the community yeah so and echoing what uh councillor rutherford said for sure yeah sure thanks counselor council smith yeah just a comment as well mr me um i think in the previous report we had i was concerned about them that those north facing rents not being included but i see we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on but i wondered if that 's in writing because sometimes you know uh our offices change main roads offices change and if that is an agreement in writing or just a gentleman i i think this is what we 're asking for them and their return correspondence is to to say we 'd like to see that included in future future but once we hit a trigger point that those roads are failing or we need to need to add those improvements then um then that 's the catalyst for that work to do in future budgets for them to say now um start to prepare for when once we hit that that point where they fail as those intersections all those locations that the the budgets there to accommodate those uh those improvements that are suggested in that in that report sure we 'll be able to work that one through later on if the time comes just uh with the shared user path on the new fitzroy bridge i don 't see that there 'll be too many pedestrians or cycle riders over there that new bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the the allowing for wide shoulders to allow for cyclists to transfer to the road but no pedestrian facilities but i don 't see there will be too many pedestrians in that area no no and i just think that the the costs um going up but there are um options in the future that you can always can leave or add to it at a future date but uh should the to the need and be warranted at that point councillors no further questions or comments on that one council smith are you happy to move move cancer smith uh seek a second a councillor kirkland i 'll put that those in favor please thank you thank you officer for that report that was well done moving on to park sport and public spaces 10.4 the freehold lease and trustee renewals for parks councillor rutherford is the portfolio and council smith and council election going to leave us for this time always um hang on all the other ones except for those okay we 'll deal with the other leases before you step out and then okay we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so we 'll leave those two items three items till the end and work through the others as the portfolio mr mayor i 'm just wondering um given that there are some questions around this and i think it would be timely to have a look at the lease documents itself i 'm just wondering whether we can lay this on the table i don 't believe there is any urgency in the time frames and send it to a workshop it shouldn 't take shouldn 't be a huge workshop but just give us the opportunity to work through the leases make sure that they um what we 're want taking forward and then there 's still that look at um the six years versus three years and also the amounts and how long for okay so [Music] so through you mr chair um that was sort of i 'd mentioned to the counselor that was our backstop depending on the the number of questions we actually have a parks workshop next week um some of these leases councillors you will know have expired for quite some time so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this report to go through okay councillors i 'll i 'll be guided by the table there so you 'll move cancer rather for the amount of lay on the table for a future workshop you 've got a conflict can you actually vote on to lay it on the table uh i think it 's in i think it 's in globe but i 'll just check with the ceo now you 're fine to do that it 's not the specific item that we 're voting on um second and councillor wickerson we 've got a mover and a seconder we 'll put that those in favor of carried unanimously sorry justin he 'd been watching the olympics he was prepped and ready to go anyway now it 's prudent that uh we do that as as uh council ruleford has mentioned it 's a long time um between the next time they come up it 's great great opportunity to go over them in detail planning and regulations we have three items on planning and regulations and start off with item 10.5 the biosecurity program for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to the council maters as a portfolio did you have anything on this one at all okay doug we 'll throw it to you thank you doug uh good morning mayor and councillors so uh what we 're asking for here is a an extension to our biosecurity program for invasive biosecurity matter uh it 's we 've had it for two years and um haven 't been able to fully finish it due to some staff turnover and uh or more importantly dry weather it 's very hard to determine uh what plants what when it 's just a just a dry stick so we 're just asking for an extension for two years to continue the program uh all reports has been working very well there 's on few occasions there 's been a few letters and reminder that letters have had to be sent out um and i and um sort of a testament to the good work the team 's been doing there 's only been uh one possibly two by security orders that 's had to be issued okay oh sorry and sorry mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked the addition of parkhurst to be included for this yep no i don 't think that 's a problem um councillors questions council rutherford uh yeah thanks mr mayor i was just wondering why westwood and gogango weren 't included did you hear that doug in the area uh yes throws through the through um the chair mr meth it 's it 's really down to a to a staffing issue and prioritizing the areas that we can get to and can 't get to yeah i guess my and and i don 't want to say one import one area is more important the other or an issue is more important but a lot of the properties west we go gengo way you know are very much reliant on weeds not spreading and and the fear of giant rat tail grass being brought in from vehicles moving from other communities through that area is is certainly becoming very very um high on the radar for those communities and that affects their livelihood so i would think it 's a fairly high priority doug did you hear that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can to take that on notice mr mayor has hasn 't been included on this program but we can um certainly look at including it going forward yeah thank you okay thanks doug will uh we might come back uh if we can come offline and get a bit of detail around that back to the counsellor and and give a bit of an indication there because i 'm sure the community will approach the council to to talk about that council rutherford thank you uh councilman uh thanks very much mr mayor i just wanted to say that uh you know i believe this is a very important program then and i 'm good to see you i 'm pleased to say that it 's been extended i understand that we did have some staffing issues and that 's why it was about to get followed through so as long as we 're making sure that this gets handed on and we 've got a succession program moving forward i 'm happy to move this okay thank you councillors i was just going to make a comment that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a lot of people from westwood and gagango are members they 've actually got a new sprayer outfit okay one that was worth a fair bit of money that they require out to landholders in that area i just thought maybe that was a reason why they weren 't included can 't council rutherford no mr mayor i 'm fully aware of that but it was actually raised at the last ratepayers meeting too that some concerns about um things being brought in by vehicles that are moving from different areas yeah yeah okay nowadays we 'll be mindful that and i could say doug will come back to you on that counselor move council maters councillor smith you have it a second i 'll put that those in favor pose carried unanimously thank you councillors moving on to item 10.6 and cancellation have a conflict with that one remove himself from the room thanks bevan thank you so this is for development application d28 2021 it 's for material change you use for a club to extend the trading hours and also a operational works permit for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ located uh the total site is located at 268 eldon street and 105 clifton street berserker good thank you so the application was required to undergo public notification for 15 business days and the applicant provided confirmation that all those requirements undertaken in accordance with the statutory requirements and that included photographic evidence of signage physical newspaper ad as well as letters to adjoining property owners so the application itself was for proposed training hours for the club uh club area sorry club area and for the bar area so the actual set for the servicing alcohol the extension is from 10 to 2 am and the gaming rooms is being extended from 10 to 4 am that will happen all days so the proposal also seeks to replace an existing freestanding sign which is on the on the corner of sorry clifton and bursa street and this will be a digital sign single-sided uh facing traffic traveling northbound on that burska street there it 's only going to be used to advertise purposes to deal with the club uh so sorry we 'll go back sorry so the sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a total sign face area for only approximately five square meters so i don 't believe that 's the scale they 've just literally said we 're gonna adjust that to five square meters the subject side is designated in the sport and recreation zone cerrone surrounding land is predominantly designating the low density residential zone which is primarily dwelling houses in the surrounding area so there was one submission received against the application with the following issues identified the extent of trading hours for the bar area selling liquor in particular may have the potential to increase crime and damage to surrounding residential properties and there is also issues highlighted about the location brightness and hours of operation for the proposed advertising sign so the club will be required to obtain a liquor licensing approval with the state and that will require a community impact assessment to implement various managerial and physical measures to mitigate potential safety issues such as public disorder vandalism and public drunkenness now these internal measures may include staff training crowd controllers cctvs at entrances exits and also ensuring there 's sufficient lighting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the surrounding air is predominantly residential um the position of the advertising device on the corner is not expected to cause adverse impacts near our residences and there 's a number of conditions to mitigate impacts such as maximum brightness minimum times before they can change ads and also making sure the device doesn 't conflict with traffic signals and that type of thing also it 's noted there 's no like restrictions on operating hours under the planning scheme for advertising devices so the proposed development was assessed to not compromise the strategic framework in the playing scheme and generally complies with provisions in the playing scheme codes the application only received one submission and the submitted concerns have been addressed by the applicant furthermore where necessary appropriate conditions have been imposed to mitigate impacts on the development therefore the application is recommended for approval subject to conditions outlined in the report thank you bevan councillors council smith uh yeah i 've got a couple of questions mr mayor i just wondered has the applicant done any other consultation other than what was required under the application have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't believe so at this time so sorry through the chairs so i believe this is sort of a two-prong thing for them so they they have to get the local approval before they can even get the state approval so i believe a lot of that consultation will i guess potentially a more in-depth consultation will happen at that stage when they go through the state so they met their requirements under the act for the planning approval but they will still have to go through the office of liquor gaming and regulation yeah i was interested to read that to me it should be the other way around i should do the the public um consultation first you know the assessment but i just wonder if say if this application is approved and the local licensing refuses the application to extend the hours what happens then i can check but i believe they like they wouldn 't be able to operate under those hours because they need both to occur i believe for them to get approval but i can double check that okay and just a third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have on your property advertising your development because i know it used to be two but um i 've seen some developments lately there 's only one sign through the chair that 's common it 's based on the road frontages so if you have one road frontage it 's only one if you 're on a corner block for example you might have two this one actually had four because they 're basically on that hole constrained by the council road so each boundary had a physical sign i actually did have four yeah i had four they gave us photos for that thank you okay thanks again smith councillor kirkland um thank you mr mayor um i just wanted to to question bevan if through through your miss mary if i may uh so the club itself is located on sport and recreation so on page 113 of your report which is 117 of the agenda it 's uh saying that it 's for the purpose of sport and recreation and then it goes on to say whether or not the commercial entity can continue and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just questioning whether you think this club is small scale in the commercial enterprise and whether it fits in with that definition in the planning scheme through the chair no i believe the argument i made was it wasn 't which is why it was inconsistent with the zone and i had to do an assessment against a strategic framework so it was um deemed to comply to the strategic framework but under a consistency with the actual zone i did i disagree with it being small scale um and did you say that it 's in a low density residential zone primarily accommodating dwelling houses that 's within the reforms through the chair i 'd have to read the report but it 's surrounding that area it 's a sport and recreation zone the site itself okay and so for the extension of those hours i 'm wondering whether it 's um it 's not a night precinct it 's more of a community residential precinct is that correct well it 's sorry through the chair the site is sport and recreation it has a it has a field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the site itself the surrounding area is residential so the report looks at the context of the surrounding area um we don 't use that terminology so to speak but yeah looking at the surrounding area it 's predominantly residential so presumably the club 's supporting that residential area as a as a facility um and yes i agree that 's not small scale which is why we had to go through a higher level of assessment for it and under under the assessment that we did we believe there was enough grounds to approve it based on the benefits it provides to that local community in terms of a recreational facility so does gambling classify as recreation you just through the chair it 's it 's actually irrelevant to this assessment for planning counselor kirkland um basically we can only assess it against a sport and wreck zone code but the actual gaming itself and the liquor licensing is assessed by the state so it 's not we can only assess it against the sport and rex zone code we can 't assess it against the residential code @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly it 's not in the definition of the planning scheme um that gambling 's a recreational activity but having said that it probably could be considered a recreational activity um okay so do we as a local council have the options here today to to discuss whether that 's a good thing or a bad thing to to approve a extend gambling um hours or not is it limited to sticking to that through the chair they still have to receive a license from the gaming commission and i believe that 's where the public significance test will be through that gaming agency and they also have to talk to the liquor licensing branch in relation to that hours as well so the planning approval comes first and then they 'll have to seek licenses through gaming and uh lika licensing all righty thank you just a question are there other venues that have got those extended hours through the chair yes there are um i think parkhurst tavern has those hours and there 's probably a couple of others but i can 't think of them off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i i did i did look that up actually uh mr man myself last night and i noted that the other clubs the major clubs do not have those extended hours i i have concerns over this particular approval um with that in mind a question to bevan and tanya just ask it again because it was one that i asked on the way through in terms of this report is they have approval for those hours that doesn 't mean they actually operate for those hours is that correct so whilst you may have looked to see the operating hours the approvals yeah so there 's a because that was um just in terms of consideration the report they already have very lengthy hours i know this is extending it but um the increase of hours and i don 't believe they operate for the full hours now okay thank you through the check can i just say that um they it 's up to the gaming authority they may actually come back and say no you can only do it till two so there is the opportunity there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised and then for them to look at it through the gaming licence okay thanks daniel uh councillor mathers and wickerson and rutherford councilman uh thanks very much mr mayor yeah look i was a little bit concerned about this uh with a few a few different things and i asked the same questions in regards to the extended hours because i you know four o 'clock and two o 'clock um but i was also made aware that all the other major clubs have the same licensing they 're just not choosing to operate so it does not mean that this club will actually operate till then not but that 's the decision they 'll have to make i suppose if they receive their licensing one of the concerns i did have was in regards to the the signage because i think the original application was for quite a bit larger it was a larger signage sign than that they reduced the sign size down to about five meters the five square meters the other thing i 've noticed now is that we 've put the condition in there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flashing lights and also the um brightness of it is to can control to be controlled at night time and day time so that 's making me a little bit more comfortable in regards to that because obviously i 'm very mindful of the neighbors that are looking straight at the sign um and so i just wanted to make sure that that is definitely something they 've got to stand by yeah and through through the chair residential areas have lesser brightness allowed as well it 's not like a uh sorry a musgrave street that brightness is much reduced in terms of residential areas so um and those types of things in terms of like minimum times for advertisements to maintain traffic safety and those types of things as well yeah and so so it can be brighter during the day but at night time it 's got to be through the chair yes there 's it it works as a suite so full full sun you 're going to have maximum brightness but as it sort of inclement weather or night time the the brightness reduces according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas more so than even commercial areas and there 's also a condition i think i read that where these this the sign has to stay stationary for a certain amount of time so it can 't be consistently scrolling over at a very quick rate which would could annoy neighbours as well so i was pleased to at least see those conditions were there thank you just a question through to beverly what 's the recourse if the sign isn 't if it is really bright and causing um an issue overnight time are they able to come back and work on those conditions if the to lower the uh the brightness of it so to speak if it still is causing a problem so this this is basically taken from best practice like australian like australian policy like this is outdoor media advertising i think that 's where we based a lot of our planning scheme requirements on so it 's like standard practice like around australia basically the brightness and as i said i don 't have the numbers off the top of my head but for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or whatever in this area it 's 300 so it 's a much lower like a much lower brightness based on the type of area it is so um in terms of those conditions not necessarily but i mean obviously if there 's complaints received and different things like that then that 's something we could go back to but these things are standard standard sort of um guidelines so i don 't imagine that to be an issue on its own but looking at that we have minimum times for advertisements different things like that that look at managing that as a holistic sort of issue i suppose and okay uh council wickerson yeah thanks mr chair i have some concerns about the uh operating times for the scientific i know that the code is set in that but we control everything else in the planning scheme and the brightness and the and the flashing the animation of signs i 'm surprised that we don 't have a mechanism where in some cases where we need to employ that to restrict the operating times as well for the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have a big sign it can be on 24 7 it doesn 't really matter but where it impacts on a house right across the road always take myself if that was me sitting there what would i think it would wouldn 't be a lot you know so and i understand that the illumination can be dialed down and all that and that 's great but i think do we need to consider in the next review of the planning scene do we put that mechanism in there and can we do that for the odd chance that you know we can 't resolve it any other way that we 've still got that mechanism available to um to restrict the times so through the chair you 're asking me whether we do oh well it is is it possible consider that when we review i think the we 've got cam sitting behind you councillor wickerson so he 's taken due note to that um that part of it sure but the ones that they have on the school ovals and schools they tend to not operate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off at 10 o 'clock or something like that so i 'm not 100 sure but i have driven past and they you do notice them when they 're operating then you 'll drive past later overnight and they 're not not working at all sorry through the chair um some of the signs do actually operate 24 7. there 's very few that we actually restrict the hours on the side at the school at the schools yeah heights college has theirs on all the time i 'm not sure about amaze yeah no state skills i was talking uh state schools i 'm not sure yeah i know it 's the state skills that they come off of a nighttime side account yeah so i think there is something there and i support what council wickerson saying it 's probably something there we need to be mindful when they 're in residential area it 's a different if they 're on the highways and uh exposed to that that that zoning but if they 're in residential areas and we have concerns from residents to start with then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that council rutherford um thank you mine 's sort of along the same lines and why we couldn 't have put a you know a curfew 10 o 'clock curfew time of a turn off um tanya just said we don 't restrict does that mean we have the ability to restrict sorry through the chair um we can condition it um it 's just that we haven 't in the past so my concern is that to me there 's a little bit of inconsistency here now i remember one in another residential area although far busier than this one where it was knocked back because it was residential and it was commercial just around the corner so it 's always these inconsistencies that that get me and this one is and i also thought that we had um our own bylaws that said these signs cannot be within a hundred meters of a residential area so now i don 't know if it 's exactly these but certainly the trailer signs say 100 meters from a residential area so why is this different through which does the planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's two separate things under the local law it 's actually on the road reserve that they control sorry no it was on one i 'm talking about was on private property it may have been a temporary thing um i 'm not sure it 's at the end of the day we can condition it to turn off at 10 or 11 o 'clock at night yeah i i think that would be given it 's a residential area and it is straight across the road from home so i i don 't think it would be unreasonable to ask for that to be turned off but you know whatever whatever time is um deemed acceptable uh we 'll continue on question councillor smith oh yeah just to comment first it 's coincidentally this is responsible gaming week and i did do a little bit of research and with the significant community impact that 's part of the liquor licensing application i just wondered did anyone know what they actually do do they interview all the houses around that area or do they just put it in the paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just wondering how they do that community assessment for for the liquor license oh i 'm not sure bevan have you would you know what sorry i it 's not something i 've researched in depth no i haven 't done that i am aware they have to provide a community impact assessment so that they provide that as a draft to us basically because initially how this came about is they applied to the state and then we looked at it we went no you don 't have approval then they came to us so we had a like a redacted sort of community impact this statement they gave us and that looked at all the facilities in the area and and they looked at the community need for it the impacts on the the community in terms of safety all these types of things so i believe it 's a much more um probably involved process but i don 't know the specifics of it okay thank you oh yeah i know it 's not your department but um you know just to comment i think they would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't be aware but you could have a dozen signs on a fence but people don 't read it they don 't know what 's happening and people are so busy these days to walk over the road and read a sign okay counselors look at adding another item there to put a time limit on the on the sign between the hours of yeah i 'm just going to put probably 10 10 p.m to 36 p.m yep turn it back on yeah okay councillors um if there 's no further questions or look to with that addition to those uh operating years for the advertising uh can i seek a mover in a second with regards to those now yeah move cancel the mothers we have a second cancel the rutherford we 'll put that those in favor those against we 'd like to record councillor williams mathers wickerson and rutherford i don 't vote not a division sorry just voted against the council councillors kirkland and councillor smith cool record debate against that okay thanks bevan you 're there for the next one we 'll cancel action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is 10.7 10.7 councils thanks very much bevan so this application is a minor change to d84 2014 so this is riverside waters it 's a preliminary approval the existing approval to vary the effect of the planning scheme for sorry council rutherford um sorry just some advice sorry i i should have raised this right at the start of the meeting um i live near riverside waters mr ceo have i gotten here yeah thank you thanks evan that 's okay uh so material change is for residential purposes and reconfiguring a lot um so that 's located 54 to 102 and 263 belmont road parkers now the existing approval was for 222 lots the minor change is to include six additional lots which will result in 228 in total so the preliminary approval in place basically has their own mini planning scheme which varies the effect of the existing playing scheme and all lots created will still be over the thousand square meters which is consistent with that document so as the development 's consistent with that document the application is recommended for approval thanks billion questions councillors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me on the map exactly where the extra lots are going to be and how close they might be to fitzroy river water so through the tree what was the last thing um if you could show us where those six because i this was difficult for me to identify where the new lots are going to be and how close they are to fitzroy river water sorry i 'd have to double check but thanks basically redeveloped that whole block to include an additional six um one additional change i 'll mention is they 've also gonna connect this to belmont road up here so the development 's gonna have two access points to development road that 's to improve internal sort of circulation as well for the development yeah think thanks bev and through you mr mr mayor i just wanted to make sure that they weren 't encroaching any closer to frw there with the potential down the track complaints from residents about noise and lights and all the rest so um that 's good to see that they 've put that in the center there thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counsellor mate is you happy to move as a portfolio secret seconder councillor kirkland i 'll put that sorry i 'll just wait for uh karen to catch up it 's hard to scroll down when they 're large items with so much information in there to the uh to the on so it 's councillor mathers and kirkland seconded i 'll put that counsellors those in favor pose carried unanimously thank you moving on to the budget and governance matters item 10.8 the commercial center study 2021 cam we had some questions uh around this one so you 're here to answer them all i have thanks very much cameron thank you mr mayor and good morning councillors the purpose of the report is to present to the councillors the commercial center study this is a study that council offices with cdm smith and rough plan have been working over the last six months we did have a workshop back in 2nd of june to present some of those findings and of course we 've taken on taking those findings away as well as comments mentioned by the councils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original commercial center study was undertaken in 2010 to inform the rockhampton region planning scheme it was a review done based on submissions in 2014 and obviously we 've undertaken this new review for this year the reasoning for that is we have a number of development pressures throughout the region including coals of course wanting to set up in in north rockhampton in particular as well as expansion plans for grey smear allenstown as well in addition as we all know that covert had has had quite a number of impacts so we wanted to take a little bit of analysis about what those impacts mean for our commercial centres so obviously we 've seen a lot more online shopping for example and what that means to our footprint and what that means for our land users under the planning scheme it 's obviously quite a lengthy study so i just thought i 'd just concentrate on the the key findings so one of the key findings is there 's obviously a high level of vacancy rates throughout a number of our centres in particular the cbd and smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street and gladstone road form form part of they 're obviously being impacted from retail trends so there 's a trend away from bulky goods into smaller retail outlets as a result of increased online retail presence this does actually present a few opportunities for some of those empty shells to be transformed into indoor indoor entertainment type and leisure activities as well so and the other thing that was mentioned as well is potentially tray trade-based supplies so we see total tools and men 's toy shops those types of activities the study also recognized that there 's an increase in different forms of activity including craft breweries distilleries artesian producers so there 's a little bit more of a shift towards that area in relation to the covert impacts itself we 've seen a decreased retail floor space so stronger focus on smaller footprint commercial office floor space so from more permanent offices five-year leases towards commercial buildings with a little bit more flexibility in capacity lease periods and configurations as you probably appreciate with a number of people working from home there 's a little bit more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh towards in-city in the city residential development particularly two to three storey units that was something that came from rough plan cedium smith some of the other key recommendations from the study and bear in mind i should point out that we are just receiving this study we 'd like to workshop the recommendation so you 're not approving the recommendations here today we 're just simply receiving the report we have a workshop in the next couple of weeks where we go for each one of these recommendations and what should be done and what shouldn 't be done and that may mean a future amendment to the planning scheme so the projected demand and key issues so as i mentioned there 's vacancies in retail office space across the cbd um unlikely to feel to be fulfilled by 2041 which is a 20-year planning a rise in the scheme users as i mentioned before there 's been a reduction in demand of bulky goods space in local and specialized centres shift towards online retail vacancy rates in the centers have generally increased since the previous commercial study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an analysis of building quality as well so obviously something we like to see is rejuvenation or revitalization of centers so we went out and did an audit on building quality we generally found it to be quite poor in the local and neighbourhood centers so mount morgan frenchville and kawana richardson road as well as some parts of the cbd as well also we found that uh with the landowners in the cbd there 's not a willingness to sometimes invest in their own buildings and facades including facades internal fit outs and to attract new tenants so that 's something that we need to address in relation to additional supermarkets we see a demand for additional supermarkets after 2031 in north rockhampton and gracemere in relation to the planning scheme there a number of recommendations related to the planning scheme in relation to minor updates but generally the consultants felt the planning scheme was actually quite flexible in allowing particularly reuse of of areas and throughout the recommendations actually support a lot of the current policy settings in this planning scheme which is which is nice to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheme recommendations refer to a lot of the strategies already under the cbd redevelopment framework so the consultants obviously support the continuation of that particular framework and something that we will workshop with councillors exploring areas of incentives place making in streetscapes improvements redevelopment opportunities and private public-private partnerships as well so that was some of the the the key findings from the study um as i mentioned before the purpose of report is to simply receive the document there are a lot of uh pressures from developers to uh they obviously were part of the consultation period for this as stakeholders and obviously they came to see the outcomes from it so the recommendation is to receive the report and make it publicly available we have made it very clear on the document itself that this is not public policy of council it is simply there for information purposes and that we will workshop the recommendations with councillors at a later date okay thanks very much kim got a couple of questions i 'll go to councillor kirkland then council election council of kirkland um thank you mr mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report but a very insightful report i think it was great to note that there were a lot of parallels with the outcomes of this report to our own already done um strategic cbd planning interestingly enough i i was going to question how much the study cost i do have some questions around some of the accuracies of their vacancy rates and a number of other statistics that they have in there that didn 't necessarily i think reflect 100 accuracy on some of the areas that i 'm familiar with on kiwana for example i did also just want to comment that we 've already implemented a lot of what or are implementing a lot of what those recommendations are looking at we 've got a number of gyms now in our cbd which was brought up that that might be something that that we want to do we 've all already got the um medium density uh residential for our cbd and a number of other of those recommendations that they have we 're already doing that embarking on that and so i would question as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more gyms can we have that sort of thing so i am excited cameron for the workshop yes thanks kim uh thanks council kirkland council election thanks mr mayor and through youtube cameron um the i likewise uh with councillor kirkland share my concerns about the accuracy of this report um it uh i know there 's a bit of fluidity some businesses open some closed but i wouldn 't expect that to be too significant um in particular i 'm concerned about the uh the recommendations based on the fact that parker shows a zero vacancy rate um i 'm led to believe that that vacancy rate could be as high as 35 40 percent currently and that 's a big concern because the recommendation is for another shopping center out that way when there 's not significant growth happening already and and i 'm very concerned with we 're thinking about opening up another shopping centre when when the accuracy of this report is far from what what the actually is kim i 'll just respond to that um in relation to the data so we did a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very very quickly and that was after christmas too so uh and racing the vacancy rates they could well have been higher at that time in parker 's shopping centre i 've actually contacted them since and there 's obviously vacancies in there at the moment the the study talks about not a new shopping centre per se but a new supermarket so there are different attachments and demands on supermarkets as opposed to a fully fledged shopping centre and it is out to 2031 as well so it 's still 10 years away so that that will be based on the growth in north rockhampton so if we continue with our current growth then there will be a demand within that catchment for another four line supermarket so just to clarify that i don 't think they 're recommending any expansion of existing centres at all particularly parkers i think what they 're recommending is some key one particular key site along gamba road having the opportunity to be used for a full-line supermarket um supplementary mr jimmy so the the accuracy with the which is what i 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stages have been zero percent as i 'm aware so it 's always been a fairly high figure and the complex itself has concerns um that that 's kind of a stubborn number that the number they 're sitting at and it won 't happen until there is significant growth or norman road opens up to allow norman gardens to come through an access way into the departure shopping centre um it 's been stubbornly stuck at that number for quite many years um and until and and it 's just a bit of a concern that obviously if we 're talking about future yes it 's 2031 but if there 's still future it might be at least until 2031 till at least that 's 100 or close to 100 capacity um it would be a bit of a worry to the residents out in parkhurst uh if we were to have some more competition that would affect that significant uh shopping complex we 'll discuss those in the uh more details in the workshop i 'm sure those questions shouldn 't come around there and get a better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking about the catchment numbers it 's on page 155 of our agenda and i just thought they were a little bit low and i just wondered how long ago this report was put together and is it taking into account our growth like we all know that so many people here now that there 's not enough houses for everybody um just grace me is probably the only one i could speak to uh the late latest um uh resident numbers i saw was twelve thousand three hundred so have that and add on uh like all your western people and south west and and the people from the south that probably shop there i know it takes me an hour to do a five minute shop so there is plenty of people that go there and i just wondered even with allenstown and parker 's those numbers seemed a bit low and talking about local centres as well frenchwall farm street norman roadmap morgan i thought that they were a little bit low as well as well as the neighbourhood centres so i just wondered what significance those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um thanks council smith those particular numbers are based on what 's obviously been released by the state statisticians office and other numbers that we use so there is some flexibility in relation to demand and when these centres come online so if there are recommendations for an additional supermarket and the development developer for example justifies that there is actually higher growth than what 's been anticipated under the study then those particular supermarket for example could come online earlier okay but the study is just using a baseline of one percent growth which has been a historical trend you may well get influxes in in population growth increases decreases stabilizers we just need to take a one percent uh annual which has been historical the trend and using that in our justification for the commercial land this study really recognizes a lot of commercial land available and there 's a lot of development approvals available a lot of the commercial land currently is actually being greatly underutilized and that 's why you see higher vacancy rates and that 's why you see areas that that probably need a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all be captured in the workshop we can discuss it in detail about where those yes sorry through the chair we 'll go through a lot more detail on the workshop yeah including um what the role of centers is under the planning scheme as well so everybody understands why we have them uh and also how we set up the future direction of them as well thanks again council smith yeah just to comment that but if we receive this today and make it publicly available when we want to workshop it is that clever should we be doing that or have the workshop first lay it on the table until we can have a workshop because otherwise if we make it public it means we agree with everything in it i can 't address that before yeah yeah so sorry for the chair um like i 've mentioned previously um we 're not saying this is council policy we 're saying it 's for information purposes only so when we publicly release the document i 'll have that written on every page yeah so it 's very very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stakeholders who are very much interested in the outcomes yeah but i mean make clear that the recommendations are for discussion yeah and subsequent those workshops then the amendments can come from there yep obviously when it gets amended into the planning scheme then it becomes a statutory instrument and council wickerson uh thanks mr chair for you to camp just a general question cam is there an integration between this study and some of the outcomes and also our other uh road work networks if we 're if the study makes some predictions about where the growth it 's going to be is there some you know that that connection between so that that report informs some of those decisions and we looked the other day in the allenstown area and we know there 's a big vacant block there that 's uh prime for development but we looked at some of the traffic patterns around there which is historically a problem and that may solve the problem in the in the short term but in the longer term you know the other two reports talking to each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair um the report takes an account the planning scheme and land use patterns under the playing scheme and that road network and how big these centers need to be for that catchment obviously for some of these centers if you have you know if if there 's growth anticipated then those issues need to be addressed as part of that as well in relation to traffic it 's an interesting one because a lot of these centers are consolidated for a reason um and well i know that there may be traffic conflicts around there but sometimes that 's actually a good thing that the center is actually performing it 's when you have no traffic or nobody parking in a center then you start to question what that role and function of that center is and whether it 's actually achieving you know its outcome so yes in summary it does talk to the languages patterns under the scheme and where we have current centers but in relation to transportation generally in centers you want to encourage more people going to them for accessibility than discouraging them because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh what you 'll have is actually a lot of vacant areas in our current centers if you know what i mean so the more percentage you spend for our growth the more vacancy rates you 'll have and i will get into the workshop about an individual 's need over a community need in relation to centres so you have a lot of existing commercial land owners who can 't get tenants now if we expand our centers or approve outer centre development then obviously they 're not going to be particularly happy because they 've done the right thing they 've invested in commercial land councils also invested infrastructure in these centres for its road network sewer water etc um so that 's why we have a center 's hierarchy but i 'll get more into that in the workshop yep good explanation ken thank you councillor mathers thanks very much mr mayor look i think this um report is very important because it 's what we need to use to you know move forward and look at our growth and that sort of stuff as a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning very quickly that the only way i can make an informed decision and a good decision is based on the information i 'm given and the issue that i have is there seems to be a lot of holes in this report that i 'm looking at and that 's just being completely honest what concerns me is what records we have for the people that are actually you know preparing these reports and then presenting them to us because the information that we 're building on is a lot of it is used for that and so you know what i would almost like to ask is is there any way we can communicate with these people and get them to give us some idea of where these figures have come from because i know i can only talk within my area the numbers certainly don 't reflect the reality and i think it 's very important with the amount of money we 're paying uh you know taxpayers money or rate pays money to have these reports done i think they there needs to be responsibility and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in time but again cam is how how relevant are they really yeah um just sorry for the through the chair we can give you a number of spreadsheets that actually dictate we actually went around side by side about six months ago and went through and identified the land use and the gfa etc so with any sort of data gathering exercise you know if you can get to 80 to 90 percent correct you 're actually doing a pretty good job and knowing that it 's going to change week to week with new stores closing new ones open new developments etc it 's probably important to recognize as well that is one of the data sets that you have been used there are a number of other data sets that have been used as well so these guys obviously have australian experience about what are the trends in regional centers what are the trends resulting from covert and then basing there putting all that information together and then basing that on some recommendations sorry providing us with some recommendations on how to go forward so when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot more detail but in the days with any sort of data collecting exercise there is going to be you know a level of of discrepancy um with that but i don 't believe that that 's actually compromise the end result of the recommendations being provided and the fact that they 're actually backing up a lot of what we 've said already under the scheme and the framework how we should go forward i think thanks very much i i it 's for you mr may i understand what you 're saying that cameron i just the the things that i 'm looking at here i think we 're talking we 're at way outside eighteen ninety percent so i 'm very interested in seeing what um the officers can come up with because from what i 'm seeing here i i probably uh would be tending to lean towards the officer 's information more so than what i 'm looking at here right thank you okay thanks um council election thanks mr mayor um i agree share your sentiments um i 'm very concerned do we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until such time that we actually know that these figures are accurate uh through the chair i mean that 's the decision for the councillors if they wish to to release it i guess what the officers are saying is that um i we 've got obviously a number of people that are interested in the outcomes particularly the recommendations um and and and b look we um we are not saying it 's council policy okay we 're saying this is information that 's been presented to council um and we 're going to workshop those recommendations i am concerned about the accuracy and it 's probably one of those things where there are sad that we probably need a peer review on this one no i 'll look i 'll go to the ceo and again um it 's it 's just about getting that information out to the super so cam you 've gone out you 've engaged a number of stakeholders within the local community yep and so forth they will require to have some input into this draft report this draft study to come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say have some feedback into that that 's correct in fact some put in submissions as well for this report [Music] and i don 't think too many are going to be too concerned about vacancy rates and things in at minor levels be quite honest they 're looking at the bigger picture particularly for growth and development um particularly what they 're focused on but yes you 're correct we did go out to stakeholders they are expecting a response um particularly a uh you know the outcomes of the study that we 've been working on for the last six months so as we go through the workshop arrangement and seeking feedback from the stakeholders have been involved there would be an opportunity to then go back and challenge some of the veracity around the data within that which may or may not have impact on the recommendations yes for the chair of course yep okay councillor kirkland then council rutherford councillor kirkland um thank you mr mayor i understand we 're just adopting i like just receiving the report i should say today but i did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we 'll be workshopping this we won 't be placing all of our eggs in one basket on this one report that will actually be using other reports and other data that 's been made available to us and that gives us a really good peace of mind that we 're not um like i said placing all of our emphasis on one report especially when councillors have all seen this and raised our concerns about the accuracy of it yeah that 's quite clear thank you council rutherford yeah i think there 's probably two things here one i think if it goes out it gives the opportunity for people to to respond particularly if they think there 's an issue but i am a little concerned that are we sending out a document that people are going to be disappointed with particularly if they 've played a part in um helping to form it are they going to be disappointed with what 's come yeah kim sorry for the chair in russia council robert 's question i think that most of them will actually be happy um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be unhappy um but the vast majority will be actually happy with the contents um of the study itself because it addresses some of their their needs or wants um it is a the study itself is a bit sobering in relation to i guess releasing to the community when we 're basically saying look there are a number of vacancies we 've actually been very honest and open about that and it also gives an indication that the council acknowledges a number of vacancies and these are the things we are going to look at not necessarily adopt but look at as part of a workshop to try and address some of those issues can they put faith in the document to build their future on it 's from what i got picked up from cancer again but what i picked up from cam is that yes data moves on it moves all around the place six months you know snapshot which probably took three or four months to actually collate things have moved on since the report has been written however the report doesn 't get down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region actually takes a bit of a helicopter view of the whole region and takes a bit of a look at say the larger you know nostalgic quan or just on the cbd if it takes a helicopter view and the veracity behind those recommendations uh cam 's comforted in is that correct then you 're confident in how the recommendations haven 't been impacted by the micro part of the data that 's been gathered yes through the chair that 's a good point um even that we take it from yes a very very high level uh when we 're looking at our policy responses to to centers generally speaking you know you look at the data yes there are a number of vacancies what do we achieve to help those centers develop and grow from a high level strategic perspective so just to give an example that might mean we 're a little bit more flexible under the planning scheme to allow additional uses in there so the study is talking about more indoor entertainment and lifestyle well that 's something we can should consider more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so we 're not getting down to this shop 's vacant and that shop 's got something in it we 're looking at actually a higher level view and saying what are some of the policy responses we can do to help all centers develop and grow over time but also acknowledge that there are a number other policy higher level policy responses such as improvement in streetscaping and things like that that make these centres more presentable so we 're actually trying to help facilitate growth we 're not trying to compromise it or limit it and look i know that some stores have changed and there are maybe some of the data is you know not up to date with with vacancies and all the rest of it but that does not really change the overall message to say we do have a lot of land that 's vacant or undeveloped yeah um yeah so probably to that myth i couldn 't smear is we 're not looking around the individuals around even individual centers you 're actually taking the higher look at the whole region and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mayor i guess one of the things i 'm keeping up is a recommendation has been made on the basis that there was zero percent vacancy at the parker shopping north town centre and that 's why there 's actually a recommendation to have an area at will william pelfrey road based on zero percent and if that 's not accurate which i know it 's not if that 's not accurate then that 's a key recommendation that 's going based on something inaccurate that 's what my concern is okay just generation of that question um it will be assumed under the commercial center study that there will be no further expansion of parkours for william powerfield road you 'll get residential growth there will be a catchment for a minor centre based on that future growth okay so that parker center is now district center that will accommodate a wider wider wider catchment yeah i don 't think we 're going to get to the to the i think we leave that to the workshop and go from there council wickerson question thanks mr chairman just wondering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this report and use some data if we know bits and pieces of the floor and maybe more we don 't know uh are we liable that is is there any disclaimer or something i think what cam saying there is a disclaimer there that we 're basically saying that it 's not policy and it 's not published and it also works sorry it can also work the opposite way if we do have information at hand that should be public it should be made available to the public them to make decisions about like our blood maps even though we haven 't incorporated our flood mapping into the planning scheme at this stage we still make it available to the public um out there before council actually says it 's in the planning scheme so we don 't need to say you know at your discretion to use this information for any business decisions they need to do that it 's yeah it 's just sorry through the chair um we might get very very clear on the document that it 's obviously not council policy um if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still got the planning scheme that says which is our statutory instrument it says xyz that 's that 's been adopted by council they may make arguments under the centre study for for a particular development but the reality is we 'll still assess it against the planning scheme and its statutory instrument what we 'll see that when we workshop the recommendations that will probably then lead to an amendment to the planning scheme where it becomes adopted um for council that 's a statutory instrument that 's what council 's policy is this is a study that council has undertaken for information only to help guide that future process of potential amendments to the scheme okay thank you catherine ford yes sorry i 'm just wondering with the recommendation whether we can include something in there that says you know while council questions some of the um information oh now look i think i think we workshop it and this is only just to to make that information that we 've got at the moment available to that and we go from there it 's not a statutory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could say that the recommendations i say it in the report anyway the recommendations will be workshopped at a later date and i think we do make fairly clear the document is not public the thing that just worried me just a little then was uh chem 's statement that they may refer if they 're putting an argument on a planning application they may refer to that document that that was the key that started to um go well maybe we should have something in writing saying that while we we receive this and we put it out for public we don 't necessarily accept all the findings does that cover cancer now it 's already publicly available once we receive it so it doesn 't it doesn 't say that we 're questioning it um uh sorry for the chair um are you ever going to get 100 though if it 's a snapshot in time whenever you 're there is it going to be yeah yeah sorry sorry for that um we could say that the study will be publicly available and lay this item on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and go from there i think that 's the only way that we 're going to get any consensus going forward just be advised it is an rti little document as well right information people can still access it anyway anyway yeah if they want to they can lodge and write information on it but i think the difference there is we haven 't actually received it it 's just a document that council has commissioned but at this point we haven 't received it 's still discoverable is there a difference between receiving and adopting it yeah it 'll just take a lot longer if it 's still discoverable there 's no point in laying it on the table i don 't see why we can 't receive them what the councils are saying they don 't want to endorse something that 's not accurate that 's what i mean can we just not put there that it is not um council policy to cover ourselves cancer smith told me that we lay it on the table until after the workshop i 'll seek a second move cancer smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table until it 's uh until we until it 's been workshopped i 'll put that doesn 't answer the question mr mayor um can we workshop it if we haven 't received it we can okay legendary mr man question won 't we have to receive it regardless there 's a motion council we can speak two or four against it um cancer there 's a motion there that the matter lay on the table until further workshop to put that those in favor those opposed emotions carried can i record my opposition to that the others want to record this councils we have um we 've gone to it 's quarter nearly quarter to 11. we might take a recess there for 10 minutes and then come back and deal with the other items on there councillors of rutherford and councillor rutherford sorry um take a recess and come back in ten minutes time thanks councillors thanks cam cheers thank you [Music] [Music] i wanna see how the world turns round let 's go adventure in the deep blue [Music] sheep [Music] baby [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change a thing i knew that we 'd survive here and all the goodness we would bring this i

[Music] so [Music] do [Music] [Music] i want to see how the world turns round [Music] home baby [Music] [Music] [Music] do [Music] now that we 've arrived here i would not change a thing i knew that we 'd survive here and all the goodness we would bring this i see everybody swimming in sunshine everybody feeling fine everybody join the front line ain 't nobody left behind [Music] ain 't nobody left behind everybody 's swimming [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] do [Music] [Music] [Music] baby [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] now that we 've arrived here i would not change

@ @ @ @ @ counselors we 're all back on our spots okay thank you council we resume our council meeting uh and we 'll move on to item 10.9 the westwood rural fire brigade lease renewal council smith did you ever no she doesn 't have a conflict in that one that 's right okay kelly would you like to talk to us uh through that report please uh sure thank you mayor um good morning councillors so this report is disregarding the westwood rural fire brigade their lease is due to expire at the end of november this year and they have requested a 20-year lease renewal um you 'll note in the report that the 20 years is consistent with the previous decision of council for the collingwood rural fire brigade last year that we the council granted a 20-year lease term so if there are any questions please let me know council rutherford um yeah i certainly agree kelly i was just wondering but uh the cali jungle fire fire um rural fire lease says a peppercorn rent are we considering the same sort of arrangement for the westwood rural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same peppercorn rent um so um yeah so the report says that it 's to be at a continued peppercorn rental so that 's consistent with all of our rural fire brigade leases that we have in our region okay thank you that 's good they yes i am happy to move um our rural fires do just an amazing job for our community so happy to move this one and again probably coming back to the earlier report on your strategy it 's it 's important that the risk is there that we we support that uh those people that are out there doing the work on the ground council smith 's happening is second council if no further questions or comments i 'll put that those in favor promotions carried unanimously thank you councillors moving on to item 10.10 the 5k cabins native title compulsory acquisition council has a change to the resolution to uh to the one that was presented in the report um just the wording just was a little bit um a bit hard and felt that we needed to soften that to to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to start with is that we 're more uh looking at a consolidative approach rather than uh one where it 's it 's it 's been uh heading down that path for um for the urgency we just find that it 's something there we need to need to work and after our meeting with the gangalow nations people we um we find that that uh that could be more productive uh heading down that path rather than than the path that was chosen previously so it 's basically a change in tact and one that we need to work to happy to also write a letter to the minister to seek government support for this critical historical piece of [Music] tourism that we could work on i was trying to find the word for that one but uh yeah look i think it 's important that it 's not only left to local government to to try to work with but we can seek seek other levels of government support and buy in on it because it is important to our history and something there that we need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to made available for the public and for the general public to see as well so i 'm keen to progress those discussions as well and hopefully we can bear some fruit from that uh cancer relevant as a divisional counselor would you like to speak um mr mayor i 'm wondering whether you would consider a third dot point on to that motion basically um formalizing what you 've just said about writing and it would be a dot point three that council rights to both the state and federal government seeking recognition of the natural and historical significance of the fire clay caverns along with the request for assistance to stabilize and conserve the caves to ensure this important site remains intact for future generations that were the words that i said [Laughter] yeah if you could for that across to to karen we can capture that i 'm more than happy to put that as a third dot point councillor but uh i think it 's important again yeah the horror the historical significance of that site is something that can 't be underestimated and uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a tutoring venture going forward is something we really need to to make sure that we we can progress and uh and by by no means um step away from but it 's a it 's a just a different approach than what we were doing previously councillor mothers thanks very much mr mayor uh mr mayor i 'd just like to congratulate the council uh for the recommendation i 'm hoping that it goes through uh i think everyone won 't agree it 's a very very important issue and it 's something that i certainly would like to see progress i 'm just really happy that we haven 't we 're not proceeding in the direction that we were originally proceeding because that was certainly not the right way to go so i just want to say yeah thank you for the council for uh for looking at doing it the right way you 're here um council is just thinking it may be something that we can put on the priority list for the upcoming federal election that we um inform the candidates or something there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not sure what uh buying they 've got there but tourism is a big thing especially with covert and and what we 've got on their plate at the moment so it may be something that the potential candidates may want to um advocate for as well definitely mr mayor mean it 's it 's a national treasure that we 've got sitting up there so yeah yeah for sure thank you council rutherford for um adding that further dot point there which really does um reiterate um the discussions from the council in the workshops where we were heading with this one so um are you would you like to move councillor rutherford second i 'll put that those in favor opposed carriage university thanks very much councillors moving on to item 10.11 the draft debt recovery policy for review money thank you thank you mr mayor good morning everyone so uh council is presented with the debt recovery policy which has been uh reviewed and presented to council for adoption um the policy applies to rockhampton regional council rate payers and other debtors with overdue rates and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major amendment to the policy which was due to the inconsistency with the legal proceedings commencement cessation and other matters policy the wording has been added to the policy to allow a delegated officer to instruct debt collection agencies acting on behalf of council to recover overdue rates and charges including bringing court proceedings on behalf of council so this is still the current practice that council follows however it was identified that it was inconsistent with the legal proceedings policy and we had to correct that the legal proceedings policy will actually be reviewed at a later date so that that is fully covered in terms of the inconsistency then thanks very much many councils any questions on that one councillor smith yeah probably just a comment mr may when we brought in that um people only get one reminder letter i was against that because i used to get two i just found when they get that second letter and it 's from the depth collector people get very very upset and stressed and i just wondered is there any way we can actually soften that and i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council i don 't know whether a lot of people do or whether they 're too embarrassed to do that no i think there 's a pathway for that to occur uh marnie did yes so through the chair um we already encouraged those arrangements to pay um the the arrangements to pay are to be in advance of the the rates being struck so we encourage people to get in front of their reigns balances but there are also there is also an opportunity for rates arrangements to occur once the debt is there and rate payers are wanting to you know try and pay off those rates if they 're behind um i understand what council smith 's saying in terms of the first letter reminder notice however you know the the rate payer has already had a 30-day period clear to deal with their rates the first letter is an administrative process that council runs it does go to the collection agency after that however that initial point of contact it can be seen to be a little stressful but it 's it 's a process that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that collection process and commence that that way yep thank you councillor rutherford i was just wondering whether you know a text messaging um as a second follow-up whether that 's sort of affordable for us to do and and not too time consuming just as that i guess a compromise and interim measure um for people um through the chair i guess the text messaging is we we do a global text message i guess to rate payers when the white rates or water are due you know we get a notice period and it 's becoming due at the discount period the text messaging will require us to collate all of the data and select certain rate payers to text which probably takes a little bit more effort to try and collate who we send that message to because it 's obviously not going to be everyone at that point in time it 's only going to be those that are outside of the discount period we can certainly explore and come back to council it may have some more more issues side issues too to that i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come back if that 's a possibility i 'll hear what your counselors are saying there but uh it may be may not be achievable marnie just another comment as ross just mentioned we don 't necessarily always have mobile contact details for those people who are um who are outstanding as well so they 're not necessarily going to be picked up in that text message process either okay thanks manny councillors further questions around that one if not i 'm happy to move seek a second second to cancel the latching i 'll put that those in favor carried in and say thank you councillors moving on to the notices of motions we have two notices on the books uh we 'll start with 1.1 11.1 sorry i 'm councillor kirkland for the central queensland local government climate forum in european on the 12th to 13th of august happy to move i 'll move councillor smith seconded against the mothers i 'll stay with that one yeah yeah councillor smith second and councillor mothers i 'll put that those in favor pose carrick thank you and uh number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the travel approval process thanks council election uh hang on we 'll seek a mover in a second and first before we get to that um can i speak to it first um can we immediately we need all movements we need to move now move cancel action second chancellor uh smith can i foreshadow an amendment please yep yes what is the amendment so um i 'd like to foreshadow that instead of it saying and livingston local government area um that we look at all local government areas within the cq rock amendment to the existing nation so council is you happy with those amendments councillor wickerson i 've got a small amendment as well just in that first bullet point um if i can speak to just for a moment the original intent of the notice of motion was around the cost of of this so it was never about distance away from rockhampton so i wouldn 't mind adding at the end of that first line and absolutely concur that it should be the cq rock area but this sort of circumvents that a bit too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenses the travel form that we call it so if there 's no expense like and there 's two examples you could go to makai up and back in a day drive your car there 's no accommodation there 's no fee that shouldn 't have to come back to the table there 's no costs associated rather than your car so it 's not distance so and mackay is outside of the cq rock area alternatively you could go down to your food for two thousand dollar conference and that probably should get back to the top come up with me come back to the table so it 's not about distance so much it 's about the cost of the travel and impact on budget that that was what the original intent of my motion was so basically for triggers it 's a travel form to be lodged it should come to the table [Music] so i 'll go to the speaker for the motion first and we 'll work through it from there and then i think that 's interesting i 'm happy to with the amendment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy for that i 'm not sure about council wickerson 's additional amendment to that speaker against councilman uh thanks very much mr mayor um the the original um motion that was put forward or i i thought the idea of or what i was actually voting for was the idea is um expenditure that 's that 's what i was interested in was the fact that you know how much it was costing the the ratepayers to send us the thing to uh particular events and what the benefit to the council and to the councillor 's position was so um you know i i agree in regards to councillor rutherford uh cq rock but i also agree with councillor wickerson and the fact that um i think it should be um when it when it 's cost involved you know no one minds if someone if a council is using their the car to drive somewhere and come back like i was saying but if it 's a cost involved uh i think that 's something that you should come to come to the table yeah what i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um we 'll deal with this one that that 's on the books at the moment with the amendment to to cancel the latch so sorry we 'll work yeah the median procedure works so council rutherford proposed an amendment to the motion so we 'll meet a seconder to that amendment and that will then become the motion okay and that amendment will then be debated however from yeah you can 't go on to a second amendment so you can 't amend an amend amended yeah you kind of manned amendment um and that 's where i think we need to come back and have some clarification with council and may maybe some subsequent follow-up of words because i think the words on the run will might pick us up a little bit more again it may be maybe another note of summation down the track counselor with the scene yeah i think probably that i think if we try and do what you 're saying counselor wickets in relation to trying to clarify it might actually muddle us up here on the go so i know you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um damon is still to bring that report back to to change the actual policy maybe that 's some discussion before that comes back to the table okay then the amendment has been um to the motion has been moved council rutherford second and councillor mothers from what i 'm hearing it 's where everyone 's on the same same page from it yep yep well we could have we could have almost left that dot point as just rockhampton because um then we wouldn 't have to that would cover conferences then to look through okay councillors we 've um made the amendment uh move cancer rutherford tennessee rutherford did you wish to speak to it oh um i thank cancellation for putting this um this motion forward because it was obviously an unintended consequence of where we were trying to do the right thing by being more accountable for um expenses on different travel certainly to our ratepayers but it its administrative nightmare to have to ask for approval to go to livingston or even to gladstone for that matter you know our work needs us to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just tidies uh tidies that up yeah i agree speakers against just wait for the tidying up of those words and we 'll get the mover and second and then we 'll denote speakers against them there 's no speakers again so i 'll put the motion those in favor carried unanimously thank you councillors um cancer there 'd be no other items on the agenda the questions on notice of agent business or close the meeting at 11 14 and thank everyone and thank the officers for the reports i think when from sorry yeah ain 't nobody left behind [Music] ain 't nobody left behind [Music] swimming [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] let 's go adventure in the deep

firstly i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to country i would like to begin by acknowledging the traditional custodians of the land on which we meet today the rumble people and pay my respects to the elders past present and emerging i extend that respect to our neighbouring aboriginal peoples within the local government area the ganga loop nation people the bharata the kabul bara and the etimorala people and also acknowledge the torres strait islander people whose land is in the torres straits but who live and work on aboriginal land thank you councillors we have a full complement move on to confirmation of the previous minutes would i seek him over in a second and move councillor smith to have a second with uh councillor kirkland those minutes are true and accurate i 'll put that those in favor as against carried unanimously thank you councillors we have a number of declarations and of interest in matters on the agenda today and we 'll work through those as we go through and there may if there are other items that arise during the course of the meeting please do not hesitate and inform from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there thank you very much mr may um i councillor may that 's informed the meeting that i have a declarable conflict of interest in item 9.3 community assistance program major sponsorship motorcycle in queensland this declarable conflict in interest arises because my sons trenton kai mathers my sister 's uh councillor sheree rutherford and brother-in-law michael rutherford and i volunteered during speedway events i wish for eligible councillors to now determine pursuant to section 150 es of the local government act 2009 whether i might participate in the discussions about the matter including by voting on the matter or must leave the meeting including any area set aside for the public and stay away from the meeting while the eligible councillors discuss and vote on the matter okay we might um sorry councillor because there 's a dual uh conflict here we might go with councillor rutherford as well uh and deal with both items if you 're wishing to our line is slightly different to that again so i don 't know whether that makes a difference i would suggest i would suggest we deal with your matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting because i think if you were to vote on councillor may this matter you would have a conflict of interest in interest on that one so i think we deal with council rutherford 's first mayor sorry about that we 'll do that uh sorry just uh the agenda of those ones so apologies councilman but we 'll go with cancer rutherford first and uh and make that um decision on that then uh before i read that out can we please just clarify um speedway events can we just put solos um in bracket beside that please so that it 's very clear that it 's not all not not the motors okay thanks council rutherford all right um i councillor sheree rutherford informed the meeting that i have a declared declarable conflict of interest in council agenda item 9.3 community assistance program major sponsorship motorcycle in queensland this declarable conflict of interest arises because my brother grant mathers nephews trent and kai mathis and my husband michael rutherford and i volunteer during speedway solo events can i please add to that also that on occasion um the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um in return for a donation um and certainly while i don 't you know i have no idea that that 's happening this time around um you know i believe they should have the opportunity to to do that if that um if that opportunity does present itself um yes mr mayor i think it 's probably best because of that last section there in particular that i um i 'll just leave the meeting rather than ask council to vote um on whether i can stay or not okay about it thanks whether he can vote on stay or not sure i 'll leave the meeting leave the meeting present thanks councillor rutherford and we 'll move on to councillor mayer 's point i don 't think we require you to read that again but we 'll move on to the the decision making about wishing to be eligible for council to determine i 'll just wait for karen to catch up if probably councilman is here you just probably inform the table how you will put the public interest in front of the private interest is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm happy to take um uh questions from around the table as well so um look i 've been involved in motorcycle racing my entire life so obviously it 's a passion of mine but um in regards to solos i purely simply i know the the person in question uh mr william were at day uh he 's approached me on a number of occasions to see if i could help out in regards to volunteering myself and my sons have helped in the vip area serving at the bar helping to set up that type of thing i have no connections whatsoever in regards to any committee any decision making processes uh anything to do with uh any monetary value with it so i believe i 'm more than capable of being able to assess this on its merits and certainly put the community benefit above um above the sport on my own okay thanks councilman councillor kirkland did you have a question with regards to that item uh yes i just i suppose wondering about influence and how much influence you would feel that you have with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ongoing thing for how many years so two questions in one yes certainly no problem um uh william warwick day is a family friend has known that family for for quite a few years uh back through pcyc when he was involved in boxing and that type of thing um so i i certainly wouldn 't uh he 's an associate uh not a personal friend um in regards to the um you know so i don 't think i 've gotten any swap in his uh decision-making process the second question sorry was just how long through you mr chair how long the involvement has been like i 'm trying to establish counsellor how close that relationship is obviously with conflict of interest if we 've got a family member that we 're considered to be quite close with then we would be con considered to have a conflict of interest and the question is whether your decision making will be influenced by that relationship so i 'm just trying to establish how long that 's been going for your relationship with the the company that the business um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um so i 've been involved in three meetings yeah three three meetings that i 've helped him with when i say meetings as in solo meetings uh outside of the solo meetings i very rarely have any contact unless i run into william warwick day on the streets that 's the only time i 'd have any connections with him okay thank you councillors we will ask for a decision on this matter now so um could i seek a mover in a second with regards to uh the item one or two on that uh those decisions there so um councillor smith yeah i 'll move that uh councillor mathis doesn 't have a declarable interest do we have a second council of fisher i 'll put that to the table so it 's probably a council mother has a conflict of interest however the table has determined that he might participate in the discussion in the meetings so maybe as in the item there they may participate in the decision making about the matter uh yeah which includes that okay yeah i 'll put that to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that those in favor those opposed emotions carried thank you we 'll just wait for the uh secretary to catch up and invite councillor rutherford back in sorry do you want yeah okay recordings you sure we do except yeah councillor latcham opposed it voted against so um until we go through the names yeah that 's it okay councillors we 'll move on to the the next next conflict councillor fischer mr mr chair um uh ideal fischer i 'd like to inform the meeting that previously i have declared a conflict of interest in the housing construction grant program the matter that will be discussed in item 9.8 housing construction grant program draft amendment this is a declarable conflict of interest arises from my family business fisher 's nursery which was tendering on a project that was involved with a local builder our business was not successful in this tinder but there could be further opportunities to tender on future projects so i propose that i leave and stay away from this place while the meeting is being held while the matter is being discussed and voted on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this stage thanks councillor fischer i 'll go on to my conflict um i met council tony william inform the meeting that i have a prescribed conflict of interest in matters item 9.6 rockhampton regional planning scheme minor amendment that this prescribed conflict of interest arises from my brother gerald williams who owns property in the port curtis area which is part of the amendment i propose to leave the meeting and stay away from the meeting and place where this meeting is being held while this matter is being discussed and voted on thank you i might fix those words up too sorry man you are required to leave the meeting yep yeah so i am required i won 't propose to legal i 'll leave the meeting um councillor kirkland hi councillor donna kirkland informed the meeting that i have a prescribed conflict of interest in item 9.6 rockhampton regional region planning scheme minor amendment the prescribed conflict of interest arises as my husband brett copeland and i are the proprietors of dale creek proprietary limited trading as ultratune south rockhampton which is located at 55 bloodstone road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a prescribed uh conflict of interest must leave the meeting to change the words online as well because it 's prescribed we have to leave yeah okay noted counsellor um thank you we 'll just wait for that um items to be clarified and removed do we need to put in there um mr ceo what the relevant because it 's put in our property address but it 's not saying what part of that amendment is is the conflict with as you know the levy okay councillors moving on with the agenda but again um no any um conflicts that arise if they 're not notified during the meeting please uh please make us aware uh public forum 's reputations nil uh councillor smith sorry i 've got a conflict of interest too okay it 's up there it 's up oh sorry yes no that 's not a declarable or a prescribed conflict of interest it 's a matter that you 're dealing with just public money and you 're just getting the table to do it yeah that 's uh sorry 8.1 yeah um but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that i haven 't i 'll just declare that at the time through the chair council smith i would suggest that after you finish with 8.1 you raise that matter of wanting to make a further donation to the pony club then declare the conflict of interest then have council determine both the conflict of interest and then the subsequent matter to do with the granting of the funds and then we 'll go from there okay okay but this is 9.21 that we need to work through now yeah okay so um i 'd like to inform the meeting i have a declarable conflict of interest in 9.2 community assistance program major sponsorship alton dance polar cross and sports club incorporated who are holding the state championships this year in july as my nephew dane mckinnon is a member and plays for bohenia polo cross club and he will be attending the event and competing so i 'd like to handle that just by leaving the room thanks okay thanks cancel smith uh item six uh nil public forums and deputations item seven no petitions move on to item @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discretionary fund application rook hampton agricultural show council alan smith councils uh it 's just a process there that this one needs to go through so could i seek a mover in a second move councillor brotherhood second and cancel election we 'll put that those in favor those against carried [Music] mr mayor i would like to also donate 350 dollars for my councillor discretionary fund to donate to the boulder company club and uh i am a member and instructor of that club as well okay so i have a conflict sorry so i think there 's the proposed motion then just leave it as that part and then do the declaration for the conflict so i think it is is that councillor i 'll probably do it for you council smith um declared a a confl a declarable conflict of interest as she 's an instructor at the boulder comb pony pony club and is a member yep and would like the table to determine no i 'd just like to leave the room okay yeah declarable could be perceived so that 's when if she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conflict of interest and then whether or not she can stay or go um stay or go at this stage she said i 've just got a conflict of interest which is declarable and it 's left and counsellors sorry mr may the reason for council smith putting it in so early is there 's a jim khan coming up which that money is to go towards yeah otherwise it went through the normal process and the council made the determination at the time councillors there 's a [Music] motion there that approved the donation of 350 uh to the boulder county and pony club move councillor fisher seconded councillor kirkland i 'll put that those in favor motions carried invite councillor smith back in uh councillor kirkland okay record that do you record the way they voted as well so that was uh unanimous okay offices reports 9.1 developments incentives for the emergency health aged care central queensland council future is it no no no i think greg 's online there mr mayor yep uh thanks greg yes uh mayor and councillors uh thank you and good morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's under an older development incentives policy but uh it uh it is now a complete project uh the mata mercy health and aged care centre queensland uh it was for two floors of oncology and cardiac ward that was constructed uh um i have been having oncology treatment there for the last that 's removed that 's the same as any other person of the community same eligible okay thanks sorry greg back back to the report please thank you mayor councils so this uh this was a second application uh that we are only assessing the second application here the first application was a much larger development application it was rescinded and this is the second application so really it 's the it 's reducing the infrastructure charges under the policy from 133 399 down to nice round number 66 699.50 okay thanks greg councillors any questions to greg with regards to that report if not seek him over in a second i move councillor smith second and councillor kirkland i 'll put that those in favor oppose carrick unanimously thanks to councillors moving on to 9.2 the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sports club incorporated councillor smith no that 's all right we 've you 've done the conflict thing mm-hmm alicia did you want to speak to that report yes thanks mr murray just briefly so councillors this is for the alton jones hollow crossing sports club they 're planning to hold a queensland polo cross challenge on the 3rd and 4th of july within their application they 're suggesting that there will be 300 players 400 horses and 800 supporters of which about 500 people should um stay for the duration of the carnival or three nights it 's recommended councillors to provide sixteen thousand dollars um for assistance for this event and it 's been a number of years since they 've whole have held the event but my experience with apollo cross is that it 's very well followed so happy to take any questions mr man uh council wickerson as a portfolio chair do you want to speak to this thank you thank you mr mayor look i i support the this application but i just wanted to ask probably through you to alicia all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it are anticipated attendance figures do we ever go back and get some documented data did they actually get the 3 000 people they thought and do they split up and it 's as easy as collecting the postcard as they come through the entrance gate are they locals or are they visitors because the amount of spend would vary a bit like rocky natch or whatever locals won 't spend as much because they 've already got a house and food here but just to go back and get some of that data because i imagine a lot of these people will repeat they 'll be back next year to get some support if they are getting the figures that they anticipate to get well that 's great you know we want that but if they 're not well maybe we need to reconsider and yeah it 's it 's probably um part of that workshop that we will be talking about the whole formulation i don 't think they they do currently but it 's it 's prudent that we investigate that going forward i don 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onerous on somebody to be able to do that and provide that back to justify the um in the first place and then that gives a bit more base and a bit more um decision making process going forward with other applications so uh the true benefits so just to add to that mr mayor they do have to acquit that money so they have to demonstrate the expenditure that has been occurred and with that they do provide um i guess some information on the success or otherwise of the event what we don 't do is necessarily ask for hard data around that so that 's something that we can certainly i think that 's what councillor wickerson was looking for the hard data to say that the exact numbers and postcodes and so forth so uh again that 's probably something we can workshop and develop going forward thank you thank you council wickerson councillor rutherford um mr mayor i 'm happy to move i i understand the point councillor wickerson 's making and i think it 's something we need to look at for every event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy to um to to do that when we get to the workshops um and delve into it but this is a really good event and i think it 's a an event that represents the diversity of our community you know we have a large rural sector of our community this is something that um is dear to them um and it does have quite a following and i 'm happy to move it okay thanks cancer rutherford uh have a second ah councillor wickerson we 'll put that those in favour emotions carried thanks very much councillors we 'll invite councillor smith back thank you it 's we might need to get a turn style there it 's going in there it as we go uh we 'll move on councillors item 9.3 the community assistance program major sponsorship for motorcycling queensland uh again alicia would you like to speak to this please thank you mr mayor just briefly so this is foreign event councillors that 's on the 23rd and 24th of july um it sounds like councillor mages is much more familiar with this type of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solo inside car racing um the i guess draw card for this event is that we 're expected to have 3 000 attendees from all over australia um so it would bring that huge visitation to rockhampton which is what we 're seeking with funding this event so happy to take any questions or even council maters might want to share his experience with the sports councilman with any pearls of wisdom no pearls of wisdom look it 's it 's it 's a motorcycle racing or solo racing has been a long-standing thing throughout the community and i think you probably already read it 's the oldest standing track in australia that we 've still got here so there 's a lot of heritage to it um going by the the previous um meetings that i 've attended uh the 3000 attendees will be stretched i don 't think they 'll get that that many but it 's still it 's still a very good uh event for the uh community i believe that 's okay thank you council wickerson no no comment okay uh council seeker mover in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second and councillor mothers we 'll put that those in favor opposed union of saints councillors merchant is carried invite councillor rutherford back to the meeting russell 's getting he steps up today thanks council rutherford item 9.4 regional arts development fund 2021 round two funding recommendations uh is this alicia um just defer to john but we also have a query back from one of the questions that were raised yesterday about one of the reception recipients sorry so i 'll hand over to john okay thanks alicia thank you john good morning good morning through the chair can you all help me yes um so what we have here is our typical radar funding report with recommendations from the selection committee on which applicants should receive the funding and this is round two for 2021 um so the team who put this together with louise hales our supervisor for major venues recommends that council approve the following applications for funding from the regional arts development fund museums and galleries queensland where the grant 's going to be used towards the cost of bringing museum and gallery professionals to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elizabeth simard the generations of men exhibition and screening showcases local history landscapes and soundscapes for six thousand four hundred veronica zeal the artist is creating an immersive light experience as part of exhibition conference for the opening brockhampton museum of art for ten thousand just skipped to the rockhampton lapid club to engage rod beady to teach the craft of opal cutting and polishing to members of the club for 2316 and then nellie lovegrove to work alongside children of different ages in a workshop series to develop a mural for the grace near scouts hall building for 10 840 before concluding it 's worth noting that nelly lovegrove had applied for some funding previously and that was contingent upon her from receiving extra support she was unable to do that during the covert period um she maintained those funds and then when this next round came through another application was was put through for a different project the funding amount is being deemed to be the same and so rather than the money going back out and then going back in it was reassessed and happy to recommend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the report is it 's a really great um diverse range of projects which is being uh we 're recommending at the moment so thank you thanks john i have questions council wickerson then councillor kirkland council wickerson thanks mr may just to read about what john just said uh to highlight the diversity of projects that 's not all just about painting for example so the first one is more of an administrative thing to make sure that the uh where as central queensland were involved in the review of the museum and gallery standards so that 's important to be in the grassroots of how we how we manage that industry but also a film production about a men 's business which is good to see you see men 's mental health is probably forefront on in many minds at the moment so that 's good uh but also uh the mural from nelly on the the scout which is good to get kids involved in that and the final one there which is seems to be out outfield but not really because it 's in walter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them how to cut it right across the board of art and culture which is is what we 've tried to do with the assessment and also that there were seven applications uh and two of them didn 't quite meet the criteria so we don 't just take all comers there is a selection process and we screen those and as a panel we assess them they go through again you 're right it 's quite a diverse range of different applications and that space uh councillor kirkland um thank you mr mayor through you um ieco absolutely what councilor wickerson has just said i 'm more than happy to support the recommendation i do just have a question i 'd just like to ask through you mr chair uh john if you could explain what happens with that leftover 809 how that works thank you yes through the chair there is a process where we can have um small short response grants and interestingly the rat of funding actually goes from august to august so it 's a little bit strange from that perspective so that 8 000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be delivered in the meantime and then normally what would happen is if there 's any funding left over the half which is councils would just go back to council and then we would make an application to the state government about what we do with those remaining funds sometimes i ask them to return or but that small amount might be they may elect to allow us to just roll forward into the next year but there is still certainly uh abilities to disperse those funds within then without in the funding period thanks john thanks council kirkland councillor rutherford uh thanks mr mayor i 'm still a little confused um about the nelly 's amount so john um through you mr medjohn is that two projects now no no it 's one project the initial project which was a much larger mural project which she had requested we didn 't account the radish did not give all of the funding for and the asset the advice that was given at the time was if you 'd like to do this greater project we 're able to give you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll need to try and find some other funding and support my understanding that the artist was in the process of doing that during that period um and she was unable to do that during i guess what happened with from a covert perspective and so at the time i understand the way i understand the process is that she then identified a different project and the decision was made okay hold those funds applied for this different project which is a smaller amount overall of what she was hoping to achieve and then the um and then rather committee would assess whether that 's appropriate and not and i 'm quite confident that if i 'm very actually very confident if this second project didn 't meet the requirements you 'd either be but not not proceed or would be asked to return some of the funding so that 's the way that that happened so how much money in total has she received for this project noah you said she was allocated money received it and and held it yeah it was the amount which is about pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the exact figures in front of me sorry just through the chair i can um confirm it 's exactly the same amount councillor rutherford so she was allocated 10 0840 in the last round which she 's kept hold of so she is applied for the same amount but a completely different project and now that it 's been approved so that saved the administrative side of it as well so is that returning and reissuing so is that nearly 22 000 all up no no it 's only one it 's just a roll over two different projects so the other project didn 't happen um she would have been normally had to return that back she but she 's applied for a different building similar to sort of thing but a lesser of a project and the committee have assessed that amount so it 's the same amount just the one time so then why does that affect the total if that money 's already basically been expended why does it affect the total now oh i 'd have to report back on that whether or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first round or not so whether we 've doubled up you 're right but it 's only one amount that we 're paying forward to her okay thank you okay get that uh get that answer on notice counsellor okay council no further questions can i seek a movement in a second or with regards to this one move councillor wickerson second and councillor kirkland i 'll put that those in favor against carried unanimously thank you councillors we 'll move on to the next item nothing infrastructure planning and regulations rockhampton planning scheme minor amendment oh sorry did i jump on specialized supplier sorry i flicked clicked through on my thing 9.5 my apologies again alicia is or john yeah i think when you just skipped mr mayor that john has accidentally got off the webex he was going to do this one but councillors this is just a report in terms of the specialized supply with the rockhampton regional libraries and the system that runs there it 's part of our format i suppose in terms of we can only go where there 's a limited number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say like a number of quotes so this is the process that we go through i 'm happy to take any questions no it 's reasonably self-explanatory in my apologies again flipping over that uh thought item counselor fish is happy to move can i seek a second uh councillor wickerson we 'll put that those in favor as against carrie thank you now moving on to 9.6 where there 's myself and councillor kirkland have a conflict so i 'll hand over to the deputy mayor to share the meeting while we deal with that matter okay counsellors um who have we got online too oh cameron oh call me old-fashioned uh across to you cameron um to just talk us through this amendment thanks uh thanks uh deputy mayor and good morning councillors um so the the report is in relation to a minor amendment to the rockhampton region planning scheme this is something we 'd like to do sort of an annual basis as you can appreciate the schemes now five years old going on six years old so as part of the contents and as legislation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose of this report is is to resolve uh to amend the scheme undertake a minor amendment to update the standards in the scheme such as australian standards or updated legislation to also include inconsistent development applications which must be outlined in the scheme and also to include ministerial designations as well so the minor amendment doesn 't result in any policy changes in the scheme itself it just simply up is simply updated and recognizes new legislation new australian standards inconsistent development applications that have already been approved by council and also approved ministerial designations as well any questions counselors i think cameron oh council smith so with the inconsistent um decisions so are we saying that they weren 't uh in there before no no sorry for the chair uh we do have some in there now we 're just updating that now so what we 've done in the past is when we do a major remember the scheme um we 've actually included a lot of these minor changes in there as well now we we 're just doing minor amendments as sort of an annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some inconsistent development applications we just need to incorporate the the last couple of years of inconsistent applications okay council wickerson thank you mr acting man [Music] schedule five cameron i wasn 't quite clear why those four projects uh are included i know what they are but we have other other major projects what is special about those for that they come under that schedule designation of premises for development yes under schedule five ministerial destinations they 've already been approved a ministerial designations so in all planning schemes they must reflect those ministerial designations so those four we 've obviously got some already in there okay and now we 're just incorporating the new four that have been approved in the last couple of years if i could probably to help the councils if i put through the chair is that these approvals have overridden these the underlying schemes yep um requirements so this is actually coming over the top of it so that was so that 's already what 's happened and so that removes the way what was in the old scheme so i understood yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so schools have a number of ministerial designations they sometimes don 't really impact on our scheme whereas the alcohol and drug rehabilitation that would have been an underlying um open space zone and effectively that approval comes over the top of it we take it away so action to go back and tied it up yes you don 't go back yeah okay understood thank you council rutherford mr deputy mayor um it 's just curious more so than anything given the planning schemes a living document and legislation does change and things change why and not not by our making why do we then have to go out to advertising every time that happens i understand for a major amendment but for a minor amendment when it 's it 's driven by other levels of government um why is there requirement to advertise so through the chair there 's no formal public consultation for minor amendments is simply resolve and publish it in the the public knows the public gazette so there will be no formal public consultation for this so it 's really just about advising that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any further questions no further questions all uh i seek mover and a second uh move counselor mathers seconded councillor smith uh and i should have as the portfolio chair should have automatically uh went to you councilman mathers so it 's been moved councillor mother seconded councillor smith all those in favor and that 's unanimous thank you within the minutes we 'll record all the names karen yep thanks council fisher we 'll move on to the next item on the agenda is 9.7 summary budget management report for the period ending the 30th april 2021 and hand over to mani as uh as we understand we 've been working through the budget and uh and where we 've been so uh i 'm sure we should all be pretty impressed about what 's uh what the situation is but i 'll ask manny to read the report and seek any questions after that thanks manny thank you mr man good morning everyone um so we 're reporting on uh the budget figures for um first of july through to the 30th of april 2021 and the results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operating revenue is currently sitting at 92 of the budget predominantly because of net rates and utility charges private works and recoverable works are at 89 of the budget due to higher bulk water sales and timing of works done by the civil ops team for main roads grants and subsidies contributions are behind budget we 're waiting for our financial assistance grant to come in before the end of the financial year as that pre-payment has arranged a year on year that 's what happens and interest revenue is ahead of budget at 92 percent as well we 're looking at expenditure being around 77 percent of the rise budget so we 're tracking well in that space contractors and consultants are only sitting at 71 but we 're expecting that some of these works will be completed and paid before the end of the year so that will no doubt increase asset operational is at 77 due to the lag in timing of billing for things like electricity cleaning and security costs admin expenses are sitting a bit lower than anticipated um at 60 percent due to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which usually occurs in the may june period so we 'll probably see that being picked up in this month and next month our total capital income is sitting at around the 76 percent of the revised budget and capital expenditures at 59 um our capital spend saw a reduction as we 've discussed at our budget workshops of only 4.9 million spent during april but we are seeing that really bumping up during may with our actual costs at present and what we 've already looked at our total investments are sitting at 74.8 million to the 30th of april and total loans are at 121.3 million we are in the process of as we 've already discussed with council um reviewing a high low at a high level our monthly bay monthly budget um for may and we will bring that to council in june for a meeting for adoption but it is at a high level mainly to look at our spend on capital and um whether there needs to be adjustments for carryovers generally speaking we 're seeing a little bit of change in our operational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks money again yeah that capital one we could um we 'll we 'll watch that one and see where that goes to uh to see where there are any carryovers are required counsellors any questions to manny with regards to that i 'm sure we all should be very much abreast of what 's uh what 's happening with all the workshops we 've been undertaking uh throughout the weeks and months it doesn 't look like there 's any questions from the table manny i 'm happy to move um the recommendations seek a secondary cancel election i 'll put that those in favor as opposed emotions carried thanks very much council fischer 's leaving the meeting on item 9. uh cancels the item uh housing constructions grant program draft amendment uh again mani would you like to speak to that report please thank you mr mayor so in the absence of damon we 're just reporting on changes to the housing construction grant program this was previously introduced by council and provides payments for approved applications upon completion of constructions of new homes to the 30th of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constraints that the construction industry locally has been facing and other circumstances which are impacting on the delivery of payments by the 30th of june 2021 and we 've presented an amended policy to reflect those changes and to actually keep up with what have what 's happening in the local industry probably the key aspects are is that we what we have seen are a number of houses that haven 't reached completion that were that made application for this grant and won 't reach completion by the 30th of june so as long as the crux of it is really as long as the base payment for the construction of that property or house is done before the 30th of june and evidence is provided of those applications that have already been submitted council will um is amending the policy to reflect payment for those for those homeowners for that five thousand dollars each so really that 's effectively what the change is um and how we 're administering it there 's been quite a take-up um you will see that council received 185 applications for for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been finalized we had 41 that were either ineligible or refused a number of them were signed up when they weren 't actually purchased or hadn 't purchased the land and then those haven 't been transferred as yet so they won 't obviously meet the criteria that we need and there 's about 37 applications remaining so that 's what we 're dealing with at this point in time before the 30th of june um we are seeing of those 37 there are still 12 that haven 't actually been transferred so we think that they probably won 't be eligible either so we 're probably around the 25 properties that we 'll be dealing with under this change to the policy thanks very much money again fantastic proposal and and really hit the mark about what we were trying to achieve with that but this is just wrapping it up and uh again being a little bit flexible with uh with uh the pressures on the uh the building industry at the moment so um moving with the times and uh and wrapping that uh that project up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see that uh that 's where we 're at with that at this point in time uh so cancel the office of recommendation we adopt the amendments to the housing instruction grant policy as outlined within the report i 'm happy to move and seek a seconder councillor mothers i 'll put that those in favor those opposed carried unanimously thanks councillors better go and try and get cancer fisheries in there making a cuppa oh sorry cancer yes elevated music one ended one out balancership now that 's it counsellors are moving on to our next item 9.9 the assistant portfolio counselor appointment uh councillor laxman 's recommendation of cancer actually appointed to the assistant uh infrastructure assistant portfolio counsellor uh councillor wickerson uh mr mayor i 'd like to put an alternate motion to the table if i may yep um and with all respect to councillor smith i 'm sure we 'll do a sterling job in infrastructure i think um on request i think councillor smith would benefit from uh your experience with a long-serving reign of infrastructure just in that transition period i believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i think it was with that intent that we were there to back up uh the chairs of those portfolios with our individual expertise and experience i just think in that transition period because it is a a huge portfolio to look after i 'm sure you do a great job as you did with planning but i 'd just like to propose that that you 'll be appointed as the assistant chair of that portfolio i 've probably got enough and i respectfully probably decline because i have got enough of my plate with other um the economic development tourism area it 's it 's one but also oversight of the whole the whole region one but um council smith did what um yeah mr mayor i didn 't discuss it with you because i thought well you 've got so much to do and being the mayor as well and normally your portfolio is economic development so i was going to include you on in everything i do and ask you a lot of questions but um i i sort of didn 't approach you about it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great role i see now that we have these workshops previously when we had the the committee structure when everyone wasn 't a member on the committee we we did struggle to get an understanding and and assistance but we 're all we 're all a team on the on the workshops now so we are getting a clearer clearer indication so really it 's only a figurehead sort of uh thing to say that you 're an assistant to to these portfolios when we 're all working in the same space and sharing those uh projects and and in discussions so i don 't see this as a really as a big one whether it 's any extra workload or not really it 's just me really a name on a title so to speak so um i 'm not sure cancer wickets i don 't think that and my ability to be able to take any more work on um in that space i don 't think that 's uh that would help in the situation at all yeah if you 're not willing to do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll we 'll um work at that but i see there 's further lights on councillor smith mr may just just another comment um i see the assistant portfolio person um as the one available for media you know the portfolio council was away i remember a time when um i think council official was on uh official business and and the mayor was away and the media was trying to get someone to talk about something to do with um waste oil or water and um nobody ended up doing it so i see the assistant as someone that fills in for things like that and and um and that 's that 's the beauty of it i mean that is a great great option and having that um when there 's cancer on leave or away for for other purposes and that 's that 's you know that 's a an option there with that and i think we 've got a number of assistants throughout the uh the tent council but there 's always delegation that can happen from the mayor 's role as well so if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during that time we can work through it uh i 'll go to councillor rutherford and then councillor latch and council rutherford thanks mr mines a slight side issue and it 's just in the report it says um that um the advanced rockhampton so that sort of advanced tourism um remains the assistant remains vacant at this point in time i just wanted to reiterate that i 'm really interested in that one and it 's just waiting until we saw it through um yeah and that and that 's fine cancer i 've i 've taken that one on board and it 's just a matter of waiting for our direction on where we 're going with that with that space but that 's warranted and uh i do recall that and uh note that cancel election thanks mr bear uh yeah just to further council smith last week uh we had council of fisher philly for me when i wasn 't able to actually physically leave the workshop so it goes to show it does work to have an assistant yep okay councillors can we seek a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommendation move councillor smith second and councillor maida will put that those in favour those opposed carried unanimously thank you councillors um moving on to item 10 notices of motions 10.1 notice a motion councillor drew wickerson review of council uh travel approval process council wickerson would you like to speak to your motion yep thank you mr mayor um i 'll probably go through the individual items there but probably wanted to start off with what it 's what it 's not you know it 's not a travel ban or anything like that we had our integrity workshop the other day and the thing that i took away from that and we all really know that is that every decision we make must be fully informed and that 's sort of a core of what we do so decisions to go away to travel i think really need to come back to the table for a bit of peer review um we 're expecting and i think even by me um you know requiring our staff officers and staff to um to think really long and hard about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i think the percentage of about 60 cut or so to travel really to fit in with our overall ambition to to manage our budget pardon me um so going through these things the first one is that all those decisions to travel away outside the local government area come back to an ordinary council meeting for peer review and decision uh that those um requests need to be supported by some accompanying documentation of what what the true value is back to the organization uh before we travel away and probably the final one there is just to to really consider and if covert has taught us anything is that we can operate our business nearly to 100 efficiency uh remotely so um we webex in to meetings all the time we travel away and then webex in back to this table it can work the other way too we can beat this table and or in this region and webex into these things the way up i believe our core business is here in the rockhampton region and absolutely there are going to be times when we need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will directly benefit our region and of course when that 's justified at the table of course we 'll approve that well there 's one line there too about decisions that have already been made by the table and a great one is the cq rock where council has really decided that we 'll send one or two delegates or whatever it is away those decisions obviously are a preset and that 's absolutely fine so i 'd like to put that to the table with a recommendation that we modify or revise the expenses reimbursement and provision facilities for mayor and councillors policy uh as detailed in the in the recommendation so you 'll move can i seek a second uh i 've got a question um yeah i 'll get a second and first and then we 'll get questions councillor rutherford uh questions councillor smith then councillor yeah so so with our travel amount that 's spent um the the cost of our car you know fuel servicing etcetera that goes on to the travel expense too doesn 't it like is that part of that five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenses so you 'll notice that a number of the councillors have different value amounts for their vehicles at the end of the year and that gets reported in the annual report so that 's not part of that that part there the travel is the actual outgoing expenditure for flights accommodation registry and registrations and meals okay well um can i speak against the motion um we 'll walk further questions and we 'll put it to the formal um for and against the uh councillor latcham and then councillor uh mr to speak against it okay well we 'll wait for the vote for the process question cancer okay through you mr mayor uh i agree in principle i just want to ask the question uh how the amendment would be enforced when between an invitation to an event and the actual event there is no opportunity for a formal resolution around it how you would pose that we would address that would have been deferred to the ceo for an immediate decision or the mayor do we need to include that within the body of this resolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably yeah so there 's normally those invitations would be the region that 'd be the majority of them um yeah they can so if i could just do a little bit of thing the expensive reimbursement policy used to be that all travel except the mayor used to come to the council then that then became to me and that was not probably the best way to administer it for all councillors on the way through um and then it 's well then you 've got this one too as such so i think there 's probably mechanisms that you could actually seek the mayor and say his approval or whatever else for that you could deal with it retrospectively retrospectively it 's always difficult yeah you could do it retrospectively if that 's what council want to do or you can leave it with myself to do i i think perhaps mr mayor that there would need to be some sort of framework around that if we if we 're going to go down this path we need to be very clear on on all aspects of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that councillor fisher question yes uh very much following what councillor kirkland had uh said uh my first question probably to the ceo at the start of this term a number of councillors there were nominated to be representatives on outside the region committees or boards now these boards have meetings across not only across central queensland but across uh the state and sometimes you know is this uh and the timelines as councillor kirkwood said sometimes there you do get in uh requests for uh meetings that are that you are unable to do via skype or those and i 'm talking about my representation with lawmak and those timelines there are very difficult as to to join up with meetings of the council here how and again how how do we take that forward i think if i could through the chair to council efficient councillors i think that that 's probably the finer mechanics i think the first thing is to resolve what your policy position is and then we can work our way through the mechanics of it because you could have you know a definition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel is you can have build that around it there 's a couple of variants that you could for controls you can put over the top of that that would allow some and not some it 's probably down the finer detail that i have to get to but it 's the general policy position first and then i 'll have to work through the mechanics of it then my second question is we approved only just recently the advocacy uh policy and uh which was sort of very much if an opportunity arose that uh council officers the mayor and deputy mayor uh could be asked to attend again that that also sort of falls contradicts or puts that sort of awkwardness in that policy how it again how does which one overrides the other well this policy would override your previous ones that 's yeah and then i 'll have to come back just then say well yeah it 's going to operate goes back to council kirkland 's question and your first one counsellor may i ask um through the chair to the proposal would would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intent of having that extra that oversight i think that 's important and i know with working with a number of councillors that from different councils in the lawmaker area there there is no single policy in any of the other communities but maybe we need to to work through and actually sort of sometimes there we could actually come up with the policy that uh has the intent that your yourself has outlined but could also there we have that input from the ceo and also uh the relevant officers as well i 'd rather get it resolved now in the public space what i didn 't say earlier is the intent that i had was uh and it 's not to do with integrity it 's to do with transparency and accountability uh every other decision we make happens at the table in the full view of the public that we represent um i don 't think it 's a good optics uh to be making decisions that directly benefit ourselves traveling away or whatever on our own and we wouldn 't ever let officers do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an officer was doing that and got expelled for it uh where it should be held at the same standards that we need to and if it 's a good project to do or so a good event or a meeting to attend our peers will obviously support that and away we go most meetings for these formal ones have plenty of notice to come back to the table and if not well then through the ceo we can manage that minor tweaking of it to make sure that we can attend those very important meetings just to have that oversight and peer review could i suggest that um we 'd do a further dot point to the to the item to to include that because that 's a that 's the issue that i have uh concerned with just to for the for the ceo to to give delegation to the ceo should there be something a rise that the policy um the policy may not uh capture yeah mr may happy to do that i 'd need some assistance i think from while they 're doing that i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us actually coming to a definition of what denotes an official official business later on it 's a separate thing you 're right and i think the ceo is developing uh developing that a bit where tickets and events and and uh protocols around who should be attending the mission so that 's another body of work in itself so um separate to separate to this one yeah councillor wickerson that the delegation be given to the ceo to determine on urgent council of travel okay happy with that mr men okay i think that 's a bit of middle ground uh case for those those ones councillor rutherford um thank you mr mayor a little along the same lines as councillor kirkland there about you know what constitutes official travel but also um just some clarification i think this is what council smith was getting at just before in the annual report it has listed our travel expenses and allowances and i think there must be a component of that and i certainly been explained to us in that way that there is some component of our vehicle usage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clearer breakdown of um in annual report or even to us that there 's no easy way of finding what is specifically travel travel expenses um yeah it should all be travel which is your airfares hospitality accommodation registration your vehicle sits over here as a vehicle expense it sits there i 'll double check it yeah because there 's no mixing of that inside of it because we can 't do that no so for instance um last financial year it said i had seven thousand dollars worth of expenses for travel expenses and allowances i didn 't go anywhere that 's right we 'll have to look at that one we 'll take that offline that 's that 's another question so that that 's you know i think that 's what gary smith is getting at it 's hard to see what actually is because it um yeah the only way you don 't know what it is we don 't know exactly what we 're dealing with yeah we can take those uh those questions off offline counselors and work out the the costings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around so before you people go to cq rock meetings that 's going to come to council every time well that 's what this recommendation is saying and excluding the mayor so if the captain if the council official was going to a cq rock meeting that would have to come to council council the third bullet point i think addresses that so anything that 's our prior council approval and security rock is the example that i gave mr mayor that 's i think that 's correct so that 's still that doesn 't have to come back that 's a a pre-existing approval that 's already come to the table for i think mayor and deputy mayor to attend that doesn 't need to come back it 's already been approved by the table so i might travel to cpmg meetings think we 'd have to fix up a few of those things yeah we 'd have to fix up a couple of them but there wouldn 't be many to fix up no because we 've effectively all you 've done is a point i 'd have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointed to those groups and see what was attached to that resolution because i know with the cq rock that was quite specific around the deputy mayor attending where some of the cpmg ones and lawmak ones and other ones were not so specific in relation to what the appointments for and how the appointment is going to be rolled out so i have to go back and check that but it 's it 's good governance it 's 12 months on it 's a good way of going counsellor fischer yeah and i 've actually you 've almost answered my question but yeah it just sort of comes back to particularly where we have been appointed and lawmaker in particular for me is one that at the moment because of the restructure of the organization is taking not only sort of regular teleconferences and zoom meetings but also in person uh uh workshops so um this could be sort of almost like every month you 're bringing a report to council but if the ceo is talking to the ceo ceo i 'll bring a further report back about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be approved by the table and again that would come under that dot point three is what uh councillor wickerson has mentioned i think everything is covered in that and if there is anything that 's outside of that that further point with the delegation be given to the ceo to determine council of travel we 'll uh we 'll pick that up i think it 's a great way again transparency and uh being accountable uh just to make those modifications to the policy as we go forward so councillors will head into the debate properly if uh if that be the case i 'll ask the move with the motion councillor wickerson to speak to it or are you happy for what you 've said previously no mr mayor happy okay do we have a speaker against the motion canceller latching thanks mr mayor uh something just to read out uh to make sure i get it clear so uh i wish to speak against the motion uh of the basis former mayor streelow recognised the importance of councillors traveling outside of the region to learn engage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former mayor streela organised a trip out to carbocal mine to show council support for the mining industry to outline how important it is for our rockhampton region there are councillors who attend the bowen basin mining club lunches in makai each month as a show of support for the mining industry on behalf of rockhampton regional council i fear that any changes to this policy could compromise many years of great advocacy by not supporting further attendance at these lunches it should be recognized that some councillor portfolios have greater demands to travel outside of the rockhampton region in the wasted recycling portfolio there are four lawmak meetings held around the state each year and these require tenants in person only it is the relationships with the other councillors and waste managers formed over that time that enable greater communication of issues within the waste and recycling community to try to offer assistance to work together for a common goal to showcase and recognize innovation this is all to benefit the rockhampton region sometimes attendance at these meetings outside our region allow for new ideas gained by seeing what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cbd side streets of makai the new material recovery facility in cairns allows insights into what can be done when our new murph is being designed sometimes it is unexpected opportunities that present itself that can 't be achieved by being on a zoom meeting for example whilst attending the waste conference at the gold coast earlier this year i was able to network with like-minded persons and met a senior waste manager who kindly invited me to inspect the landfill site in toowoomba it gave me a personal tour around the site in addition he invited me to visit the smart waste transfer station at john darien outside toowoomba he was very supportive and offered valuable advice in my role as waste and recycling manager the best way to find out what is on other people 's minds is face to face rockhampton has hosted many successful events including rocky nets and river festival many of these events would not have happened if not for the unplanned opportunities presented by councillors attending other events outside of our region river festival was sponsored by adani after much advocating in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the policy was to be changed i note that this is council wicked wilkerson 's recommendation not councils i implore you to consider the great advocacy and other benefits achieved by hard-working counsellors attending meetings outside the region and the risks associated with any changes i believe the policy at the moment is fully transparent and it has accountability and as the old saying goes if it ain 't broke don 't change it thank you speakers for the mission council of rutherford um mr may uh council legend this doesn 't stop any of those things that you just talked about um it 's still so we we might just speak to the motion right as an individual if we could please yep sorry that that 's my mistake i guess um yep so this policy still allows for attendance at conferences attendance at meetings um you know council visiting other councils it still allows all that what it does is it is let that happen in a transparent way where we are doing that at the council table that the community is brought on board with that and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ models for our organization you know we know that times are tough we 're trying to tighten our belt in all areas this is one area where we and we have been the staff have been restricted in this area so this is an area that makes sure we 're accountable not only to the community but to all our staff as well so still allowing for travel to other two important events thank you uh speak another speaker against the nation councillor smith yeah thanks mr mayor uh i just feel that a change to our policy will deter councillors from traveling to other areas the fact that it 's got to come to a meeting uh it will probably be to deter people from from even going uh i think in 2012 when i joined this council nobody knew that we were in the resources sector and uh thanks to councillor fisher and us traveling to morning expos and the barn-based mining club we became very prominent and i still remember at a mining expo people lined up to talk to us and we never had that sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a really good position as far as the resources sector is concerned and i just think that would it will deter councillors from traveling outside our region and just the last stop point and i agree with totally with what council luncheon has said uh but also webex and zoom are great but there 's nothing like being there in person and we know that when you 're miles away from the action um you 're reluctant to join in sometimes because sometimes it 's too hard to get people to see you but otherwise you just don 't feel like joining in but if you 're there in person and representing your council things are a lot better and turn out a lot better for our council thanks councillor smith as another speaker in favor councillor kirkland ah thank you mr mayor uh yes i actually think that in the essence of transparency this is actually adding a further layer of transparency to our community it 's showing the community what gives the community an insight to those types of events that we are actually attending they 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events that we are attending as well as meetings that we 're attending that are outside the region in an uh uh advocacy position for them so i think it 's it 's a good thing in that regard i also think that if there is a particular uh function luncheon whatever that is going to add to the essence of our portfolio or other representation that it absolutely will not be turned down at the table none of us are looking to do that however if there are ongoing um casual type functions that we 're going to just for the sake of of that networking that passion of a counsellor i certainly speak for myself when i say this is to pay for that myself if it 's not going to be approved off by at the at the table i will continue to advocate for my community to the best of my ability and and won 't lean on on the council funding to to pay for that if if the need be so i 'm happy for this i think it 's a great initiative and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is really good governance i 'm i 'm in favor of this okay thanks council speaker against the motion council comment not uh not speaking against the oh we 're in formal debate that probably probably not yeah it 's at the mayor 's discretion yeah um look i 'm happy for it i don 't think we 're it 's a it 's a die in the ditch item that 's when we um you 're right thank you mr may i actually commend drew for councillor with us for actually looking at ways that we can improve our transparency um i had a few uh concerns mainly because of sort of some of the appointments that we have in the meetings that are involved in those appointments but i think the amendment with the ceo on those urgent businesses but how that we can just fill in those gaps but one of the things that i take great pride in this this council and the previous councils is that we have gone from being very inward looking to where we have actually made great goals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had to actually travel we 've had to network we 've had to build relationships and i just wanted to highlight just a couple of those really great things that we 've done and this has been sort of that we have moved out of our region in western queensland uh up until four or five years ago very little uh purchasing policy involved supporting rockhampton and central queensland we now have where part of their uh purchasing policy is if they can 't buy it locally in the central west they stick to central queensland first and we actually see now most of the vehicles that are in these regions are actually purchased within our own central queensland region that 's because of that friendship that we 've built up and that respect and that support that is both ways the resource industry is i think is one that we have really made some strides and council smith was right the very first mining expo we went to the mayor of i won 't say the city the mayor of the city said what the hell are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a not a resource center and our comment was very very quick we actually started off as a walk-in walk-out mining town we worked very very hard and the comment as we developed it was if your product is so good and you see the board of directors on the showroom floor that is something there that we 've got to take a stronger look at and we 've all over those times have have participated in that and then even more recently in sort of some of the other areas we 're actually now becoming the leaders in regional queensland in so many areas and a lot of that is due to us putting that extra yards in a lot of it is we 're putting a lot of our own personal time a lot of our own personal travel time and paying for those ourselves but also there we are sort of using uh our budget allowed budget to actually move to those places and i think just having that ability to be able to to just have that transparency i think that that is quite good i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence very few of our travel is actually conference travel which people you know sort of have that negative image a lot of it is actually one uh regional council on regional council interaction it 's actually sort of more working for a better good for regional queensland so i just wanted to make those comments that what i see is what council wickerson has done is actually there something that part of a recording method a little bit more work for the putting together the agendas but i think it 's still going to benefit us we are doing great jobs so yeah just sort of want to suggest this is not a negative but this is something we can make into a positive thanks deputy mayor it 's um yeah i can get those comments i think uh we 're in the interest of time we 've um we 'll go back to the there 's no further speakers i 'll go back to the uh petition um council wickerson to final speak thank you mr mayor just to sum up and absolutely agree with our council officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ networking and functions outside of this region to the benefit of the region and and this in no way is intended to to stop that going forward again as council rutherford said it 's about the public perception that we 're being very responsible with our financial management even though the numbers that we 're talking about for this particular budget aren 't huge it 's a message it sends to the public uh community and also to our staff that we are seriously scrutinizing every dollar we spend because it all adds up um but if a an event or a request to go away can quite simply be justified that there is a true value to the region it will come back to the table and i have no doubt that that will pass through and and will attend to those events so it 's not about again back where we started it 's not a it 's not a travel ban it 's just to like but that layer of oversight or peer review or scrutiny whatever you want to call it over that particular decision just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be good governance thanks okay well i 'll um i 'll put the vote those in favor those opposed wish to record there thank you the motions carried thanks very much councillors and just a good misdemeanor for council rutherford the stuff in the annual report is everything that 's in the expenses reimbursement policy which includes car training travel a whole lot so it 's your entire amount yeah so sorry it was a little bit off than that once a year yes so it 's difficult to work out to keep a track of what 's yeah i think linda and diamond are now sending monthly reports out to councillors yep okay councillors just asked the question so at the end of the day it 's all lumped together about 5 000 our travel and our car two separate matters one is your budget five thousand and the other one is the reporting overview report the council of others that 's got seven thousand so that 's the combination of two of those or three of those or four of those five of those things so that 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of that so everything you what 's you 're allowed on your expenses reimbursement policy goes into getting into that there 's a lump sum council wickerson um miss me just through you to evan is there any way in that public report because all the public will say is the bottom line to break that up uh i had one one year which was a discrepancy and anyone that 's got a an emergency trailer or skate park or something needs to be across this turn and with damon i could work through it but i had a spike in my expenditure when you wondered what this was going on because i had the fifty thousand dollar environment trailer uh and all the costs associated with that and depreciation whatever got lumped onto my my travel as well so just to itemize and that was resolved but just it was hard to track down because even i couldn 't find out what it was so for the public looking at they go oh well you 're traveling all over the world um yeah it 's probably just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the travel of the expensive reimbursement policy just counsellors be mindful of what the definition within that policy is about council business okay just be mindful what 's in there because yeah there 's no there 's no grey line especially with uh with with the current climate with um scrutiny you need to be mindful alert but those uh what those processes are and uh not step outside councils that uh that said there 'd be no further business so i 'd like to thank everyone for attending this morning and uh we 'll close some old general business i thought we would just yes against the fisher i 've got two firstly um with the resolution um on thursday there is the bowen basin mining club meeting in makai do we need to apply yeah so can can we do that verbally at the meeting okay so um i and i think this would be best as a the councils that are attending bomb based mining club uh meeting is being held in makai this thursday which would be the 27th of may this will sorry councils i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government up from the airport so i 've got to uh sorry councillors i think i could deal with that one in line with that thank you for that the last one is i 'd like to actually thank the mayor councillors and all of the council support staff i have never taken a period of time like i had of for health reasons it was something that i think was very needed and i just actually want to thank everyone for their support because uh it was very much appreciated okay thanks very much acknowledge cancer fisher and uh yeah we will and no further questions we 'll close the place of meeting and thank everyone for your attendance thank you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] do [Music] [Music] now that we 've arrived here i would not change

time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to public uh deputations we have a deputations this morning from charlie who 's going to make a deputation on the straw ambassador so we look forward to that and invite we 'd

come september 2021. anastasia palestine 's government has from september 2021 bans single-use plastic straws and plastics in queensland hi my name is charlie and i am part of straw no more i am the youngest straw ambassador in australia i have been part of straw no more since i was six i am now nine years old i did this because of my pet turtle franklin turtles are in danger with plastic straws and single-use plastics why because plastic straws and plastics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i have two questions my first question is as queensland moves to ban single-use plastics and plastic straws by september what is rockhampton regional council doing to assist businesses in making sure they are on board by september and comply and what is council 's policy moving forward if businesses have not complied my second question is has council fought of a system for helping clean up our waterways we walk our dogs on lead and take our own bags to collect rubbish and take it back home to our own rubbish bins has council fought of a similar system to the doggy poo bag dispenser for people to be able to collect rubbish as they walk maybe this could be as simple like take a bucket with you on your walk and then have rubbish bins available as they return the bucket to empty their collected waste into maya asked one thing of you all please think before you drop this means a lot to me and my pet turtle franklin i would like to present each counselor with a few with it and a few staff with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grant council of shane may 20. councillor sherry councillor ellen linda councillor donna karen alicia hey i have to say my wife actually purchased some stainless steel straws yesterday with the brush so very good charlie could we i 'd like to ask councillors to give a round of applause for that deputation so fantastic [Applause] thank you for your time you 're a very confident young lady and again thank you and franklin playing his part i see as well so i 'll just uh i 'll just ask for some questions and uh answers off the floor so uh councillor kirkland that 's the portfolio for sustainability could you um thank you so much charlie for coming out today my name is councillor donna kirkland and one of my roles in council is with the portfolio of environment and water so this is a subject and a topic that we discuss uh quite broadly across my portfolio so i have a couple of questions for you is that okay yeah i 'd like to know what made you decide to be a straw ambassador well when i was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the couch and i just looked at franklin and i felt like he was just nodding his head just saying yes and then i just said yes because i knew that franklin would come all this way with me on this journey i think that 's fabulous a turtle i think i might get one at home to tell me when to say yes or no to some things here um what is the most important thing the most important thing that you think we as a council can do maybe tell the community do something somehow tell the community maybe put some posters up about to not litter like take have some rubbish bins available where people could go down to the fitzroy river have some rubbish bins available and then um people can just put their waste into those bins that is a really good idea so i have one last question what will you be focusing on next once plastic straws are no more um probably to stop the stop the single-use plastics well we 'll be seeing you soon thank you so much charlie yeah charlie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on what our sustainability unit functions are that we undertake through council so it just gives you a bit of a snapshot about what we 're doing as a council for the environment and how we can put in place strategies and programs to be able to help our wildlife and and look after our environment so lisa would you just like to give a quick snapshot of sure charlie and welcome and thanks for our lovely gifts so one of my teams that i look after is our an environmental sustainability team so i 've got a team in there of three people that are just like you completely dedicated to our environment they 've been working with all of the different areas of council to try and make us more sustainable and they 've come up with some great initiatives so one of those things is the plastic free places which they 're working with the businesses just like you say to phase out those plastic straws and plastic plates and all of those things because lots of people don 't actually know what to use differently you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an important step in the process but they also do lots and lots of good things and look after our great barrier reef and represent us and council on that area we look at the waterways the drain bodies and they do investigations of what 's down the drains and how we can capture that litter before it actually gets into our waterways so there 's a huge amount and so we 've really we 've even won some great awards um for our through the lga lgma sustainability awards for some of our things so um and here 's our champion who 's just come in here this morning and we 've got some great community grants as well for community groups who also want to improve and and make a difference so some of the schools that we 're working with they 've um st peters is on the agenda this morning so they 've had some huge gains in terms of some of their rubbish and and changing so i hope that at your school you 've done that initiative as well down there thanks very much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we visited wandel primary school and the students up there were developing an app what they could do to to protect the environment and there were some fantastic options that they were providing fishing for rubbish was one of them and you could could win tokens by uh going on to this app when you go for when you go fishing you could fish for the rubbish and and win some maps and uh uh win some tokens and then if the uh you got so many tokens then you 'd get an opportunity to meet the mayor that was one of the one of the children 's uh prizes i 'm not sure whether that will be uh lighting up for that one but yeah but they 're really uh looking at ways that they can help our environment so it 's great to see our youth and young students in that space but uh again congratulations and thank you for the gift but i 'll have another couple of lights on so i might go around the table i 'll go to council election and then councillor rutherford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks for coming down today and it 's a very important cause what you 're on about so i 've brought my paper straws along the paper ones so i help out a a little tennis club and we 've actually made a conscious choice of changing over several months ago to paper straws rather than plastic straws and like many other businesses in the rockhampton region we 're transitioning to get rid of single-use plastics so and part of that the first strategy was getting rid of your plastic straws and going to paper straws and it 's been embraced by our customers very well they they appreciate why we 're doing it um the other thing is we don 't want to see it go into landfill right so from a waste and recycling point of view we don 't want to see that to answer some of your questions so first of september the single-use plastic ban happened that was instigated by the palestine government and we applaud them for bringing in that that legislation and i guess they 'll be the ones policing it and enforcing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like boomerang alliance who are going around to different businesses in uh in their region and along livingston as well and up along the coast and they 're helping businesses to do the right thing to transition to paper stuff instead of single-use plastics so they 're one company that 's doing really well and there 's been lots of companies and i think the council itself has internally has done a lot of changes so they 've they 've got a rid of a lot of the certain placements where possible so i applaud you for coming down today and thank you very much thank you thanks councillor um councillor rutherford and then councilman charlie i just wanted to say thank you very much for coming and thank you even more so for your passion for animals and for the environment um i part of my portfolio is the rockhampton zoo and i am very passionate about animals as well and i hope that i know you 're an inspiration to other people but i i would hope that other people will take your lead young and old and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lover of our zoo i i hope for the future that zoos and aquariums are not the only places where we get to see and enjoy animals so on behalf of the animals not just turtles thank you for being so passionate um and thank you for coming to share that with us today thanks council rutherford councilman thanks very much mr mayor um congratulations and welcome charlie and parents thanks very much for coming along charlie i just want to say once again thanks very much for your passion um as i mentioned to you earlier i 'm an avid scuba diver and i 've seen firsthand the damage that single-use plastics does in the marine environment and it 's very very important that we we are very careful what we do on on on the ground because everything flows down the gutters through the stormwater drains and out into the ocean so it 's fantastic that we 've got the younger generation you know championing these sort of causes i applaud you for that the other thing i wanted to mention councillor latcha mentioned the meringue um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but i think it 's on monday the 30th of august i 've actually got a forum where they 'll be talking about what they 're doing with single-use plastics and the bands of them and what they 're doing with the with the local pubs and clubs and cafes and that type of thing so it might be something interesting for you to go and do i 've been doing some qnas i 'm happy to fold those details on if your parents would like to take you along to that thank you and congratulations thanks councillor mothers councillor wickerson thanks mr mayor congratulations charlie um if you haven 't thought about what your career is going to be when you uh when you 're an adult maybe a politician or a prime minister or something like that would get its suit very well spoken and again we are very passionate too i 'd just like to probably answer some of your questions as well very quickly as well as our dream buddies program uh council only last year i think it was councillor kirkland installed a bigger version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all about i 'm sure but this was put in on trial so it 's a bigger cage if you like that catches all the storm water that comes out of one particular system of ours and then we look at what comes into that but we use that also to demonstrate to the community because yeah we we partner with the community all the time to see what comes down our drains and if they see what goes into the river first hand it might make them think about what they throw into the road which ultimately goes into the drone so that 's something we 've done but also again on that partnership thing um every year we have as everywhere else does uh big nadox celebration so in the past and everyone probably needed to learn these things but they would have a mass release of helium balloons so around the table we decided uh working with the rumble people at our local indigenous group that this wasn 't a good thing so we put a ban on that but also working with the rumble people so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you like we wanted to celebrate in some way so we swapped from uh releasing hundreds and hundreds of helium balloons most of them accidentally but you know there was lots of them up there uh to tran a plant a native tree in a particular park we 've got so now every year those little kids that started walking a little bit taller go back and they can see the tree that they planted which is good for koalas and good for birds and all sorts of things so we 've just swapped from one to the other and i was very pleased that uh this year when we went tonight not one balloon not even a balloon on a stick which we sort of had is a bit of an interim thing but they 're still not ideal because they 're rubber and there 's a plastic big long plastic straw you hang on to so this year not one so that was quite an achievement of the whole community not just council so part of our job is to encourage the community to embrace all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so again well done a couple more years prime minister for you i think thanks councillor wickerson councillor smith did you want to um yeah i 'm really busy keeping an eye on you 're doing a great job so charlie congratulations you 're an absolute inspiration not only for the younger generation but for us for the whole community and i congratulate you and our turtles are such a beautiful uh creature and uh to protect them like they can 't protect themselves they 've got no hands to pull things off their neck or out of their nose or whatever and i think we just need to stop putting stuff waste around that ends up in the in the ocean where the turtles are so congratulations and i can 't believe you 're so young and you could speak so well congratulations absolutely wonderful so uh thank you for coming today and bringing this gorgeous when i grow up i 'd like to be a marine biologist so i can discover more about animals and help all the animals that are in trouble by all this plastic that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect location up here near the great barrier reef and with the mighty fitzroy river right beside it so it is a perfect environment to start that studies that 's good congratulations and welcome uh christine did you want to say anything from the officer level or be good to wrap up if you like christine 's one of our officers from the sustainability department as a manager there thank you and welcome charlie look i 'm sorry i missed your uh briefing this morning i will be watching that on film a little bit later but uh look it 's absolute absolute pleasure to have you here today and to have our younger generation really flying the flag and inspiring us all about what we need to do here to uh to protect our region and uh really appreciate all your efforts congratulations thank you thank you okay then we 'll uh we might wrap that up and thank you again charlie and franklin you 've done a sterling job my god thank you uh okay council we might resume a meeting council kirkland would you like to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you in a second uh sorry i 'll put that those in favor please carrie thank you uh moving on to item 9.1 the qme 2022 exhibited site cancel any discussion around that one council of uh wickerson thanks mr maynard just to support that um i think with other councils we 've been to a few of these in the past and uh and have done a staff have done a sterling job of setting up a display but to actively encourage a precinct with some of our other um people in the mets industry is is a great initiative to do i think uh the last one that i went to was in makai uh of course that they 're being the host if they get the prime site but they did that uh terribly well they had not only their own council demonstration or presentation but a lot of the suppliers also in that same region all working as a coordinator group so that 's a strength in numbers so i think that 's a good good initiative have we got sites picked out uh through you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks greg threw it through the chair you don 't need the store i don 't think i need that uh yes uh council wickerson at this stage it 's really about snapping up the sites early uh we will get preference because we were one of the uh the site holders in 2020 the cancelled events so this is a bi-annual event and i know we have participated in the past and 2018 being the last one of those so we will get preference on on sites but they haven 't released that it 's more this is an offer to snap it up now to keep it at the 2020 price so if you don 't sign up now it 'll be at a 2022 price one of my memories is i think brazil had a amazing stall there uh were you there for the brazil one i think so yeah oh they were walking not suggesting we didn 't but they were walking around with brazilian wine and brazilian beef on display so maybe it 's a bit of barramundi uh beef or something beer i 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comment mr maggie i 've probably gone back 10 years ago i think we we went up that was my first opportunity to go there and as rocky regional council got known at the expo we were quite busy a lot of people were very interested in what we had to offer etc and i think it 's imperative that we be seen there i think that 's probably a good investment um the cost of it yeah no and i 'll recall my visit to there i think there was a remote control truck with the gia written on it that were very popular with the audiences that they came pass back in the day but uh again look uh okay what council smith was saying here our reputation has grown over the years from those initial [Music] events so it 's great to see that we 're still we 'll continue in that space because i think it 's important with the resource sector that we we support that and we 've been seen to to be in that space where probably traditionally we 've been uh looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mindful that we 've got the resources there as well on our doorstep councillor kirkland um thank you mr mayor yes i think i i totally agree that we need to have uh presence here with this um this function and it what it does is it demonstrates that we 're continuing to be ambassadors for the small medium enterprises and those businesses within our region that are supporting the mining sector so it 's it 's telling them that we 're we 've still got skin in the game and we 're very much interested in representing them to that industry okay i 'm happy to move seek a second uh councillor smith i 'll put that those in favor oppose carrie thank you greg um did you want to present on the 9.2 the bomb uh i suppose i 'm not sure after that last presentation i 've got two mining uh proposals to put in front of council but uh this is the the annual bowen basin mining club launch that uh the bowen basin mining club through jody curry has agreed to have one each year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we 've pushed for that but we haven 't so that 'll be held in september this year and i mean they 've got a lineup of decent speakers that 's good speakers there 's a panel with uh ian mcfarlane from queensland resource council mark scott from hastings deering uh for kesh from tease and jason mccallum from yen cole so it 'll be a good lunch but we need to continue to market it but it is uh it is like that previous one it is continuing to highlight that uh makai isn 't the only resources uh city out there rockhampton certainly is one as well so it 's very important that we participate in things like the mining expo and this mining club lunch and other things and graham shepard and i 've been doing a lot of work with the resources centre of excellence in that same uh same sort of ilk so so this one 's fairly self-explanatory that we sponsor but again thanks very much greg i don 't see any lights on could i seek a mover in a second or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll put that those in favor propose carried unanimously thank you councillors moving on to item 9.3 the black summer bushfire recovery grants you had a bit of questions and answers there yesterday on the um workshop was there any mardi gras martin i think there was a question about whether that we 'd been through to check on some of the smaller applications or liz 's own councillors rutherford oh i just thought that um someone was going to come back with some information for us this morning um about peter yeah about boys i think peter was there but i haven 't uh haven 't seen him he 's not on online that 's probably the size of this through the chair martin here i 'm not quite sure what the questions were i think there were some questions that peter relayed to me in relation to uh the rural fire brigades now my understanding is the rural fire brigades are incorporated bodies so are able to make their own applications for this funding program yeah martin i think we discussed that but i think there was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was happening after those events and uh some of the requests to come through so council peter um we might leave this mata lay on the table till later in the agenda uh and then competed to come back with uh with a bit of that information that we were talking about yesterday if that 's okay rather than trying to uh fill in the gaps it might be better with peter there um i 'll move that we um move this item until later in the agenda seek a second sec uh i think so here councillor of wickerson just wait for uh karen to catch up i moved to council wickerson seconded i 'll put that those in favor oppose carrie thank you moving on to item 9.4 botanic gardens and zoo redevelopment information endorsement so council rutherford did you have any comments on this one to start before we start thank you thank you mr mayor and i 'm excited for the officers to be able to um present this uh um this has been a dream of mine for a very very long time to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start to get some of the tlc it needs and and you know it served our community for a very very long time i think it stands quite proudly as as one of our greatest tourist attractions if not the the best um and i think it 's um it 's timely that we now acknowledge that the toilets are way past their used by state that the kiosk certainly needs attention that the popularity of the zoo um has just grown incredibly and to be able to invest into that um facility uh is amazing so it 's i 'm kind of overwhelmed for it to have got to this stage now and i would like to particularly thank the council table for their support in this and their input over the workshops that we 've had and especially the council staff uh for taking this on board running with it and and presenting us with some really really great high class options um to consider and and be able to deliver for our community so um i i do make the point that of course it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the fact that we have a document now and we have will have plans uh to be able to go looking for that funding um is a long way from where we have been in the past so i will um pass back over to you mr may and um yeah thanks very much councillor and again the uh your passion and drive for for the the gardens and the zoo is um unwavering i think it 's something there that you 've undertaken and it 's great to see that the this redevelopment plan uh at the appropriate time uh with the development of what 's happened with some of the exhibits over the years has really um proven to be a draw card for the region and it 's i think it goes under the radar quite a lot when people are going out and visitors to the town they uh they spread that word uh far and way far and wide and uh i think that 's a testament to the to the work that 's been undertaken by the staff and uh council over that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be putting the rockhampton zoo and the botanic gardens on everyone 's radar uh going forward so uh that 's a great opportunity and one that we can see and develop and in time and this this this redevelopment is really going to allow that to occur so i might hand over to jacob to go through council kirkland do you have a yeah that 's fine we 'll wait for it wait for jacob to get through thanks very much jacob if you could present the report no problem good morning mr mayor and councillor so the report before you today includes a revised implementation plan for the redevelopment of the rockhampton botanic gardens and zoo and this implementation plan has been revised based upon the completion of the concept design that we 've been working on so if you remember in january earlier this year an initial version of that implementation plan was submitted and it included the commencement of a concept design for this for the site we 've now finished that over the last several months and have now updated that based upon a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those workshops and um proposed a priority order as part of that so adoption of this implementation plan really allows us to move into detailed design for what we defined as the initial priority projects so happy to take any questions on her counselor kirkland um thank you mr may yes i really want to take this opportunity to just congratulate jacob and the entire team for what they 've pulled together and presented to not only the council but to the community as far as the processes um and and just the stages and everything has been completely encapsulates everything throughout the the concept design right through inclusive of projected uh time frames from money etc it 's it 's very well done and i hope that this model will continue to be implemented against other projects that we deliver in the future it 's well done thanks jacob and team well done thank you councillor kirkland council rutherford um mr mayor i 'd also like to take this opportunity if i could to um maybe acknowledge michael elgie and the role he 's played i i believe he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ michael as the curator of the botanic gardens was about leaving his legacy as each curator has done for the botanic gardens and he had a particularly tough job in that he had to repair the gardens from cyclone martial so there 's been years of cleaning up you know not just the initial cleaning from the cyclone but you know our trees have been things that trees that we thought would survive that have shown stress and have continued to deteriorate and die and just just major works that have taken a number of years to do so he 's had the hard job of cleaning that up just when um you know it was time to start planning for the future um he 's he 's sort of uh moved on now but his footprint um is in this as well so this is part of his his legacy legacy as a curator so i 'd like maybe for us to acknowledge um the role he played in this as well thanks counselor uh i think it 's been a team effort too i think there 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haven 't mentioned but uh it 's great to see that uh all that work is starting to um to have uh come to fruition and uh with this plan now and uh it 's great that it 's it 's to be staged and we 'll seek that other levels of government support and hopefully we gain that support going forward to be able to implement what those stages are so um that said council of rutherford would you like to move is recommended oh very much so mr mayor very much thank you do we have a second councillor smith uh i 'll put that those in favor oppose carried thank you thanks very much jacob [Applause] moving on to item 9.5 the uh planning and regulation counselor maters did you have anything to do with this one are you right too i 'm i 'm fine for that too officer thank you mr may thanks very much amanda good morning mayor and councillors um the proposed development um that we 've got here is for a material change of use for multi-unit dwellings for 19 units the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ units um all um two of the units will be running penny quick street um the site is located in the low density residential zone and um generally the proposal complies with with the requirements of the planning scheme and was subject to public notification we received no submissions on the proposal therefore we 're recommending it for approval subject to the conditions outlined in the recommendation okay thanks very much amanda councillors any questions no questions uh could i seek a mover in a second or with regards to that one move cancel latching second and canceller kirkland i 'll put that those oh sorry so we might uh we might move on to the next item sorry it was move council election second councillor mathers yeah and it was carried unanimously council might get back to that uh the bush for online sorry christine christie go ahead we 'll keep going and we 'll we 'll get to that in the end of the agenda and then deal with it sorry i 'm all over the place good morning thank you very much christine thank you look this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program environment and sustainability scheme grants there are three applicants for this grant round a total of six thousand two hundred dollars uh including grace mere state school pnc association st jose 's catholic primary school park avenue p f association and saint peter 's catholic primary school p and f association as well mr chair i don 't know whether i 've got a conflict on this one because i 'm working with the grey smear school pnc association for the 150th celebration thank you thanks christine councillor kirkland um thank you mr mayor well i really want to extend to the community to our schools and the organizations and congratulate them and thank them for going outside of their comfort zone sometimes and being the first to actually explore and implement some projects that both teach um and achieve significant environmental economic outcomes and i think that i 'd like to encourage other schools and organizations to get involved in these fabulous opportunities to get grants to to see their projects so well done i notice there 's a a couple there that have continued to expand on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their school i congratulate those schools so i would challenge them to go out and challenge other schools to catch up okay thanks again for coaching council wickerson um thanks mr mayor through you yes also to echo councillor kirkland 's sentiment we 've seen firsthand this morning with charlie and franklin as a backup um the importance of not only leaving a good clean planet for the next generation but me but also encouraging that this current younger generation to do it for themselves so this quite modest sponsorship of those programs will see a whole school uh continue to embrace those values of that we saw demonstrated firsthand this morning so uh you 're happy to support council okay move councillor kirkland second in councillor wickerson i 'll put that those in favor opposed carried thank you christine uh moving on to 9.7 at least yep thank you probably present this one okay thank you um if we could uh councillors as the um presenting or just going to find my little agenda item again just drop below there we are yeah councillors this is the operational plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final report for the year as we 've seen him through there there 's been a number of red dots but those red dots so most of them are work in progress on the way through considering the workload of the organisation there 's a pretty good achievement to go through that those red dots will be completed as we go through and there 's a few delays that through council 's decision but overall mayor and councils i 'm pretty pleased with the uh progress of the organisation the last year and happy that we take some questions yeah no that 's okay kevin is there any workshop yeah that 's right was there any questions counselors on any of that operational guide again it 's uh uh good to see that the the organisation is looking to um those red dots and improving them as we go forward i think it 's uh it 's important that they always have that um target there that we try to meet but uh the workshop a lot of the questions were worked through and uh explained in detail as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through you too evan uh evan thanks very much for the report um i understand you know with the the system we use with the um green dots red dots and that sort of that top thing the only thing that 's a a little bit disconcerting with that is when you see the red dot straight away you know you 're concerned but you know it 'd be good if maybe there could be a little bit of um a purple dot well even if it 's not a different color dot if there could be some wording beside it maybe letting us know that you know this is ninety percent um to be finished or eighty percent um i don 't wanna make extra uh work for people but uh just instead of jumping off the pages all these um projects all and that type of stuff not being finished just give us a bit more a closer idea of what we 'll try and give you some numbers but i preferred actually if we had the blue dots yeah it 's trying for the blue dot i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you okay counselors no questions further questions on that one i 'll move on in a second i 'm happy to move secondary council rutherford i 'll put that those in favor carried unanimously thank you councillors moving on to 9.8 councils delegations of the ceo melissa thank you good morning marin councillors this morning 's report is seeking council 's approval of various powers to be delegated to our ceo a range of different pieces of legislation the first two attachments deal with new regulations that we previously have not been contained in councils registers so those are the land regulation and the residential tenancies and rooming accommodation covert emergency response regulation the next four pieces of legislation sorry yep three pieces of legislation there are existing pieces we have in our register and are simply updated as a result of changes to those legislation and also the conversion of our existing registers over to the lgaq layout so i 'm happy to take any questions questions counsellors no lights on well could i seek a move in a second with regards to the report move council election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor opposed carried thank you 9.9 the summary budget report nice money to present thank you money thank you mr mayor good morning everyone so this morning we 're presenting um two budget management reports for council 's consideration the first one being the period for the 30th of june 2021 so there has been a delay councillors in providing this information to you simply because we 've been trying to finalize our end-of-year statements and get probably the closest position that we can for the 30th of june period so that 's the reason why it 's presented at this meeting and not earlier in the financial year just going through what has been presented you will know councillors that when we undertook the monthly budget review for may which was adopted at council 's statutory budget meeting in june we have now identified that our operating revenue is at 102 of our budget so we were very close to where we thought we may land excuse me for the end of the year so some of the key areas there were fees and charges revenue at 106 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grant revenue was at 109 which was due mainly to our recovery or receivable of the rasi grants and the domestic airport security cost support program that we 've been getting from the federal government as support for the downturn in the airport industry excuse me um so that is really what 's generated a large or our budget coming in over the expected revenue budget for the end of year our operating expenditure was around 100 of our budget for the year which was a good indication of where we went to with our expected expenditure for finalizing the accounts our capital income landed at 106 of the budget review and our capital expenditure actually took quite a large increase during the june period or 15.4 million dollars taking our total to 115.7 million spend for the year so that was pretty good going uh to what we were expecting in terms of where we were landing for the year our investments at the end of june were 88.2 million and our total loans were 147.9 million and you will recall council that we drew down that loan of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well that was included in that balance of 147.9 million so we 've ended the year with a a small with a surplus which we won 't identify as being our final position but it 's a positive sign for us at this point in time that even though we forecast a deficit for our reviewed budget we ended with a surplus any questions in relation to the june figures thanks very much mani uh again as we start off in the new financial year it 's uh early days and um great to see that those the figures are close to where they were uh wanting to be uh towards the end of that financial year uh is that a capital budget record evan did you mention that just before we asked i think i 'm close to 115 million would be our highest capital expenditure ever yeah and that so it 's below what we actually budgeted for the start of the year but there was a few big projects in there so but it 's a pretty good outcome when you look at it for what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh the airport revenue um those figures from the recent um lockdowns and and where they 're at so they 'll come through and at a further report just to get a uh yes they will the next one yes um through the chair that those figures are to the periods to end of june and um there are still um grant funding for the remainder of the year as well so the the dascs grant will actually expire in september but the rasi grant continues beyond that so yeah they 're positive signs in terms of what the federal government is supporting towards council in terms of the operations of the airport and will we use all of that grant money it 's for operating costs so um it 's based on it it 's it 's based on what we what our actuals are uh to be reflected in terms of our operations all right thanks manny um council has any other questions if not i 'll i 'm happy to move seeker seconder uh council mathers i 'll put that those in favor please uh 9.10 again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also is the report to the 31st of july so our monthly july figures based on the 21 22 adopted budget from the 24th of june you 'll note that our revenue is quite high because of our levying of rates during that period and which are due by the 1st of september our and most of the other revenues are below or within budget at this point in time similarly our operating expenditure is sitting below budget and that 's to be expected at this time of year given movement into the new financial year and also finalization of projects and things like that that may impact our carryover budget as well and and things like that that we 're working on currently our capital income is sitting at 11 of the adopted budget and that 's in line with this early stage as well as our capital expenditure being quite low at 2 so our investments have moved to 77.5 million dollars as you would understand you know there 's been a lot of spend that went on through the end of the financial year we do see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that towards the end of the financial year so you would have that 's impacting on our cash and our lines are sitting at 148.3 million so not a lot to talk about i guess at this point in time in july but we 'll see that alter once we um we 're currently reviewing our carryover budget and finalizing our end of year financial statements for 2021 they 're due to our auditors next monday so you know there 's a lot of work going on but behind the scenes in terms of preparing the accounts and getting things ready to finalise 21 20 21. okay thanks very much moaning cancelled any questions early days i 'm happy to move seek a seconder councillor smith i 'll put that those in favor proposed carried thank you yep we might live 9.3 off the table if that 's okay i think 9.1 is it yeah 9.1 9.3 the black summer bushfire recovery grants councils um we might just take any questions to martin and liz oh sorry i 'm happy to move that we lift the matter off the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that that 's in favor post carried unanimously thank you uh liz martin would you like to present that report please uh he 's not there anymore thank you thank you good morning councillors thank you for receiving our report the blackfyre summer grants are available for local governments incorporated organizations community groups and businesses so we 've prepared this report after discussing with council 's departments and these are the council projects that have been recommended to the unit so if there 's any questions um from yesterday please let me know okay thankfully there were a few there and i 'll go to council rutherford and then council smith council actually quetzal rutherford um thanks mr mayor i have a question but i 'm wondering if you 'll allow me to prefer preface um with it i guess where i 'm coming from and when i looked at these uh this lids i looked at fire if this had have been for cyclones any of our other disasters um cyclones floods um the like where you know council takes a very much a lead role in that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right down to um qfs and and our rural fieries and i was just a little concerned that some of these didn 't necessarily put fire as the top priority and i wondered whether we had spoken to the rural fire brigades about what their needs were what their concerns were because i would have thought the first thing that jumped to my mind was the lack of water in those areas and we did discuss an additional standpipe at gracemere but whether more dams or bores would have been a good spend of um grant money to address these this issue so i think my first question is you know in putting these submissions together have we taken on board or did we talk to the rural fairies about what was most needed from them in in their mind thank you councillor kirkland don 't don 't blame her for my words [Laughter] apologies there sorry i 've only got the little screen that i can see this morning oh sorry councillor rutherford um yes there has been and um i suppose one thing that from the disaster uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all hazards approach so when it comes to building resilience and preparing for the next disaster we do reflect of course back on what 's been learnt through the recovery and bushfires for this instance but from the dm arrangements we try to look at all and especially when there 's funding available we look at all houses and how all aspects can build resilience and preparedness for the future events so that 's that probably explains some of the projects that are being proposed for bushfire though because yes this funding is to look more so like bushfires and recovery and what 's outstanding from previous events there has been throughout the the process to develop the bushfire study strategy and mitigation plan there was extensive consultation with the firemen at the ruckington fire management group and local brigades we haven 't had any specific um project phrase for this for this through internal departments but with the brigades they can themselves apply for funding that may not that may not stop our infrastructure but i just wanted to note that yeah sorry liz can i just ask you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um fire what was the group you said yeah yeah so the fire management group management group did that include representatives from the rural fire brigades it sure does yeah it 's it 's administered by kufus it 's it 's a layer under the local disaster management group in the arrangements fire kufus take the lead on that and their key stakeholders are the first officers from the rural brigades through the ibmg we did specifically ask you first to ensure they pass that on to their first officers to seek ideas for projects i guess my concerned concern is we were out at cabra when the fire started to um to get away and everyone took off and the rural fieries were saying they have one point once it gets past that cabra point that there 's one spot there where they can stop it after that there would be no stopping it basically until it hits pink lily lagoons and then would jump across to the airport and the gardens so to me just for my way of thinking it would have been you know was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important that we had extra dams or water sources at that point given that they were so very very concerned if they didn 't stop it they 'd lost it that lost the battle no thank you councillor no they have not raised those specific projects with us but that doesn 't preclude them from the um the doing their own applications though sorry for the those uh rural units that 's true yeah it break and they have for the last rounds of flexible funding they 've definitely they 've definitely applied for such projects building breaks um building more fire lines on property that 's they 've worked with us with with our civil operations when and two we do we do through through peter as ldc we do write letters of support when we 're approached one more question mr mayor if i i may yup um and that is uh our applications in competition with their applications for the funding liz do you get that question i did thanks well yes there 's only 1.6 million dollars available to the rockhampton lga so all projects received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be prioritized based on on the recovery gaps and resilience gaps relating to bushfire from those last events and that 's through that management group though they everyone 's putting their input into that to come up with these we haven 't we did send a media release out to the community to encourage groups to get in touch with us if they would like ideas support um letters of support but there 's only been a couple of groups and none of those groups have been the rural brigades and they do know um i work with them at the fmg so they do know that we are there to support them so i 'm afraid i could not tell you exactly the projects that are going to be submitted and they don 't have to come through us either to get those letters of support okay thanks councillor smith and council election yeah thanks mr man i think liz just answered one of my questions and that was um how how the rural fire brigades are being um advised of this grant and but if we did media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes they might miss it people are busy but if it wasn 't actually sent to the rural fire brigades i think they probably didn 't know about it but i think liz it 's five great projects you 've come up with and just hoping that even one of them gets up um and i did identify it yesterday i 'm just a stickler for correct history uh just in the grace mere evacuation planning it says that the fire started in cabra and it actually started in istanbul locality uh but if that 's a um a set um record of the event well we probably can 't change it but just just you know i thought we just should note it but i think um just talking about fire breaks that council of rutherford brought up in a really really good point there was fire breaks made to stop that fire getting any further than it was at cabra but they need to be maintained every year it needs to be dozed again um i know boulder comb and gray smear do fire breaks and i think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some council funding for the fire breaks years ago and i just wondered if that still happens if someone could answer that question we still from peter mentioned yesterday 30 000 for the maintenance of those but where that 's contractor there it 's not cancelled do that or mixture okay says um you know a fire break in that locality would be all on private land but i think that 's a good point i think you know we need more fire breaks and and sometimes the rural fire brigades just maintain them themselves control lines but then also if there 's a now if there 's a fire there that they can always get that equipment and put a fire break in at those times too so it 's all about that management and that strategy and the planning and that 's where those groups meet together to to coordinate that going forward yeah mr b i 'm just concerned at the moment because we 've had some rain enough to get long grass everywhere but it 's very very dry everywhere it is a concern so thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to clarify the bushfire resilience officer um is that position uh are you making an application for funding for it or is it will this be an expensive council for funding it 's a fundamental just the report doesn 't indicate yeah funding sort yeah 100 funding sort for all those projects listed they 're all funded positions yep and they 're only only for the term of that for that group council wickerson well thanks justin i just wanted to probably highlight a couple of the projects here that i strongly support and that is the resilience officer um and my understanding of that is that that person is a dedicated person to take all the information that we get from previous events uh and to build on that and not only to coordinate that information but to then work with all the local stakeholders and most of those are represented around the table when we meet for ldmg it 's the ses and the police and fires rural and and urban but just to make sure that all the elements of that response uh are aware of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do very well but also just to progress that and probably the most important part is then to work with our community because council and all our agencies are sitting around the table we don 't do it on our own we do it with the help and the support of the community to make us all more resilient even to basic things like keeping your own property clean and tidy in the backyard all goes to towards helping that that response of that resilience to it that 's right reducing those fuel loads around their own properties uh helps immensely so something there that we work towards maybe the next project with the um a response to climate related risk too i think you and i have heard firsthand that um with climate change and whether you deny that we caused it or not it 's a thing but and the end result is that not only the um you know the period of that fire risk has now been lengthened starts early finishes later but the intensity of those uh events not only bushfire but other storms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's what 's predicted so uh to have this officer uh have a really deep understanding of that and then to communicate that to the stakeholders and community is is a great value i think and i think we get some great uh outcomes from it that 's right it 's important and uh coming from where we 've had uh experiences over the last few years the last decade it uh it 's uh warranted uh how we plan for the future so having that officer there to go back over that work and then develop strategies to go forward is where we need uh it 's a great application council 's uh council rutherford um mr mayor i think we just need to be really careful how we do that i recall once um before a company in melbourne had sent invites to us to attend flood um flood recovery uh conference seminar down in melbourne and i wrote back to them and said you want us to go down and learn how to do it i think you should be inviting us down um and actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um to tell you how it 's done and it 's a little bit with fire you know in the rural area i think we need to be very very careful to go out into a rural area and tell the rural people who fight these fires um how it should be done or what they should be doing i don 't think we 're proposing to go and tell them no that 's not the case at all no all right yeah the program is about having officers go out and get that knowledge that they know and build it into the plan it 's the exact reverse it 's about that they 're the knowledge base okay i thought that had already been done i thought that 's we 've been doing that already no there was a consultation after the fire went out in fact with a number of the groups after after bushfire events and that that 's just a part of the process there that happens that uh to gain as much knowledge about uh what event it is whether it 's a cyclone or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that uh are involved in those events but this is more specific about bushfiring in general all right sorry i i thought that had already been done i thought we 'd had a number of community consultations with with um group that our disaster management group had been out there chatting to groups already because they were at um we had men here through the chair could i please add um we have we have gone out to the groups the fire management groups the community and definitely from a disaster management perspective we acknowledge strongly that the fieries know how to respond to fire and mitigate fire one thing that this study this officer would do would be to really take those findings and look at it systematically and how we can really integrate that knowledge that we have captured and better uh better forming our plans and our strategies and and really integrated into what we 're doing because what the studies identified and in you know the mitigation they 've suggested it is a lot of work that 's that 's still needing to be done um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the first officers and the kufis uh paid staff for one of a better way to phrase it but things like that you know we we are supporting um how that happens and we we would value an officer to enable that okay thanks move council smith seeker seconder council kirkland i 'll put that those in favor i suppose carried unanimously thank you councillors uh moving on to item 10 10.1 notice a motion notice of motion councillor shane latcham northampton regional council floral emblem can we have

[Music] okay uh good morning councillors good morning staff and uh good morning listeners look firstly i 'd like to uh open the meeting and uh for this special meeting that 's been called today uh i 'd like to pay acknowledgements to country i would like to begin by acknowledging the traditional custodians of the land in which we meet today the rumble people and pay my respects to the elders past present and emerging i extend that respect to our neighbouring aboriginal peoples within their local government area the gangaloo nation people the bharata kabul bara and yadamarala people and also acknowledge the torres strait islander people whose land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in aboriginal land thank you councillors uh this is what we call about being nimble um we had our council meeting on tuesday but there 's been an opportunity or an issue that we need to uh call a special meeting and uh hence uh the men being called this morning um i 'd also like to declare any uh conflicts of interest if there 's any uh anyone have any conflicts um we had the report sent to the councils sorry yeah there was a report attached to the agenda like yesterday sorry brief report did would you like some time to to read that report okay um council we might just take 10 minutes for cancer has any other counselor have anyone else read the report that 's been provided sorry councillor smith i didn 't um wasn 't it yeah just give a minute there for that um again it 's uh part of those times when you need to need to act swiftly in the opportunity that 's been written that arose from this uh this request that 's come through so the report was developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heads up we had a great youth sustainability cq sustainability forum at the central queensland university this morning with all the schools in our region fantastic roll-up 170 odd students and we were posed a series of questions and had to had like a q a with the students so they were really fantastic and councillor kirkland uh we put on the spot in the spotlight but i think it was really great hearing the enthusiasm and the stewardship from a lot of those school leaders uh really positioning ourselves well into the future but what we 're doing as a council really was able to be highlighted through that uh through that forum as well you have council matters yeah mr maddie monitor asked was her was there a bit of a theme with the questions that the students were asking as in you know was there a certain interest that they were um it 's it 's about sustainability um and where where council was going in that regard uh and it 's a it 's a long journey and one that we we 're embarking on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what cancer does in that space through our recycling programs and uh yeah that 's all i actually meant in the questions they were asking you know where more the questions about solar energy or about recycling or about or what you know yeah a bit a bit of everything everything yeah from you know there were serious questions we had over six uh speakers there um the state government uh nick from the university uh professor clump uh being able to ask a few of those uh questions and different uh different levels of government and what other organizations are doing as well but um hearing about what the schools can do as far as their recycling programs what we 're doing with their solar renewable energies uh and also what we do at the landfill third bin trial those types of things and plastic bands and as in plastic and single-use plastic bands and also our balloon balloon program as well so when you 're ready council smith to step there um you can let us know we 'll uh would you you were right councillor smith okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd or greg did you would you like to uh to speak to the report and we can take some questions from their counselors morning and councillors uh yes the short notice uh these sort of events uh come along from time to time uh whether they be nrl events or others uh it is a matter of things moving very quickly so hence the short notice this opportunity came across the table in the last 48 hours and we thought it was worthwhile at least looking and running by this this chamber that 's for sure from from a an event point of view the nrl is now locked down in sydney as i 'm sure you 're all aware uh sorry the nrl players lock down here out of sydney so all matches are now being played in southeast queensland or townsville uh the annarella are looking to look after the regions and visit the regions but there is obviously a cost associated with that so they 're currently dealing with we believe with about five regional cities uh for several matches um you know so we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rob crowe through the qrl uh and uh made the approach to sort of to see if we wanted to be a part of that uh the league 's club came on board to underwrite the event which was really positive uh it meant we didn 't have to underwrite something which uh which takes a lot of the risk away uh becoming a sponsor uh say takes a lot of risk off of our hands that 's for sure so it 's all a moving feast at the moment the dealings with the with the nrl and also in a bidding war so i suppose as a sponsor of a larger package being put forward we want to give the lease club the brown park trust and the qrl and the capra has enough surety that we would either be in or out as a sponsor of a potential event from an economic benefit point of view it 's hard to quantify an exact economic benefit on this one we don 't have a lot of data on it in our hands uh there could be a potential sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a five times multiplier as well so you know it it certainly but for us the bang for buck is credibility we 've been we know that uh several people have chased nrl games here before it 's certainly something that you want in a queensland regional city to give you a profile it 's national coverage well actually in some cases international coverage uh with the foxtel coverage that we 'll we 'll receive as well so the cost to this event and i ask that we keep the the number that is quoted on there the two hundred thousand dollars we keep that in confidence at this stage uh because we do not want to uh sort of get that number out there and jeopardize anything the nrl are doing um as well i just asked that from that point of view it 's it 's a public meeting yeah okay i 'm just i 'm just throwing that out there i 'm not saying you have to keep it in conflict i 'm suggesting we keep it in confidence that 's right and i was i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's for sure so but you know to from a bid point of view uh you know that they we will only be a sponsor of this event we will provide that sponsorship is the recommendation uh we will run the ticketing the management of ticketing through the pillbeam system as we have in the past and we will uh talk speak to alicia this morning uh we will take a service fee for running that as well so the in-kind is really running the ticketing but we 'll take a service fee off that it 's only a small service fee but it 's uh something we do with all events taking a service fee through a ticketing system won 't be a large large fee but to what the costs are along the way and then obviously advanced rockhampton will run the marketing uh from our city and region point of view not the marketing of the event per se but the marketing from a city and region point of view uh if you if you give me the authority to go forward and negotiate a complete uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that it 's it 's the cross integration with the nrl and how we join in with their regular major sponsors and how we might be able to get some ground sponsorship which then obviously gives us more and more coverage on tv along the way from economic and social benefit obviously there is that profile it 's another significant event for us in the city for our residents uh if we you know if i had to put the finger in the air and test the water probably about 20 visitors we feel uh so that you know with a target of 5000 probably about a thousand visitors to to the region for it that 's a thousand direct ticket holders we would see there might be associated people that come just to be in the city at that event so i suppose i 'll leave it there because the report does speak for itself but i 'm really happy to answer any questions or at least the ones i can in in what were the discussions we 've had so far yes and thank you greg it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over two days uh and again we may not have all the answers uh to some of those questions off him but as time goes on if we 're supportive of it then i 'm sure we can get those answers back to uh to the questions back to those answers back to those questions so uh i see a number of lights on uh so i 'll go to those questions first and then we 'll see if we can answer those uh councillor smith then council robert councillor smith uh yeah i was just wondering um the other hundred and fifty thousand who picks that that tab up is that for other sponsors other sponsors um in local sponsors or could be anybody yeah we we don 't we 've been asked to for our um level of sponsorship in this uh to make up their component of it but there are other corporate sponsors in uh the the operations as well there 'd be ticket revenue that come back in to cover some of those costs from the other that other component of it so um we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can mean for our region um as similar we do with other events that we we sponsor as well so second question uh through the chair the 5000 patrons is that is that as much as um the brown park will hold is that did it that 's what they 're telling me that that 's that 's that 's the um with the code and what they they 're happy to to work with is five thousand at this point so they 're basing all their assumptions and they 're planning around five thousand uh ticket sales so they believe that they 'll be able to achieve that uh council rutherford uh thanks mr mayor and acknowledging that um covet is changing on a daily basis um right around australia so that that will happen i guess um in a whole parallel world i i suppose um for want of some words to put around that but just looking at this aside i think it 's a great opportunity i was interested but as to some of the games are free to air and some aren 't do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be free to air no we don 't uh council we we would obviously target one that is all on free to air in foxtel but again it will really be determined on what games are available and which one we can actually win for the right price as well and you know say we 're only a sponsor but for them they 'll be looking at that price if there 's one that 's worth this much versus one is worth this much they might forego that so there 's no guarantee of that it 's a bit uh against other other uh cities at the moment so we 're putting our best foot forward with regards to that being part of that uh sponsorship to to see if we can get a game to uh rockhampton region thank you thank you uh councillor kirkland then councillor mathers yes smart so just to clarify the 50 000 is going to be additional monies taken from the rest of the budget added into advanced rocky 's budget or is it coming out of the advanced rockhampton budget and i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other advertising that you 're wanting to do the cross advertising for example you said uh signage at the field and that sort of thing um in addition to that fifty thousand dollars what would the estimation costs be and are you taking it from somewhere else yep sure question one uh at this stage it 'll come out of the advanced rock hampton budget and then reviewed at the next budget review okay so at the next budget review it could become an additional cost it may not but that 's something that we 'll review in the future so we have to review all events from that point of view uh question two uh the marketing money is just a diversion of our next month 's marketing money uh towards this rather than where we might have been going with our explorer accounting campaign we 'll change it over to make sure it 's targeted to the right audiences for this one so we would have spent that marketing money somewhere so this is diverting it into the markets that might complement what is being done here so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for future reviews or now it will come out of the current marketing budget just a diversion to the markets required uh i don 't have an estimate on that but as i say it said it 's our regular marketing budget thank you councillor mothers uh thanks very much mr chair i think uh councillor kirkland must have been uh listening to my thoughts [Laughter] see that bubble uh okay look uh again council i think it 's a great opportunity one that 's uh developed rather rapidly and uh a councillor rutherford you 're right with the covert um unfolding it 's it 's something there with all the events that uh they 're managed and through state government i 'm sure that the anna ruled nrl wouldn 't uh put any risk around uh their future um competition and uh i 'm sure they 'll be covered off if if such a proposal was uh was to be successful so uh i think the benefit to the to the region is is finally getting an nrl game here we 've tried many many times to to achieve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's one that we it 's just been that goal too far but if there 's a perfect option uh coming forward and ability to be able to do that i 'm sure our community will will welcome that with open arms and uh and vote with their feet and get those buy those tickets as quick as they can so i think it 's a it 's a great opportunity one that we can promote the region as an nrl possibility into the future we just grow that population and then start to achieve the achieve what we 'd like to go from there so i see more lights come on so i 'll go with councillor kirkland i think yours thank you yes i echo your sentiment it is something and this is uh we all know how much rockhampton loves football and i 'm sure that that there 'll be a take up as you say voting with their feet getting in there and buying those tickets that 'd be great so just on that um is there an exclusion of local purchasing of tickets or is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the rockhampton people purchased the team again yeah that 's that 's too early and as a sponsor we 'd um and i 'd go through vance rockhampton and greg and um to to give those answers back uh at this stage it 's very early and as a sponsor rather than an organizer we probably won 't get that answer until um until they 've really gone through all the if i may have leads into that then leads into my my main question which is around covert of course and around whether we would be a magnet for potential um breakout of covet by bringing people up from seq and the concerns of the community really around that so would we be enforcing any extra mitigation measures too same as the same as any events of the show that we 've had um previously it 's it 's all queensland health and uh you know we 'd be guided by their their instructions and they 'd have to be a covered safe plan in place to be able to held a function like that so we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocky river run all under the cloud of covered and uh this i don 't see this any different uh if there is um anything there that 's required uh queensland health will will allow us yeah give us plenty of ample time for the event to proceed or whether it doesn 't yeah excellent comment and really good for the community to hear that that 's great thank you okay thank you uh councillor maters and councillor rutherford thanks very much mr mayor yeah i was just wondering obviously it 's probably too early for us to know what um day of the week the the competition or the or the game might be on but i was just wondering once again it 's just a little bit of forward thinking but it you know i 'm wondering if we were lucky enough to have something towards a weekend or on a weekend whether we could uh actively try to do something else without within the city to try to keep the people here for an extra day or two you know i know it 's short notice but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel about it yeah just to try to keep the people okay again um yeah great question i think uh what we 're what we 're looking at is we 're putting a bid in and uh that that 'll be subject to what what uh what the what 's available there and possibility through the nrl um but i 'm sure greg 's already thinking about that overnight uh about what other options we could uh we could add on and greg did you want to make it certainly councilman so you know i know what 's happening in the city over this next month uh that 's for sure so uh i have preferences for for dates of games in mind and i 'll deal closely with them on that as well when they 're making their decision uh to make sure there 's some steer them towards where we 've already got things happening in the city and really creating that and and also you know they 've all all set as well is working with local hospitality groups to ensure that it becomes that larger thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the hotels and the restaurants and such getting involved as well so you know a challenge here will be a short notice gain and and it will likely be that uh so it that 's why the answer to the ticket question and the answer to this is it 's how much we can do in a very limited amount of time but i think i think once you announce that that you 've got it in a game i think a lot of people jump on it very quickly and i think we can create a carnival type atmosphere as much as we can in a short time period anyway uh certainly my preference game which i put out there here uh we already have something planned right on the next day so i 'll leave it at that sorry to be that cryptic but it 's certainly uh if we get that one uh you will have a very busy weekend where we wouldn 't have normally had a busy weekend yeah no that 's great to hear greg thanks very much just you know if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and clubs as well so yeah thank you thank you thanks councilman council rutherford um mr manchester uh i your words around the covert and the assurances to the community um you know that this is something that we queensland health will obviously keep a very close eye on and and um of course with lockdowns the way they are i think um what gave me a little piece of mind with this is that it 's 5 000 maximum you know and we 've had vents far more than that in a less controlled environment um rugby league is such um we are so passionate about rugby league in in this central queensland community that i would think that 5000 tickets would be snapped up fairly quickly by locals um in any case if that 's um if that 's how it happens so um i think this is a wonderful opportunity to bring something very special here um for our community regardless of you know normally we we do events that we hope will put bums on seats on airplanes and fill accommodation and everything else and while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about bringing something special for for our local community yeah you 're right and i 100 endorse i don 't think uh just in the history of rugby league and rockhampton and some of the fantastic players that have been able to produce from from our local talent pool uh is something there that um we 've always been asking for an nrl game to be able to come and support and i think this great it 's a great opportunity to uh to achieve that and recognize some of those former players and the players that we 've currently got in the nrl um through it through an nrl game here where it 's competition points and i 'm sure you 're right those tickets will be very hot property once they go on sale so fingers crossed that we can achieve something but this is the first step on that on that journey so um councillors i 'd like to move the recommendation if we don 't have any other uh questions and uh i 'd seek a second uh

morning uh i 'll open the meeting and i 'll start by acknowledgment to country i 'll acknowledge that we meet on the uh traditional custodians on the land in which we meet today the rumble people and pay my respects to the elders past present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peoples within their local government area the gangalu nation people the brada cabalbara and yetamarala people i also acknowledge that the torres strait islander people whose land is in the torres straits but who live and work on aboriginal land thanks very much councillors present we have uh in attendance councils we also have apologies and leave of absence from councillor sheree rutherford and councillor grant mouthers who both apologies uh for this morning 's meeting council 's item four declarations in matters on the agenda oh sorry in my leave of absence councils i 've come to the uh the hernia situation and uh booked in to have some surgery uh next tuesday so i 'll apply for tuesday wednesday and thursday next week if i could get a movement in a second for those three days uh moved uh council fisher and seconded uh councillor election guess what i 'll put that those in favor suppose there 's probably not much choice in that one unfortunately uh uh but thanks very much for that so uh i 'll hand over to the council official in that uh when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little chuckle out of that one council but that said um we move on to declarations and in matters on the agenda cancers no declarations uh move on to item five uh business uh outstanding lifting matters from the table uh councillors this is one uh matter that laid on the table the report to be dealt with uh this morning that the following matter be lifted from the table and dealt with accordingly and that 's a financial sustainability and budgetary issues councils i might um with your approval leave that matter and adjourn the meeting and have a have that because we haven 't got a full compliment and it 's important that we have all the counselors in uh in on this discussions and uh adjourn the meeting until monday this coming monday uh to to be able to deal with that the other councils that apologies this morning have uh asked if we could do that because they believe they need to be here while we 're doing those those discussions so um so we 'll deal with the other matters uh today on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meeting and and deal with uh this this item 5.1 probably if i could be best if um if you 're going to go down there an adjournment yeah you would actually lift this matter up off the table and when you come to whatever the section is 6.1 then make a call on what you want to do there okay got it we 'll cancel we 'll uh i 'll take a move in a second that we lift the matter off the table council kirkland and secondary council smith i 'll put that days in favor emotions carried thank you did we uh okay well now we 'll put that in another one and we 'll move on councillors as i said we 'll we 'll uh deal with that matter as we go later into the agenda but we 'll move on to officers report uh 6.1 the council decision-making structure so put a hand over to you ross and uh one please thank you thank you morning councillors this report before you is something that we have had some very minor discussions about but something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readjusting our portfolio information session briefing schedules the schedule we have set for 22 is um quite intensive even though it it does blend a lot of formula and form meetings together as we 've now heading 2022 we have found that there 's a lot more issues probably on our plate uh councillor 's plate than um was probably thought of back in september when we last when we adopted this schedule so what we 've we 've put in a couple of options uh mr mayor but we have recommended an option there um but one of the um one of the outcomes of it is really for council to look at more on the strategy look at strategy outcomes advocate advocacy more on the behalf of the region and communicating with the with the community as well we only focus on those bigger issues um as well as some of the other things that we are working through as we know we have issues to work around um the certified agreement negotiations the mount morgan waters northern suburbs and covered finding issues just to name some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the program so to try and make better use of councillors time and offices as well rather than being in the um in here so much when we do come together it 's it 's working together more on those issues we mentioned just before um so um mr miller i have recommended um that we go to a committee stratform or community structure the last thing we want to do is take away the importance of the portfolio structure it 's quite important um our reference to that is that we would really like and i know the portfolio counselors do work now with with managers and general managers but to really focus in on that for their day-to-day operations to really have that um yeah where it 's if it doesn 't need more or further or there are specific items that can be you know dealt with through that issue as well so um the recommendation i 've put to our draft terms of reference there as well uh mr mayor for both the committees that we recommend and i 'm not sure whether i haven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mayor are not having one 's living as it is the element is not having a community structure at all just having council and a strategic workshop every every week i 'm not sure that would be as successful but i 'm sure we can make it work um so they 're they 're the key points on it 's um i won 't rabble on too much more about the report mr mayor what 's in there it 's been pretty well laid out but i 'm happy to take any questions and evaluate a bit more if we go through if we like yeah okay thanks ross thanks for the uh the report council has any questions to ross on that one i think we 've um we 've spoken about it at the workshop we 're just keen to hear if there 's any um any cancers or issues there council wickerson oh thanks mr mayor i think when we chat about the other day when we 're looking at having a more strategic meeting initially at least while we get through our current situation and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that i thought that was our discussion in any case i think when we i don 't mind the look of the the two standing committees as we 've got there but i wouldn 't mind like we did when we we got rid of committees the first time to maybe come back at a set period of time and and review that there 's there 's not that um check and balance in there and that 's the thing that i was thinking cancer when maybe we uh after the budget 's handed down then we we we do a review uh of the structure and and see how successful it 's been if it 's like a trial and er and see if that 's um needs any work on that so um is that uh that appropriate counsellor yeah uh councillor fisher deputy mayor and then council smith councillor fischer thank you mr mayor i was actually going to ask for a third dot point on that same line that a review uh be conducted i was going to say after four months which would be around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so i 'm happy to uh either set a timeline or after development just nominate july 2022 yeah after the uh the budget delivered uh the july period i think should be uh sufficient cancer i think we 'll um aim for that as a at the target councillor smith was that all kind of that was it oh thanks to samantha 's probably just a comment that i think anything that makes us as a board of directors more efficient like our operations is good and i think you 've picked the two like communities that 's our community and everything they use and infrastructures like 90 people drive on a road nearly every day so i think that 's the two important ones um to be you know yourself as chair and the whole council involved yeah so i think i think it 's a great idea so i 'm really in favor of it you 're right i think it 's a better use of our time in offices time as well uh councillors if there 'd be no further questions could i take them over in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smith second and councillor kirkland i 'll put those in favor opposed motions carried unanimously cancelled so we might um we 'll go back to that other item if that 's okay um we don 't need to move into closed session on this one evan we 'll just leave that one um it 's really up to the council mr mayor to do what they want to do here they deal with the matter or not deal with or adjourn the matter to next week any procedural motion is a just a mover no debate straight to it so um okay cancel i 'll test what i 'll move that we adjourn the the budgetary uh component of this meeting until uh monday oh sorry the monday the uh 7th of february um at 9 9 am uh and secret seconder second councillor fischer sorry a procedural don 't need to just i 'll move that up i 'll put that cancels those in favor those opposed emotions carried thank you uh councillors if there be no further items on the agenda i 'll [Music] closed captioning not available

that those in favor against carried unanimously thank you councillors uh item 9.3 the black spot funding application 2022 23. uh stuart are you would you like to present that report it 's got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one if that 's okay thank you microphone sorry sorry about that uh the funding is 100 um funded um by the state fair or by the federal government um and so it 's a good opportunity for council to rectify some of the road safety issues in the region just before you go on could you just repeat that the first part about the crash um oh yeah yep so the black spot program funds intersections that have three or more casualty crashes in over a five year period and the treatments proposed have to have a benefit cost ratio of greater than two so that 's generally and and set treatments that are proposed to mitigate the particular crash types that are identified at that location in 2122 so this financial year we were successful in obtaining funding for upper dawson road caroline street to convert that to signalized intersection and some intersection treatments along waterloo street at stewart street and robinson street so proposing some compact roundabouts there for this round the 22-23 year we 're proposing four projects as i said before one of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and canning street intersection so it 's sort of a two intersections combined there and aiming to remove the right turn out of derby street into upper dawson road and formalise the intersection arrangement at upper dawson road and canning street so over those two intersections there 's been six crashes at derby street and three crashes at canning streets a total of nine over the last five years in that particular area so the treatment that 's proposed there in that attachment one seeks to to formalize those intersections and just remove that key conflict point coming out of derby street and and i suppose take that movement away because the way it sits it has sight distance issues there for vehicles making that right turn so the proposed cost associated with that it 's 818 000 the second project is east street stanley street um so there 's been a history of six crashes there in the last five years and we 're proposing to construct a single lane roundabout so similar to what is at derby in east street there to mitigate the through-through crashes that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we 've got a derby in east the issue is there 's sort of wide carriageways and each street thinks it has the priority there we have done some previous black spot works there in 2013 i think it was but the issue sort of still remaining there so the thought is that the roundabout solution will sort of alleviate that issue and force everyone approaching the intersection to give way the bowl 's over and stanley street is the same crash profile essentially it 's had four crashes in the last five years and we 're proposing the same treatment there that roundabout treatment um so to mitigate that now the roundabouts have been designed to accommodate b doubles because stanley street and boles over street are b double roots so similarly to the roundabout at eastern derby it can accommodate a b double to make the required movements there so those two intersections are a million and ninety four thousand and a million and eighty three thousand um each uh and then the final one is a resubmission from last year um to improve some curve alignment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there this one 's a proactive one so it 's there 's not a great crash history associated with it or sorry of injury crashes there are some reported sort of property damage ones but it 's supported by a road safety audit and really highlighting that that curve at the bottom of the jump up 's a bit too tight we 'd like to sort of widen that out and improve the super elevation there so the cost of that project coming in at 715 000. so they 're the projects that are proposed i 'm happy to take any questions that the table might have okay thanks for the explanations um i 've got a couple of lights on so i 'll go to council wickerson councillor smith and then councillor kirk and councillor wickerson um thanks me just a few questions for you about upper dawson road derby street and upper dawson road canning street to some comments and questions around that uh will this new design allow for uh increased traffic and heavy traffic if um if we have another flood and upper doors and roads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair it still allows the movements from upper dawson road on to derby street as per the diversion and the works that have been proposed there can still accommodate those b doubles in the event that there is a flood and that 's the highway traffic 's diverted up on the upper dawson and the same goes for that the left out from derby into upper dawson so we 're really just removing the right turn when people turn right to go into dan murphy 's and so as part of that we 've also given them a right turn off upper dawson to counteract i suppose that movement 's been removed okay and are you getting rid of the right turn from upper doors and into canning as well said that early no so that that right turn will still remain um until such time i suppose that it starts to cause dramas at the moment it 's um still performs well that right turn out um and so we 'll sort of keep an eye on that if it does sort of cause issues over time we may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that right out of upper doors and indicating is fairly low um and so we 'll we 'll sort of keep an eye on it but at this stage it still can be done safely so we 'll leave it in for them for the minute okay so so just the right turn out of derby into upper doors and fur yes and formalizing the writing from canning into upper dawson some can again double doors yeah so just having a proper turn lane so at the moment it 's just wide um carriageway there so we 'll actually be marking a right turn lane from um canning into upper dawson i 'm just wondering about the impact on on that business then a fair few customers that would come that way that 's sort of the only way to get into the car park there for dan murphy 's yeah so from so that um so ford dan murphy 's and the allenstown plaza there 'll be in those attachments at the back there you can see we 're providing still a right turn movement into the allenstown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losing any access it 's just that rather than turning right from derby street into upper dawson and then left into the car park they 'll come if they 're coming from the north they 'll go canning onto upper dawson and then turn right in from that location so there 's no no impacts to their access and we had sent that concept through to charter hall who owned that dm murphys and allenstown plaza and received some in-principle agreement for the design that 's proposed so yeah and probably just the final one um we can 't give too much detail on this but the the smaller roundabout that goes into allentown plaza probably like the big big car park um is always a bit of a problem because there 's no holding distance once you get off the road and people back up and it always blocks that off at the worst times in future there is there any chance that that could be changed whether that 's exit only is there any discussions or that might be offline yeah so that 's something we can discuss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into that area and that i suppose those three intersections together and here we can make some improvements there and there is some possible solutions but yeah the issue is that if they don 't have that storage facility when you come off the roundabout into the car park so if someone 's backing out then it backs right out yeah so yeah there are some things i can talk to you about okay okay that 's good thank you council smith oh yeah thanks mr chair i think they 're all great projects especially the stanley street one because it is so wide and i go that way all the time when i exit here if i 'm going home and it 's um you know trying to get across there is sometimes a bit bit hairy i just wanted some more explanation on the razorback radar and that 's probably one council of rutherford is inquiring about two the razorback oh okay um so it 's it 's the slight term before you you go up the rise is that what we 're wanting yes because i was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know wait area now on saturday i was going up to mount morgan and i pulled over there there was a water truck going up the road and a car right behind it and of course the truck is just creeping along they 're in extra extra low gear probably and another two cars come along they actually had a weight on the road beside me and i thought oh god no one comes and crashes into the whole lot of us there 's only room for a car there yeah um that the the pullover you 've got before then is really great uh lot nice and long and sort of wide but i realized you 've got limited room to put more pull over there but i just thought i was i was quite worried on saturday and i 'm running in a car i 'm not in a truck yep okay um so we 're just widening i just wanted it more it 's really hard to see on the map so we 're just widening and taking out some of that bend yeah so through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the razor back there predominantly they come down at a bit of a higher speed and then they 're going into a tight curve and that curve also has adverse super elevations so they tends to run them off into the embankment there rather than allow them to sort of take that curve better so the proposal there is to sort of um make it a bit more of a gentler curve as you come down the hill there and provide some widening and a bit of drainage works there as well we looked at there 's sort of one part of the larger part of projects for that razorback jump up but we focused on that one because it sort of represented the highest risk for vehicles to have a crash but also noting that yeah as you come the other way heading up the razorback there 's a lot of issues associated with heavy vehicles trying to climb up that steep grade there as well so we can have a look and see whether there 's any provision to provide a little bit of additional lay down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job should it be successful okay and just one more uh just um a comment uh i know we 've got to go on crash history but i 'd like to fix things before this crashes and a few things i 've ever pointed out and oh no we 've had no crashes there or no fatal cultures or what especially when it comes to main roads you know when we i can probably clarify that there was an accident there i was up with the water meeting and came down that the bottom of the razorback and there was a car in the embankment at the base there 's been quite a few there and he 'd just taken his eyes off the off the road yeah so this is not that location oh no i 'm just generally talking about other any places you know you see that it 's dangerous and people know it 's dangerous so they slow down and then you put it in as a as a you know a suggestion and they 'll say either council or main roses say well there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not wait for the crashes i know that they go on crash history to um to give us the funding so just to comment so through the chair there is sort of two elements to the black spot funding so there is reactive which is yeah where we do have a crash history and then proactive where like you 're saying where we 've identified areas that there is a safety issue and potentially we can put forward for those so we are progressively i suppose trying to address some of those where i can 't speak for the department for tmr but yeah we 're trying to address proactive ones where we can but they need to be supported by a road safety audit there 's a bit of sort of work that goes into that but we 're happy to take any suggestions that you might have for proactive ones as we go forward because yeah we would like to submit one at least one sort of every round proactive so that we can yeah try and address some of those ones before issues arise thanks for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their communities about areas that could be of concern councillor kirkland um thank you mr mayor um i just have a couple of questions if i may through so along the lines of what uh council smith has just said stuart can you tell me when we are looking at the reactive um matrix i suppose if you like how do you measure do you measure all of the accidents that have happened how do you capture those ones that haven 't been reported by police how are you actually capturing the number of because you 're very quite specific with the number of incidents but clearly you wouldn 't be capturing them all is that assumption fair yeah so through the chair the the funding is based on injury crashes so where i suppose police have been called to the side and there has been some sort of medical treatment so whether that 's minor medical treatment hospitalization or fatality so that 's where they draw the line on the funding as in terms of those crashes we at these intersections we go a bit further i suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of go to police and ask them if there 's any additional crashes that haven 't been reported but as we said if police aren 't called then there 's no record of the crash occurring so on some of these if it 's property damage you know fender bender that necessarily isn 't reported on any system anymore it used to be back in 2010-11 but now it 's sort of not reported so it 's hard to to capture that data and it largely becomes a little bit anecdotal as to whether there 's been crashes and issues associated with those so unfortunately i suppose we have to run with what 's reported and if we do get concerns from the community sometimes that bolsters these applications if we 've got requests where people have said that they 've had a crash and things like that we 'll use that to bolster the application but for the purposes of the funding it 's related on injury crashes rather than you know your property fender bender type ones but where we may have a lot of those complaints we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we may then go into a road safety audit where there 's been a number of complaints but no crash history associated with an intersection okay well that illustrates that the emphasis is back on to the community to make sure that they 're bringing through reports of of incidents either by way of snaps and solve or you know just that they 've witnessed a vendor bender as you call it and that will bolster these types of applications moving forward um mr mary if i may my second question is around uh denison street i was surprised there to see stanley street and bowls over the street when myself i 've witnessed a number of offended fender benders or recorded incidents even so we 've done some work on derby and a number of the intersections there on denison street have you had any feedback about the effectiveness of of the works that we 've done there as to whether it 's actually improved the conditions is my question yep through the chair i wouldn 't have the figures on me at the moment but there was some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether there was a reduction it 's important to note i suppose that the treatments that are proposed have a reduction factor they 're not going to 100 solve all those solutions so the way they 're calculated and the way they calculate that benefit cost ratio is on a reduction of the crash type so the percentage of it happening so it 's a treatment that might be proposed 100 eliminate the risk there but it will improve it but i haven 't got the figures to to have a look at those ones along denison street but i know that derby and denison is still very much on the radar with regards to crashes along that area so it 's one that we are considering for next year because there 's a couple of other projects that tie into it that we want to make sure that we sort of get whatever we do there doesn 't preclude other work that 's happening in derby street but that one 's very much on our radar but we were made aware yesterday i think there might have been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that i don 't know whether it 's reported but we 'll sort of talk to the police through three years and try and find a bit more information on that i think the community will be pleased to hear that stuart that that section is on your radar and yourself have witnessed a fair bit of carnage along there just in the last couple of years and so i 'm sure i 'm not the only one that 's seen that that is it for my questions thank you mr mayor thanks councillor coachman councillor rutherford um thanks mr mayor um i 'd just like to raise the westwood hall exit onto the cap highway it 's been raised numerous times over a number of years now it 's a bit of a tricky one in that we don 't own the land but we do have a public toilet and it is promoted as a rest area um the traffic um is growing all the time the speed is increasing even though there 's been a request to have the speed limit decrease through westwood but there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side of the road which would have been prior to that somewhere you could pull off if you happen to have been leaving and go oops there 's a car coming and and you could pull to the side now there 's trucks um parking along there also that creates a vision hazard but really it wouldn 't take a lot of money and i think as far as black spot it would tickle the boxes i just don 't know about any accident um statistics there but for really the the small amount of money it would fix just to put some bitumen so people weren 't coming off gravel trying to accelerate on gravel onto a highway that is increasingly busy you know i think it 's certainly worth it might be one that sorry cancer might be one that we can do through the 3e committee rather than trying to seek black black spot funding for it there might be a couple of options um to see if it 's that warranted that it needs to um needs to be elevated there yeah through the chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could just put forward to tmr to do the work rather than trying to apply for funding but um um it 's been knocked back it has by tmr because it 's trust lane so that 's the problem it just keeps it just sits in no man 's land and the fact is that yes it is trust land but we have a public toilet there and we are promoting it as a rest stop yeah it might be the three-year committee by the sounds of that then if it 's not tmr just push back on it then it might be one that um goes through the three-year committee then we 'll uh get some resolution on it from there or direction and then um give a guide to where we 're best to um try and seek the funding for that one i 'm happy to follow that up cancer rather than i think that because if it 's a rest stop there 's there 's some other funding that can go towards rest stops and things like that as well so we 'll seek to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come and talk to you later about that yeah stu i i have a question on the um bolts over and the e street roundabouts um more the bowls over one with the heavy vehicle yes and would the pavement be increased as those roundabouts are installed you tend to see with heavy vehicles that there 's a rut created if the pavement 's not heavy enough and will that be improved there like the pavement improved at a roundabout considering that it 's a heavy vehicle access to the rail yards yep so through the chair yeah the in the estimate for the works there is a dig out and a place aspect of the pavement that 's there so because we 're trying to keep within a certain benefit cost ratio we we 've kept it sort of con confined to around the intersection but yeah we are looking to dig out and replace uh existing pavement there at the intersection because with the design of the roundabout you still have to play with crossfall and things like that it 's easier sort of dig out and replace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the the confined footprint of the intersection we 'll be pulling everything out putting new pavement in so that new pavement will be better than what 's there at the moment so and should be able to accommodate those heavy vehicles that are moving there and then we propose that asphalt surface so that the heavy vehicles as they do those turn movements won 't screw on the pavement too much and cause damage so it 'll be designed there to accommodate the vehicles that are there as that design vehicle okay just uh i know who might say the the work the pressure they put on those roundabouts when they haven 't been upgraded but hopefully it 's successful and uh again i think they wanted with those you know the crash history in those those trouble around about saying okay councillors if they our councillor yeah councillor smith happy to move sorry councillor rutherford further question mr may just for curiosity is there um guidelines about how many roundabouts are too many roundabouts on in an area is there any it 's a bit like traffic lights i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thing it 's just how many accidents and whether the driver behavior is probably an education thing that needs to happen as well but uh through the chair where we look with roundabouts it depends on what the movements are on each of the legs so where they 're fairly balanced we prefer to sort of lean towards roundabouts but also where there 's um you know in a developing area you might consider signals but you know the areas down on stanley street bowls over street are largely developed and there is still industrial growth there but you know they 're not likely to change movements significantly in that area and so then they sort of lend themselves towards the roundabout but also in terms of mitigating the crash types there so there 's a lot of through through crashes so the roundabout sort of forces everyone to slow down whereas a set of signals there 's still going to be a priority movement and so then people are likely to put the foot down and go through and you might have red light runners and things like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a there 's a standard around how close you might have them together but not as how many you might have in a particular area but that would be looked at in terms of travel time and things like that so that inform those sorts of decisions all right thank you thank you seek a second now councillor wickerson i 'll put that those in favor carrick university thanks very much stu moving on to budget governance and other matters 9.4 the bad debt write-offs um thank you manny thank you mr mayor and good morning everyone so presented this morning is a schedule of bad debt write-offs that have occurred through the year or over the last few years the reason that this is only coming to council now for the first time is because the policy was changed in 2019 and there was no presentation of these bad debts during 2020 due to covert and restrictions in that in that space um council has exhausted all avenues of recovery uh for the for the recovery of these bad debts in accordance with the policy and therefore it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try and recover those those costs or those debts that are sitting there thanks manny some of those have been to the collection houses as well without any success yeah yeah okay cancers it 's uh pretty straightforward unless there 's any questions there could i see come over in a second with regards to the move council smith have a second the council of kirkland i 'll put that those in favor against carried uh moving on to a number of noted summations so um we 'll start off with uh item 10.1 notice motion councillor kirkland uh rockhampton agricultural show council of kirkland we seek a mover and a second or with regards to that recommendation you 're happy to me i 'm happy to move it of course and second and councillor i 'll go to the uh mover first councillor so councillor copeland uh thank you mr chair yes look i 've just brought this to the the table for uh to bring to the attention just the fact that as councillors we all should be good stewards of the money that we are spending of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought to my attention that council has not previous well like to uh council smith spoke to me and said that certainly back in 2008 there was some council intervention and the agricultural society have previously run this event and i 'm just questioning whether or not it 's something that council should continue to do and all i 'm asking today is for a report to be brought forward i 'm not saying i 'm against it or for it i 'm just asking for a report today to present to us what the full cost benefits uh cost to the region are and what the benefits are to the region to then have a true perspective of whether this is a discussion we need to dig deeper into as to the validity moving forward of council 's role in presenting our our regional show that 's uh pretty much all there is to it just asking for a report today okay um speakers against council smith yeah just um so obviously a lot of people think that um you know it 's a waste of money and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a report even on the 2019 show i think we just pulled even and i was happy with with that report the problem we have uh is that this table voted to have five dollar entry fee for three years and that was i think that was after the 2019 show not before and that that is the problem because i 've seen the um the girls trying to balance a budget and get some some entertainment uh for the show and it was nearly impossible so we we 're sort of um half the entrance fee of most other shows most of the shows are ten dollars and um pensioners and children five dollars and that would give us a better uh platform to work from and i think when the costings come up you 'll see the income is not there because of this five dollars and hopefully after the next council meeting that will change because i 've got a notice of motion in um but i think the the benefit to the community is obvious and i 've had over the years plenty of hotel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a good event but you 've got the service stations you 've got the uh feed merchants and all these people it 's probably more the motion is more about a report back not whether to have the show or not to have the show and and whether the costings are there wouldn 't wouldn 't you think a report would give you an indication about whether the costings are covering the event but my argument is probably why the show why don 't we do cost uh a deep dive into the river festival all the events that we have why just pick out the show again that 's probably a prudent point again it 's it 's about providing a livable community and some of those things there is no return on that investment i think there 's a um you know the the benefits to the community uh would be the economic benefits in in people coming in and spending money and entertainment and retaining people in this in the region um rather than people moving off to larger bigger areas that have more more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's about being a regional center in in highlighting the importance of that with a full calendar year of events and activities for the for the community to enjoy uh it 's prudent that we we look at air costing so um again i 'm probably not speaking four against it 's just more uh response back to that my concern is to get a report we 're at the end of the financial year i think people are really really busy at the moment and this report could be months and months away anyway and already they 'll be planning for the next year 's show no i 'm not sure ceo that uh we 'll just yeah we 'll work our way through it as soon as we can get it back if it 's parts then it 's probably not a timing thing uh speaker in favor councillor election thanks mr may it 's um i see there 's a great benefit to see a report come back i think any information we can get on on value for money for the ratepayers is a good thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the show is um everyone gave big thumbs up to the five dollar fee they thought that was a big improvement um to the show as well as the fact that we 're now running it or advanced rocky is running on a bit on our behalf and uh everyone was happy overall with with the way the show was running obviously there 's room for improvement with anything but i think this report will probably bring to the table um what what statistics and what information that we can further consider to make it a bigger and better show than than before thank you speaker against uh councillor fisher i 've actually got a comment more than just a question i 'd probably seek we 're very informal debate so whether we suspend standing orders but it might be better to request for a suspension of standing orders okay well i 'll put that to the table it seems we 're in debate can we still do that and i 'll put that those in favor carried okay with suspend standing orders councillor fisher comment yes look it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of some of these [Music] events and agricultural shows country race meetings all of those have an even greater social benefit to the community and if we 're doing a cost benefit we need to look at that as well and the community regardless of what we sort of think a lot of people are doing it tough some some of the families here have come out the other side or through this covet financially far worse off than others and to have opportunities to have events like the show like a number of other uh events does have a social impact on the community as well and you know we 've got to look at the depression and all of those type of things and what that hats is an impact to the community so if we 're going to do a report i think we need to actually have it a little bit far further reaching to actually see what are the the other values because sometimes they you may not make a profit on an event but if you look at the bigger picture the social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great benefit to the entire community council the the recommendation is that the show costings in benefit to the rockhampton community economy did you want to i kind of read that as being more financial rather than sorry it 's probably a little bit of technicality the suspension of standing orders for this type of discussion really isn 't meant for comment or debate or views it 's about obtaining information or whatever else while you 're in formal debate it should remain informal yes so mr uh mr mayor i 'll actually just can i actually ask uh if in the formation of this report that the social impact uh on the computer well we might get back into formal debate and then that could be put to the mover of the uh the recommendation counselor uh that move to go back into i 'm not sure council rutherford did you have a question probably yes i think it is and it 's more um i certainly support the this recommendation i just think that maybe it needs to be a little broader than just the show i think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worries me a little that we single just the show out because we 've done that before we 've singled the show out and looked at it and i think we need to look broader across those events that we are and how much they 're actually costing us um you know because there may be a time where some tough decisions have to be made and we need to be able to compare apples to apples so i just wondered whether the the mover would um consider making it a broader motion to look at um a report for a major event yeah we might wait till in formal um process if that pose that question uh so any other questions in sorry sorry just wonder how do we do that once we 're in formal debate yeah there is a provision to go back there and ask for a change as long as the change is not away from the actual original intent of what the motion that 's been moved in a second it was there that is sorry there 's also nothing stopping from another motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to back in the debate yeah well okay we will resume um the meeting uh and i 'm back to a speaker against the motion so we 've had a speaker to wrap up the motion thank you mr mayor um having listened to to everyone 's conversation um just recently just now uh let 's i would rather stay with the original intent of of the of the motion but add a second motion to accommodate what counselor rutherford has has spoken to i 'm happy to do that and uh i think probably to measure a social impact is is something that 's a little bit easier to say than to do so whether or not we we put that to the council uh offices whether that 's able to be done so if we could stay with the original intent of the emotion i 'm just looking where are we i 'm just looking for it to see it up there and also in response to councillor smith 's objection if i could also say that i believe that this report would would actually help if uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ councillor smith with the fees and and the need to address those and the costings that 's the entire purpose of asking for this report to be brought to us is that we can see whether or not this is something that is viable and is bringing an economic and as councillor smith has said a social benefit to our community the rain reason that i 've brought the show apart from all of the other things that we do river fest etc is because river fest was instigated initiated and run by council whereas the rockhampton show was not and now it is uh the has deferred to us as at the responsible uh party to deliver that and to pay for it so it was originally a community project and now we 've taken that on i 'd just like to establish whether that 's something that a the community are happy with but also that we financially can see that it 's a viable thing to continue or not it 's purely the report process that i 'm asking for today and we can dig deeper into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have we got up there that yep that show costings and benefit to the rockhampton community and i would also like to ask that within that that it 's showing the um in-kind costings as well yeah my intent would be the full full costings that would come through a full report on the do i need to mention that i 'd like to see the unkind costings included in that because i would like to see if it 's not in kind they 're actually cost incurred by council yeah and these are done by the other departments so they 're not in kind yeah so the other yeah that would be so that will capture that we 'll see that in the full report perfect i just want to make sure that we 're capturing that that 's awesome and then does counselor rutherford want to put some wording around i think we deal with this motion because that um wouldn 't take the intent of the motion away so i think we do with that and then if there 's a subsequent motion cancel rather for i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that um for councillors so that they do understand where it 's come from um so i wonder if the mover wouldn 't mind adding the word history secondary to that my intention i would pick that up counselor the full report would include that history for when it failed but when we took over to when we stepped out and we were back in it again because i think it is it has a really very very relevant to bring the discussion yeah okay councillors i 'll uh no further debate i 'll put that those in favor as opposed emotions carried counsellors look uh i 'm hearing from the discussion there i think there 's probably a room now and we need to do some workshops about our budget we 've still got to make some massive savings uh going forward before we even start to think about next year 's budget and part of that workshop we 'll be looking about what we what we currently do and how we can start to put options there so i 'd like to see all those other events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can get a true idea about what the benefits and what those costs are before we before we make it make a decision so i 'd rather see that rather than a motion council rather see that in a workshop and that would give us a full full uh escape scope about what what those costs are and what the benefits are going forward not as this one was a previous committee that was running it i understand that those costs and the history of that is something that we can all do in that report that that 's made public but the other one would be just to look at all the uh all the other events that we undertake and uh information on that through our workshop kim 's little brother thank you mr mayor i 'm happy with that as well i just wonder whether we can also include in that maybe um we some of our events have fallen by the wayside now a lot of that was due to covert but then there 's they haven 't been picked up either and it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick those up or whether they are they 're gone and how we feel about them being being gone so that might be able to be included in that workshop as well again that 's that global global uh picture about where we 're at and through that workshop and what our abilities and what our community can uh afford going forward uh would be the big question gary but uh that said we 'll yeah so the next one would be uh we 'll move on to the next resolution which is uh 10.2 again councillor kirkland with the solo artwork project councillor kirkland i think you 're happy to move i might move it happy to move back do we have a secondary um cancel the motion has lapsed due to the lack of a second ah okay do i get to speak to it at all you need a second before you can um speak to the resolution motions has lapsed councillor rutherford mr may can i call for a report um on on this issue um so there there was information in this um that says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we need to know what that means um so there is a lot of questions that were raised that that this raised um that i don 't think we have answers to to be able to support this motion as it stands so could i please call for a report that looks at you know what the handover of these silos means and then how we um how we assist with our artwork on those silos depending on ownership okay um mr mayor may i interject there just to talk to well we might this is uh alternate motion we might go through the follow-up because we 're in debates can i move that we 'll move and we 'll need to seek a second for that no no no can i move with suspend standing orders uh there 's no emotion that 's there 's no motion that 's uh currently live so just to suspend so we need to have a move it to this um proposal that you 're putting forward uh so you 're happy to move and i 'll seek a seconder cancellation we go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay suspended orders uh councillor kirkland um thank you mr sorry and we 'll just wait for that to catch up okay counselor kirkland thank you mr mayor i 'm a little disappointed that i wasn 't given the opportunity to speak to this particular motion um it 's presented here in writing of course but then uh as councillor rutherford probably just has be careful we don 't go back to the previous movement i 'm just going towards councillor rutherford 's request for a report this motions have been lost shouldn 't this be a general business have we got the emotion lapsed for the one of a second there 's probably nothing at the sorry the hoods with the chair there 's nothing through the ruling of the chair and the table that you can actually accept another motion all the way through okay so we 're in suspended um meeting at the moment and your question counselor is to counsel a rutherford on what she 's hoping that that report would reveal in the event that there was a motion to to accept um to to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a material memorandum of understanding wouldn 't suffice given the discussion that you 're leaning into it may do if that 's what 's going to happen but that doesn 't if it 's if it remains private property we 're spending a hundred thousand dollars of community money on private property if there isn 't something that covers that to stop it being painted over in two years time or or whatever else then we have invested in something that um i should we shouldn 't have so to me there 's just too many questions that haven 't been answered project is fabulous absolutely but too many questions for me remain unanswered that i think can be quite easily answered once they 're asked and then we can make an informed decision i don 't think at the moment we can make an informed decision about spending a hundred thousand dollars on something we have no idea i think even if there is discussions about it being those silos being handed over to council even that is a discussion we need to to have um i i don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying though i would have thought that uh we could have built that into the the existing motion that we would potentially look to having a memorandum of understanding in regards to that specific thing so if you 're calling for a report what else would you hope yeah we 're probably getting into debate again where it 's not in the um intent of the removal of standing orders uh do you want to bring that up welcome to do that in the when we resume yeah am i able to present a different motion then with different wording an alternate motion if you get a second up you 're able to yeah put an alternate to that there is an alive you can have an alternative or foreshadowed motion could be moved with this one so you can actually ask for a alternative motion as long as it doesn 't change the overall original intensive motion you can actually do that or you can have a foreshadowed motion if that original motion that current motion is lost sorry yep council election thanks mr mayor um as i was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behalf of jrt out there at the at parkhurst on the 10th of august i 've actually had a chance to read through my notes on that on that meeting and i agree with council rutherford that a report needs to if we 're going to pursue this a report needs to come back the reason for that is a little bit of confusion in the letter to the ceo it talks about the solos being donated back to the community i think we 're getting into debate again there and this is just you 're supporting supporting the the motion so it 's more this style is just more free open to ask questions about about the it 's just that the intention was back then the council was interested in being part of the decision process to uh to paint the solos was all were explained it wasn 't about whether we wanted to contribute to the project so it 's it 's different from this report that we 're seeing today so i think another report to clarify did they get painted or just contribute to what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably into the debate phase again on that so we might resume standing orders uh can i seek a move and a mover to resume standing orders move councillor smith uh resume standing orders and back into debate councillor rutherford speak to the motion in favor um mr mayor it 's a great project and i certainly don 't have any issues with the project as i said before there is just too many unanswered questions this is a hundred thousand dollars is a huge investment um in artwork and if it 's artwork that 's not protected um then there 's a real risk in that so i don 't see anything wrong with just taking a step back at this point making sure that we have our eyes dotted and our tees crossed with reports from the officers um to to let us know um how how all of these things are going to play out what does it mean about handing them over is it to a community trust is it to counsel who is it actually being handed over to um who 's in responsible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many questions that are unanswered at this point and all i 'm asking for is um the opportunity to have those questions answered and then we can sit down and have this same discussion about whether or not we invest in in the painting of the silos speakers against the motion council of kirkland um no i 'm not against the motion i just don 't know where to go from here so we 'll just full shadow thank you yeah because i 'd like to include in that with the mind that we are actually wanting to potentially sponsor this and i 'm not sure whether the movie will accept that counselor we 'll put that together that changes the intent of my motion that would have to um counselor kirkland would have to foreshadow that as a second motion if this one lapses fail so we 'll go through so if we foreshadow it with with the motion force yet to add into that you can 't the first motion is really the intended in the first motion that was left uh to to bring that back up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why i was shocked when it because it 's kind of yeah all right so can we add into with the movers um permission to potentially put together a memorandum of understanding with council to address questions that are raised during the rep again i think we 're going back to the to the original attempt of the one that that was lapped so i think so mr mayor is there not an opportunity then down the track for us to sponsor it if if if the original intent is for us to support this silo project that was my original intent then what 's the reason i don 't think you 've got that support from the table so then the report is useless now what the report will suggest is what the the concerns are being raised in the second um second motion recommendation to get a report on on the whole project to for the councils to make can i then come back after the report with a new motion which is the same as the original within three months is it i 'm sorry yeah no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lost motion whatever else so if when the report comes back to the council table it 's presented to the table it 'll the officers no doubt will say that the report be received it 's then up to the council the council itself the council table can then put an alternative resolution to that report to say that they either accept it or want to fund it or they don 't want to fund it or they have any principles or support so you don 't have to follow what the office 's recommendation says it 's up to the council table so once we present that report back to the table that report becomes on the table and the council can do with it whatever it wants to do and we 'll still be able to go back to the original my emotions because okay because the understanding you 're giving me there was that originally that we wouldn 't be able to come back to that and i thought well what 's the plan if it was moved in second and it was lost then you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a similar a similar moment because it 's latched because it 's slapped so it hasn 't been lost technically okay that 's a new one on me anyway so uh yeah in time i haven 't had a lap space and then that foreshadowed motion that comes with it so yeah okay we 've resumed standing orders we have a mover in a second or if there 's no further debate i 'll put that motion those in favor those opposed notions carried unanimously thank you cancer moving on to item 10.3 uh noticed a motion from councillor shane latch from proposed travel waste and recycling expo sydney from the 25th to 26th august 2021 do we have a mover and a second with regards to that recommendation move cancel election we have a seconder councillor smith uh any debate i 'll put that those in favor against carrie 10.4 notice the motion cancel election the lawmaker traveled to barcaldon uh again moving in a second now from the 21st to the 23rd move cancer latching second and council of fisher i 'll put that those in favor opposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canceling the official norm lawmake travel to bark haldon have a mover in the second hour move cancer smith second to council election we 'll put that those in favor opposed carried and uh noticed a motion council of fisher developing northern australia conference from the 16th to the 18th to august in darwin that uh a mover in the second move cancer smith second and cancel election any yes cancel a question or um it is a question yep of sorts um i just wanted to ask you councillor fisher understanding your medical um regime as to whether being so far away from home is going to potentially be a risk no thank you that 's actually the reason i came along today just to answer any questions and before i put this notice emotion i actually met with my oncologist to actually ask that very question and the reason why i was asked um alan dale who is the chairman of the northern developing northern australia conference is someone that i 've built up a rapport over the years and worked with uh him very closely to actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on and it was that very much that rapport of sitting down with the committee of the developing northern australia to actually set in place a series of presentations at the next developing northern australia conference to actually have the whole of the circular economy and the resource recovery as one of the key elements and that 's always decided at this conference at the previous conference some of those key topics so mackay regional council put their hands up as to be the host and this would be very beneficial for all of northern australia but in particular where the road map for waste and resource recovery in queensland to be in this place it 's my intention actually to stand down the annual general meeting of of lawmak i 'll my ambition was always to get this new standalone entity up and running and then sort of to stand back and let a new executive take over but this is just one of those last little pieces and prior to leaving i will actually have resubmit a um a certificate there that allows me to go i have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going through these various cancer journeys working with council 's own health officer there that we do have a i think it 's a work work uh medical work form within council yeah so i i 've kept that you know i do break it every now and then sort of come into council meetings when i should be on leave but i just thought i 'd just explain that uh with this and um my role wouldn 't be as intense but it is sort of very much to to actually a bigger picture and a directional picture for uh the whole of the resource recovery and moving that forward so if you 've got the best minds in the country being able to talk at an event in this area we 're only we 're all going to benefit thanks against official counselor kaplan thank you thank you for your response to that counselor um i would add just further i 'm very concerned of of you being away if there were a lockdown or something like that and and where you would find yourself and bearing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here in rockhampton i applaud your your make being a part of bringing that to rocky but also uh your aspirations with the circular economy and everything absolutely uh agree that you should be a part of that um they did have zooming sessions uh i noticed that the whole thing was covered remotely um i i 'm not trying to to to say you shouldn 't go i suppose i 'm just asking have you made sure that you have considered all the other options uh rather than putting yourself in a position where you might be locked out and needing health treatment yes um can i yeah yes actually they 're had a very long discussion not only with my oncologist but also they had spoken with [Music] various people within darwin and also the uh the actual oncology practice they actually have a branch in darwin as well um i i know that there 's another event coming up in brisbane that i just don 't think i could go and just want to sort of be very very careful where where you can go and where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approached and i also have a number of of uh close friends in darwin as well so it 's not like you 're just going to a place that suddenly land in sydney you know no one it is someone there that there is a very good circle of people that i know don 't expect me to to be doing 12 or 15 hour days at that i think that 's something that this won 't be but it is very much a very focused delegation to make the very best for the future but i old dogs do learn new tricks this one this old dog just takes a little bit longer to learn those tricks uh council wickerson uh thanks mr chair probably along some of the same lines just wanted to clarify something and i think it might just be a typo on page 50 of 54. we 're talking about uh the travel expenses being covered by lawmak and i 'm very pleased to see that it says that the conference is covered virtually but this is suitable for lawmaker delegation should that be unsuitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenses about halfway down so so there is that virtual component but that was deep down unsuitable for lawmak delegation or i just wanted to to clarify i 'm sure i read it somewhere that it was unsuitable and then yeah it might be nice to yeah i thought this would be but probably the other thing is if you 're there representing uh lawmak more so than rockhampton council why do we need to approve it at this table isn 't it if you 're on i think you 're on leave of absence at the same time is that something you couldn 't just cancel the fishes nominators represented by arts okay yeah yeah so that 's the reason i was just curious about the connection if you 're making your own way they 're under your your own steam or someone else is sponsoring it just wanted to clarify the tour he 's representing rrc and lawmak there both at concurrent they 're covering the cops okay then cancer we 've i think we 've run into the questions on that one so we 've got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll put that those in favor as opposed you know emotions carried counselors there no any questions on notice or urgent business if not i 'll thank everyone for attending the meeting this morning and a closer meeting thank you [Music] everybody everybody [Music] everybody left me everybody you,"(-23.3786203, 150.5088889)"

declarations in matters on the agenda there 's as there 's a budget meeting there 's no uh requirement for any declarations in that space uh so we move uh straight on to the officers reports 5.1 uh but firstly i 'd like to uh open with with some comments and uh and i 'd seek further comment from the council as we go through go through this morning councillors the budget set presented today sets the foundations for which we will grow our region bigger and better in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services growth in population and growth in infrastructure at its heart it 's a catalyst of water and sewage capital program which shows council vision for our region we are looking at a better future as we deal with the challenging present and it has been tough we have had pandemics droughts our income has been lower and our bills higher and through this we have made the tough calls and the right calls this budget which delivers uncertainty in uncertain times it looks to the future or looking after our community and it grows out populations while shrinking our deficit this is an infrastructure budget and the centerpiece of the centerpiece of this year 's budget is a 77 million dollar investment over the next three years into three catalyst projects the north rock hampton sewage treatment plant the grace means sewage treatment plant and the glenwool water treatment plant once completed these projects will lock and unlock our region 's future growth that will allow us to grow our community from around thirty five thousand homes and businesses to more than fifty thousand why is it important i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how these projects have reached this point in 2013 a planning study for the future of our sewage treatment plants was completed and showed that we needed one of these plants to accommodate a population of 100 thousand council currently has four treatment plants in the rockhampton great smear and mount morgan an estimate was prepared based on similar plants and inserted into our long-term financial plan at the time the study of the plan showed that the estimated on growth predictions for the population of one hundred thousand of the strategies and reviewed over those few years and in 2016 those reviews showed that their growth had slowed and that we only required a small upgrade to the capacity of that plan so the estimated population was reduced and included in their long-term forecast amended accordingly as we have seen over the last year and a half the region and the city has is growing the recent growth in pop in predictions indicated that we now need a plant to accommodate 75 000 the north rock hampton sewage treatment plant will have an upgrade to cater for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as the approval of two hundred thousand plus slots at the elida development this plant will upgrade will take us through to at least 20 42. the back of the wider budget is now this year alone is our capital program of 151 million with more than 60 million funded from state and federal governments within our capital works program there 's 30 million will be spent in civil infrastructure this year on roads footpaths and stormwater drains another 14.7 million is going towards our water and sewerage network and with the treatment and more than 3 million be invested into a solar farm at glenmore to cut our power bills and increase our sustainability 5 million will go to waste projects across the region and almost 30 million will be spent at the airport 25 of which is from federal government funding going towards the alliance hangar at the same time we are investing in the social fabric of our great community so people have a recreational opportunities that they need and deserve this year we 'll see more than three million to continue with the redevelopment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million dollar upgrade to the mount morgan pill and invest those dollars into a boat ramp at port alma and into incumbent creek we will also look at investing more than two million dollars into new parks and maintaining our current ones our commitment to the new rockhampton museum of art continues with a 4.3 million dollars in this year 's budget towards the fitting out of the building and the acquisitions that will begin the mil with the millions of dollars of work that uh that go into the heritage village as well as our detail in the investment in our communities worth noting that our community who reaps the benefits based off the previous year we will typically see a 70 to 80 percent of that spend that goes back to local businesses the engine room of our community and our economy when i was sworn in and its mayor in february i wanted to work with the councils to get the council back in the black after last year 's deficit of 5.4 million dollars i 'm pleased to say that this year 's budget sets council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have reduced the deficit by more than three million dollars to end up with 2.1 million in the red this year our challenges has been to cut the cost without cutting the services and that 's what we 've done from here we 'll need to stay on course to continue with the fight to find a better and smarter ways of doing business to stretch our dollar further in this budget we are proposing a rate increase of 3.35 for the typical residential rate payer this is a total of 2.26 extra per week we have kept this rate as low as possible while ensuring we can continue to fund the services deliver that vital infrastructure projects and ensure that we do not compromise our future we have done this in the face of reduced income from the airport higher insurance costs and the pressures from the ongoing drought in mount morgan which is forcing us to cut water daily we 'll continue to with our support for the residents and help them manage with their costs of living we have kept the 10 discount for those that pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebate is up to 260 dollars when combined with the government concession of 200 this is much needed relief for the thousands of pensioners in conclusion i would like to thank and commend my fellow councillor colleagues in their efforts for the constructive debate and the compromises we 've all had to make over the many workshops and undertake this in order to form their budget i 'd also like to acknowledge the efforts of our ceo evan pardon peter cauford our leadership team alicia cutler our chief financial officer marnie taylor ross cheeseman our deputy ceo and the finance team and all the hours and efforts that i put into this budget it is greatly appreciated after seven years 17 years in council this is my first budget that i 'll hand down as many of the rockhampton region i commend the 2021-22 budget to you for your consideration and adoption thank you councillors [Applause] so um just like to go if there 's any other comments from councillors around the table i 'm happy to do that do you want to start around the table yeah if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you mr mayor this budget process i think has actually been very open very free-flowing as far as comments and also a budget there where we 've been able to have input as well as uh be able to have those sometimes robust discussions on uh some of those projects and some of the items within the budget but i thought i 'd like to sort of just comment on a couple of key areas and so putting in our budget in comparison to other budgets within central queensland one of the things that probably is always very hard for regional councils is actually see that there is a share a bear spend and a fair budget for all of the communities that make up a regional council now throughout central queensland many of the local governments have actually seen a contraction in their satellite areas and everything coming back to the main base i think one of the things that we can really feel that we can take and be quite proud of is that that spend in our communities outside the greater uh rockhampton urban area has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the likes of north rockhampton and i think that this is something that our communities outside the urban rockhampton area there can actually take as if we are listening we we do uh hear their needs and we support their needs and in a very tough economic climate this is something that i think we can hold very dear i 'd also sort of like to sort of just reflect on some of the projects in this budget have been quite a number of years in their makeup and two that i would like to highlight is a budget about four years ago mr chairman mr mayor when you were chairman of infrastructure we purchased a vehicle there to actually address the pothole need in the rockhampton region i looked this morning as to this week going back four years ago when i had put in 40 pothole requests just in division two this last three months i haven 't put in more than three pothole requests that has been some of the things when you look at a budget and for me a budget some of those investments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we go through and look at our infrastructure budget there are so many less roads in some areas that don 't need those big spins because we have had that ongoing maintenance i think that that is a credit to council and also mr mayor as chairman you fought for that and we 're actually seeing the benefits second was the solar farm at fitzroy river water and i know that we can probably compare scars in getting that to this stage but it is one of those projects that i think is a long-term project and a real credit to the entire council and officers there to actually see this come together it was something that always made sense but you do have to prove that there is value for money to the right payers and i think mr mayor that is one that has been very very well constructed but i do have those passion areas that i like to talk about and i love anything aviation to see in this year 's budget that there is 26 million dollars for the rockhampton maintenance facility is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be talking in 10 years time and maybe i 've got my wheelie walker and and sort of uh saying oh yes i remember that budget but the 26 million dollars there creates a whole new industry will need those facilities that the mayor spoke about in this year 's budget because we 'll have that extra population that will be required with all of those new skills for the rockhampton region but also the airport has two other significant spins one is the cross runway where there 's a million dollars being spent on the cross runway and many people say well why you 've got one runway why do you need two rockhampton airport always started off as two separate airports and it wasn 't until world war ii that it actually became one airport but the cross runway there has a significant benefit and one of the reasons is rockhampton region and rockhampton airport is the largest base for the royal flying doctor service there are more passive passengers or patients that have flown out of rockhampton than any other of their regional facilities in queensland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's probably one that won 't make the media and i wanted to highlight that and that is to uh nearly a quarter three quarters of a million dollars in the budget it 's called a paid uh car parking equipment but the when you go to park at the airport we 've got 11 year old equipment that is hanging on by a thread of just keeping the public able to grab their tickets purchase their parking times this new equipment is state of the art it 's one of those ones we 're used to it at the rockhampton hospital but it actually has number plate recognition it also then gives the ability there to actually do specials and like cairns that have used the car parking there is as a certain times there 's those times where we can promote come out to the airport come and have a meal at the airport which councillors and mayor we 're all doing that after uh for lunch today but there 's a discount for a meal or it could mean there that we could have okay first 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a free coffee this is all part of having one of the most modern and efficient airports in regional australia so while this is only a small piece of our rockhampton airport budget it 's one that will actually help not only in generating income locally but we 're also competing against airports in emerald in gladstone and with something like this and some specials if you 've got to travel maybe 150 kilometers to an airport and you could say okay do i go to emerald do i go to rockhampton or do i go to gladstone this might be the thing that actually sees well we 'll go to rockhampton then we 'll get that that free coffee and catch the flight out of rockhampton so this is another uh spend to actually improve the use of rockhampton airport so councillors mr mayor i think that when we were looking at this budget first up i think the comment was made we 're going to have to lock up all those sharp instruments there because it 's going to be tough under your leadership and the skills of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a budget that we can sort of stand hand on heart and say this is a budget there that 's actually going to see rockhampton develop in the future so i commend that and thank you mr mayor for the process that you led during the budget thank you very much thanks uh deputy mayor cancer fisher um against there 's any other councils my comment to the budget chancellor kirkland thank you mr mayor um firstly i 'd just like to say that this is the the second time sitting around the table to deliver a budget the first time was right in the midst of of everything covered and it was touted as being the most difficult budget that had ever been delivered to the community of rockhampton and i have to say that this year 's budget wasn 't dissimilar and we 've all heard the comments uh that sometimes we we work we toil with blood sweat and tears i can assure the community there was sweat and tears and i i 'm also glad that there was no blood shed however there were times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely echo the sentiment that our mayor has has shared the wording that is put together appropriately describes everything that we are bringing to the community so thank you mr mayor your address was excellent and and the only thing that i 'd like to add to that of course as the portfolio chair for water and environment is that a great uh piece of this budget this capital expenditure this year is 77 million in our infrastructure of sewage and water and that 's over three major projects and i 'm very excited about that because it means that we are augmenting for a reason we are renewing for a reason and that is for the benefit of the community 's growth and it 's going to bring an extra 300 jobs to our region which is fabulous and a local injection uh to our economy of about 107 million dollars so that is for those people who were delivering the augmentation of those facilities and that 's exciting in itself we 're going to see an extra 16 000 homes catered for and that 'll take us into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure of about one percent per year that 's going to be our growth i expect and anticipate with the wonderful work that advanced rockhampton are doing that we will exceed that and so to be prepared for that is very prudent and i congratulate all of my colleagues it has been a difficult budget to bring together i congratulate uh certainly mr ceo and all of the leadership team there have been considerable um compromises i suppose or sacrifices as mayor said in different areas but absolutely no sacrifice to the delivery of services to our community and so well done to everybody who 's been able to find those efficiencies and i think that today 's budget as you have said mr mary 's for a bigger better brighter future for rockhampton and i 'm looking forward to seeing what that deficit to continue to go down and we 'll be moving into a surplus in the next couple of years and so that 's an exciting prospect for our region for our community and for our surrounding communities that we are now working very well in collaboration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done mr mayor thanks very much councillor kirkland um i think we still have a lot of work ahead of us but uh it 's great to get to this point uh and put that work that we 've we 've already achieved today uh i 'll go to councillor smith thank you mr mayor um like a lot of people i was dreading this budget because of covert and other factors but i think it hasn 't been too bad sort of like you know it 's a little bit of a relief in in places uh if someone ever asks me what i think our region needs and i always say better roads so i think i 'm in the right department now but there are so many departments and factors that make up our budget and make up our council and um a 30 million dollar spend on roads and footpaths is quite significant i 'm quite happy with that i 'm quite happy that some of our little rural communities are going to see some bitumen this year which is really great and we look forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we don 't know what 's going to fall out of the sky we know what normally does but hopefully there will be some other grants come along that we will be successful in and thank you to all the people who write the grants and the fact that we have a lot of projects shovel ready is very very significant when we 're applying for these grants so thank you to the ceo and all the leadership team all our officers managers and staff because i think we 've got great teams of people and uh congratulations to our mayor councillor williams you you 're doing us proud thank you thank you very much councillor uh councillor rutherford or councillor council rutherford thank you thank you mr mayor and i 'd also like to offer my congratulations and thanks and thanks to um the the our wonderful officers but also the entire organization you know this it has been a tough we can 't say it enough how how tough a budget this has been to pull together and and how much has needed to be done through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that support we wouldn 't have got to the place we are so thank you i am probably more excited by this budget it 's not sexy budget at all but i 'm probably more excited about this budget than i have been about others that have been more delivered more pretty things because this is the budget that really builds our future this is the budget that sets us up for the next 30 40 years um and it is about building our community and and building um the future for our children and i 'm really hoping that we can take our community on the journey with us in this one it hasn 't been without pain and there will be some things that we 've all had pet projects that we 've been pushing on behalf of our community that we 've had to let go to achieve this but that the payoff will be there if we are patient and we all work together um i 'd also like to thank the entire council table therefore for their support of the mount morgan community our community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the table and the organization to back that community up and continue to look for a path forward for them with their water supply um is truly amazing so thank you all for that um and once again mr mayor congratulations on a great budget thanks very much council i appreciate those words uh councillor witherson thank you mr mayor um his colleagues might know my background was in building design uh one of the least exciting parts of any building design or house design is the foundations but without good foundations the rest of it comes to naught possibly so this budget i believe sets those foundations for our future going forward it 'll accommodate that extra growth that we anticipate getting uh thanks very much to the our economic and tourism development wing advanced rockhampton that continue to secure and and pursue more opportunities in that area um but like with the house uh probably the secondly sexy part is is the bathroom um until you don 't have one uh so while it may not be the ideal ribbon cutting event and gala exposure that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely essential again if we want to cater for those influx of new residents to rocket which we we badly need to support our ongoing future we can 't do that without that augmented series treatment plan so that 's uh well not exciting absolutely essential uh and also just to thank all the staff uh every single person that works with this organization uh contributes in their their way to the good of the whole one team that we we strive for so and just to conclude thank you for very strong leadership probably aside from budget uh considerations also setting um overdue relationships with our neighbours and with other organizations we had drifted away from i think also moving forward that 's essential if we 're going to progress this region we need to work with other regions collaboratively and in a coordinated way if we want to get the support from other levels of government and also our own communities so and thank you for the leadership with that thank you very much and i think that uh analogy of the uh the house and the toilet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perspective but it is uh it is very freedom about setting the foundations uh cancel election thanks mr mayor and i likewise i 'd like to commend everyone the leadership team uh and the councillors for part of this process so i appreciate the fact that we 've been given more time this time around to do the budget as my second budget that i 've been involved with uh and for me i just want to make a few points um that i see each budget is a snapshot of where the council sees it 's an immediate future for the rockhampton regional community and i commend this back to basics budget with the must-do infrastructure the jobs and growth and for the future of our great region uh in my portfolio uh it 's pleasing to see a commitment to a five million dollar capital expenditure for waste and recycling especially predominantly at the extending the life of the lakes creek landfill and that 's an essential service in our community and finally uh it 's exciting to see a new park in the residential growth area of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very much mr mayor so first budget for me so quite exciting time so thanks very much for everybody for helping me through it i 'd just like to quickly talk about the process more so than the budget itself because as a first time coming and seeing what happens in the background the amount of work the amount of discussions the amount of debate that goes into it and i 'm just very proud to see sometimes i wish that the general public could see what goes on behind the closed doors i know some stuff we wouldn 't want them to see with with the discussions that we have but the work that goes into making these hard hard decisions on behalf of the community i think is extremely important and i 'm also very pleased to see the fact that there 's been so much compromise where we 've decided to not have the bright new toys or the fancy new toys and we 've gone back to the infrastructure the stuff that we need to move forward for the growth and the betterment of the community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ councillors and uh the leadership team marty 's team you 've done a very good job and i 'm i 'm very pleased to see how things work behind uh you know this side of the door well done thanks very much yeah council matters it 's a great then thanks everyone for your comments it really does mean a lot and uh help us with this budget process okay

my uh i 'm talk that we have a large agenda and i 'm really going to try and roll through it um so if i i get too fast and ahead just uh let me know we 'll wind it back a bit thanks council election uh moving on to officers reports advanced rockhampton item 10.1 tender consideration plan for online digital platforms greg would you like to speak to that please good morning mary and councillors uh this uh this report uh is really formalizing something that 's been happening for a fair while now anyway it 's the advertising through those online platforms and they 're the major platforms uh we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside of the box so it really is that facebook linkedin google and the fourth one which is listed in the report so it really is to allow us to advertise on those platforms without having to tender and uh because of the tight like billboards because of the types of platforms they are these are even more unique uh that we don 't really need in my opinion uh and recommend at the table we don 't need to tend to these items okay counselors if there 's no questions around that one i 'm happy to move secret second up secretary councillor wickerson and i 'll put that those in favor suppose the motion 's carried unanimously thank you moving on to 10.2 22 developing northern australia conference exhibitor again greg yeah it 's pretty pretty uh self-explanatory there uh a conference that we know well having run this uh conference last year uh the one in darwin this year being a stop start affair and ended up being online uh but in makai next year and i think it 's uh in my humble opinion uh worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conference and it 's close proximity hopefully a number of us will be able to attend as well uh around this around this room so that 's my recommendation we haven 't gone for any large sponsorships here we 've just gone for a basic booth uh to make sure we 've got profile there yeah putting rocky on the radar yeah no that 's uh that 's understood greg and i think it 's a reasonably self-explanatory tree again i 'm happy to move and seek a second with regards to that one councillor kirkland i 'll uh any questions cancers if not i 'll put that those in favor opposed motions carried thanks very much greg moving on to communities and heritage community assistance program round two alicia thank you good morning councillors so this was the round two of community assistance program we had 10 applications received two were deemed ineligible um and then we 've got eight that are recommended there in terms of the grants there 's one there that is for 2023 softball championships and just make mention that that will be sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other funding for that event happy to take any questions mr mayor uh council election question thanks mr mayor just happy to move this i 've um i 've been obviously critical over the years of some of the some of the funding that 's happened but i 'm very happy with with where the uh the group has has assessed this one the only question i 've got uh mr mayor is probably the stedford uh they had a request for in kind value and uh whether we should be doing it in kind as well i understand that will pay for the use of the philbin theatre but should it just be in kind in the first place yes it could be so um i would have to check in counsellor just in regards to that event whether or not they need the funds up front to help with their cash flow that would be the only question on that it 's probably one we can we can get more detail on that one as we move forward but it makes sense as it 's a annual top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions i 'll put that those in favor as opposed motion carried unanimously thank you councillors moving on to 10.4 fees and charges uh city child care centre who has that one john thank you through the chair good morning councillors uh here we 've got a report requesting an increase to the fees and charges for the city centre child care centre um what we 're asking for is that we 're allowed to have an increase timed with the calendar year this is actually the typical way the child care centers do go about increasing their fees and charges so my recommendation is in accordance with the requirements of the local government act council adopts the amended fees for city centre child care centre for the remainder of the 21 22 financial year i 'm sure you 've read the report um i won 't take read it all through to you but um the child care center over the past number of years have had increasing costs associated with the revision of how child care workers are paid also with some of the statutory requirements of ratios @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff members and also we 've typically taken the process of very doing very minimal increases that 's the way that council typically operates all the services which it delivers to the council to the community and but you 'll see we 've been quite conservative in the past and even when we were we were unable to increase child care fees due to the outcomes of the covert situation we 're also very conservative because of when we 've put those increases on the one thing to remember also is that the increase that you see here in nearly all instances is not wholly played by the person seeking child care it is typically 50 funded for the child care subsidies that the individuals receive so thank you very much thanks very much john uh council wickerson is portfolio chair happy to move uh seeker seconder councillor smith um councillor wickson in comment or just there 's a book all right okay no questions i 'll put that those in favor opposed motions carried unanimously thank you john uh council wickerson and seconded councillor smith i 'll slow down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much john thank you moving on to sports um park sports and public open spaces uh item 10.5 rockhampton botanic gardens and zoo branding you got this one greg all right quite uh unique and exciting for me standing up here for in a parks portfolio that 's too sure i 'll try not to make a habit of it alicia that 's for sure [Laughter] marion councillors uh this has been worked on by a number of departments through council and both ar parks and also with infrastructure as well have all been part of this process it 's been workshopped uh several times within this chamber um it 's why a couple of the people that were involved are no longer here it 's why i 'm standing up here in front of you uh but the report that 's attached to or the the brand guideline that 's attached to the report uh runs you through the the brand uh which is the legacy brand the symbol the marker past present and future and then the logo and then some examples of the the correct and incorrect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too many curly questions but that 's just me being optimistic because if there are i 'll try my my hardest to to answer them along the way but i 'm i 'm hoping it has been workshop to this stage yeah and that concept uh can be accepted can cancer rather for this chair did you want to make any comment um mr mayor just to say that you know the process was a really good one i thank the staff um all the staff that had their input into that thank counsellor for counsellors for their patience in um working through it i think you know colors and designs and that always had the most lengthy discussions um that you can have but i think we 've really come out with a very good outcome um that matches our our botanic gardens and zoo beautifully and and speaks to the heritage of the area so i 'm happy to move thanks very much councillor rutherford again i think there 's some exciting times in the botanic gardens and zoo space going forward and it 's great to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that uh master planning that we 've been working on as well so it 's it 's good times for the uh for one of our major tourism and local attractions in the city uh thanks very much council election question thanks mr mayor just uh and agree with what council rutherford said um that done a really good the process has been fantastic it 's got to a result where we can now present it to the public um probably a comment more on page 64 on the chimpanzee picture the only thing i could pick up was where it says live learn conserve it 's very difficult to actually see the wording so that 's probably the only comment is maybe when they look at it they reconsider the color scheme on that picture on 64 with the chimpanzee at least you can read what the the words say but other than that it 's a fantastic document so i 'm happy to second that okay thank you councillor and i have jonathan maxwell with me who will note that down as our holder of the brand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh councillor wickerson uh thanks maj just some comments and again yeah the process was excellent but also the comment that all of the proposals have put up were all excellent and was very hard even in our workshop to pick you know which was the better of them but i 'm personally pleased that we 've gone with the legacy brand as you know council rather than i have a bit of a legacy of our own going back to the botanic gardens but i think this really picks up and i think it came up during our work shopping or certainly when we 've chatted to people that as councillors where as a council we 've got that custodian role so we don 't own it and we 're just in this moment of time the caretakers of it so it 's our role to leave something that is a legacy for the next uh communities and generations coming up so i think that 's very fitting that this is the one that we 've landed on and also that it picks up on some design and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well chosen council i think the mayor 's comment before about you know it 's great timing now that we 've completed this because as part of that master plan process not not only we can start to physically build these things but also all the branding we do as part of that we 'll have the new brand on it yeah it really does dovetail got those comments councilworkers and council rutherford oh mr mayor meet capri billboard um there i think we could um put that anywhere and and we would have people flocking that 's one of the best billboards i 've i 've seen so and yep she 's certainly very photogenic that 's for sure yep and uh i 'm sure greg i 'm sorry mr billboard would uh know about that one as well so yes jonathan and i have had that conversation uh meerkats are gone for a little while and the chimpanzees will take over next month [Laughter] that 's all good so no further questions counsellors we have a mover in a second uh move cancer rutherford secondary cancer election uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very much greg well done on that one they do they do take a fair bit a fair bit of our time looking at those types of things when there 's so many choices too that doesn 't help moving on to 10.6 uh the transfer of melbourne street paul freehold lease from the australian federal federation of uh total and permanently incapacitated ex-servicemen and women mr may all right you have a conflict in this one councillor smith yep my nephew and his wife brett and terrell and mckinnon are number five melbourne street and the end of that park uh that pertains to this item uh is only about 20 metres from their house so i 'll declare it so councillor smith uh we 'll leave the meeting for this discussion um justin or who do we have anyone justin online yes thank you justin could you uh speak to that report please yes thank you mayor good morning mayor council uh today 's report looks to support the community 's active freemason lodge orders and groups currently operating within the rockhampton region before i just get into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apologize on my behalf in the report in the first sentence within the background section i 've got the date as the ninth as 1962 they 've been operating so freemasons have been operating since 1862 so i did a short cut them about 100 years they had to apologize just to make that correction um thanks for the report uh in september uh we were notified of the imminent sale of the elmer street lodge this has been their base of operation supporting over 90 of these freemason groups within the community in total we do have about 12 lodges and associated groups that make up those those groups uh elmer elmer street hasn 't formally lied by reports but we have been advised that come mid-january they will be asked to fully vacate that site leaving them without a home in in total the the community hosts um i guess i think there 's about two of the twelve groups that have since transitioned to the berserker lodge over on monarch street however that does see that facility capacity hence why they are looking for an alternative home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking on an average of about 15 to 50 members per lodge or group so it is a significant amount of members that we 're talking about that are going to be displaced for sale of almost 3. so driving driving i think the community members from the various lodges have identified a solution which has been outlined in the report in substituting the loss of elmistry so by a way of establishing a new incorporated organization named soldier house soul sharehouse has actually been formed based on committee members from the various lodges in the means to facilitate the sale sorry the purchase of the melbourne street hall so driving this initiative is the opportunity for salty house to buy the ore from the cqtpi the the hall not only provides a suitable substitute for the alma street side but it does boast a range of opportunities including some improvements to the facility itself so the melbourne street hall as it stands they 're looking at doing some upgrades to amenities improving disabled access to services members um tpi have formally provided soldier house also the first option to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this has been done outside of council so they they 've come up with an arrangement to sell their asset hence why today 's report is looking for council support to now resolve to transfer that freehold lease just over the land of which it occupies to support that sale is there any any questions i guess in addition to that council thanks thanks very much for for presenting the report there justin uh councillors any questions with regards to the to justin councillor rutherford hi mr mayor i 'm happy to move this um i 've met um with a number of these gentlemen with justin and we 've worked through this it 's really quite a very good outcome um that that helps a number of organisations so i 'm happy to move okay thanks again sir rutherford councillor wickerson happy to second uh no questions with regards to that one i 'll put that motion those in favor as opposed motions carried unanimously thanks very much justin we 'll invite councillor smith back into the room it will be while their numbers are there thanks councillor smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to alicia thanks very much alicia well thanks mr mayor so this matter was laid on the table last council meeting and so now we 're talking about it again so the whole objective of this report was to talk about uh the nature and scope of the details in which we had applied for a grant funding to upgrade that site we 're still waiting to hear on that but i guess there was a feeling that um one in terms of disclosure and bringing it back in terms of the nature and scope of that grant application and two is in terms of do it 's commencing some planning work so that should we be successful with that grant will then we can also get started to make sure that the delivery of that project will be within the grant time frames um separately to that we had a workshop last week just around some of the operational challenges i suppose of the pool in the short water shortage of water environment but i sort of stress that there 's two separate issues here one is about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know what how we operate that site more effectively so happy to take any questions and thanks very much elise again yeah there was a bit of a mix up there with the the two into the one uh one item but that 's been cleared now and again in the in the essence of time we 'll we 'll get a bit more understanding about where that where that will take us um council rutherford question um more a statement if i could mr mayor and it 's probably um in the report it talks about a contemporary pool facility and and initially that sort of it didn 't i was i was happy with that um but then i started to wonder really about the what the aesthetic look of the pool should be or the facility should be and whether we it 's possible to have a nod to the heritage of of mount morgan rather than you know go completely contemporary um so it 's very early stages but i just wonder whether we could look at that um through the design phase i 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go through that as well and we could talk about those uh aspects at that time at that point but that said councillors um i 'm reasonably happy that we 've got to a decision there so uh could i see come over in a second cancer rutherford you 'd like to move secretary councillor kirkland no further questions i 'll put that one though it 's in favor and the emotions carried unanimously thank you councillors moving on to planning and regulations we have a number of planning matters on the books this morning so we 'll hand over to tonya with uh item 10.8 thanks very much tanya i just turned the mic on please thank you good morning marin councillors we 've got a couple to go through today uh the first one is a material change views for a house in frenchville so you can see uh the the site outlined there um it 's all bush behind that site um it 's it 's dual zone for property so the back half of the property is in the environmental management and conservation zone and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zoning which is very unusual so the front part of the property where the house is going is actually within the low density residential area so they 're not actually going to impact the back so that 's just a 3d view of what the house is going to look like so there 's one properly made submission by a submitter in the area the proposed developments recommended for approval subject to the conditions outlined in the report thanks very much councillors any questions with regards to that one if not uh could i seek him over in a second with that report uh councillor blackson councillor may this is the portfolio sorry just just beforehand i 'm i 'm happy to move um that mr mayor i just i wanted to make a comment of a talk briefly with uh titania the other day in regards to this one i just like to know whether we have some sort of procedure in place i know we 're going through and making a lot of changes in regards to our strategic planning you know will that property be captured for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to get that the whole property covered under the residential uh area versus the remove the environmental is is there some way that that can be captured or does it just stay like that question tanya thanks for not sure through the chair um it may get picked up and we can certainly flag it with strategic planning um but it 's not something they would ordinarily do and tanya would you see uh it necessary to be flagged or is is that you know once this is approved it 's okay moving forward through the chair i think once it 's approved it 's okay moving forward because it will have that residential use over the entire type because it 's it 's unusual in the fact that it 's zoned a split zoning on the one property yeah so the residential use will prevail over the environmental conservation management zone all right thanks for that i was just thinking about the current owners now if they want to go and sell it later moving on to the future i 'm happy to move that yes yeah question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stormwater going into the neighbour 's property we have so much of that lately especially with all the rain we 've had i 'm not sure how how we mitigate it um but i just want to ask tanya because all the roof water is supposed to be directed to the nearest point of discharge which is normally to the front of the house does anyone check that once the um house is built because on a there 's a i 've got lot of them in in gracemere that haven 't been directed to the front and they 're they 're draining into their neighbours and i just wondered uh if anyone checks that after the house is built through the chair yes we do for every material change of use the development compliance officers go into a compliance check once the development has been undertaken and it can get picked up within that compliance check however i don 't know if the development looks like it 's been done correctly whether there would actually be any sort of practical signals that the stormwater wasn 't going to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not that i 'd have to have an mcu either case the building people are supposed to check that through the chair um council officers the development compliance officers would check that anyway because they have to do a compliance check on every approval that gets done in terms of the the split zoning um that it 's a propos it 's a sorry it 's a historic subdivision so because of that the lot should have been zoned residential instead of having the split zoning um and again we can flag that with strategic planning to to show that it 's an issue okay thanks daniel uh council election second of the motion uh no further questions i 'll put that those in favor those opposed motions carried unanimously thanks very much tania 10.9 uh again tanya so counselors this is a uh reconfiguration of a lot in the rural area of boulder cone it 's the form sorry this property it joins my cousin 's place so i had a conflict where i was going to be in motorsport so i need to leave the room yeah so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cousin there is a lying way in the middle but definitely have a conflict with that one thank you okay um i have a cousin that lives somewhere out there on tea tree road council council smith is telling me um mr cea yeah if you don 't can 't pinpoint it accurately where it is i don 't think it 's if you can 't see it on that map there um i i know they are there somewhere where they are i don 't know but they were they were in pack did you want to test the table to see whether you want to go or would you just like to step out and again cancel it made it be in the same i mean yeah i 'm in the same boat but i i sorry i 've only just realized as well that 's that 's the old motorsports precinct chris yeah just looking at numbers i 'll just say we might you might just ask the question about whether council sees that that is a conflict details um so my cousin sandra bogue sandra and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were impacted by the motorsports precinct and i 'm assuming this is the same same site so i 'll put it to the table whether you believe i should stay yes i did leave for the motorsports precinct yep um but there were a number of there were lots of combining issues for that one as well so um i 'll leave it to the tables sorry just for me one question mr is that would the cousins be a close associate of of yours or they dis removed a distance no no they 're first cousins they 're closely closed okay and i yeah i 'll put the same thing forward as well but they are they 're first cousins and we we do communicate musically regularly okay councillors the decision is that there 's a perceived conflict of interest uh with the close proximity and you know i 'm hearing that i 'm not even sure where the property is so uh sorry there is a conflict of interest is whether or not the council 's gonna stay perceived um do you believe cancer kirkland question um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there were a number of submissions around this particular application and so it would have been from neighbors and that type of thing so i am okay you 're concerned but would you just like to leave the meeting rather than putting to the vote yeah okay that might be the same yeah i 'm fine to leave the meeting as well okay we might not you 've still got caught yeah that 's fine that 's fine yeah that 's you don 't with the conflict of interest the remaining council attended the site so that your core it 's uh that 's always the better urge on the side of caution defensively come to those decisions sometimes it 's uh it makes it okay so uh thank you tanya tanya um through the chair it is actually the old motorsports precinct so everyone should probably be fairly familiar with it um it 's a rural subdivision one of the requirements of the reconfiguration of a lot code is that sites in the rural area have to be at least 100 hectares and all three of these sites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of submissions in relation to the subdivision a lot of them were matters that we can 't actually take into consideration um some of the matters are actually dealing with the quarry and the quarry is not on that land so the issues raised by the submitters were irrelevant to our assessment of that development so this one again is recommended for approval subject to the conditions outlined in the report okay thanks very much tanya can cancel any questions if not can i take a question thanks just me just one quick one through to tanya uh lot three at the back so access to that will be via tea tree road that 's that 's a formed road uh through the chair i think it is and uh access easement for the middle lot as it was before through the chair yeah that stays yeah thank you okay thank you uh movers and seconders with regards to this one move cancel election second in council wickerson i 'll put that those in favor opposed motions carried thank you yes invite the other councils back in thanks ross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to present the next report please uh yes thank you mister good morning mr mayor and councillors um so this application is for a dwelling house to be located at three rental street lakes creek um next slide please i think i can 't see you from if they 're moving um so the house will be approximately 156 square meters in size and includes open plan living four bedroom two bathroom house uh the house is provided with an on-site sewage system and will be connected to council 's water network and gain access by reynolds street our next slide please um the subject application was required due to the site being affected by a special management overlay area this overlay is in place because established industrial uses located in the surrounding area include lakes creek meat works and the borel site the house is located a significant distance away approximately 980 metres from the meat works and 340 meters from borrow asphalt plant the application was subject to public notification for 15 business days and no submissions were received next slide um yeah the proposed development is considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not anticipated to compromise the strategic framework of the planning of the rockhampton region planning scheme and therefore the application is recommended for approval subject to the conditions outlined in the report thank you kathy questions counsellors councillor rutherford yeah mr mayor um it 's just a side question really and it it looks like that there is um a detention basin or some sort of lagoon in the middle of that and i just worry that um down the track when you know maybe this property 's changed hands or whatever that you know we 're going to be responsible for um stormwater overland flow and you know someone who 's built on a detention basin yeah i 'm reasonably familiar with the location council and i think it is mainly um not so much overland flow but maybe just pooling cooling water in some of those uh lower areas it is very uh like mellonhole country where there 's there 's a number of um pockets in that area but i don 't see that one as a as an ongoing issue going forward but kathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this particular site has actually been raised at the front so it 's actually not affected by by any of those pulling waters where they 're so where the house is located it will be um out of yeah uh cancels any other questions to kathy on that one if not could i seek a mover in a second with regards to it move councillor may the second and council election i 'll put that those in favor those opposed motions carried unanimously thank you kathy i 'm moving on to our next item 10.11. thank you yeah this application um is also for a dwelling house and it is going to be located at 229 german street in norman gardens um next slide please the proposed dwelling house will be approximately 250 square meters in size and includes also an open plan living four bedroom two bathroom house with an ancillary detached shed the house will be connected to council sewing water network and also gain access by an existing access point along german street the subject site is located in the environmental management conservation zone the current site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square meters the area to the north is a large 36 hectare vacant lot also designated in the same zone um north and east of the site is german street park and mount archer national park and south east and west of the subject side are all located in the low density residential zone and predominantly used for residential purposes accommodating single dwellings our next slide please the application was subject to public notification for 15 business days and two properly made submissions were received the issues raised were in regards to drainage and the fire access on the property and have been summarized in the report and addressed as part of council 's assessment our next slide please um the proposed development is not anticipated to compromise the strategic framework of the royal cancer region planning scheme and therefore the application is recommended for approval subject to the conditions outlined in the report yeah thank you kathy just just a question if we go back to the aerial photo um and the trail that is behind the the rear of that property is that a fire trail or is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so council actually contacted qfbs um to ask for their advice um and they uh let us know that there was no need to retain it no need to find the access points that they can gain access um into the areas okay so that 's that 's redundant that trial now um yeah okay that was that was my uh my main concern if it was in the in a um zone area and they still required that but again at the base of the the uh the slope um there 's a different uh concept there when it comes to the fires councillors um cancer smith sorry yeah i was sort of a little bit concerned about the fact that we 're getting up into the mountain and i remember when we were doing the planning scheme we just really thought about things really deeply went and had a look at things and put some in and some out of the area where they could build and i just um it it 's that fringe uh area and that 's that 's part of the playing scheme and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look at how um how our father impinged into the uh into the bushland and the in the mountains and uh like i mentioned before this one is at the at the base uh of that area so you look at the other development to the um uh east it seems to be uh consistent with that that level of development going into that area so it 's not stand out something higher up the mountain or or out of line with that but uh it 's it 's always going to be a challenge going forward with that request to get those better views and uh you know prime blocks would be beautiful up there um one of them we did a few years ago and we were concerned about having another access or a way out of it this has got a narrow like a battle ax easement so we 're happy with that obviously kathy that 's the access internet 's fine um sorry i couldn 't actually hear that question uh council smith it was more about the uh the battle ax style entrance there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a previous application over this slot and the adjoining lot for residential subdivision so they were actually going to subdivide it into two lots um and they 've just got that access to get up there but now the owners have decided to build just the one house and not sub-divide okay thanks cathy um council legend thanks mr mayor as i understand that the property to the left has a three metre easement through there as well so there 's opportunity yep okay thank you for that okay counselors no further questions could i seek a mover in a second with regards to that application move counselor may the second and councillor smith i 'll put that those in favor those opposed motions carried unanimously thank you thank you moving on to item 10.12 10.11. 10.12 sorry i 'm just jumping all over one and brendan thanks very much for for that presentation thank you good morning mayor and councillors um this is a development application for a material change of use for a telecommunications facility so it 's located at the back of the glenmore shopping village between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounding areas so it 's in the location of the telecommunication facilities indicated by the star the surrounding areas as you 'd be familiar just generally characterized by houses educational establishments and in commercial activities i would just clarify in my report i referenced glamor state highs north rockhampton state high so i was referring to to glenmore state high so it 's a 32 and a half meter high monopole unpainted non-reflective grey telecommunications tower it 's for the purpose of 3g and 4g mobile data there 'll be a there 'll be an outdoor equipment cabinet at ground level and some safety fencing around it there was one pro not properly made submission objecting to the proposal on health and safety grounds that was the main one there was obviously a pretty common concern with telecommunications facilities the applicants submitted a report with their application um with a methodology undertaking in accordance with the australian radiation protection nuclear safety safety agency which demonstrated that um there 's effectively no concerns around electromagnetic radiation on nearby properties or students so and on that basis we 've we 've recommended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um its benefit to the surrounding area and providing those telecommunications facilities okay thanks very much brendan questions council smith yeah i was just sort of wondering why they would put it on there when we 've already got good mobile service in north rockhampton i mean we 've got so many areas around rockhampton that you can 't get any service at all yeah and here we are look to be upgrading but 3g and 4g that 's the old network isn 't it what about the 5g because that 's the one that people are concerned about for health reasons and with my experience with these towers once they 're approved they just upgrade them anyway yep through the chair so um they did a site selection methodology and an analysis part of the application so this particular tower is for optus now they 've experienced um they 're effectively their telecommunications facility or at capacity in that norman gardens area there 's been a pretty exponential increase in the use of mobile data since covert kicked in so there is an increased pressure in that network there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is for a 3g and 4g tower there is no conditions restricting the future use of it for 5g obviously they 'd be separate to any other legislation telecommunications legislation and need to comply with so there is the opportunity in the future to upgrade that tower to to match community needs okay thanks very much councillor kirkland oh thank you mr mayor just to comment just back to councillor smith that 's an area that um myself and i 'm sure councillor lakshman are very familiar with and our phones regularly drop out in that area so i 'm quite sure that yes in that in that exact pocket there so it is probably a really welcome um thing for certainly the commercial businesses there that would be experiencing similar problems so yeah okay um brendan are there any further questions to brendan um could i seek a move in a second though to that recommendation move councillor may the second council wickerson i 'll put that those in favor opposed motions carried unanimously nope uh emotions carried brendan and that was your first uh first presentation as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prickly one too with telstra so cheers you 've done well all right thanks marin councillors moving on 10.13 the risk register quarterly update at the 30th of october 2021. cassand thank you good morning mr mayor and councillors presented to you today is the latest quarterly update of the risk registers for adoption of note to highlight this period there were four new projects and their risks that have been added as well as additional two projects having undergone the review process being reassessed from a moderate five to an increased high for current risk rating the four newly identified projects and their risks can be found on the first page of the of the um attachment too happy to take any questions questions counsellors casein it 's uh it 's always prudent that we we maintain and monitor those risks and cancel there 's always risks that we associate with the organization um it 's great to know that they 're being monitored and raised and yes i 'm always heartened to see when management go through in the quarterly update and you see some movement as opposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at them and considering them so yeah yeah that 's it thank you uh cancel action question thanks for that question i 'm just happy to move this happy to move council election take seeker seconder council of kirkland i 'll put that those in favor motions carried thanks very much cassin thank you uh 10.14 the planning act 2016 temporary delegation over christmas new year period mr ceo i 'm happy to move is that this is just again it 's a uh a standard process that we moved through over this christmas period and uh putting all the delegation on to uh the mayor and the ceo and kids listen that so uh just part of that parcel seconded council of wickerson uh any questions with regards to that counsellors i 'll put that those in favor those opposed motions carried unanimously thank you 10.15 regional queensland council of mayors damien damon yes good morning mr mayor councillors the report for your consideration this morning is a follow-up to a previous report and resolution of council back in june of this year regarding an invitation that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mayor 's organisation as detailed in the report subsequent to the matter last coming before council the cq rock organisation have considered it and requested in the remaining individual councils of that uh member group to individually consider their position in relation to that those individual councils have considered it and with the vast majority having declined the invitation of membership in light of those developments and assessment has been undertaken in relation to the potential of advancing regional priorities via both the cq rock and regional queensland council of mayors and also in the context of council 's previously stated desire to obviously really strengthen those connections and relationships within our neighbouring local government areas and members of the cq rock and working within that particular framework in light of the fact that those other cq rock members have decided not to join the regional queensland council of mayors while a voice within that organization obviously has benefits to be able to advance broader priorities on in terms of central queensland at the same time as a single voice within a broader group of regional councils there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a worst-case scenario conflicting priorities being resolved out of the regional queensland council of mayor 's organisation which would put us in direct conflict with our cq rock members so on that basis and following that assessment the recommendation has been to decline presently that membership there is obviously opportunities for council to revisit that as those as we continue to work through the cq rock framework but obviously happy to take any questions thanks very much damon and again um cancels my my view uh after meeting with mayor hill in townsville that this group was looking to to grow in the next couple of years to be equivalent to the lgaq scale and costs uh increasing in the fees going forward i 'm very concerned about that and especially with our financial position at the moment but uh i 'd need to just flag that at the moment that was another consideration there that puts had some concern where we probably our finances of one that we need to be monitoring going forward so uh i 'd probably just like to add a further [Music] item into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the financial year um that invitation um in the light of that that situation i 'm getting a number of lights on there so i 'll go around to a few questions there councillors if we um we can ask answer those as we go forward councillor kirkland first thank you um thank you mr mayor i 'm actually very pleased that you 're adding that amendment in there because i was very concerned about the message that we 're sending to the rest of those councils the the regional councils i 'm not talking about cq rock um by not being a part of it we are a big brother in that cq rock and the representation to be there i would have thought would have been of a high priority to continue to collaborate and at least have a voice in anything that they 're hoping to to approach state government on so i think that it 's it 's prudent of us to consider being a part of that organization i understand where you 're coming from and i was going to ask your personal opinion so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damon that there may be a risk that there 's a conflict with cq rock and what they 're hoping to achieve but at the same time i think there 's a risk of us not being present in the room when the broader regional queensland council mayors are meeting and discussing matters that affect regional queensland we 're all very well aware that south queensland councils do tend to come up with the better end of the stick and to to have a combined collaborative voice i think is a very powerful thing i also hear what mayor is saying about the move uh in that general direction of of coming somewhat concerned about that as well not putting words to it but i hear what you 're saying mayor as far as lgaq is concerned so uh thank you very much and i 'm pleased to have that um that additional put in there for us to review this that we 're not sending a message to those councils that we don 't want to be involved yeah yeah just holding off prudent at this time that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organizations and that said my remit since being there has been to engage with other groups regionally and yeah this is a great opportunity but just to be to be mindful going forward where we are positioning ourselves that we 're not uh overlapping and providing a dual dual request in that space as well councillor smith then councillor wickerson yeah i just wondered with um being a member of the rqcom is there any chance that they would be getting funding like as a group or is it not for that because just just by going to that northern australia conference at alice springs that time you can see the northern councils are really um you know northern australia count really adamant that they 're so far away from the south where all the money is that they you know really want to join forces and and get a lot more funding i just feel like we 're sort of in the middle except for queensland we 're sort of in the middle and i just worry that we we could miss out on something significant yeah again looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm very mindful of our financial situation with the cq rock and their um their development over the next few years we 're really um buying into that on on a larger scale so we just got to be mindful of our involvement and our capability going forward so again hence waiting until the end of the financial year to review uh counsellor you 're right i think the advocacy by working in in groups and in partnership is a great way to lobby other levels of government since local government is at the lower level and always you know the the need of the other councils other government levels to to get that funding and working in a group helps provide that funding we just need to make sure that there 's no overlaps in priorities that we 're also doing here or uh that we 're advocating for locally that that may be captured in that group so i think it 's just a little bit time to sit back and uh work your way through that council wickerson well thanks mr mayor just to support what council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to review that in due course but i think there 's a need for another to get on too many but another tier between um the central queensland region of councils and lgaq there 's somewhere a level in there and it says councillor kirkland said it 's really to to balance out too much focus just being on the southeast corner strength in in numbers we all get together but obviously the resources for that i think if there is an overlap there for what the agenda is and there may well be some conflict would you have to be in the tent to be able to support our position whether not outside the tent but uh if there 's a if they 're duplicating what maybe the northern regional councils are doing maybe they need to look at what their what their priorities are they 're looking at it as the whole of queensland other than the southeast corner so that there 'll be a higher level agenda going on than what each region may do so they just probably need to define what their uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't be that overlap and if they then get too high level where it starts to step on lgaq well that 's not not robert somewhere in that middle ground there 's a need for mayors to come together but again you review that in the union 's house we 're tracking yeah that 's uh that 's what we 're asking these stage councils councillors thank you for those discussions i think we 've got a clear indication of our way forward with this this request i 'm happy to move as recommended seeker second council of kirkland i 'll put that those in favor as opposed motions carried unanimously thank you moving on to 10.16 the delay in the implementation of the quarterly rating uh for the 2022-23 financial year thank you manny thank you mr mayor and good morning marin councillors so brought back to the table is the discussion around delay in implementation of the quarterly rating for 2223 so councillors will recall that we that it was resolved on the 9th of march that community consultation would occur during 2122 around this particular impact or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from that consultation in 2223 proceeding with quarterly rating so the report is bringing back to council the recommendation that council defer the community consultation activity on the quarterly rating plan for this year and delay any action on the quarterly rating project there are a number of i guess competing demands that are occurring currently with council and that have also impacted on the ability for us to go out to community consultation in this first half of the financial year particularly around the implementation of the new corporate plan and the federal election advocacy plan which has been released so the other thing that we 're currently working on and will also be a more public consultation process will be around the northern boundary project and polling which is due to happen during march to april of next year um i guess the other consideration for council is the budget implications which were provided in the report previously we 're talking in the order of additional costs for the production of notices around that 78 000 and 80 000 mark plus a potential impact on existing staffing levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potentially in our rating team as well based on the the number of processes that have to be repeated four times in the year rather than just two through half yearly rating the other impact is to be considered is that we haven 't factored these additional costs into the 2223 budget when we 've been looking at our modelling to date so i guess that 's another consideration um to take on board thanks very much manny for uh presenting the report and information there on that uh the reasons for that delay councillor kirkland then councillor for council kirkland and thank you mr mayor um councils with the continuing revelation of of budgetary constraints on our uh where we 're heading moving forward i think that um whilst this is a fabulous initiative and i think that the idea of this initiative was to relieve that burden of the of the large rate figures half yearly to pull it back to a quarterly thing to help the residents of rockhampton that 's that 's the whole pro the whole reason for the quarterly uh rating consideration that being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to to to happen and certainly as i 've said with the revelation of recent constraints being put on our budget it 's probably prudent that we would move forward with this i 'm thinking i i did want to ask can we put a date to to review this i don 't you know when we say delay that could be as we 've seen with some things that come off the table it could be years before we come back to it it really should be that we 're trying to to relieve that burden can we put a date on it at all mr man so i just think with the um the election and federal election and also with the um where we are in our budget position i 'd say i 'd suggest maybe after the next five years can we do 22 23 after the next financial year would be time to workshop it again and review it at that point i don 't think we need to rush rush into this one oh yeah i 'm agreeing with that yeah considering they 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well so we don 't want to spread ourselves too thin uh if we 're going to do it that we look at it after the next financial year into the new yeah we put that 20 20 22 23 financial year that uh that covers that issue there councillor yeah thank you mr mayor that gives a bit of guidance for the officers then to um to park it for a bit and then come back and have a look at it again uh council election and council rather for then council election council rutherford oh mr mayor i think i can live with that one i i 'm not keen to let it go either so that 's even probably pushing it out a little further than i would have liked i was going to suggest we lay it on the table to because at the moment we have a motion that says you know we we go to consultation to look at implementing it so um yeah but i can i can live with that thank you council election thanks mr mayor probably just a comment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates bill that comes out every twice a year maybe we look at considering moving the water access charges to the actual water billing the water consumption charge and that would put a bit of relief on that the twice annually and then that could be split up between the four water billing cycles but it 's just a consideration i think we probably need to take that one a bit more detail and understand what the implications and issues around that it resolved money that 's um no further questions here that 's that 's fine from the organization 's perspective to hold it over till then give us some data thank you okay councillors if there 's no further questions i 'm happy to move that recommendation seek a second uh councillor kirkland i 'll put that those in favor i suppose motions carried unanimously thank you uh 10.17 summary budget management report ending 30th november again manny thank you thank you mr mayor so this is the monthly budget management report for the up to the 30th of november 2021 the recommendation is that the report be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the year so our operating revenue is currently sitting at 47 due mainly of course as we say every month to the um rates and charges that have already been levied but also other things like private work and recoverable works are at 47 also which is due to the timing of works performed and invoices grants and subsidies are also at 47 as council has received the quarterly payment of the financial assistance grant already in terms of our operating expenditure we 're sitting in around the 40 mark so that 's a positive we 're under budget in that space or within budget contractors and consultants are sitting at 38 materials and plant expenses are at 43 which are slightly over budget and we expect that well that 's mainly due to the cutting of water to mount morgan which has increased in costs which we spoke about last month when we did the monthly budget review admin expenses are at 33 uh in terms of our capital capital income is at 33 and is in line with our expectations however our capital expenditure is on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now around what the capital program will look like and what we will do in terms of review reviewing that budget through this financial year there are already some changes made at the last monthly budget review but there will be some further changes we expect and we 'll know more about those changes towards the end of january early february particularly around the fitzrover water major capital projects on those treatment plants so we 'll have further information to come back to the table at that time our total investments are 100.7 million as at the end of november and loans were at 141.4 million as at the end of the month there 's no further questions i recommend that that be received thanks money questions counselors with regards to this one thanks uh i 'm happy to move as recommended uh i think you 're keeping an eye on that i think we 'll definitely need to work in this space in the new year and work out how we um manage that going forward i 'm sure there 's some issues we 'll need to work together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as per the um budget review so i 'll seek a second with regards to that one move cancel let 's move myself second and cancel election i 'll put that those in favor opposed motions carried unanimously thank you moving on to the next item notice motion notification from councillor smith with regards to the sorry the show uh council smith would you i 'll firstly take him over in a second you 've moved councillor smith do we have a second councillor wickerson uh speaker for the motion council of smith uh thanks mr may um i think we did a work uh we did get a report on last year 's show which showed that we did make a loss um it was a great idea to put it down to five dollars for the 2019 show it sort of brought people back to the show made it affordable for families i believe the ten dollars is still affordable for families our neighbouring shows of richlands marlborough the caves japan mount morgan all charged ten dollars have been for quite a while and in most cases that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one different is mount larkin and they charge eight dollars for adults so pensioners and children which between five and fourteen will still pay five dollars that 's half price and four and under is free and those uh groupings are in line with the royal national association the rna the echo that 's what that 's their groupings as well so remembering that all competitors pay an entrance fee as well and i still think 10 is still affordable for competitors and without interfering in operational issues it just became apparent to me last year with working at the showgrounds office that they were struggling with the budget and to provide quality entertainment we had fireworks on every night but also to just to provide ring entertainment but also outside the ring as well you need the stalk walkers and whatever else we had to get that entertainment to um you know to to give to people i know that 's still very cheap compared to some shows down south but i think we just need to move it up to that value in order to not make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a small profit that money will also give us more help with getting things ready for the show we didn 't have anyone on the grounds sort of outside of council for we had volunteers there that were doing all the heavy lifting but uh to get our parks people and civil ops people they really just came on board for the show and it was a struggle to get a lot of things done even though we do have help from the prisoners putting up the horse stables etcetera and doing some of that heavy lifting so i think that that 's all i needed to say i think the the a little bit of the history of the show is there and um the what your attendance is going to be is always anyone 's guess but also next year we don 't know what the covert restrictions are going to mean and whether it 's going to cost us more money as well so i just would like to ask everyone to consider uh putting that price up and i don 't think it 's going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away because that 's what they 're used to paying anyway at other shows thanks council smith speaker against a motion counselor sorry mr mayor not a speaker against just a procedural motion to see if we could suspend standing orders i have a couple of questions for the mover happy to do that um no put that those in favor oppose emotions carried thank you procedural motion that we suspend standing orders councillor kirkland question uh yes i have a couple of questions for the mover councillor smith um noting that um the echo is 35 for an adult and the prices are considerably higher and yes the echo is a much bigger show can you give us some idea of the prices of shows in the region and what they are charging currently that 's question one and secondary to that have you considered the additional expenses that are starting to be incurred every year um and whether or not we need to anticipate rises in costings to present this show to the community at a cost that 's not expense at the expense of the rate payer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the smaller shows charge the ten dollars i don 't know what um mackay charges um to be honest they 're not in our cq regional group um so i 'm really not sure but all the smaller shows definitely charged ten dollars and and they um didn 't like the fact that we put ours down to five dollars because i thought well people won 't go to their shows but um as we know this year at richlands it was record crowds um and i think at most of the shows people um flock to them because last year we didn 't have a have a show that 's why i 'm pushing for this increase so that rate payers won 't be picking up any tab next year i don 't believe that we get a lot of in-kind support from the rest of council because we 've had we have workers there from parks and from civil ops and i believe that is all costed out and that 's why we didn 't get them till like the day before the show so that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of money out that way thank you hope i answered your question if i may indulge just with one other question councillor smith yes i i 'm supportive of increasing the amount i 'm just worried that it 's not going to be enough to still bring us back to a position where council are not providing this at the expense of the rate payer especially moving forward with increases in in costs uh definitely happening in and we 've all seen that i would wonder if you would be open to amending the amount to twelve dollars olive oil leave it to the table again again i think it 's season charges can be changed at any time so i think it 's maybe prudent and it 's just my view that we look at this and then review again after this show about attendance and um and how the how the finances have gone yeah [Music] mr mayor the previous people that ran the show the citizen rockemed agricultural and citizens association their entry fee for adults was something between 15 and 16 if i remember rightly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that 's why we welcomed them back in 2019 with the five dollar and i think you know people realize that things have increased since then twelve dollars is another two dollars um and it 's probably neither here nor there for a lot of people but i i think what you just suggested reviewing it um after this next year 's show and we might have to put it up to 15 dollars after that and half price for pensioners so okay thank you uh councillor mayors and council wickerson councilman i thank you mr mayor i think councillor wickerson was performing council workers thanks just really quickly mr marriage just a quick look makai is 20 for adults over 17 uh 15 for children 6 to 16 and 50 dollars for a family pass so there probably is scope in the future too to review it but i wouldn 't want to increase it in a big chunk uh too suddenly i mean the people were happy with five dollars we 're doubling that to 10 but by almonds i think we 'll come back and review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive uh event to put on but we 're balancing that by providing a good community event that 's accessible to to everyone with the cost although that said you see people are lining up for these rides which are sometimes 15 a ride so you know things that things ain 't what they used to be cost wise but i wouldn 't want to increase it too quickly but certainly come back and review it yeah thank you thanks council wickerson councilman thanks mr mayor through you to um councillor smith council smith my my biggest concern with uh with the increases uh you know we went on your opening statements you were sort of saying that you know your team were having troubles trying to find quality entertainment and that sort of stuff working on the budget which i totally understand one of my concerns is that if if we do do this increase are we doing the increase so that we can try to stop the costs going to the ratepayer because we have to fund the difference or are we looking at doing the increase so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still going to mean that you know that rate payers are going to have to fund it at the end so i suppose what i 'm asking is if we do increase it does that mean we 're going to try to spend the money on entertainment or are we going to keep that in the operating budget to cover other costs no i think the main aim will be not to make a loss this year we cut down on entertainment in the lunch hour which we had in 2019 we had bikes and whatever in the ring we didn 't have any of that this year so we only had the one quality show and that was the rooftop express and we probably get something like similar to that next year but but now not you know not not an excessive amount of entertainment that we had uh the previous year so that would be the um yeah the the idea of putting the price up is not to provide any more entertainment i think it was fine like you have a lunch break and people go and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and come back for the show jumping or whatever they want to watch so yeah that would be what i would think but it 's events for camp are the ones that that run the show they um source the entertainment etc and some sometimes we 've already got it booked anyway because you know the show 's only about six months away so a lot of that would have already been in train uh but i 'm sure that the girls that um that do that they keep a really close eye on the budget thank you thanks very much just and just one more question or what statement mr mayor if that 's okay which uh and i do understand you know that was probably a good idea going back um to the five dollars uh entry fee um and all the shows you know prove that they 'll well um received and well attended but i i personally think that had more to do with the fact that we 're in the midst of um covert and people were looking for an excuse to go and do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have gone whether it was ten dollars or whether it was five dollars so all right thank you very much thanks councilman election thanks mr mayor it 's true to councillor smith i guess um from from my the feedback i got was five dollars was was spot on that everyone was happy with that price whereas previously they wouldn 't go to to the to the showgrounds because it got too expensive for the families um but i guess my question is more so i did attend ridgelands and i did attend the caves and the caves you did a very good job out there with the the livestock and the judging and stuff and to me that 's what made the cave show it was based around the agriculture sorry the cattle and stuff the cattle judging and stuff and whereas we go to the rockhampton showground and it 's kind of like a side issue and it 's probably probably not as important as it probably should be my question i guess is the cost involved to do the judging cattle judging and stuff because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people watching it is that something we 've got to consider going forward or do we just wipe it out as an expense and not have to increase this fee would be sad to see it go but do we have to look at those things within the components within what the show does i think that 's a workshop question rather than arson counselor to do catalan horse people they 're paying to go in each event and a lot of times they you get sponsorship so that 's sometimes you 're actually making money out of those um events it 's just probably a pity that no one not many people are watching it and so important yeah being part of the show yeah well that 's probably something we need to look at it 's always been a question yeah so so this year remember we didn 't have any commercial cattle uh because it was a beef year so that brought a lot of a lot of people in 2019 probably bought you know hundreds more people then we didn 't have that this year last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation is the affordability and on the delivery of of of the product and i think that um i 'm just concerned about giving the community one price and then reviewing and giving them another price is it possible that we just turn this into just reviewing the price because if we give them one price now and then in five months a few months time just before the show we decided it 's not going to be enough we 're going to come out at a big loss again it it 's possibly confusing the community is that possible it 's probably better it 's probably not a yeah not in this that 's more a debate question asking that motion to be not a question in suspending standing orders more that 's more to do with the the recommendation rather than a question again sorry it probably needs to go into the debate yep sure um okay so we 'll resume uh against cleveland you want to resume standing orders yeah move councillor kirkland resume standing orders put the motion those in favor you 're opposed to standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debate we 've had a speaker for the motion speaker against the motion council of kirkland not really well i suppose it is against the wording of the motion so it i would propose that we take out the prices and that we commit to reviewing this with it with a mindset to to increase the prices depending on i don 't know just putting it out there they need to work to a budget they need to estimate how many people are coming and the price and work towards that that was the problem last year speaker for the motion ross i was just going to say mr may i just had a quick actor greg and to setting the prices really needs to know yeah pretty much now to yeah for the for that next year 's event okay speaker for the motion speaker for councillor brothers happy to speak for mr mayor i think we know that we have to um make a start here we have to raise the fees just a little and um we can go around and around about how much that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bullet ten dollars is a fair price we bite the bullet we 'll have a better idea after this show of where we 're going and and we can look at a number of different options council speaker against council election thanks mr mayor and uh it 's just my fear is the community they there 's some things that rockhampton regional council do that are fantastic and you look at river fest and other things which it does cost the council money to deliver these community events and and to me i kind of put it in with that uh category it 's one of those things we deliver yes we kind of want to reduce the amount of costs that we we have but i think it 'd be it 's important that we keep it as five dollars probably for this year and review it the following year um i just suspect maybe if at what point do the community say now it 's too dear for our family or for ourselves and then if we see and i don 't want to see that go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in patronage or attendance next year because of this i don 't want to say i 'm told to say thanks council latchman and another speaker for the motion councillor wickerson well thanks mr mayor happy to uh to move it as it is uh with reviewing it after the next show when we 've got some facts and figures there but also probably looking further down the track and i think when when council first took it back a number of years ago now we were hopeful that in the future sometime council wouldn 't be running it we 'd have a another body like the show society something and i know there 's council there 's pressures and difficulties in doing that trying to find the people willing to give up their time to doing it but if we gradually build up the price over a number of years so that it is a a more viable event we 've got more chance of having a body steady step in and say yes we 'll take that on and have half a chance of breaking even at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ track a bit i 'm happy to look at this but slowly sustainably creep it up when we can okay another speaker against speakers against uh council smith would you like to wrap up i think uh thanks mr meber i think it 's all been said uh and i think uh with ten dollars i think we 'll still get a good crowd and uh and a quality show so um and and as i said before it 's keeping in line with what the other smaller shows charge in any case but very happy to review it next year and i 'm not sure whether we need to ask for a report after the show the same as we did this year but it 's a good idea to have a look at all events and see how much the rate payers are picking up the tab i think we 'll be doing that as par for the course council looking at all our finances and moving forward in that space considering the position we 're in no further comments and debate around this one i 'll put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to record record chancellor election the motion is carried uh now just just counsellor let 's invite it spoke vote against not the whole lot counselors we might um will be guided whether we take a recess now or we would wait till we go into process and then break from then but yeah we might do that but cancer we 'll call a recess and come back for the closed sessions item so if we can be um please be quick how fast we wait till 22 10 minute break and uh come back um are you doing urgent business before closed session or are you going to come back after i think i 'll come back after it 's it 's that we 'll go through that and then we 'll move into their counsellor if that 's okay so a 10-minute research council [Music] [Music] let 's [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] now that we 've

everybody [Music] [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] do [Music] taking the good with the ups and downs i want to see how the world turns round [Music] is [Music] [Music] do [Music] do [Music] [Music] go back into our live streaming council will resume the meeting and move on to item 12 questions on notice nil urgent business and questions counselors counselor rutherford um yes thank you mr mayor i 'm just wondering whether um early in next year as as soon as possible we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugher and main roads to discuss um our the medians and what 's happening to get some idea of um you know their their ideas on on medians and um certainly to protect um what we 've got and look you know for many years now we 've worked really really hard to change the image of rockhampton the cyclone had a significant impact on that and i would hate to think that our medians are going to be predominantly concrete again and and in light of not having any information at all it would be great to be able to sit down and and discuss with main roads and our state members what that 's going to look like moving into the future yeah no i 'd support that council i think it 's one that we 're we 've um time has and legislation now changes have made it very difficult to to get into that space but even the mowing and the maintenance on those medians is something there that we need to work a matrix out or a program or policy there around that as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at that because it is really bringing the the reputation of the town down because of the untidy nature of the process but again because of the changes and the legislation that that 's required that 's not something that council has been able to resolve so i 've sort of had that those questions offline and asking other other options there that we can look at or working with them about a um scheduling of those programs and how we can do that but i think it 's great to invite everyone to the table and and work out a process there we can do that uh that kevin 's just working up um resolution around that counselor but uh i 'll go to other questions council smith and then council made it yeah just in addition to that i 'd like to talk to them about um having a really nice northern entrance at the roundabout there and i 'm just wondering in rocky city days did they pay for the yep and roundabout or was that main roads paid for the bull and all that i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roundabouts especially with the ring road and what 's happening in that space as well get a better understanding about what 's uh what 's available and i think there 'll be some funding for that it 's great i think it 's a great opportunity to start that process now that um actually the northern one it 's all finished and looks nice and getting into this it 's very bare looking that roundabout yeah we can um see if they 've got funding to do something there councilman maters thanks very much mr mayor excuse me i also had a a something i wanted to bring up with urgent business but it ties into uh what council rutherford was talking about as well if we are going to have a meeting with this state members and the reference state representatives you know are we able to include uh in those discussions uh what 's happening in regards to our creeks maintenance and clearing you know i i 'd like to say you know i commend what our mowing parks and mowing teams are doing as best they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're struggling to keep on top of it but the states of our creeks throughout the area and i totally understand it 's not council 's responsibility um but surely there must be some way that we can talk to it with these guys and involve dnr and maybe get some sort of scheduling of what we can do and how we can do it because the the state of the creeks are um you know beyond ridiculous at this stage and and if if we get a uh if we get a decent wet season we 're going to have a lot of localized flooding purely simply because of the amount of debris that 's going to be caught and backed up in these creeks so i think it 's prudent that we try to do something so whether you want me to make that a second urgent business or whether you want to tie it in with that i 'm not sure i think you might have to have two two dot points because they 're two different departments but with the same members and the nrm rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate please um yeah okay so am i able to [Music] play we 'll deal with one first thing let 's move into a second one so councillor wickerson second and uh council rutherford 's uh first motion uh any discussion around that cancers if not i 'll put it those in favor questions carried unanimously thank you and now councillor mate is you wishing for the same same type of yeah corrected um the same uh the same type of meeting if we could have barrier state state members and the nrm and is it nrm is it sorry yep and nrm um so that we can work on some sort of plan in regards to maintenance of our creeks and waterways uh within the rockhampton region are we going to keep it to pest management because i 've sort of talked about the you know cleaning creeks and gullies and even at springer 's lagoon but the the logs the hollow logs little animals live in them and they 're always reluctant to move them yep there 's the best management you may find that when we go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's no work that 's undertaken in those creeks because of the uh requirements and it 's probably prudent that we new councillors on board that we do have those discussions at this point um do you want to have a workshop first before you call for the meeting uh look look i i 'm very much i 'm happy to be educated in any way shape or form but look i really would like to um put this to the state members because you know i keep being told that we can 't do anything about it and i need to be able to tell my constituents that i am doing everything in my power to um to to sort this out for them uh i i yeah okay thank you thank you yeah uh second to councillor kirkland yeah happy to second that and and also commend both council rutherford and may this we 're bringing this to the table because it is that we do get a lot of complaints from constituents who think that it 's rockhampton regional council who 's letting down the the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roads and quite often it 's not so thank you okay thanks council kirkland if there 's no further questions or debate around that i 'll put that one those in favor emotions carried unanimous answers counselors before we wrap into uh to close session i 'd just like to um to say thank you to each and every council for your work throughout the year in 2021 we 've had some definite challenges that my time on council has been unprecedented and i hate to use that word but they have been times that have been quite challenging going forward um with with the situation so it 's great to have a team of councils that really um support each other in the in the organization i know you 're all very passionate and uh community focused and drive for your community so um i 'd just like to thank you for for your work at this time uh as our last council meetings for the year for your support for myself and and also the organization going forward there 's always uh the opportunities that we can we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great great way that we can see uh the organisation taking ourselves forward i 'd just like to also thank the ceo uh the council staff uh indoor and outdoor and all the council officers for presenting their reports uh to the best of their ability and giving us the guidance uh to make our decisions as we uh as we work our way through those uh those issues throughout the year so uh just on behalf of myself i 'd just like to wish everyone a very merry uh and safe and healthy happy new year uh councils any other councils want to talk and i do want to put on council officials who had uh intended to turn up today 's meeting just to to say his uh christmas message but unfortunately he 's able to unable to do that so an apology from councillor fisher so thank you if there 's no other comments i 'll um move that we move into closed session but we have a recommendation first that uh in accordance that we need to move the meeting into a closed session uh do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

declarations of interest in matters on the agenda councils i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declarations we might move straight into the offices report and sponsorship sorry my bad i 'll uh firstly start with the acknowledgement of country i would like to acknowledge and begin by acknowledging the traditional custodians of the on the land in which we meet today that rumble people and pay my respects to the elders past present and emerging i extend that respect to our neighbouring aboriginal peoples within our local government area the gangnam nations people the bharata kabul barra gidemarala people and also acknowledge the torres strait islander people whose land is in the torres straits but who live and work on aboriginal land thank you so well you might click straight into the uh to the business uh thanks greg uh and over here uh thank you mayor and uh thank you councillors um we 're back here in the chamber for another special meeting for for another special event uh which is fantastic uh uh the report when written uh or we wrote this in a way was uh an event in september but uh as as the hours and days have passed a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this resolution goes uh we will have a game a semi-final game and it uh it will be in september and it is likely to be the weekend of the 11th and 12th of september more details will be announced by the nrl hopefully today and uh that will come out in the media but as far as this goes we are sponsoring an event for 25 000 and we will be providing ticketing services those ticketing services will be charged back to the capras at uh cost price so that will cover any merchant fees it will cover any ferv which is the ticketing agent any of their fees and i 've put a third disclaimer in there that any other fees that may be directly relevant to the ticketing services so that those costs will be uh will be collected prior to giving any money over to to the campers after the game um the the uh as said previously the benefits to us for having these sorts of games i mean the profile being being very very a big big plus um you know the great things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these events and i think some of us experienced that last weekend how excited our residents were over the two games we 've averaged about eleven percent visitation outside of the four seven hundred 0102.103 area we 're hopeful with this that the drive market if they get they get on there and get tickets we 'll be promoting to them so part of our social media burst will go out outside of the region as well just to make sure they get the opportunity if they get tickets that that stimulates obviously that economic benefit for our hotels and hospitality offerings as well but i mean the hospitality offering is doing very well out of these games a lot of the venues both restaurants and and bars and pubs and clubs are doing very well very busy uh and you know it probably not a significant spike in retail activity uh that you could put your finger on but i 'm sure there would be some of that just people getting out and about in in the region um again uh the crowd will be under a covert plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capped at five thousand people uh how those tickets are allocated entirely up to the capras uh of course they will just give us a number at the end of the day and that is what we go on sale and i 've been very clear with them once they give us that number we won 't be going back on sale a second time if they have more to give so they will have to sell those privately this will probably happen very quickly but we can 't say we can 't announce a game for one i don 't know it uh but two um that 'll be done by the nrl and then passed on to us and as far as a ticketing time frame uh we this time around i think the nrl will be dictating little bit more when they want those tickets to go on sale so we 've put a number of provisos in place to make sure they 're going to set a deadline for us we 've set some deadlines for them to make sure we can achieve it and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one other thing that i wanted to cover off that was ticketing field signage i think there was some problems yes thank you thank you mayor uh yeah as far as this goes this uh this game will actually have a pre-game concert uh which we haven 't been able to have entertainment in the past uh because of the covert bubble they didn 't want anyone on the field but they 're allowing the capras to run a pre-game concert so it 'll be like a 12 o 'clock opening if it 's an afternoon game and they 'd have about two or three hours of entertainment of which we can start to brand up and help them brand that there will be additional tv opportunities if assuming we get the game that they 're speaking about or the time frame we should be on channel nine as well as foxtel which would open up some more opportunities for tv coverage for us they certainly alluded to this one being a channel nine game as well as a foxtel game so you know we will we will work we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in case and we sent them a lot of our vignette what 's called vignettes which is our short clips of rockhampton and the region as well so we 'll just rehash those and get them back and try and get them in we also in those first couple of games provided with a number of highlights of what you can do in the region for the commentators it wasn 't used widely on foxtel but i 'm led to believe channel 9 may use some of that so you know we can 't make they can 't make a lot of guarantees on that and nor can i but you know we will do everything possible to get as much as we can there will be a little bit more signage around the ground certainly the sideline i 've had a fairly frank conversation about last week not being on that sideline sign it will actually cover the three three of the four uh sidelines if i call it that so one two sidelines and and one of the end lines up on the northern end so yeah yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coverage there we 'll also review the signage we 're using around the ground and see if we can beef that up but there is a fair bit there and obviously i 've tried to keep this at a minimal cost to us as well and that 's why i hadn 't bought any new flags or anything like that really the the money we 'd spend on being on the core flip signage that had been around and we made that fairly generic so we can reuse that at other events as well so and as i said it 's it 's got our dual logos on that as well so so the recommendation uh that rocky regional council approver sponsorship for 25 000. plus provide ticketing services at cost towards a bid for an old match to be held in rockhampton during september so i 'd have to read all that thanks greg um yeah again that uh difference in this game is that it 's a semi-final game uh the four o 'clock time slot uh and there 's a half an hour lead-in on that free-to-air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one last night in makai they 've got it they 've got a fair fair uh run on that as they lead into that game so i think there 's opportunity there we can provide some some information to them to take the best advantage of that uh being free-to-air um greg were you able to get a an idea on the coverage with free to air what uh what type of uh i couldn 't enroll didn 't answer my question yeah so no it 's it 's significant anyway i know that uh wide i got a couple of lights on at the table so i 'll go to those first and then see if there 's any online council wickets and then councilman it 's councilworkers yep thanks mr mayor and thanks for your report greg absolutely support this it 'll put us on the radar with uh other opportunities with nrl and and beyond uh but just a few questions uh this one another bids presented by queensland kappas is that the same as the previous two i thought it was the trust that put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because what what we did last time again because it moved so quickly that last time we actually included all three uh so that we covered ourselves in that last one whereas after that we worked out who was signing the agreement ended up being the campers so we sort of we sponsored and put all three there but in the end the money went to the capras anyway as it will this time so officially that 's who signed the agreement uh so this time i was able to narrow that down because i know who 's signing the agreement was last time i didn 't know yeah no i understood um and you answered one of them i guess in part about the other sponsorship opportunities with the live to wear we 've got a range of great explore rockhampton uh full commercials there 's an opportunity for that as that 's something we 've got to pay more for included in the deal council that 's certainly a paid paid deal and we can price that up and see what that looks like for us as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually be able to get some coverage uh throughout the football as such yeah that 's right so probably more people watching that as well to be honest with you so yeah no very good yeah and the last couple of probably covered related on sort of you know thinking about that at the moment you know truck drivers and whatever uh the the bubble that the nrl work in is there uh or all safeguards being put in place so there 's no interchange between say local players or spectators or officials and the traveling teams is there yeah i mean the capital cq rugby league council they have this covered bubble under control we don 't have a lot of control over that but watching how they 've done it in the past two games uh certainly there 's no interaction with the players the boots get thrown over to the fans which is a great thing as well and other things which was fantastic but and even the press conferences there 's a lot of security around that they come they come up the stairs you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're barricaded away from people so yeah but that 's purely driven by cq rugby league and the capras that one yeah okay and probably the final one is that uh in the event that there is a a total lockdown and the game can 't proceed uh do we get a refund yes correct there 's no payment payment is unsuccessful delivery of the game and and obviously the other commitments in the contract in way of signage and things like that so yeah okay excellent thank you very much thanks cancer workers and council majors thanks very much mr mayor through you too greg um councillor wickerson covered most of my questions actually so which is very good now that 's no problem whatsoever um so i can make it very simple um greg i just wanted to confirm that obviously um you 're saying that we 're reusing a lot of the signage and that 's type of thing that say uh and i would imagine most of the marketing marketing we will do we 're doing will be social media so there 's no uh real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the costs that are there we 'll still be going against ir 's marketing budget correct so we 'll consume labor costs within our current budgets no matter whether so councillors may not be aware that we we have a working group of about 10 and on the day of ticket sales we have a working group of about 20. so with all those costs consumed by us uh as part of that but those those have been very short-lived things as well as far as marketing costs they 'll be consumed in the advanced roadhampton budget so we 've consumed a lot of that already producing the signage that we did produce uh any additional stuff we decide to do this time around will obviously be borne by our ar tourism budget as well and marketing fantastic thanks very much and mr merritt also just like to say that obviously you know with the events and that type of thing i 'm very mindful of the budget that we 're working with but you know if we look at the amount of money we 're talking about for such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could get bang for buck the the amount of marketing and advertising we 're going to get nationally and hopefully if we go free to air the 25 000 we couldn 't do any advertising campaign that would even touch that so i think this is a very good very good business sense and i think with the great work that ir team do and presenting a professional product i 'm very um keen to support this so thanks for bringing it to the table thanks councilman yeah if you 're right it 's um uh once in a lifetime opportunity to get that type of coverage for that for that expense uh that outlay um and it 's it 's um again once in a lifetime opportunity to get a semi-final game played in uh played in the air and backyard so i think that 's again being nimble and being able to bring those reports to the council table and and address that uh i think overall for the for the two games we 've already had plus this one uh it really has put rocky on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite thankful that we 've had this opportunity um be it through covered that that it 's arisen so um but anyway that 's uh it 's a great outcome cancers any questions on online there i know we 've got a quite a few uh out there i think videos yeah no she said she i 'd asked her just to um uh speak up if there was something there but if she when we come to the vote she 'll she 'll say the yeah or nay uh if that 's the case um so if there 's no further questions there to greg or the or the officers i 'll uh i 'll seek a mover and a second uh with regards to that i 'm happy to move and and seek a second uh councillor mathers oh hang on did you want to question council of election that i 'll put that days in favor hi thank you motion 's carried unanimously thanks councillor kirkland i i do appreciate that um that important struggle you 've got with your rit at the moment but uh cancels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the uh for the city in the region that we can really um hang our hats on that 's going to be a great uh great outcome for that outlet uh there being no more uh items councils we 'll uh we 'll declare the meeting closed and thank everyone for your attendance thank ups you [Music] [Music] is [Music] so [Music] so [Music],"(-23.3786203, 150.5088889)"

under the state government um was amended to remove a number of provisions regarding the management of of waste and it was expectation at the time that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number eight um in 2018 council adopted local law number eight um but however at this at that time um for for some reason or another the designation of the waste collection area and the definitions around that were excluded from that adoption so this is just trying to tidy up a bit of an administrative process around that so there 's a number of recommendations i won 't go through them all but again it 's really around defining the local government area as the region so the designated waste collection area is the region and then the waste collection areas are areas within the designated waste collection area where domestic and commercial waste and recycling collection services are provided areas are as marked on the designated waste collection area maps and are subject to change by council as a result of future land development and planning requirements so there 's also so some additional recommendations there again coming from the regulation over into the local law around definition of recyclable waste definition of standard general waste containers definition of industrial waste containers so it 's a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council okay thanks very much michael and apologies council wickerson i should have recognized you as the portfolio uh spokesperson for the previous item i didn 't uh that 's fine through my agendas there but uh again probably with the the chair did the chair of the uh waste wanted to make any comment thanks mr man yes as michael has rightfully said long time coming and it will be good to tidy this up yeah thank you councillor wickerson question um yes thank you mr manager through you to michael um with the definition of what 's recyclable waste um can that be uh revised at any time because i know we 're looking at polystyrene too or the sacramento plastics and things like you know solar panels if ever we have to uh we 'll get to a stage we can recycle those we can just amend that definition at any stage um through the chair that definition is related to um the kerbside recycling service um not recycling in general okay and uh yes it can be changed and actually as a matter of fact uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to council about the composition of that yellow lidded bin and what it may be what it may look like or what we may want it to look like in the future with some of the changes happening around you know banning single-use plastics and packaging covenant changes at the federal and state level as well so it can change and it i would suggest it will likely change okay thank you very much okay thanks very much michael uh councillor kirkland um thank you mr mayor uh michael could i just ask around this policy whether the the mapping and that sort of thing is is including like it 's specific to people who will be conducting recycling surfaces and where they 're allowed to be is that that 's my understanding of it is that correct so we have so the the whole region rockhampton regional council the whole region is the designated um i 'll just get the term right the designated waste collection area and then within that region within that area we have then areas where we will and we will not provide services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's expensive we 've got a series of maps which capture those properties that are rated for and those properties that we therefore service with the curbside waste and recycling service outside of those map boundaries we have a process where we can if a resident says look i 'm outside of your collection area but i 'd like a service can you please provide it we have a criteria under our procedure which we assess that request and then on a merits basis we either accept it or we don 't accept it if that property is accepted then we include that properly that property alone within our mapping system to capture it for forever and a day as as having a surface we as having a service so we do a geocortex through our through our it gis team and we capture that property and then that 's included thank you michael so it 's specific to our particular operations within that within that um field of recycling not to other businesses that would be conducting okay thank you just right thanks counselors good questions um yeah see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move and move into the action uh seek a second councillor smith i 'll put that those in favor against carried thanks welcome moving on

thanks very much martin good morning thank you sorry okay so good morning mayor and councillor so this morning i 'm just presenting the interim management report from audit from our interim audit that was conducted in march up to the 31st of march the management letter hasn 't identified any significant deficiencies in council 's internal controls and we seem to be proceeding quite well under what we what our audit plan our accidental audit plan has been set at the beginning of the year so there 's no real concerns that um thomas noble and russell as the delegate of the auditor general have identified in terms of what we 're working on currently and what our our processes are there are a couple of deficiencies that have been identified in the report however you will note that they are ready to be addressed either or have been addressed or will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything is going quite well probably the only thing that i would highlight is that we have some probably issues in relation to our asset capitalization processes which have been highlighted in the report and we 're working with the auditors on that currently to try and resolve some of those issues before the 30th of june very much marnie i understand it 's a moving feast and uh with those asset management plans coming online now that uh that streamlines the organisation to be able to make sure we where as those audit reports are undertaken that we 're achieving those goals and milestones so uh something there we need to watch but part of the the requirement this report uh needs to be uh presented to the table and uh that 's uh that 's where it 's at so cancel i 'm happy to move uh as recommendation as as recommended and uh seek a second subject to any questions second council of kirkland i 'll put that those in favor against carrie thanks very much thank you 9.7 the 2021 operational plan quarterly report quarterly quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks alyssa good morning mr marin councillors the report this morning is in two parts so i 'll start by jumping to the bottom because i think that 's probably the easiest part of the report before we do our progress report and throw to each of our relevant general managers and executive managers so the second part of the report before you is some minor amendments to our existing operational plan um and essentially what 's been included is the changes previously approved by council to reflect the updates to the council of portfolios so if you 're looking at your agenda on page 111 we 've updated the table um there and following this meeting further to our deputy ceo 's report we will also include councillor wickerson in that new assistant um role so as well as that table throughout the actual operational plan um against each of the relevant actions and targets where it relates to each portfolio we 've updated the names in accordance with those changes that were made as well so that 's all quite minor and really just attached for your convenience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the report then is our quarter three operational plan quarterly report um so you all be familiar with this report now in the layout essentially it is a summary of our progress in relation to our operational plan um and how we 're performing against our actions to date as well as setting out those performance plans for each of our three business units uh the current report template um is as at 31 march so those new portfolio names won 't be updated in today 's report they will be in next quarters quarter four because those changes weren 't made at that point um and also it 's just worth noting that um the actions so this is on page 79 of the agenda actions 1.19 1.10 and 1.11 relating to our water treatment plants the responsible area um relating to those in our next report we 'll move from vitro river water to project delivery so that will all be coming through in the quarter four report that you will see next quarter so running through now our progress report will use the same format as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relevant executive managers and general managers to provide an overview of relevant highlights and low lights within their areas so first we have the executive manager of advancera campton greg i believe he is on webex yes greg how are you good morning good morning mayor and councillors i 'll try and be brief but you know that 's very difficult for me but uh i hope you can all hear me uh okay so probably from an industry development point of view uh very much an increased uh industry and stakeholder engagement quarter for us uh some 14 industry events held in that time uh some very broad just with the business community trying to get them engaged in what we 're doing at council and at advanced rockhampton uh some more specific in the likes of a property event and a renewable energy event uh another one uh with the regional uh precinct activation survey uh which went very well with a live a live survey at the event last week uh or the week before last sorry uh from a mining construction point of view continue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key coal asmti contractors for a renewable energy point of view uh you know engaged with about nine companies in this quarter a bit gold wind up at club creek neon epiron cq power gen x uh from the agriculture and water a real target for us is uh working with a new agricultural company trying to get get them to get a cq base up here uh so we 'll continue to to fight that good fight and hopefully we 'll achieve that flying them with the right premises very soon uh from a development point of view lots written about two key cbd uh sites in the loft uh which has has commenced and launched uh in the gallery two uh which is is uh has launched and is selling well um probably other industry things e-scooters we all know uh that presentation that the eoi has now closed uh so we will be progressing with that uh in due course uh the region 's rising summit i have spoke about in the past but if anyone wants to know any more about that please ask tourism industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got billboards all around the state whether they be for tourism and marketing point of view or industry marketing uh also the new tourism video that has been nominated for a queensland tourism award and those awards will be held in a couple of weeks time from events point of view well we 're all pretty aware of the larger events but you know with australia day and anzac day uh both went off very well in my eyes anyway uh rocky nats uh we will have we 've got some and that 's team in town today and yesterday uh we 'll have the final report for that sometime over the next week hopefully uh and beef uh you know i mean from the ar and council team the city looked great uh you know dropper rain helped that but also the teams whether they be parks and gardens uh you know the activations that my team sort of put around the town were great the tours from the tourism team went very well and then the trade stand out there was well frequented uh out of peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got some questions that 's probably a comment greg i think uh rockhampton certainly is on everyone 's radar across the nation after beef and uh credit to the team and we 're getting some fantastic uh emails coming through about how magnificent the the town looked uh in the presentation for beef and uh credit to all the staff involved in uh in undertaking that to put our put our town on the in this in the spotlight during beef uh was really something uh everyone needs a pat on the back and i 've asked the ceo to make sure that memo from those comments are passed out to the to everyone in the organization about how how well they 've done and uh and a great pat on the back uh for that effort but uh a lot of work happening in uh in economic development and uh i 'm sure there 'll be some um great connections and networks that were made over those weeks during those events and more people interested in our region going forward so looking forward to very promising times as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurring across the region so i think it 's a busy time for everyone and it 's great to see that uh we 're all pushing in the same direction well done that 's for sure and there if i could make a comment if you 're talking about beef week you know you 've made it when you make have you been paying attention the show that 's on monday nights uh beef week and rockhampton got about 10 mentions last night so some in a very funny way but uh in general rockhampton and beef certainly starred on have you been paying attention again everyone needs to take credit for and uh that is putting uh rockhampton in the in the cq on the on the national radar and i 'm sure the other regions are all benefited from beef as well and it 's great to see that we can put our put our our region on the on the map so to speak uh that said councils any questions with regards to greg 's presentation we might move on thanks alyssa thank you so next we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is not to say any of the other uh department 's owners are important uh ross but uh you know that 's a that 's pretty high benchmark we need to uh move on from but yeah it 's a hard act to follow that 's it yeah thank you very much ross all the stuff greg said we supported and helped with that so that 's about it it 's a good starting point mate thank you so um thank you miss me and look um i guess a couple of things through the last quarter in our customer service area we 've handled over 28 000 enquiries by the phone counter and online and done 691 rate searches in that quarter alone which has been a pretty big uptake we have been struggled a little bit to meet some of our kpis with the answering phone with that we did take some resources out later in the year and we 've also had an influx of of inquiries we actually had a lot of inquiries through the rocky nets and the mount morgan water supply too which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's we 're still working on that so we will we will improve um the um angus and world and strategy and planning um you will see in that report several red dots there but they 've been undertaking a mountain of work um those items that haven 't been completed there 's certainly significant progress towards one of them there is our report today in confidential session so that will um close that one off so there is still a mountain of work there the budget you 're all financial well and truly across how that has been progressing so i won 't spend any time on that one and the other area we have had in our some notable things in our corporate technology particularly our procurement we 're meeting 90 of our suppliers are being paid on time which we do a a seven day payment we 're a bit shorter there so we 're actually meeting 90 percent to get people paid so that 's good um we have um 100 uh sorry of our top 100 top suppliers we 've got 92 on purchasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our key indicators as well to get our best bang for buck and we 're also [Music] processing all our correspondence target is 95 to process on time and we 're at 100 of that meeting out the times to meet that um mr won 't go into airport i 'll let marcus do that uh when he gets to his um but that 's a quick overall a quick take on how our progress for the quarter but happy to take any questions okay thanks very much ross questions councils council smith just mainly a comment mr mayor i 'm not sure how we get purchasers or prospective purchasers of properties to do extra searches i think the normal rate search doesn 't reveal a lot of things i 've just had one instance in gracemere where the block of land was actually in a flood zone and i had to get an mcu and build the land up when the builder had already given a quote so i 'm not sure how we we encourage people to do those extra searches i don 't know it 's always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get caught they don 't know they think that the solicitor has done all the searches um when they 've only done the basic searches and it may be maybe something um as an example we could do some meteor on just to again push that message out there to make sure they do those searches to to highlight with those overlays and as time changes there 's always further overlays and things that could could be occurring so it 's a it 's probably prudent that we look at doing some media there just to remind purchase people purchasing properties to make sure they do the due diligence and make sure they check all those uh have all those searches undertaken before they they sign the check that 's a good point uh thanks very much ross no other questions to ross area thanks very much ross i know the work that angus and the team are doing in the background too is a lot of a lot of positive work and uh really pushing uh moving our region forward thanks ross thanks melissa thank you next is our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alicia councillors i was pleased um in terms of the homeless connect event um because of covered last year we certainly couldn 't have it but especially now given that the shortage of homes in rockhampton or vacant properties um we managed to sort of reshape that event and still deliver it through covert and so what we ended up doing is just distributing food vouchers and i guess hygiene baskets if you if you like through the hands of compassion food banks so we 've managed to get 200 vouchers out there and that has made we 've had some really great feedback on that front in doug 's world we are absolutely under the pump in terms of the increase in the residential development activity um we 've seen that more depletion of all the available blocks that are out there for sale that they 've been snapped up so we 're also getting that flow on to the development application increase as well so it 's a great pickup great to see but also hearing around some of the delays in building certification not just at our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those kpis just like um that ross mentioned with the increase in activity our team is also under quite a lot of pressure with the increased volume on the botanic gardens front um really pleasing to see the number of workshops that we 've had and the the development or the redevelopment project progressing well we 're going to have another workshop this month on that to bring back some of the outcomes so it 's very exciting to have that project happening and we 'll sort of start to see the fruits of the labour there the meerkat encounters have been hugely successful and they 've kicked off in this quarter so again the number of um facebook pop-ups and things like that that you see of people enjoying that it 's a great tourism product for rockhampton also in the flying foxes we have commenced the sorry in the gardens we 've commenced the removal or moving on i should say of the flying foxes it so far hasn 't been as uh quick as what we would have hoped so at this point in time we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a break and then we 'll restart after the break um the other thing that 's going on in parks is that we 've got a quite i guess intensive internal project and that is about about realizing like or reviewing some of the processes and structures around in the parks area so the yield or the whole goal of that is to basically make men more and women more efficient in terms of the mowing so eliminate like a lot of those overheads and so that we can get more time out there mowing so that sort of is coming we 've had what we 've done is pull resources from other areas of council and and put it into there so starting to see the benefits of that as well there 's been some really good positive comments that have come out of there so i think that it 's also making some cultural improvements in that space which is great on in john 's world we 've successfully delivered the heritage village consultation and now we 're working on the reopening of the village and we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilgrim theatre which again got lots of lovely comments ross has always already mentioned that there 's a number of um red dots i suppose in the planning space they 're around the 1.2 numbers in the operational plan report but i guess from our perspective we rely upon angus to do that and what we have seen is just leaps and bounds improvements in terms of our planning undertaken the red dots really relate to the time frame not the effort that has gone into those things so thanks to him and similarly with the community assistance review which i mentioned earlier in the day is that i 'm also ann is helping me out in that space so that will come through it 's just we haven 't met those timelines that are in the report and that 's it from me thanks very much alicia look um again that that department in that section um fantastic work to john aaron and angus and all that support that 's coming through from the background the comments and um hell and being able to get out to beef where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a record um just hearing how wonderful the city looks from the riverbank to the botanic gardens to mount archer people so many comments were just how how um how beautiful rockhampton really is now and how modern it 's starting to look so those comments are repeated throughout the day but the parks and gardens and the work that the team have been doing there and yourself as a director uh credit to everyone there in that space but uh we realize there 's a lot of uh a lot of pressure on the planet planners at the moment especially with uh with the development and what 's occurring which is a great thing but it puts pressure on the department whether we can supply that demand at the moment so again uh the ceo 's made knowledge of that and i think it 's something that we can work to to try and um take the pressure off there but uh it 's it 's a great thing to have but a bad bad thing as well if we can 't achieve what we 're trying to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone in in the department i 'm sure everyone 's working as hard as and as diligently as they possibly can and yeah i should have sorry i should have mentioned and made mention of the parks group and how they have worked so hard to get everything up to scratch it hasn 't doesn 't finish now just with beef of course we 've got the rocky river run show and it on it rolls but um and understand we had that uh that that rain that was there and then pushed pushed a little bit harder to uh put us behind the schedules but uh yeah it 's great to see that everything was all spruced up for beef and uh it 's great to great to see the city looking the way it is yeah thank you for the region thanks alyssa thank you next is our general manager for regional services peter where the rubber hits the road peter good morning uh mayor and councillors okay thanks peter i 'll talk generally about overall the capital program we look like we 're going to achieve around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of 130 across council so it 's probably going to be a bit of a record spend i think this year fortunately we haven 't been impacted very much by covert and that was a real risk in supply but there 's been the odd item in some projects but it hasn 't delayed any projects so we 've been very lucky there okay that 's fantastic 100 million dollars in capital works that 's uh that 's a record there and something there that the team needs to be okay the first uh major project i want to talk about is the rockhampton airport feasibility study for the levy [Music] the project in this current quarterly report talks about december 21 it won 't be completed until february march and you 'll notice that in the budget process that we 've actually moved some money to next year there 's two reasons one is there were some existing resource problems with the consultancy and the second thing is we 've added another option that we think we needed to explore while we were there so the project is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outcome at the end of that project project number two is rockhampton museum of art project is on track uh to be handed over by from the contractor to council first of july and from that point on it will they 'll start the commissioning and the fitting out of the entire artwork which will take some time there 's been some challenges in that project which are really about some original supply of faulty materials we 've just delayed the project and used up a lot of our float but we have still been able to keep it within that one july and for anyone who 's seen it it 's starting to look quite impressive inside there will be another we we are planning to give you another look at it just before opening but we 're in a we 're we 've been in a period where we 're testing the building for um effectively pressure testing and um that pressure testing has taken a while to pass effectively so what we do is we pressurize the building and look how many leaks there is and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little bit too much but we 've been able to rectify that and it 's been all approved and passed and so now what that enables us to do is actually do the final painting and chip prop work so that 's where the ark area is the next two projects i want to talk about are all three are relating to frw the glenmore water treatment plant is underway we 've issued the contract it 's in the design phase so that design phase will continue for the next few months before physical works on site starts north rockhampton sewage treatment plant is it also in the design review stage so there 's a design completed at a concept top design that is under review and we are looking to be able to go out to tender around the end of june grey smear series trooper plant is just lagging behind that so as soon as we 've sorted north rockhampton we will start the same process which is a design process and then tender shortly following airport the airport is on schedule to be completed on the 30th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is actually the upstairs section of the airport we are just negotiating with the state government they want to do a media or a launch but we 've got a complication in terms of that the upper is funded by state and the law is funded federally so we 're trying to work out how we do that without creating more walls as you might know okay so we 'll work our way through that the the final total thing as i said it 's 36 september and they 're just now starting the roof replacement which is the final piece okay and the only other thing i want to draw your attention to which is the individual actions [Music] there 's two i want to draw your attention to the first red dot is the floodplain risk management plan for frenchman 's and tasers greek if you recall that project effectively through a change in budget has been unfunded this year so it 'll remain read it won 't no work will be done on it and we will see how we go in this current budget process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there at the moment to undertake that study in the next year okay and i think that 's all for me oh one last that 's it one more there will be a report coming to council in the next month on bushfire risk we 've done a lot of work on reviewing bush fire risk across this region and we will be tabling a bush fire management strategy which is very much targeting mount archer mount morgan those hot spots and a series of actions and requirements for council and other agencies so that um is going to the local it 's been to the ldmg and discussed it will now come to council for endorsement of that strategy so um there was a lot of work over the last nine months on that just been a big effort okay and that 's it for me okay thanks very much peter again a lot of work in that space and it 's great to hear when you look at that report we see a lot of red red dots but when you hear the reasons behind that and uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are coming from all different angles to to push those uh timelines but a lot of them would be near nearing completion or or um changing their their uh their rating on that on that score so it 's great work hearing about the museum of art and what 's involved in that and also the the airport uh again 100 million dollars worth of uh capital projects uh for a year record uh record delivery you can understand why some of those red dots are popping up so uh that said uh under covert conditions and and what 's happening in the region it 's uh it 's it 's also very important that we understand that uh looking at this report so again peter if you can pass on thanks to to the team um on on every level i 'm sure everyone 's working as the best they possibly can and to achieving those targets as we go through in the operational plan councils any questions to peter 's report at all if not thanks very much peter thank you thank you so now we will move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual performance plans for our commercial business units so first off is our manager for virtual river water good morning marion councillors and media thank you look i won 't talk for too long hopefully you 've all had a chance to read the operational plan report um i will just touch quickly on page six of the report itself uh you all know the situation in mount morgan happy to provide a more extensive update perhaps next week at the workshop on what 's happening there but certainly the dichotomy or the perhaps the large difference between what 's happening in mount morgan versus what 's happening in the map in the barrage is just so striking given the dearth of rainfall around the area so one is nearly empty and the other one is 100 full again which is great to see for rockhampton but obviously not so good for mount morgan page 11 looking at the environment theme just a couple of key items to touch on there and again hopefully you 've had the chance to read those is the work to establish the south rockhampton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so the distribution network is is essentially completed for that and we 're in the process now of engaging a contractor to install the pumps and finalize the electrical and mechanical aspects of that work and then possibly as early as late june early july we should commence actual first supply of recycled water to a number of nearby customers so that 's that 's progressing quite well and the second item there is really just to touch on the solar project which is proceeding quite well a glamour water treatment plant it 's gone through a 30 design stage and within the next two to three weeks we expect to see final design on on that installation with the contractor arriving on site probably within the next month or so to actually commence site works in other words some clearing and preparing for installation of of their various componentry so that 's that 's progressing quite uh well at this stage i will touch on the fact that i think in the operational plan targets at the time at which those targets were being set um probably may june @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we nominally set a completion date for 30th of june this year that 's clearly not going to be met and you 'll see that noted in the operational plan targets report i won 't talk too much more about some of the other significant projects peter 's covered off on those but if you turn to page 16 there are a couple of items there that i 'd like to point out to you in the local government leader theme uh under the water and supporting a better environment section there some fairly significant items actually so as is normally the case each year the queensland government i guess invite the queensland water directorate release their urban potable water and sewage benchmarking report which is essentially a benchmarking report for all waters water service providers local government or other across queensland again frw and council have been shown to perform very well against their peers without typically typically our strengths are in the low operating costs and value for money performance indicators that are published in these reports but also increasingly to demonstrate that we 're actually hitting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asset performance indicators such as water mains brakes for 100 kilometers and you know the customer interfaces that we have as well so i 'm actually happy to circulate that report it 's no longer in a pdf form it 's in a powerpoint presentation form but i can circulate that to counsellors for for um for your interest and the second item there of note is that and for some discussion next week hopefully as we 've continued to work towards finalizing the review of the water pricing regime and we 'll be presenting some some information about that next week with a view to hopefully soon reaching some council decision on on where to with that um just moving on to the frw performance plan so page 31 if you wish to try and follow on this is just the manager 's overview section of that report and most of what i really do want to talk about is on that same page i guess quite some positively for fitzroy over water we 've we 've performed well again through this quarter with the majority of our 22 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll see in our performance plan that are listed as watching and they tend to be some of those more aspirational kpis where again we we set ourselves some fairly high targets for response and rectification time um performance for for reactive work so we 've listed those as watching because they are already likely to not reach those fairly uh again aspirational targets for performance but certainly the majority of the targets are well on track and we 're very pleased with that but i 've listed five sort of key highlights there um drinking water quality has again been of a very high standard with greater than 99 compliance across all of the region uh in the final stages of sourcing water from number seven dam in mount morgan we had a very minor exceedance of a health guideline for trihalomethanes which are a type of molecule that are produced when chlorine reacts with organic carbon if you drink concentrations of that particular compound for a really long period of time like a lifetime it 's believed to potentially be harmful a one-off isolated event is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decision-making for for quickly moving to supply water from great smear rather than continuing to to deal with those issues you all know about mount morgan water restrictions and again you know the community has done a fantastic job dealing with those constraints but that 's that 's the ongoing challenge for us to continue to manage during this last quarter of future rival water completed some of the construction work to extend parts of the water supply network and grace me and some of you will already see some potential budget allocations for next financial year to continue a small amount of that work uh we 've collaborated with colleagues in the infrastructure planning section to have nearly finished our asset management plans with which are being reviewed and significantly uh updated and improved with respect to to some of the the gaps that used to be in those documents so we 're looking forward to bringing those to the council table in the near future and i think i 've already discussed the south rockhampton sewage treatment plant recycled water scheme um and suffice to say we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it 's completed and just on that same page there 's a little table there which is quite a useful summary of our financial performance at this stage we 're tracking very well in our operational budget uh we are seeing expenditure tracking at about 79 percent of year to date obviously based on a 75 of the year to date completed and operational revenue is at about 92 so it 's tracking very well also um with capital um we 're a little bit behind and in relation to some of those delays of some of the larger projects and that 's the main cause for a little bit of that but i would expect that that 'll ramp up quite significantly in the coming months so uh councillors i 'm happy to take any questions that you might have uh thanks very much jason um great report again credit to uh the works being undertaken with the mountain community and and working with that community with their water issues at the moment but uh i think the the the water quality with the transport of the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the complaints that we were receiving so we 'll just have to wait and uh and see how that takes us for the next significant rain event but in the interim still continue with the options that we what we 're working through and provide that back to the community at a point in time when we 've done those studies so um thanks again for the the work that was undertaken in that public consultation i think there 's still some more um tidying up in that area we need to probably uh look at it again and uh and make sure we 're informing our community about what uh what we 're doing in that area but overall the wastewater treatment plants uh upgrades i mean that 's uh intergenerational projects there that are going to accommodate the the growth of the region for the years to come but those lumpy bits of infrastructure there that are critical uh will be something that this council 's undertaking in the next coming year so uh again uh we 'll be bare in mind that it 's not the uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critical things that we need to uh implement and make sure that our community is steadfast in understanding that these pieces of infrastructure are required for the growth of the region as we go forward councils any questions to jason in that but again thanks very much for that report jason and credit to the team thanks mr mayor thanks councillors thank you so next is our manager for rockhampton regional waste and recycling to provide the quarterly progress report on the annual performance plan for that so listen counselors we might try and go through all these reports and then we 'll um we 'll take a recess before we go into the closed session if there 's a time there thank you thank you sparkle yeah thank you mayor and councillors um so before i get onto the rrwr report itself i 'll just go through the actions um on the bottom of pages 74 in the top of 75 in your pack so these are the actions specifically for rrwr within the overall report as you 'll see there there are four i 'll just go through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our financial and non-financial performance targets the implementation remedial works for the grace me landfill which is that final capping system um that was set to be complete by the 30th of june um this this year but we 're now looking like that 's going to be more like a an october november completion date so we 're we 're not going to hit the original target for that um lakes creek road landfill cell construction this is cell a1 which is the second of our piggyback cells again that was set for completion on the 31st of october last year we did hit a few hurdles with materials coming from overseas for that material and we 've and some other hurdles but um it 's very very close to complete now and confident that that one will be complete in june and where schedule just commence waste filling in that cell in july so and then the last one there is around our landfill gas management system at lakes creek road so that was set for completion in october last year and that one is completed and operating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that later on if we now go to the rrwr report manager 's overview so facilities and collections teams are both going very well and those operations are going along without issue our strategy and education piece of work is is very busy at the moment as council is aware we 're doing a lot of work around a garden organics and garden and food organics trial that we 're looking to kick off later this year and we 'll come back to council with more information on that i 've already spoken about salah one construction um landfill gas management so it 's it is it is complete but it 's obviously ongoing and it operates on a on a 24 7 basis um the the quantity of gas that we 're extracting is slowly starting to increase which is is good to see so we 're currently at about 290 cubic meters per hour at about 55 to 56 methane the significance of that is that in our contract that we have with our specialist provider there when that quantity reaches 350 cubes an hour at 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to power generation so sort of watching that volume very closely and i think the waste mass in the first cell cell a is still relatively new and you can see when you look at the gas composition coming from that waste mass that it 's starting to turn methanogenic which will mean that it 's starting to produce a bit more methane i would expect in the coming six months which may may push us beyond that 350 trigger to get to that business case stage so that 's that 's an exciting piece of work that we 're continuing to um work on very closely might just take a question from the table counseling thanks mr mayor michael sorry to interrupt you uh you were saying the other day with something on abc landline you 're telling me how many times more harmful methane is to uh as a greenhouse gas than carbon was it 27 times 27 times yeah so just to take that out of the that uh environment is uh an added benefit as well as maybe getting some energy from them too yeah 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're what we 're burning flaring off now that that currently flared off now that uh that generation that out of there that 's right that 's currently being flared and converted to carbon dioxide and and it is a project also registered with the um clean energy regulator and we will be getting carbon credits for that too i 'd expect hopefully the first carbon credits will come through in the first quarter of 2022 i 'm hoping for that project okay thanks michael um and the grace me our grey smear facility so there 's a lot going on out there um we 've we went out to tender for the construction of the final capping system um that tender assessment is now complete and we 're ready to award a contract there we 've just got a few budget challenges which we 're trying to resolve so that we can award that contract and then hoping that they can get started very quickly and have that project finished around october november at the same time now that the capping system design has been completed we 've commenced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoping to have that complete within the next sort of two to three months so we can go to tender for the construction of that transfer station for anyone who 's been out to that facility it 's it 's a very uh agricultural sort of it 's not a very impressive facility and with the growing community we 've got in gracemere we really need to invest a bit of money on that site and bring it up to the right standard from a perform from a financial performance perspective uh tracking uh pretty well um we 're below budget on on operating expenses which is which is good and that 's a continual focus for the team um capital budget we are a little bit behind where we should be tracking um hoping we 'll spend probably some six to seven hundred k between now and the end of the financial year but um unfortunately i 'm not expecting to hit the 95 target uh on capital all non-financial performance targets these are the you know the weekly collections and missed services and and the like we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the um for the three quarters for this financial year so that 's really pleasing this and and the team over there is really sort of humming along uh very nicely and i think with that i might just um leave it at that and happy to answer any questions thanks michael cancer 's questions again it 's another uh area of it but very busy wasting recycling as things move on and it 's an ever-changing space with legislation and requirements too and the needs of our community again thank you michael to you and your team for uh for the work that 's being undertaken okay we 'll move on thanks alyssa thank you next is our manager of airport to give the update on the annual performance plan for the quarter thank you uh morning mr mayor and councillors um i thought it 'd turn up in person today instead of webex of those issues we had the last previous two times we thought you were invisible we thought you 're in brisbane for a while there marcus but thank you mr mayor uh i 'll start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 46 of the report so airport 's showing continual recovery signs of good recovery throughout the period i know i continue to say that but that 's a good thing to to actually repeat that the airports continue continues to recover from the private covered pandemic passenger numbers seem to be strong airlines seem to be throwing volume at our airport which is good that promotes more travel keeps the prices down and and i guess confidence within not only the regional market here but confidence within the airline market so we 'll continue to work with those airlines moving forward to ensure those schedules and the volume and the seats and the capacity are there for our business travelers and visiting friends and family and i can 't see that changing unless there is another outbreak say in brisbane or wherever but the ford schedules are solid and have been during this quarter the other activity within the airport during the quarter has been solid as well the retail and the cafes obviously with more passengers flowing through you can see the spend rates going going in a positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good to see the cars actually in there again although the short-term car park seems to be a little bit less in favor than the long term at the moment and i guess that might be price driven people may seem to want to walk a bit further and save a few dollars but as that long term fills up it 'll cascade through to the short term as well the financial performance we 're a little bit behind with the revenue side but the budget is loaded to the back end of the financial year so the more passengers we get the more revenue so we 'll we 'll continue to see those patches passengers grow which the operational budget should be neutral at the end of the year the expenses operational expenses are below budget for now and the capex expenditure is below at the moment as well we 've got a few issues with contractors trying to get contractors on site with uh pricing and so on as well so hopefully we can we can engage with those guys to uh to get that going again but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh resealing which is good uh and the apron lighting so we 're we were non-compliant with the moss 139 which is what the uh airports what the it 's a bible for the airports basically so over the years uh it has changed to the lux levels that are required on the apron so we 've upgraded that and it 's actually great now it 's led lighting it 's nice and white it 's not orange like the old sodium vapor lights that we had so that 's uh that 's a big improvement and the airlines and the pilots are actually commented on how nice it looks at the night time when they actually hit the deck and fly in which is good i 'll go to the non-financial performance at again passenger numbers as i 've commented it 's it 's progressing well bird strikes uh we we had a shocker for quarter three there was 16 bird strikes um it 's the environment we live in so the lagoon at the end we 've got a bat colony which we 're working with the gardens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a seasonal um there 's a seasonal thing there 's no real explanation why it 's out of our control however we do monitor we uh mow the grass at certain levels to maintain uh i guess compliance in that area because if the grass is short it allows the birds to land near the airstrip so you keep it a bit longer in their legs and they feel uncomfortable so they can 't land properly so there 's little ish there 's little things that we can do to try and rectify that but it 's out of our control to be honest um sorry counselor did you have a question i saw you ready i can 't cancel kirkland sorry you mr mayor um yes i mean other bird strikes is a concern and i just wanted to ask you marcus if i may um the process for when there 's a bird strike is that that that tell me what happens as far as the costing that 's uh how the airport is impacted with those yeah yeah so it 's a huge cost to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it hits a bird it has to have engineer certification to fly again so it 'll it 'll sit there if there 's no engineer on site which virgin will be having an engineer soon again but if it 's say a qantas flight they have to fly an engineer up they have to make sure it 's safe to fly airworthy so that 'll that bird will sit there for the next two to three hours or whenever an engineer can can get there so it 's a huge cost to the airline it 's the reputation of the airport uh as well with bird strikes so no one wants to be known as an airport with lots of bird strikes it 's not what we strive to do and that 's why we have these targets so the process of when at bird strike when a pilot radiates back to say he thinks he 's hit a bird we do a run of the runway to find if there 's a carcass there or not if there is some kind of carcass we actually take samples of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then we track what species within the area and i guess there 's different methods to rectify or mitigate the risk on on what particular birds around the around the area um thank you marcus if i may through you mr chair certainly councillor kirkland just the um bird versus bat is there a breakdown there is uh i tread with caution uh sorry i don 't have that data and i can take that on notice and get back to you on that however the bats are quite high at the moment yep thanks very much marcus and apologies council kirk and just me and male i can 't do two things at once i was trying to read an email and then looked up and seen your line i 'm sorry about that my apologies but thanks very much marcus uh moving on just with the lost time injuries that is marked not on track but we had a few in the first q1 and q2 q3 we 're back on um and to assist with lost time injuries within our workplace we you know the toolbox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly the the 18-week safety program at the moment we 're cascading that down through the whole team as well and just reinforcing what we need to do and be aware of throughout the organization out there so not that we weren 't doing that previously but we 've just made it more of a focus to to combat that um and also the hazard inspections uh we 're on track for q3 but previously we weren 't overall the airport uh is running very well it 's compliant we had a home affairs inspection earlier uh i believe in q3 it might have been later in q2 however the report back was a double plus i think they gave us which is great and that includes new screening equipment as well so they actually tested that and the feedback was uh was very impressive so overall the airport compliant safe and the teams working well together so i 'm uh happy to take any questions again marcus uh pass on thanks to the team the the airport 's had a spruce up and the the gardens and everything looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palms really really does highlight a regional airport of significance in the region so uh in the nation so i think people coming in and town during beef would have really noticed that and i was having again comments uh coming through from the public uh how wonderful the airport 's looking at the moment and and that development uh can 't wait for that opening that uh i think all councils are looking very forward to that uh opening and something there that we can work on but all the uh the operational side of it again uh congratulations to the team for the work they 're undertaking thank you mr man evan did you have anything you want to add it was quite a comprehensive overview there might not be anything left yeah i don 't think i have much more to add that one mr mayor and councillors but overall you can hear how busy the organisation is is in delivering for the community so it 's wonderful to actually hear all this and take it all in at once instead of hearing bits and pieces so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address it really does um highlight how diverse a regional council of our scale is when we 've got our own water service in their own airport it just adds to the the the size of this council i 'm sure a lot of the other council will be very envious of us and what we 're able to achieve but it comes back to the staff that operate these departments and how well they all work in delivering for their community so it 's a credit to everyone um and and the council team for supporting that so i think it 's a great uh great way forward councilor smith you um oh yeah just a question just a question i wasn 't quite sure where it sat um because the media team were actually driving it we had some disaster funding i think it was after the grace of their fires for billboards for our some of our rural communities and we did like a couple of years ago we did start the project but we haven 't heard any more about it just i 'll get damond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you through the chair the digital billboards project yes our team was involved in obviously the securing of funding and then the identification of relevant sites and scope of works that project has now moved over into [Music] ross 's world in terms of the role out there in corporate services with drew stevenson and his team i 'm happy to give some feedback or some further information to councils in terms of the exact rollout although i do believe um it will be by the end of this financial year but um i can provide some further information to we can take councillors to confirm that take that question on council smith and uh come back with that one it 's not uh that 's not something there but we 'll make sure that information is provided about that uh funding and what 's available there sorry that 's okay uh look counsellors um if there 's no further questions can i seek your move in a second with the officer 's recommendation and receive the operational quarterly report for quarter three and that the adopt the amendments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move councillor kirkland second head counselor election i 'll put that those in favor proposed carried unanimously thanks very much councillors uh council

looking for a uh approval to move forward with the new committee so that we can commence uh with them as part of the 2021 show okay thanks very much and a pretty straightforward recommendation there council smith did you want to make any comment uh as part of that committee member uh no i 'm very happy with that um thanks a great committee um time 's running out but i 'm sure we 'll have a meeting soon so yeah great recommendation uh thanks annette and that 's uh yeah that 's that 's the case with uh always with the inaugural events or events that we haven 't done before it 's it 's uh it 's a bit of nervous times but once they 've once they 've gone through that process and it 's uh it 's pretty easy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that said there 's a lot of work that goes on the background in uh in preparing those events so good luck with the uh the the 2021 rocky show so uh we 'll i 'll seek a move in a second with regards to those recommendations though uh move councillor kirkland second and councillor mothers uh put that those in favor against carrick unanimously thanks very much thank you excuse me um move on to the budget governance and other matters uh 9.2 budget summary management report for the period ending the 31st of march 2021. thanks very much manny thank you mr mayor good morning councillors and mayor and other attendees so i presented is the summary budget management report for the period ended 31st of march 2021 it 's recommended that the report be received you will note that the total operating revenue is at 90 percent of the revised budget with key components contributing to this percentage being rates and utility charges at 97 of the budget having been levied and due and payable on the 24th of february private works and recoverable works are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water sales and the timing of works done by the civil operations teams for main roads and grants and subsidies budgets are behind at 56 percent this is due to the timing of the federal assistance grant our interest revenue is ahead of budget at 86 which uh historically remains ahead of budget for the first six months of the financial year moves closer to the budget in the second half however this is tracking quite well and other revenue items are in proximity to the budget in relation to the operating expenditure 70 of the revised budget is where it 's currently sitting contractors and consultants are at 61 asset operational is at 69 and administrative expenses are at 51 attributed to reduce activity for councils venues and events rocky nats was held in early april but uh the expenditure for this event is yet to be forthcoming through the books so we 'll see that um flowing through probably in the april reporting and other expenses are sitting around the 949 percent so overall it 's traveling quite well in terms of our actuals to budget for 2021. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the budget expectations with the majority of the capital revenue budgeted to be received from grants and subsidies that are tied to so those particular projects that we 're undertaking and our capital expenditure is at 56 the major projects that such as the art gallery and the airport are progressing well and you 'll see that the capital program over 12 million dollars was spent during march this year which um has seen that expenditure level increase and it 's anticipated to increase as the work continues over the last three months of the financial year investments are sitting at 85.5 million so that 's our cash of bank um as that the 31st of march and our loans are around the 121 million dollars as at the end of the month so presented to you there 's any questions thanks very much money any questions counsellors council rutherford question um yes thanks manny i was just wondering with the um rates and utility charges we 're about five million dollars um behind there it that would be to do with the last quarter for water to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in yet so the final quarter has to be recognized and that should then bring that within budget i would expect based on the current figures that we 're seeing for actuals over the last three quarters for water utilization through the year thank you very much um and one more mr mayor and that was probably just around the contractors and consultants um the budget revised budget was increased um quite significant i think 1.3 million um is there a um is there something you can give us about why that increase was there in that item uh kessler but i think that was to do with the plans for the botanics and the master planning and things like that i 'm pretty sure those consultancy budgets are increased to reflect that additional expenditure in preparation of the next financial year all right thank you thank you um council said yeah we 're after three quarters of the year gone through now and uh everything 's mostly in line with our expectations it 's uh it 's uh it 's good to see uh just um watching those airport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positive but it 's always something that we need to be mindful of moving forward with snap lockdowns and so forth that that could impact on the budget going forward but that 's uh that 's out of our hands we just have to manage that as we go forward but if there 's no further questions with regards to that recommendation i 'm happy to move and seek a seconder secondary council election i 'll put that those in favor against carrie thanks very much councillors we have a late uh item on the uh on the ordinary meeting um delegations to the ceo melissa thank you mr mayor and good morning councillors this report seeks council 's approval to delegate various powers to our chief executive officer under the nature conservation animals regulation um 2020 so we currently are guided by lgaq they provide a service in advising us what powers are updated repealed etc that then triggers us reviewing that for our own internal purposes and that review for april brought about this piece of legislation which currently wasn 't in our register so they are new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that given the powers in that legislation and the activities we 're looking at undertaking we need to put those in place so the report seeks council 's approval of that happy to take any questions if there are any that seems pretty straightforward one there that you need to do uh cancer rutherford light on question please um yes i did i was reading in here the power to uh drop an area out of the designated uh flying fox zone um was being delegated to the ceo as well am i correct do you have a particular one of the sections there councillor rutherford that you 're looking at specifically that you 've seen trying to find it um so section 61 and 62 are the sections that um predominantly relate to flying fox management no there 's section 371 to mend the urban flying fox management area map yeah i 'm sorry i would have to get more information from the officers that are across the actual mapping council of rutherford to answer your query how that works in practice so for putting together the report we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say well this is what we believe we do and don 't need to sorry i 'm struggling to see you in carrying out their day-to-day duties so i can definitely put that one on notice to give you some more information i don 't believe that 's one we need in the immediate between now and the next meeting so if you wanted to put the report through without that one i don 't believe it would cause any issues if you 're just just a through the ceo yep sorry through the chair um councils we will have to come back because this is only one section of the piece of legislation so we 'll do another another report for later on so but i 'm happy to remove that delegation of 371 till we get some more information cancer other food is something specific that that mr mayor i just i 'd like more information because i think it 's when you put either areas in to a designated um mapping think or take it out now either way that has financial implications and it also has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know have a say in that as well so um but it that 's if that 's what this is and i just need more information on that okay i think council smith had her hand up oh sorry councillor smith uh yeah i think it might relate to westwood and cabra being added to the urban um management area if my memory serves me correctly because they are actually um classed as some as uh not non-urban i think that was added i thought that was already done though okay look i think there 's a few um a few unanswered questions in this one so we might just remove that out of the out of the current recommendation and uh and seek further clarification on that as uh ceo has he has uh explained that they uh they 'll be coming back with further information on this one another report so i think it 's proven that we hold off on that until that time get through and answer those questions through the chair if i can just jump in i 've just pulled the section up so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local government the ability to apply to amend the urban flying fox management area um what we could do we can either take it out or we could limit it that first it 's to follow a council resolution out yeah okay i think yeah we 'll go from there that might be an easy way ross i understand karen moody 's on the way over now to choose in progress coming over to answer the question i think it 'd be easy we just wait and uh look the ceo said there 's a further report coming back anyway so we can have that included in that time i don 't think it 'll make a great deal of difference until we get that uh that information okay council there 's been a an amendment to the recommendation and that is that uh excluding section 371 of the delegation uh pending will get that further information uh at a further meeting councillors could always seek a movement in a second with regards to that if there 's no further questions through to alyssa move cancel election second and councillor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 372 yes also related to it it 's 371 and 372 yes thank you i was just about to raise karen has arrived we might sorry 372 would be different that 's two basically the information two the dg of a department so it 's about not saying anything 's actually just provide information so go with that counselor we might just go with that unless karen have you got anything to enlighten us on that question cancer rutherford did you want to pose a question again just about the three seven one del uh thanks karen for for rushing here um i was just a little concerned about removing delegation from the council to the ceo and that one in i remember that we had to work fairly hard to put cabra and stanwell into that mapping um and it does have significant impacts financially and and for our community so can you elaborate on that point at all um why it should be delegated to the ceo so through the chair my understanding is that that would allow the decision to be made at a quicker level because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state to be able to ask for those areas to be added if we find other areas that currently aren 't there yeah so does that answer your question counselor you 're thinking in the reverse you were thinking that it was not allowing that ability or oh i just think that the the table had to push pretty hard to have that those areas included um previously so i i just i just thought it was to do with the urban and the rural sections that there was a bit of a um an issue with having if i could just a question to karen so just an example if we were to have another flying fox move into another urban area within our region instead of coming back to the council table and getting that town included it would come out to the chief executive to do that is that correct no no i didn 't think so so i thought it would because we 're delegating so to amend the map so yeah yeah looking at it initially here that definitely is how i would interpret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the regulation that to look at the process properly we 're on the fly but definitely looking at that section here on the spot that 's how i interpret it 's intended yeah exclude it and go through the process i 'm not okay we might uh we might just leave it at uh with that amendment to the recommendation that uh we seek further clarification on that and come back a a subsequent meeting okay councillors move council election uh do we have a seconder second and councillor kirkland i 'll put that those in favor against carrie thanks councillors oh sorry didn 't second like i hang on with being clever it just had a tick in the box cancel i didn 't it might have been from the previous one but it had it on there that 's where i was going off no actually made this so sorry about that councils i 'd uh i taken the call so i 'll put that motion again those in favor face against do you want to record that counselor kirkland you 're fine okay thank you uh councillor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't have any questions on notice um just urgent business one i probably should have started the the at the start of the meeting about the anzac day i 'd just like to thank all the councillors for their uh efforts on anzac day going far and wide across our region to service all of our dawn services and marches and events on over the weekend really great numbers coming through from the crowd and the organizers everyone preparing it councillor wickerson your uh your preparation for the march and uh organizing the anzac day events uh thanks very much for that they went relatively smoothly i believe so and uh it can be told by the the numbers of the people that turned up on the day for the uh for the event um most touching moment for myself was a a little three or four year old girl up at the cenotaph going up to leia wreath on behalf of one of the schools all by herself she got up to the to the um where you hang the wreath and there wasn 't much room up there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move around a few times until she found a spot where she could hang the wreath so it was really really lovely and she it didn 't deter at all going up by herself or finding a spot to put that wreath but she did a fantastic job and really set the time for the morning so um councillor wickerson did you want to make further comment yes miss me just add to what you you 're saying also to thank the staff particularly bev marsden and her husband who 's one of the marshals for everything it seems and also tash another employee uh remembering that we were about eight weeks behind uh when we got the green light to go ahead with us so it 's normally a rush anyway but to start eight weeks late and still pull it together there was some frantic phone calls and i 'm sure lots lots of hours worked not on the record so it passed on my uh thanks me after council to those officers either and also the the other agencies yeah the rsls and nashos the vietnam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked in record time to pull it together and make it uh very very special yeah no well done well done okay councillors there 's no further uh items i 'll declare the meeting closed i know we have a workshop to keep us busy but i 'll close the official meeting and thank everyone for their attendance thank you [Music]

Rowbotham still remember the name such a different name she saw one of my drawings and just said to me Peter you 're going to grow up and do something really creative I 'm like okay so I don 't know did she put that suggestion in my head and thus I followed that or was I already creative but probably just like every five-year-old it 's because I think that most young people are very creative in what they do the way they draw until I get to a certain age where they start to be more down on what they 're doing and more comparing what they do with other people 's of what they do so who knows but that might have been the thing that sort of led me towards doing things a little bit creatively of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project to do like everyone 's got a project here 's your piece of project paper and you 've got to do it on this topic so that used to be a very exciting thing for me to do and I used to not just draw but obviously do text but also collage and I think that was a little different to some of the other kids who maybe did some drawings so I guess that 's where that background comes from then as I got older I only I left school in formed four which is about a year ten level I think yeah and because I was failing at maths but I was doing well and everything else grating up to of course and English and things like that but my dad as I might have mentioned before he 's an engineer and he had his own business and he said I you failed at maths and you know women aren 't doing anything you know you 're just gonna get married and have kids and this was his sort of old-fashioned way of thinking so you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ math mm-hmm so that 's what I got to do so I became a drafts woman and surveyor and I really did enjoy that because it wasn 't always in the office it was out sometimes in the paddocks with the cows and you know with the staff and doing all that sort of stuff then coming back into the office and plotting the plans up and I 'm quite a neat hand dryer and I got even better because when you 're a tracer and you 're doing plans that councils have to read everything has to be pretty neat so that probably also I guess gave me another sort of feather towards what I like to do I am a Virgo and I do like to do things in a Virgo way I say sometimes but other times really I 'm quite messy things that don 't have to be perfect and I think that 's why I found object heart absolutely appeals to me so now I 'm gonna talk about found objects I do I 'll just quickly talk about other things you 're probably seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i think is a little like found object art except mainly working more flat but where you have to to pile of papers or you whatever you 're going to use in your colors where you are looking at how things work together you 're auditioning things before you put them down and a little bit like that we found object art too there is some auditioning going on with the objects and what they 're going to create there 's more than just auditioning I find we found objects so found objects probably being the bowerbird I already had a big collection of things and once I started to realize that this can be an art form I started to really collect more objects it 's my excuse anyone and put them together in an assembly drawer assemblages I bought a few in so you can see them more in the three-dimensional I don 't work with always new things so the two white ones there are I pad boxes that I 've covered in foam core and then cupboard as well in rice papers this is a found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigar box is boxes that cover or we come in boxes at glasses come in so any sort of a box or vessel form is fair game for me to put things into nothing has to be new I sometimes create my own boxes as well so there 's a box over here that has a lid on it that 's all created from book board and the lid itself is actually a collagraph that I had printed several times for a CPI print makers exhibition and it was just too good to not use as something and since the box was about crocodiles that became the lid for the box so creating a box is something that I quite like to do but finding a box to put things in is also something I really like to do so what I was going to say to is because I went to TAFE and I loved that I was so lucky to go and do a diploma at TAFE I you know I think other people here are definitely going to take or maybe done course at TAFE so if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great down there what I looked there was printmaking and painting and I passed them both quite well but I just didn 't love painting so printmaking was more the process that I really liked but from there where you had to learn the technique of it be able to produce an addition so the prints the same the same the same I think we have to do six the same to be able to pass I got bored with just printing the same plate and also I 'm not that famous so there 's not that many people wanting my prints so for me it was like fine print lots of prints with one plate because it 's a bit wasteful to just make a plate and only print one print but do other things to that print so at stitch alright collage in Calleigh printing different colors I mean hand coloring these are all things that people do but profound objects onto the print why not make it three-dimensional why just keep it as a flat print and you know muck around with things be a bit experimental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tended to sort of go down that track with my printmaking since working with found objects printmaking I 've also begun work with textiles and that seems have been the last couple of years nearly now I think I 've been developing a lot of textile work now this is nothing perfect I don 't want it to be perfect actually so we 're not talking about cutting things in the patterns or quilt making which I admire but I 'm not going to do that to other people it 's really putting things together that a once again almost found fabrics found textiles some new but some died some rusted more destroyed or burying the garden I 've been known to do that as well and let things eat it so that 's been my passion more of late I guess is developing textile works that probably came a little bit from some workshops that I did with a couple of textile artists so yet a clover who 's somebody that I really admire that 's about je TT e clover disclose oh she 's a artist from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artist in the United Kingdom so I 've done two workshops with both of them they 're fabulous artists and fabulous ladies who do sometimes quite large works especially yet she does very large works for the wall cares perhaps smaller ones and yet oh so the way they combine their textiles and what they do to them which is printing on them and stitching obviously overlaying different things which is what I like as well so that really appealed to me so that 's where things have sort of you know I 've gone down that track a little bit more I find even being now a full-time artist and you know sometimes being able to run workshops I still don 't have enough time to do everything I don 't know how I did anything before and I don 't know how anybody that works does anything now I know you all do though you 're all really good at it but um yeah it 's just there 's so much to do and so much to learn it 's very exciting encaustic is another technique that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also come together and they often do in my work so everyone 's familiar with encaustic or yep so I did bring one in there the one in the box here it 's an acoustic work feel free to have a feel once again combine that we found objects and and stuff and it 's on it 's either on book board that one or it 's on mat board but you can do it on actual timber board as well so encaustic is a beautiful technique because once again you can layer things something that I enjoy I 'm not a painter and encaustic there are people who paint with encaustic and so they have colored encaustic pens just like people who paint with acrylics or oils have and I 'm just not into that if I 'm going to color anything I 'm going to use pan pastels or oil colour rubbed on and I 'm going to win size in so I guess that 's just more my style as are these other people well I also like working with plaster and encaustic icer takes in caustic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and decide if your container holds things or doesn 't hold things these empties in empty space okay so the other thing that I really like to do is artists book so I bought a couple of them in as well a lot of things can be called novice books so that one 's more of a book book you can see it 's got a spine it 's got pages that open out this one 's a concertina one that opens out this can be called an artist book as well because it also can be read opening out but also an artist book and artists could develop something that dis hung on a wall and I could say that is an artist book because it has some sort of a narrative in it so once again it depends on how you want to define an artwork and your reasoning for for making it I like artists books I usually only make unique ones as a printmaker I could print you know an edition of an artist book if I wanted to but yeah I don 't choose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to edition my prints my 2d prints either so I like the uniqueness of a one-off type of book having said that I 've made say a lot of artist books in a series of works that I did called the crocodile series and just got mad about crocodiles and made lots of different books and stories about crocodiles so yeah they 're all one-off book so no two are the same I like to work in a series talking about series so of late I 've worked in series to do with memory memory loss my mum has Alzheimer 's so that seems to be a topical thing for me and I can sometimes it 's working through those sorts of things within yourself but also learning more about the issues surrounding at least Alzheimer 's memory loss there 's a lots of different types of memory losses we all know but also my work has always been about a narrative of something and a lot of people look at my work and say it 's it 's sort of memorabilia you know it it 's kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing I suppose in a way I don 't think it 's just nice doll jig work that I do I think it has deeper meaning than just that yeah but it does have story it does have narrative and people do as well my second job after working for about ten years for my debt as a draftsman woman and surveyor was working with people so a counselor so personal counsel and working in schools with young people and you know adults as well and so I suppose people have always been very much part of my life and their stories are amazing and people are amazing what they what they get through you know the things that that affect them and how people get through I believe art is a very great way of helping us all stay healthy mentally healthy or if we do need to become more mentally healthy to work through things I think that 's a really great thing to do and I 'm sure you all know that whatever art form it is whether it 's a movement art form or singing form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a little bit about how my process goes with my found objects so I thought what better way to do it than to see if people would like to do something with some found objects okay so you get to do a little bit of a play with the found objects and I 'll invite you to maybe talk a little bit about how you 're seeing what you 're doing with those found objects how that relationship with the found objects is maybe bringing forth some sort of a story that you see being very aware that when I put my things together I see a narrative in it and then when Sully comes along and looks at it she might see a completely different narrative initiative and that 's great perfectly fine to have all that happening and that 's that 's the beauty of art isn 't it and how everybody will interpret it so the idea being and you 've gotta have a lot of choice I put a lot of things in because I didn 't know how many people would be here that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 in so what I 'd like you to do there 's two tables of found objects pretty well see those there is to cruise around to spend a little bit of time and choose just two objects to start with now the way I do it is this I get the stuff out that I think is going to work with the series I 'm going to do and I put them out on the tables and the floors and I have a big studio so I have a lot of space and I do I just I I cruise around I just pick things up and some things I go to pick up my no yes yes no put you back so there 's different like already a bit of auditioning happening and that 's more from and that sounds weird and I 'm hoping it doesn 't sound too weird but it 's like the objects have some sort of a vibration or they 're they 've got that energy in them because I 'm thinking okay I 'm going to put some things together that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of photographs that I 've got so that 's what I want you to do is just do that pick the things up that appeal to you that seem to give you that vibe I know you don 't have anything in mind at the moment as to what these what you know you could be putting these together as but I 'm just going to step you through the process is you yeah you 're not putting anything together yet but you can imagine you 're maybe putting it in a box or some sort of a container that sound okay just look at one of those objects it 's going to try number one as have a story do you think it has a story you need to past but what was it used for maybe where maybe has they found with [Music] so does the story change when you put your objects together there 's anything is there another story coming out often when I 'm doing things I like the objects but then it 's about what else is there another bit in innocent needs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it because the other part of found object art is trying to get these things to assemble together in a way that they 're not going to just you know fall apart the first time somebody touches them you can use glue having looked from this lovely artist called Keith laboux I call him no glue laboum because he does not like glue but he does use something sometimes some glue but mostly he uses wire and drilling he makes his own little split pens it but I certainly do use wire and I certainly do drill and I love wax linen thread that 's really really lovely to to join things with it also grabs really nicely and doesn 't seem to like so that go so well it 's just a normal string sometimes does so so that 's the next thing that 's the challenge I suppose for the found object artists once they 've got the objects that seem to be telling the story together it 's like okay now how am I going to get this piece of glass to go onto this piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audition things and then sometimes no you aren 't working anymore what you are saying with these other objects isn 't helping my story and you know even though you might be putting something in an assemblage it doesn 't necessarily have to be a box that has sides it could be just a top and a bottom so you can still see all the way around it I mean there 's all sorts of ways of yeah that 's right or something with very thin kind of stands that help hold whole things up will give it a defined area or a nice piece of perspex it pops over the top of it somehow that 's the other part of course which is the display I suppose or how this piece is going to to look where it will go the process of making out any isit doesn 't really matter is more the exciting part for me I mean obviously then it 's a good it 's finished and then it 's good it goes maybe to an exhibition and maybe someone even buys it so that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me is a very exciting part I do like to see the finished product as well and I think that there 's always that excitement if there isn 't I don 't know maybe I 'll be sort of so old by then I won 't mind but I think it probably is the same for all of us when we 're whatever we 're doing however we 're creating it 's that process if we get excited by and you know wanting to get to a finished product I mean I don 't really want to be you know just half making things everywhere yeah yeah completion is always good but the process to me it 's important so and there 's always a challenge it doesn 't matter if you 're putting together similar things there 's still a challenge as to how you put them together but it 's it 's a fun challenge yeah [Music] you,"(-23.3786203, 150.5088889)"

firstly i 'd just like to open this uh special meeting um and who 's present but uh firstly our acknowledgement to country i would like to begin by acknowledging our traditional custodians of the land in which we meet today the rumble people and pay my respects to the elders past present and emerging i extend that respect to our neighbouring aboriginal peoples within the local government area the gangalow nation people the bharata kabul bara and yada morales people and i also acknowledge that the torres strait islander people whose land in within the torres straits but who live and work in aboriginal land that is a tongue twister but i 'll we 'll get to the bottom of it but again um just that acknowledgement there to country uh moving on to item four declarations of interest in matters on the agenda councillors uh we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain that thanks mr mayor yeah we 'll have a perceived conflict of interest i think um inform the meeting that i have a declarable conflict of interest as a result of ruth to receive hospitality uh from beef australia uh date of the gift is from second to eighth of may 2020 and uh the value of the gift will be greater than 500 as such should be declared i wish to participate oh no no he 's there for you sorry participate or leave the meeting that 's your options yeah i wish to leave the meeting for those reasons thank you yep okay as a result of my conflict of interest i will now leave the meeting room while the matter is considered and voted on okay thank you so that 's to the councillor meeting room the best location for that yep now cancels with okay now the other counselors with um conflicts of interest you under that um stuff may the under the 500 isn 't a gift so it 's not technically a doesn 't need to be conflict no it doesn 't need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll move on to the agenda item sorry 5.1 lifting matters off the table the the following item is that would be lifted off the table and dealt with accordingly uh the beef 2021 uh showgrounds curfew move councillor smith second and councillor kirkland i 'll put that to the table as in favor again sorry carrie question councillor no no sorry okay that 's that matters now lifted so we 'll move on to item 5.2 6.1 now the beef 2001 showgrounds curfew the officer 's recommendation uh presented and john would you like to speak to that recommendation please hopefully we can hear you today no we still got that um we still can 't catch that uh that audio evan don 't worry about driving down no no probably can 't i 'll ask evan to speak to it thanks john so counsellors i think it 's pretty well self-explanatory the um the uh the extension through the report so probably the best if there 's any questions and we 'll try and do some sign language to john okay uh councillor rutherford question um mr mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point in there that talks about um security i 'm assuming that beef will have security on site um most of the time but that that security um looks at orderly um departure from these events so i i i 'm happy to support the curfews but that their security is looking at um the orderly departure of patrons from those events yeah we 're using back to the old smoke smoke signals with john uh no there is no issues counselor rather by putting that extra dot that we um i think as far as the the the leaving the venue and how far do they uh does that extend but i mean if if it 's leaving the uh the venue then it 's uh probably something that they 'd monitor anyway to make sure that there was no alcohol or anything that uh that was being leaving the venue so i 'm sure that 'll be be covered off on that um and i 'm sure after our um workshop this morning you may be able to to raise up with the event organizers as well in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said mr mayor i i 'm assuming security will be there so it 's just a matter of um making sure you know if there 's people waiting for taxis and they 're like they 're all they 're just reminded to yeah it 's still uh late in the evening but that said okay counsellors separate dot point and um let that one be covered off there so that 's at the cancer request beef australia provide adequate security for patrons leaving the venue post event or events yep just a comment that could sound like um we 're just looking after the people leaving the event should we put on it to minimise disruption to surrounding look i wouldn 't uh i wouldn 't again how far do you stop and start with that i think it 's just a you know that it 's covered off um as part of their role and i 'm sure that 's i 'm sure that 's done anyway but yeah but it 's uh it 's just something there that we can highlight anyway that that 's uh that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks mr chair happy the second when it comes up but i understand that community engagement 's already gone out for the first stage but it was raised that there 's more to come and i couldn 't pull up the letter but i thought it only mentioned one one night of careful in that letter so that 's technically incorrect now i 'm just wondering whether we can 't communicate back to the board that the next letter that goes out needs to fully disclose uh the impact these events yep if they 're they 're going later john did you hear that yes through the chair we picked that up in the draft of the communication and i 've given that feedback that that needs to be included yep a good point okay councillors if there 's no further questions to the officer 's recommendations on that curfew i 'll seek a mover in a second move councillor smith seconded councillor wickerson no further discussions i 'll put that those in favor against carried thanks very much councillors moving on any other items uh item any item so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move on and resume our workshop so thanks very much [Music] hope it is [Music] [Music] [Music],"(-23.3786203, 150.5088889)"
AUS,QLD,Rockhampton Regional Council,RRCouncil,https://www.youtube.com/user/RRCouncil,Rockhampton Zoo Kangaroo Keeper Talk,JPfLZVyZzAE,20200817,382.56,"Rockhampton QLD 4700, Australia",1068,[Music] welcome everybody to the kangaroo um talk and training session that we do at rockhampton zoo so as you can see i 'm here with the mob that we have of eight eastern grey kangaroos now these guys can be found up the whole eastern coast of australia and you can see them locally around the rockhampton region as well so i 'll start with telling you a little bit about the mob that we have here and then i 'll show you some of the training that we do with these ruse so as i said before we 've got eight kangaroos four males and four females and we do have some younger ones that were born at the zoo um like adele here so adele has her mom and her dad still currently at the zoo um that 's sasha at the end there who is our oldest kangaroo coming up to about 14 now and her dad is elton at the end here and he is our alpha male 1 so other than that joey we also have um bowie here who 's coming up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the four joeys that were born recently at the zoo um so i 'll show you some of the training techniques that we do adele here is very i 'm keen to have a go um so with the training that we have here is quite extensive with the kangaroos and that 's due to trying to improve our general husbandry and daily care of them but also mainly it 's for health care and medical practices that we try and do here at the zoo so we started off with trying to do um some tactile training so for example with adele she 's able to eat her cooked sweet potato um but i am gonna touch her and what i wanted her to get used to is if she was sore or injured or anything like that that i could have a good examination of her this one here is bowie he 's having to go now so i can look inside his ears i can check his eyes as well to make sure there 's no injuries check his arms as well and his toes so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started doing here at the zoo um just so that we had it able to visually um see the kangaroos and touch them one of the major ones that we have started doing with them was a syringe training so if the kangaroos got sick and they needed to see the vet what we wanted to do was be able to hand inject them ourselves instead of the vet coming and needing to say dart them or anything like that we wanted to have no stress to the kangaroo so how i trained this technique which i 'll do it again with bowie is i just have a syringe no needle or anything on it again he can eat his sweet potatoes um and then i 'm just going to practice what i would do if there was drugs on the end so when it does happen the time comes if by we needed to be knocked out and have an anesthetic through the vet um i would be able to just walk in here and give him the drugs and he wouldn 't even know that it had happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again continue with the tactile training of them so they 're always used to me being around and touching them so if we needed to examine them it 'd be pretty easy to do another type of training that we do is target training penalty give it a go so you could do this say with your dog at home it 's pretty simple it 's just a broom handle and it 's just got a tennis ball on the end so what they do is if the kangaroo touches it they 're going to get a reward for that reuben touch good and the word good there is called a bridge so basically it told him that what he did was correct and that the reward is coming of the cooked sweet potato ribbon touch good not that into that touch good so then moving on from the target training it means that i could stretch bowie up and have a look underneath his belly so again making sure that he 's all okay underneath there and we get a good view of the kangaroo all the time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's really important for healthcare is making sure that we do weigh the kangaroos regularly it does help us establish if say if one was sick it may lose weight over time and we would pick up on that another thing is if they enjoy their training a little bit too much and have a bit too much sweet potato we 'll know if they put on weight good and we can alter their diet that way so it 's really really important for their health care so another part of it with target training is getting them to move so bowie would need to or adele would need to touch this target stick and that means then i can start moving them around moving them onto scales again if i needed to move them closer so the vet could come and have a look at them and they 'll touch good um i could bring them over to the fence with a bit so other types of training that we do here is um one for oral medication as well so again we 're just doing all that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of the medical that that they need would be nice and easy for them thanks guys for listening today to the kangaroo talk and seeing some of the training that we 're doing here if you have any questions about what you 've seen or general questions about the kangaroos please do comment below and we 'll get back to you with the answers thank you you,"(-23.3786203, 150.5088889)"

discussion this morning so put it that way but that said council official was actually acting there for three months as well as doing his own portfolio and his own division and i think he needs to um take time out to look after himself after all the hard work he 's done and did a great job i 'd uh support that and again i think council fisher mentioned it 's probably the longest time that he 's had off um during his term so uh again there 's a uh well and truly overdue uh again i 'd uh i 'll move that in a second that uh council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in favor against carried thank you um moving on to 9.2 the council of discretionary fund application for council alan smith the mount morgan radio association uh allocation there that 's part of the policy that we we need if there 's a

councillors moving on to item 10 10 10.1 the advanced rock camp and economic development and events uh 2021 rockhampton agricultural show tender quote consideration plan uh we got who 's is john on that one who 's there greg greg it 's greg craig 's online probably if he 's any questions mayor on that one now is there any questions on that one council it 's just um no question look questions can we have a mover in a second with regards to that one move councillor smith seconder council wickerson we 'll put that those in favor against thank you moving on to 10 10.2 the community 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show green 's curfew did you want to make comment to that council or is it again as per previous years it 's one that 's um that 's been i think there was some discussion yesterday um councillor rutherford question johnny 's online yeah councillor rutherford uh yeah i do have some questions um if i could and that 's about what type of community engagement is being done um for the community around there because to date i don 't think there has been anything um also what security will be put in place so it 's not so much the the events it 's the patrons leaving the events in a disorderly fashion um at the end of the evening that 's more of an issue so what security um is being put in place to ensure the residents aren 't disturbed if i could through the chair greg will probably jump in here i 'm not sure if you had that discussion yesterday greg with um beef australia but at this point in time council rutherford up to yesterday we had no idea of what type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to greg there yes greg thank you uh mayor and council ceo i see john there as well john may have been on the meeting on friday but uh at this stage a lot of the community consultation was was put on hold because rocky nats was doing we 're doing their consultation so uh we 've put in a call and uh tashbury and i will meet with ian mill uh today uh for a conversation uh unless john knows more than i do about this but uh um you know we need we need to get hold of this engagement plan and including the traffic management plan so that 's what we 're meeting in to discuss okay we 'll um yes cancer so i 'm wondering whether we can hold this off for a week until we have more information on that it 's our next council meeting week gavin two weeks time i think [Music] um i don 't think there 's any urgency there that they needed any issues greg and john yo i 'm mute mate john we can 't hear you i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably just asked the question in terms of this decision so this is a centered around the two events that go later into the two events three events that go later into the evening what bearing the consultation i mean we we need to follow up and that was noted yesterday at our meeting we need to follow up on that consultation but the discussion that we had yesterday was a lot of the complaints were not around necessarily the events that went the longer than the curfew that we need to close this loop out but it was around the other activity at the site you know trucks arriving at all hours in different pieces and that was where the consultation needed to also happen with the residents so we can follow that up but why would you hold off on this decision now i think security at the end of the evening is probably a key issue for the extension of a curfew and whether they intend to provide any security i 'll just be johnny you are you still on there no we can 't break um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my memory of 2015 and 2018 they 've always asked for these extensions that 's right yes i don 't see this as being any different to what they normally ask for and counsellors are divisional cancer had you received complaints about the um after these events um not about the events um but certainly about the disorderly conduct of people leaving the events so all i 'm really asking for is some sense of security for that community that um you know the the as people depart those events they 're you know their quality of life is not going to be disturbed i have no issue with beef um the beef event it is fantastic for this community and the wandel community believe that also but there has been very little consultation to date which there normally has been by this time in beefs previously and the issue of the way people are leaving those events has been a problem in the past so you know i 'd just like some form of reassurance that there will be some security there yeah okay um yeah again i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things and that 's when we had the workshop yesterday to talk about were there specific issues with the curfew um but we haven 't had any uh consultation about the community consultation and the traffic management plan which we 'd asked greg to to go back to beef and ask that for that information to be provided to us as urgent as possible and that 's why we weren 't able to to get a gauge on that those specific complaints around this curfew matter but that said we can leave the matter lay on the table and get some consultation requests for consultation from beef and we can call an uh special meeting next week to deal with this matter if that 's if that 's the best if you if that 's a preferred approach rather than trying to deal with it now and not have that information on hand yeah thank you mr mayor i certainly you know there 's no issue here except for just some type of reinsurance for that community that um you know they will be taken into consideration yep no that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we did mention that yesterday that um unfortunately you were on um away on leave that uh at the time of during that meeting to to get a better understanding of the previous uh previous events and the issues there uh that noted we councillor wickerson further question uh yes mr mayor um if greg is going to meet with uh ian mills from beef tomorrow i think uh happy to support laying down on table for a week or so because there 's an opportunity to chat directly with the organizers and bring security into that mix with transportation and community engagement as well just beneficial to hold yeah yes and look that may be part of their their planning anyway especially with covert now that there 's a another level of requirement there with um with with those types of things so that may be covered off anyway we just need to make sure that that 's the case and uh and come back that and it 's only prudent that we um engage with beef just to to do those uh questions see them so that said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the matter lay on the table and see further information from the community consultation and security arrangements and that a special meeting be held on tuesday the 20th of april 2021 uh cancer rather for you happy to move that move cancer rutherford do i have a second councillor wickerson i 'll put that those in favor against carrick thanks councillors infrastructure uh there 's no reports on infrastructure this week planning and regulations 10.3 there 's an application there councillor smith there 's the portfolio person would you make any comments here or just through to the offices yeah thanks mr may um this is a really good um application it 's an extension of what 's already there as well there was just one query yesterday about the um thomas mark be able to fill us in about the point of discharge for the stormwater because that is a a stormwater area and i think that was the concern of the submitters that was the only query i had you there jamie [Music] we can 't hear you again mike that we might have seen you there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greg are you able to say something to us you 're there greg was that a question to be evan yeah we just wanted to hear you see if our sound is working mate so he 's working so it 's must be jamie 's in we 're just having some tech technical issues at the moment so we might just hand over to thomas and uh go from the table it 's all right we 'll take that on note if uh from jamie someone can talk to jamie just about the water ones um flooding problem there they might see if we can get them at the end of the present yeah sure thank you uh good morning councillors uh so this development application is for a proposed mcu for a residential care facility located at 76 jardine street in west rockhampton uh development is actually an extension to the existing multi-cap facility located on these adjoining southern lot uh just next slide please sorry thomas if i could hey jamie are you able to drop down to the chambers okay no worries uh the subject site is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning scheme uh the current site is vacant and largely surrounded by single detached dwelling houses located in the same zone the adjoining lot to the south as i mentioned before is the existing residential care facility operated by multicap jardine street provides the site with its only road frontage to the east next slide please thank you so the proposed development as i mentioned before is for a residential care facility uh which will act as an extension to the existing multi-cap development on the southern lot uh this facility will comprise 10 long-term accommodation units comprising of single units and duplexes with overnight assisted accommodation and one short-term accommodation building with an administration office attached access to the site will be by a new crossover from jardine street to the east which you can see on the site plan there just to the north each of the units are afforded an undercover car parking space with an additional 16 visitor car parking spaces also provided on the site next slide please the application was subject to public notification for 15 business days where there two there were two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the matters raised in the submissions have been summarized in the report and i think there were two key issues and addressed as part of council 's assessment next slide so it is recommended that the proposed development is recommended for approval subject to the conditions outlined in the report in the council meeting minutes it 's also recommended that council amends recommendation c to levy an infrastructure charge of 228 thousand dollars and well two hundred and twenty eight thousand two hundred and three dollars uh it 's just an error i made with the original report any questions questions counselor rutherford um yeah first of all i 'd like to say this is a fantastic development but i am very very concerned about the location and whether we have looked at the overland flow i 'm worried that this is a similar situation to what the elphinstone street house [Music] was in so we 've built i think a one and a half million dollar detention basin just in pearson street to hold the amount of water that comes through that property so there is a massive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property and through into that detention basin and even at a time that detention basin overflowed and flooded their houses down from it so i 'm just wondering how this development has i guess allowed for that water and what happens then to the water if it 's not getting through is it going to back up uh well from my understanding and jamie will be best placed to answer these questions is that the stormwater channel there 's not going to be any actionable worsening to any surrounding properties as a result of the development how that any specific sort of design questions and what that sort of looks like i 'll get jamie to sort of respond in more yeah so we would have all seen photos of the place in jardin park the amount of water that came comes through on the land near one of the homes just up further and this is worse again i can uh through the chair i can probably have a go at um and relaying what jamie described to me yesterday so the um the submitter has actually done a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to have like a formalized drain 10 to 15 meters across the back here um that will then discharge into this council land and then out to pearson street from what jamie has said who is on the way is that the the proposed design should actually improve the current situation as a result of this development so that will then result in a stormwater easement along that area so they 're building the land up no they will make it a drain but at the moment it comes through this corner area yeah um runs diagonally so i 'm guessing to get the water to go down further and run through a drain they 're going to have to build this land up at the front ah possibly that 's definitely a jamie question he will be here soon he 's on his way councillor smith clear the question there was um a mention of um an easement uh to the back of the houses in pearson street but that 's only people been driving in that way you can see the the road that they 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not actually an easement at all there is an easement across the road but that 's not for um driving on either so that that easement sort of never existed but in these people 's minds it was an easement because that 's what they 've always done to get access to the back of pearson street properties jamie can we go back our slide to have a look at the sorry tom can we go back a slide to look at the over there thank you so council rather you 're saying from the roadway at the top of the bottom of that diagram the water travels across basically straight through where that building where that building is so straight down the pathway through and into that back corner and then there 's a big detention basin um we 'll just let damian catch his breath for a second he just built it up [Music] that was pretty good time and jamie we 've got the stopwatch out for next time so morning council is mr mayor sorry sorry about that no um so you 're asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawful point so to the north west of the site is the council owned parcel of land can we just grab a pointer if you could jamie just to um yep so that parcel of land there so we 've currently got i think three detention basins in that parcel of land there so currently the storm water comes from this upstream catchment it flows through a trough in jardine street so there 's cross drainage there as well as overland flow comes through to this site via an unformed channel basically the water sort of finds its way through here it comes down into the council land and then through this other portion of council land out to pearson street then finds its way down pearson street so what the we 've asked the consultants to do is a flood impact assessment so they 've actually modeled this catchment um looking at the expected water that 's coming through this site they 've come up with a proposal basically they 're constructing a 10 to 15 meter wide channel that will run pretty much parallel to that northern boundary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ function of that channel so it 'll detain some of that water and then it 'll release it back into that council past the land so the effectiveness of that channel basically is improving the flooding in these properties to the north it 's improving flooding slightly in jardine street and it 's actually going to improve some of the flooding levels in our council land as well cancer rutherford so jamie i thought um the water also came diagonally across that block so there is a channel but it also it goes diagonally front to back yep you 're right so there 's a smaller channel which runs in that direction so that 'll be conveyed throughout the site as well via a smaller channel which will join into that bigger one so can we go back to the other the over overlay yeah so can we can you point that through there jamie there uh yep so basically there 's a channel that 'll come down through here there 's cross drainage underneath that internal road which will connect back into this main channel through there there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diverted closer to that property boundary so that that channel can can work cancer alfred um jamie have we looked at this against our really most recent flood modeling um stuff and it it takes the amount of water that 's anticipated yeah yeah so when we 've spoken to the consultant about doing the flood modelling we 've advised them of the most recent up-to-date modeling that we 've got and they 've used that information all right i hope it 's hard to argue there so i 'm hoping they 're right a lot of water but can the the the experts have given us that information council need that because that detention basin has over top so i 'm hoping i 'm hoping we 're right so detention basin that 's over topped yeah yeah so i think the intention is that captures water and slows it down to a point and then it really flows out into pearson street so the same will occur with that channel through there it 'll capture some of that water slow it down and then we 'll flow back out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you mr chair thanks jamie and thomas yesterday i had a question just with regards to item 3.2 in your um approved plans and documents etc there it says that they 're going to take it in a two-staged approach and that the first stage is six years to complete is that normal or is it just seems like a long time was my question yesterday and the second stage was 12 years of course my my reservation is you know that a lot can happen in six years so so through the chair um standard currency periods in the under the planning act for mcu applications are typically six years so that 's a standard time frame that we 've decided to include that first stage i guess with including the 12 years for the second stage it just gives them sort of a time frame to ensure that development is completed at some point in the future rather than just i guess letting it sort of sit there yeah so give them some sort of parameters yeah okay council if there 's no further questions to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a second and move councillor smith seconder council of kirkland and put that those in favor those against you against uh through the check could i just double check that that recommendation c was going to be amended just for the infrastructure charges yeah i just if we could just amend that to two to eight two zero three yes thank you right now okay thank you councils move that resolution again now with those changes so move are you happy with those changes councillor kirkland council smith i 'll put that those in favor against carrie did you want to record that counselor are you right yep okay thank you moving on to the next item item 10.4 thanks jamie for that uh early sprint well done chotting yes thanks very much justin thank you good afternoon mr mayor councillors uh justin boeinkel sports and rec um i think i 've had the pleasure to meet you all by now look today 's report presents the rockhampton grammar school 's final capital development plan for rugby park along with a request to renew its current lease for an extended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this year 31st of december rugby park formerly known as diggers park is located on blackwall street the range and does board at the southern end of the botanical gardens rockhampton grammar school back in 2017 took on the trustee lease over rugby park forming part of their condition the school was required to establish a redevelopment plan for the facility by june 2021 this year based on this report and their final development plan they 've now actually adhered to that condition for starters in september 2019 the school also provided council with an earlier draft of the proposed development sorry excuse me providing some insight to council to the vision for the facility this included the need for potential additional land that encroachment into the botanics and the need for an extended lease term more than the standard six years that we offer currently the development proposed is a concept that is consistent with our current 2021 operational objectives and with that both officers and parks support option one that 's been comprised within that report um excuse me uh look what what we have found that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suitable value-adding long-term initiative for the community complementing council 's current focus on developing future sporting precincts within the region option one is outlined as a long-term development plan naturally and is deliverable by four stages stage one now stage one ideally you may have identified in the report that it would also identify as their short-term plan if the long-term plan wasn 't supported so stage one comprising in short a third rectangular playing field administration buildings comprising a gym field lighting upgrades a multi-purpose building with dressing rooms canteen umpire rooms and meeting rooms potentially female compliance facilities and function rooms and finally obviously working with ergon to look at power supply upgrades for the facility stage two um moving into the long term option one as we 're recommending today uh they would work with council and can consider those studies around the flood mitigation for the main field as a priority audio visual upgrades a storage shed followed by stage three where that mitigation that flood levy work would then look at considering the whole of the facility to safeguard its entirety including sorry aspects such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is the big the big item that would obviously still need to be outworked but what they 're proposing is to put in a synthetic running track with the success of a flood levy implemented sorry so with this if council does elect to support the schools plan to undertake all four stages being option one it will include naturally that and minor encroachment into the botanical gardens as referenced look if it is granted by council the school understands they need to seek appropriate approvals from queensland heritage as well via an exemption certificate to basically establish whether they can and to what degree can they establish within that area they also need to work with dnrme via the submission of a land management plan and updating that and that would be done in conjunction with with council and officers look they have they have really stressed how much they are committed to work collectively with council and its offices throughout the entirety of the project ensuring all development activities are supported and managed through relative das which will safeguard our needs and obviously those those requirements with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the tenure to be renewed on that long-term basis of up to 30 years as a minimal sorry allowing the school time to outwork the development and obviously safeguard their investment and give them time to complete that work i understand the school does understand sorry there are considerations such that council do need to take such as the priorities that safeguard the community 's future needs and access to the facility committing to work with us and established conditions that ensure capital works are carried out within the reasonable time frames meaning that if the school fails to deliver on agreed terms potentially uh council could move to alter the terms of that agreement that trustee lease and even reduce the term of tenure and these are all conditions that we can negotiate with the school and set to i guess give us that security uh with regard specifically another one i want to identify in that report is the relationship with capras the report does refer again to a relationship between the school and cq capras in the concept that rugby park becoming a training facility for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their use would just purely be for training and while there are facilities there that would utilize as well such as gyms etc their home ground would still remain brown park as their as their playing field uh look all right sorry um and i just wanted to at this point refer to page three of the report i think the third paragraph from the bottom it 's an error on my behalf i have noted or referred to a sublet agreement that 's incorrect i was actually meant to refer to as an mou so with that look i 've spoken to the school and capras and there 's certainly no intention of a sublet nor a move to what they would looking to do is um the school would remain entirely responsible for the lease and its asset and enter into something like an mou or a like with capras that would set the agreement and the utilization of that facility now the mou would also provide council with an overview of the capric presence and their use across the facility and the school has really stressed their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those conditions as well look the final i guess key point in the report i just want to notice before i wrap up is the plantation and the encroachment if we do have that consideration we 've acknowledged with the school that the existing koala follow plantation would likely be impeded if the development work was to encroach into that section of the botanics now the school have understood that a condition again would be set meaning no development work could commence until such time that an alternative food source for the zoo was established or identified safeguarding their needs and our koala population so the schools also demonstrated great support in helping us identify a future solution with that plantation and i understand that they wouldn 't be able to work in that area until such time we had an alternative in place look to conclude the school requests council i guess in short to you know support the extended lease term in the area within the principal within principal support sorry to option one of the development plan look council i also think it 's worth noting that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support financially understanding that it is an extended lease term and all these if sorry if the lease term and area was extended um they would be responsible for the entirety financially of the project and conditioned to work closely with council naturally for the life of that project and redevelopment thanks okay thanks very much justin again i think it 's a fantastic fantastic opportunity there i do see for all intents purposes that we were on on site and had an inspection of the of the facility um if you you walked the site you 'd see the fence there you you would have thought that that land was part of that part of that development originally so um um hearing that they 're they 're keen to work to to look at the options there with that uh with that um process before any development occurs there 's something there now i do have a question and it 's relation to the car parking um just to be mindful that that 's still uh public open space there and that uh that car parking there uh we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the public in general as their access and it 's a quite a popular uh walking location so i think we might need to make sure that that 's that 's part of the the ongoing relationship that that that that car park area is is something there that is not overtaken by uh by the development at all so um we just need to to bear in mind that that 's a that 's an ongoing um uh issue there with that with the club as it 's not anything in the resolution there that that highlights that one so um if we can note that i know that we 've got a an array of lights so uh we 'll we 'll start at uh with cancel latch and then work our way around from then to cancel right for cancellation thanks mr mayor i do have several concerns i mean the project on the surface appears to be a benefit boarding community but i do have concerns from within the contents of the proposal um we talk about i guess the main thing was you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but indirectly they have so the cost of the removing and relocating the koala habitat is obviously going to be a cost to counter that 's any small bit i know but it 's one consideration um it 's the paying 600 annual fee to receive 17 million litres of water for per year for free 32 000 worth of water and increasing every year for free is it hosta council um the um the the the expectation that the council will pay for flood mitigation um is a cost is it cost i don 't think there was any expectation page 64 says it 's proposed that rrc consider providing flood protection to the subject site yeah that that was complete and that i think that 's flown over from their initial draft um recent conversations and and look i 'm more than happy to go back to you know the school themselves and firm this up but they 're they understand that a lot 's changed since that original submission with council and our south rocky and airport levy plans and that that 's still in development and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levees there will be a requirement on them to outwork that conduct those investigations develop that plan and potentially even basically put it into place so they 're not actually formally asking for any financial contribution for that either okay two more things sorry um just just sorry just just to add to that so this is the first step stage of it so if council were to approve uh the extension of the lease area and the extension of the lease to undertake the next step there has to be in a development application process in which case there will be the flood mitigation as part of that that they will have to undertake so we will put just like any other developer on any other piece of land we would put requirements on them to make sure that the buildings are not impeded and that sort of thing so yep and the car parking would be part of that as well correct um secondly thanks mr mayor it 's um there appears to have been no significant community engagement on what 's been proposed for such a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to happen because it 's going to increase the intensity of the usage of the facility this doesn 't appear to be any community consultation so once again that would be part of the development application process that then you would get any objections just like we had with the item before um there would be notice of the proposed development and then any objections and such should be taken at that stage and finally um the proposal seems to rest heavily on the cq capra 's partnership using the facility however there is no formal partnership at the moment and as you explain it 's going to be a training facility but until how long until such time that there 's another facility that will obviously be bigger and better is that what 's going to happen look i guess the conversations that i 've had with um the school and with peter white the ceo of capras they 're they 're looking for a home they 're looking for a permanent base so the intention and you know with this development there i guess the conversations i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be their long-term solution um for the purpose of training i mean like i mentioned their home base and their sponsorship still reside with the league 's club over at brown park and that 's obviously set up for formal games but their training and the infrastructure that 's that 's proposed here would um they 've they 've suggested that to be a long-term solution so and that can we can talk to them more about that in detail when we look at those mou 's if if we go down that path okay because at the workshop we had uh that wasn 't the impression i got from discussions with them just to add to that one mr chair as well like as dustin said capras are i guess have been wanting for this home base for some time or expanded facilities um so at this point in time because there 's limited options around they 're looking for any avenue that they can work with should a new facility open that would something that be addressed at that time but i think we can all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horizon that 's going to give us a new facility anywhere thank you councillor mathis i thank you very much mr chair um i just wanted to mention similar to what you were saying about the um proposed car parking there um running into black hall street i think it is just i 'm mindful of the fact that you know with what we 've been talking about with upgrades to botanical garden and that type of thing that you know if we were to propose a southern entrance um that would be directly in that area yes again it 's that um there 's still that master planning that we 're working through at the moment but uh yeah it 's something there for consideration again that there was um a reason why i questioned that uh that there that area there that it doesn 't become uh fenced off all or or something there that uh that 's part of this development uh we need to be mindful of that and again that had come through the other question that was answered there was through a da lodgement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's that 's what i 'm saying through the chair yes um as as they currently with their current lease and their sorry their trustee lease in the area the car park they 're proposing that they might even you know as part of that development they would enhance that and improve that but they 're not looking to encroach into that or take over any kind of ownership within the lease so that would be purely through the da anything that they proposed and there would be via a improvement works application so basically any any party or any club or group that want to do improvement to council facility or land they go through that standard dea process and basically it 's governed through that so it 's safeguarded through that process okay thank you councillor wickerson um thanks mr mayor uh similar points about the car park if we 're going to be putting a future road through there just to make sure that that 's uh factored in uh with the d.a of course a rigorous community engagement because there are going to be impacts with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorts of things so just to make sure that that 's covered off but which we sure will be um but mostly the uh to do with the koala folder trees and we looked at that at some length on our excursion out there now we 've got some freehold land that i understand this is up along blackhall street extended the council owns and i think we didn 't actually land on what we 're going to do with that those properties uh other than i think grammar school have already purchased three or four of those lots because their car park existing car park at the side of the clubhouse already encroaches on that so i think that sort of been settled but what to do with the balance of them i just had this idea that perhaps that could be factored into the plan as well that that 's where they the the grammar school assist in setting up a new koala fodder plantation it would screen off residents not really blackwall street but on that side of those freehold from the lighting and the noise to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the slope so it 's probably not ideal for building on and may present some some difficulties in harvesting the trees but i think it 's done by hand anyway so it 's not a vehicle thing so i 'm just wondering at this point do we factor that in and say uh if grammar schools expectations that they assist with re-establishing a qualified a plantation somewhere that that we look at that area it solves a problem what to do with it and it 's it 's still close to the zoo to harvest and it could be their contribution yes cancer it may be something that we need to have a further report on there may be other options that are that are more suitable as rather than being on a hill sort of thing but i 'll let alicia yeah through the chair i 'm okay with us making the requirements that they assist us but not necessarily tagging those pieces of land i think there 's probably a number of options but i know that they 've put it in terms of budget submissions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking screening trees like if you recall what lizard said needs to be kept at a very low height so that things can be harvested so possibly not um serving that purpose but again that may be something considered in the development application about screening that area anyway as part of that application not technically for the koala fodder but for the neighbors and so forth and i just want to make sure too that when when we 're looking at how many trees uh are in the negotiation that 's not uh one for every one that we miss because they 're quite mature trees even though they 're docked down uh they have a lot of foliage come off them so it 's not like a little seedling for everyone that 's that 's lost it might be some other some other mathematics on that yeah through the chair that 's exactly right and that 's then you know and and the school understands that so when we 're talking about setting conditions in there in their lease that it needs to be established and an alternative source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from certainly yeah okay thank you council rutherford um yeah just i just wanted can you remind me when the third field was scheduled for um development through the chair sorry yes uh so the third field it 's there they 've got a couple of concepts so in the option one which is the long-term plan the third field is uh separated but in the short-term plan so if if hypothetically if we were to resolve to a certain point their capital development plan to say that you know there won 't be an encroachment for example their third field would overlap the second field currently um basically i 'm not real good with my directions i do apologize council but so the top on the top right had basically overlapped that existing second field to the west of the or that that neighbors the botanics so you 'd have the main field and then the second field that 's over that runs parallel with the plantation that third field would cross across the goal line so that 's what that their concept looks like at this point so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the third field would sit yeah so in the attachments on the on the capital development plan thanks but was the question about the timing of it i think yeah yeah so oh sorry yes apologies through the chair um that that 's in their short term so look they haven 't they haven 't given a structured timeline for for any of these activities and i think that 's why they they 're looking to cancel because naturally there 's a significant amount of investment so without that renewal so their priority is obviously that renewal and as part of the resolution today is to seek that extended renewal term on the trustee lease from there you know they will come back to us with a schedule and as a part of that renewal and sorry the conditions being set we would set those time frames so something you know such as the third field and those those items listed in stage one would have a time frame set at that point um through negotiations so mr mirror i i 'm really torn on this one i think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land and i don 't think you ever give botanic gardens land away lightly and to me the only reason you 'd give it away is for something that we don 't have now the argument can be made that the third field is something we don 't have and we desperately need three fields in one location so i i would accept that argument but if that third field 's not to be developed for 10 or 15 years then i don 't see any point in extending the lease at this point in time that could be done at some point in the future when they 're ready to do that third field because otherwise we 've given a leased area much larger than they need at this point part of which is the botanic gardens for something that could change or not be delivered down the the track and that 's a a real risk for us i believe through through the chair i think that yeah that 's that 's a great that 's a great um i guess for the feedback and it 's something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that is the the placement of the third field so dependent on the extended leased area um we 'll dictate where that third field is resides on the on the property so if we weren 't to encroach into the botanics its location would uh basically overlap you can see there on the left there where the existing field is it would sit down lower and overlap on that whereas if we do provide that encroachment and that extended lease area that third fee that second field currently would be moved across and then the third field would be placed in an alternative location so i guess that 's the hinging that 's the hinging part for them as to where that where that third field would sit um dependent on that i 'll take on board those concerns and um we 're going through a master plan for the for the botanics in the zoo at the moment and that 's a 50-year vision and this this area really hasn 't come up as a options for us looking at that um that said i think a 30-year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 30-year lease it 's still retained by council at some point in time and always able to to review that and remove it so i think having and the request from rockhampton grammar is really to look at giving them the the foundations to build on this third field and i know they haven 't given us timelines on that but i think this will this will set the wheels in motion to to start the development as quick as they possibly can because i i from hearing from them they they believe that that 's their that 's their preferred position is to get to that point in some point in time so this is really just setting the setting the foundations to to deliver on that i don 't really see the the timing of the the extension of the lease has has been critical in any decision if we hold off on it to a later point rather than uh granting it at this point because of our our master planning not looking into the next 50 years that it 's going to be something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that point mr mayor if i could this really has nothing to do with our master planning of the botanic gardens the botanic gardens to me is there for future generations it should be there for 100 years down the track 200 years down the track and not for our generation to give away the land lightly particularly if it 's council we 're not giving away the land though if it 's not going to be delivered if a project is not going to be delivered the only thing in this project that that really benefits the broader community is that third field so that that is really really critical to this project and the delivery and if it 's not going to be delivered or it 's not i 'm saying it 's not going to be delivered so they 're asking for a 30-year term to be able to deliver that 's that 's that 's the idea of the lease is to giving them the foundation to be able to deliver it and again it 's not giving away council land that 's that part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something that 's not out of council 's ownership it 's still only a lease it 's not selling the land or giving it away to somebody else it 's still part of the cancellation and that like i say in a 50-year plan there 's no intention for council to do anything with that corridor other than it sit there and for all intents purposes on that site plan when we walked around it you would have thought that that was part of their their development anyway the fence runs along uh where their existing fields are anyway so if it wasn 't anyone if you didn 't look at it as a plan and knew that it was botanic garden lane to the layman it would look like it was part of that diggers park area anyway yeah i suspect a lot of the botanic gardens is like that a lot of the botanic gardens reserve is like that at this point understood but cancer you get you get you up yeah i 've got a couple of other questions through the chair if i could just respond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the third field is in their short-term plan and that 's one of the big stressor points in terms of the um because they indicated that the fields as they are getting too much use so they need that third field but the intention would be that we make that a stipulation of the least document um we can bring those conditions back through council in terms of the time frame so that should those fields not be delivered well then the lease comes back and that 's triggered that you know has that trigger so we can cancel um and i guess the devil is always a little in the the detail with this and i do um pick up on the point that council latching made that this will be a significant change to the residents in that area um very much so particularly when there 's three fields under light i do wonder about um three fields under light so close to the airport is there an issue with that through the chair council that 's certainly something that the school and through the development applications that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i guess the time of use so i have started those conversations scratching the surface with the school as to what their utilization would be post development if it was to go forward in comparison to current because obviously we do need to be mindful of the surrounding um residents they they have provided a report and i have i 've afforded it through and look we 're happy to share that i haven 't haven 't unpacked that entirely yet but we have made it made them very aware that through the development applications um there will be considerations around that so i 'd have to work with the planning team we 'd have to work with the planning team to understand how that 's measured and managed so that those community stakeholders are considered i suspect i have no doubt that that will happen but i am worried about if we know if our planners can tell us that lights are not going to be allowed there then that 's something we should tell them straight away due to the airport um the the proximity to the airport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight away yeah through through the chair and that and i can take that back and certainly ask that specific question um there are existing lights already on on field on the main field of the facility so there 's already four tl lights i think minimal there yeah so some applications providing it 's been done correctly would have had to apply to i guess those impacts for the airport so but i 'll take that back and seek some further advice specific to that certainly um and then i guess because of the residents if there is some sort of caveat over the properties that as many trees as possible um are remain there because i think that will be vital to the to the uh the residents that are surrounding that area that a lot of that vegetation uh remains um i think that 's you know that 's where they 've that 's the end the environment they 've enjoyed so i think we need to be very very careful about how much of that is is changed in the development of obviously some will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much as possible of the natural environment around there i think is important and then just finally mr mayor was once again the car parking and more so for uh you know if we 're looking at three fields here and we 're looking at major carnivals then um we need to be sure that there is enough car parking to accommodate that so we need to look at different areas and there are spaces available through there for car parking that would certainly help car parking for both this development and the botanic gardens into the future so i think that 's discussions we need to have with them as well thanks counselor council smith oh yeah thanks mr mayor when we met with the representatives of the school that day and i was a bit concerned about the koala trees but when we walked the site liz sort of explained that the trees have been allowed to grow too tall and we can 't use them anyway for koala feed they 've got to be fairly small and so i 'll sort of stop worrying then but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they usually sort of explain they 're very fussy they 've got to have a certain breed of a tree to eat and that we weren 't using those trees at the moment but obviously land that we could use but those really big trees we wouldn 't want to cut them down anyway yeah thank you yeah through the chair um certainly we uh with with the workshop or the site visit excursion that we undertook um prior to that offices attendant we actually did identify that there is a there 's about fifty percent of the plantation that 's currently utilized um and with the remaining that 's a that is overgrown and they 're not currently harvesting from so certainly that was something to consider too but in saying that um the zoo is the curator of the zoo um i obviously would like to see that and through our budget submissions we are looking at trying to find an alternative that 's actually going to far exceed that current plantation naturally but in saying that we don 't want to reduce our access to excuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while it 's it 's maybe minimal it 's still it 's still vital and we 've made that very clear to the school that an alternative food source would need to be established before we even touch what is still harvested there certainly thank you okay councillors see i think we 've exhausted all the questions on that one so um i 'll look for a mover in a second with regards to it i 'll cancel rutherford oh sorry mr may there was just the um the gymnasium area there i 'm guessing reserve land once again if that gymnasium is looking at external members and it becomes a commercial operation i don 't think that 's um allowed on that site no no through the chair certainly uh the the uh the assets and the infrastructure that whether it 's a gymnasium whether it 's uh you know the meeting rooms and that it would all be rockhampton grammar school that develop and utilize and own that it wouldn 't be for i guess it would be similar to current clubs you know their clubhouse and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is they have the ownership and responsibility for it but it 's not a commercial basis that it 's used for the the cq capra is a part of the mou so there is a gymnasium in in that section as part of the mou they would have access to it to utilize but it wouldn 't be then commercialized to the general public at all can we please make sure that there is a clear understanding from them that that 's the the case because in previous times it it wasn 't um people were of the belief that they could open to membership um and then found out they couldn 't so you know they need to know exactly what rules they have to abide by that yeah once again that in that development application process in terms of hours of operation and clientele all of those things in that proposal okay thank you seek a mover in a second with regards to the recommendation move councillor wickerson do we have a second councillor smith councillors i 'd i 'd just like to firstly support the the application @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facilities over time have have deteriorated and to see something like this where there 's a school and a club willing to uh to invest to to bring it up to a standard to um for our athletes and uh elite sports i think it 's something there that we we do support um being mindful that there are issues there that we need to consider as far as the neighbours and uh and where that development actually occurs and what happens and when uh again mindful of our koala needs as well our family equality so again it 's something there that uh really really will enhance uh a sport in the in the region going forward so on that um councillors if there 's no uh issues i 'll put that put it to the vote those in favor those against you want to record that yeah record councillor latcham 's uh vote against that one thank you thank you thank you mr man council thank you uh councillors we 'll do one more item then then take a research if that 's okay uh this is another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward uh item 10.5 food organics and green garden organics um peter oh sorry michael online there michael would you like to present that report please yeah thank you mr mayor and hopefully you can hear me and good morning and good morning councillors you can hear me okay yes we can and thank you michael yeah great thank you so yeah look further to the workshop that we had uh in the middle of march where we went through the the project proposal and the sort of the financials and and diversion outcomes that this that ultimately by implementing a food and garden organic service would provide the community council was invited by the state government to submit a funding proposal um and this report is uh and council rockhampton regional council was one of four councils in queensland that was invited by the state to make a funding proposal and we have made that a submission to the state and this report is just seeking a suitable endorsement from council for that application that has gone to the state what we 're not seeking today is is council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any funding agreement that may come from the state um we will certainly come back to council before that was to occur and to seek further resolution to actually undertake the trial and to sign any funding agreement that may be uh forthcoming uh with that i might just happy to take any questions okay thanks very much michael councillor latcham is the portfolio chair would you like to thanks thanks mr me yeah i um i fully support this um it 's where the industry is heading um it 's good to see that the state is being proactive in in trialling this first before we they do roll it out statewide and i think rockhampton regional council is in an ideal geographic situation location to to trial lists and and hopefully we 'll get the the big tick to give us a trial with our community and the results of that would obviously then help the state uh work out how how can be rolled out thank you councillor kirkland um thank you mr mayor uh yes i echo those sentiments of of council electron i think this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial this and there 's certainly sentiment from the community for us to to find a way to deal with that organic waste and this is a very very good start okay thank you councillor fisher thank you mr mayor look firstly there uh with this i 've got to commend the staff at rockhampton wasting recycling and the chairman council latching um because there has been a lot of work that has gone in in the lead up to this and i think it 's that that leadership that has been shown has has set us in a really good way but i 'd like to actually give a little bit more of a background because uh as the state government has been developing uh their policy uh directions to taking you know our state to a zero waste communities what has always happened to date has been everything has been trialled in the southeast corner and it was the exceptional work that both rockhampton regional council and townsville city council have done has actually shown that as far as developing a circular economy and this is part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very pointy end of the state and a lot of what will come out of these trials will actually go as part of the legislation so really i think this and mr ceo i think you could take a lot of pride in the work that is happening in our council because we are at a point there where governments are actually looking to the great work we 're doing for policy now all my time on council i 've never seen that up until recent times so got to commend everyone involved in this project is really good and i would love to second this motion to the chairman thanks councillor fisher councillor mayers i thank you very much mr may um look i am in agreement as well i think it 's a it 's a great project and something that we should um you know we should be proud of and i 'm probably just jumping forward with this because i 'm just i 'm a bit of a figures person i was just looking so uh and maybe to michael my band to be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do go ahead with the trial that you know we 've got 750 bins at about almost 40 000 in cost i was just wondering um obviously understanding that 250 of those bins would need to be for green waste is there any reason why we can 't just change the lid of the bin um for the trial you know we could save ourselves almost 26 000 if we just changed the existing bins the lid of the bins for the trial that 's all i wanted to ask yes yeah accounts through the chair council motors yeah that is a good point and that the logistics of doing that is something that we 're also looking at also if we get to the point and hopefully we do where we look to roll out this service across the region we 're also looking at the logistics of how we may be able to do that uh for the whole region not just for this trial so that 's something we 're still working on okay thank you thank you thanks mark okay councillors we 've exhausted the questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm happy to move second and councillor fischer i 'll put that those in favor against carried thanks councillors look i reckon we could squeeze one more in uh 10.6 the smart hub operational plan sorry was my bad i shouldn 't have put that tip out there that we were gonna go for a recess is that do they okay oh look we might call the recess council sorry sorry drew um uh i didn 't realize there was a presentation with this report but if

carried councillors it was very remiss of me i do apologize um with that previous uh report on the um diggers park and rockhampton grammar school uh project and the portfolio chair council rutherford i didn 't didn 't recognize her at the start of that report and the work that she 'd undertaken over the last three years to to get that project to where it is currently my apologies counsellor for not um for not recognizing that during that that issue so i just like to make that uh formal um again something of my bad i overlooked and i do apologize for that okay moving on to item 10.6 the smart hub operational plan 2021 2023. thanks drew thanks mr mayor and good morning councillors um thanks for the opportunity to present our plan for the next two years the foresight of this council has seen the smart hub lead the way for small business and uh and elise and the team have put together the strategic priorities uh to build on the excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth of the startup ecosystem and small business community so i won 't steal any more of elisa 's thunder and and i 'll hand you over to our smartart business manager to presentation of the yacht plan thanks very much drew good morning mr mayor and councillors i can 't believe it 's been three years since i last stood in this room uh to present you at that time the 2018 to 2020 operational plan and here i am again to present to you not only the results that we achieved in executing that plan but also um to present to you our new plan the 2021-23 plan for your approval now as you that wasn 't meant to happen at all there we go that 's better as you know the smart hub is a key economic um outcome of rockhampton regional council 's smart way forward strategy that is our digital readiness strategy and our smart city strategy and it was adopted by council in december of 2015. this strategy has led us to build the smart hub over the last four years it first operated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now it found its permanent home in customs house so the smart hub exists to support entrepreneurs and people in business to create and grow local and global businesses in fact the smart hubs division is to be the home of our people in business and to provide the resources required for our businesses to succeed and we 've been doing that over the last four years and really the smart hub has not only been the center of resources for businesses to access but also the center of what we 've called an innovation ecosystem and so the way in which we 've built this innovation ecosystem was in the previous or plan this might look a little bit familiar we followed this model called an up global model and really this model said that there were five pillars to an innovation ecosystem and you can see them there italian dean city capital culture and government and on each pillar you can see the strategies that we 've been executing across those pillars in achieving results and building an innovation ecosystem and helping and supporting our businesses to grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you is the results of this work so as you can see we 've been very very busy at the smart hub and here 's a snapshot of the results that we 've achieved our broader membership has grown by 185 from 35 members to 100 members and these are paying members then our broader community has grown by over 200 percent we currently have 3 400 social media followers across our platforms we have 1500 subscribers on our database then between july 2019 and 2020 the smart up hosted 253 events which saw 6078 people attend those events we also saw 92 pitches during that last financial year but really the greatest outcomes is not what we 've done but it 's what our members have achieved and it 's what the people who are at the coalface of building business in our region every day they are the champions and what they 're achieving is really the results that i 'd like to share with you and so from my perspective we can measure two things number one we can measure the revenue that they contribute to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs that they create and that 's really tricky to measure unless we ask them so i made a bold decision at the end of the last financial year in may 2020 and i decided to do just that and to ask direct questions about how much money were you making and how many people were you employing well we asked 100 members and only 35 people were game enough to tell us we did take a bit of um conjolling to get the information but really this is what we saw 35 of our members have contributed in excess of 9.2 million dollars to a local economy in the last financial year and they also created 155 jobs what 's what the work we 're doing at the smart up is working for the businesses in our local community and that gave me a bit of an understanding of what was happening in the smart hub community but i wanted to broaden my vision and look at the whole of our economy and look at what other businesses were doing even if they weren 't unplugged into the smart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some data analysis and we looked at two bits of research the gem data as well as qrip data and there 's a lot of detail around this research in the actual operational plan i just put a bit of a snapshot of some of the graphs that are available on this slide but basically this is what the research shows innovation matters in short the research highlights the importance of the need for innovation and not only in our region not only to ensure that economic growth for now but also economic stability in the medium term the world is constantly changing and as a result the way in which business is done must evolve and change organizations today face a market of constant instability and disruption due to significant changes in the customer demographics and behavior technology and regulations this situation not only provides opportunities for our business community to find innovative ways to grow but it actually demands them to innovate and change and without innovation businesses risk losing market position and revenue to more forward thinking and agile competitors and the qrip data specifically clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sales from new products and services and higher profit and growth more generally innovators also displayed higher labor and capital productivity and increased market share compared to non-innovators innovation really really does matter and so in looking at that looking at where we 've come from looking at where we are as a smart up community looking at our broader economy i thought about setting two new strategic priorities for this for this operational plan and here they are in short they boil down to number one encourage more businesses to start and and also to grow not just start because it 's really easy for a business to start and fail but for a business to start and grow and stay in our local economy secondly the other strategic objective that i think we 've set is the fact that we need to encourage existing business community to adopt technology and innovation not because it 's a buzzword not because it 's a good thing to do but because of how the world is changing we have no choice we have to become more innovative we have to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the previous um plan and i showed you that little house model we used the up global model with five police and really i went in search of a new model that was a little bit more sophisticated in helping us execute the next level of this work and so we landed on the pearson model and you 'll see that it has seven pillars as opposed to five and those seven pillars are ideas growth support culture and infrastructure market access talent financial capital and those six pillars center around the central pillar which is leadership collaboration and connectivity and i just like to quickly highlight the strategies that we 're going to execute across those seven pillars to be able to build each of those pillars but also to build the system as a whole and here 's a bit of a snapshot so under ideas we 're hoping to host more ideas events so ideation days startup weekends govhack and as such for growth support we want to provide continue to provide and provide more early stage business coaching and mentoring this is absolutely critical for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help you along the way it helps and and hold you accountable for taking the actions that need to be taken and help you problem solve it makes all the difference run other accelerator incubator and other programs we ran amazing programs last year and the years before including the turbo traction lab and cq meets accelerator and a host of others we want to take that to the next level and run similar programs culture and infrastructure established rockhampton regional council innovation awards i really thought long and hard about how can we change the culture in our community to be more open towards innovation and how can we celebrate the success of what 's already happening and i think this awards maybe in collaboration with advanced rocky will help us to establish more of an open mindset around innovation and also give us the opportunity to show them what innovation is and that they 're probably already being innovative in their businesses and how to encourage more innovation then market access so a market access really indicates how can we get access to more customers and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the smart up club is an innovative approach that we 're doing ourselves in encouraging our members and facilitating our members to collaborate with each other pass opportunities to each other and do strategic and alliances and joint ventures together encourage corporate memberships corporates actually have deep access to markets existing markets and it 's really good when you put corporates and new businesses together because they can leverage off each other and then talent we want to enlarge our mentoring program we have an existing number of incredible mentors that are situated across australia we want to enlarge that and give our members more access to great mentoring facilitate and support youth entrepreneurship we continue to work tirelessly to ensure that we have a pipeline of people who can create their own jobs and don 't just rely on other people to provide employment for them and expand the seeker university internship program which we 've already started we 're really we 're working with the it department currently and we 'd like to expand that further also into the business part of the university so financial capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd like to expand that we 're providing access to our members to angel capital venture capital and we also want to establish a panel of banks and accountants in our region and then finally leadership collaboration and connectivity and to be honest this is the one that i 'm probably the most concerned about doing but i think that it 's hard when the smart hub owns or is perceived to own innovation in our region and there is really a strict limit to what our little team of three people can do and so what i see is the opportunity for us to collaborate i 'm losing my earrings um is to collaborate sorry about that i 'm to collaborate i was fine to collaborate more generally thank you so much to collaborate more generally across our region we need leaders in the region to be part of innovation we need all of the people in economic development to be part of innovation we need other people in business to so say yes it 's good to be innovative it 's good to move with the times it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at how we can stay viable and relevant in rocky whether we 'll be able to get that done is a different question but we 'll have we 'll give it our best go um on top of that we also have to do some marketing things so we 're going to incorporate the customer value journey launch the smart hub website look at our social media channels establish a facebook community and also establish a referral program and the other part of the story is we can 't stop doing what we 've done to date and so this is really the big picture we have to do everything that we 've done to date on top of that we have to take on these new initiatives and we also have to do great marketing and if we 're able to execute all of this together we 'll be able to make a really impact a really big impact and a difference to our business community because in the end i have a heart for people in business i have a heart for people who stand up every day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributing revenue to our community we have to look after those people they are amazing people so here are our goals 140 smart top members 3 000 people on our mailing list 80 external bookings high event attendance rates increased awareness and credibility in our local community a changed mindset of our local business community the promotion of smart club members increased revenue increased social media activity and online presence that is credible interesting including storytelling and is valuable to our target market and positive awareness in local state and national government as well as national and international entrepreneurial communities and even though that seems like a very ambitious thing to do we 've already made some great inroads in that and the rockhampton is known across australia and even in some instances internationally as a place where you can build a really interesting startup and a good business and so in conclusion i 'd like to say the smart up is a valuable and valued economic development strategy that this council has had the foresight to support and i would like to thank you for that support because without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue to do the valuable work that is making such a huge difference to the people of our community so thank you very much for the opportunity to present this plan to you today [Applause] very passionate presentation i thought uh well delivered but uh thanks very much is this a normal tuesday morning here [Laughter] and uh thanks very much for that council 's uh questions counselor smith just not no question but just a comment i 'd like to congratulate you release than the smart hub uh great feedback that i get uh i was at a capricorn chamber of commerce coffee catch up only a few weeks ago when a lady has got a business with you and she 's so passionate about everything in the smart hub she was telling everybody about the smart hub you know and how happy she was to be there and what um great assistance she gets to start her own business she didn 't have the confidence to start her own business before that so yeah congratulations and i think i um i zoomed in on one of your uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'll just forget what you called it now but it was absolutely fantastic i think i 've done it twice the traction yeah yeah and and that was absolutely wonderful and so congratulations thank you you 're doing and i think we 're one of only a few councils that even do anything like this so i think we 've really led the way uh in um in the smart hub and getting people into business thank you so much i really appreciate that feedback thank you and thank you again for being champions for this initiative it 's really amazing thank you and thank you and again nurturing those entrepreneurs there 's something there that uh yeah we need that uh process going for but the operational plan will uh will allow that to occur uh again there 'll be some budget decisions but uh again that 's something there we realize and um through that presentation uh fully aware about what the successes have been but what the future holds uh in that space is something there that we will take into consideration moving forward okay councillors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mr chair yes i really wanted to echo um the sentiments of councillor smith and congratulate you elise and your team are also um within your operational plan was excited to see the the innovation awards that you 're proposing i think that 's a great idea we are in an era of innovation and to encourage that in the rockhampton region and have somebody who 's focused on encouraging that is a really good thing so i was pleased to see that aspect included and look forward to its delivery thank you thank you very much thank you okay councillors could we have a mover in a second with regards to move councillor fischer seconded councillor smith i 'll put those in favor against carrie a bit too quick there with the name sorry linda okay moving on to item 10.7 councillors um again this is uh an update on on the portfolio vacancies and their titles we 've had a request to change some of the names on the on the portfolio um to try and give them a better representation there look i 've got some thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going with this so if um if you if you allow and give me the indulgence i 'll i 'll go through some of the discussions that i 've had and then from there we can we can go to the floor now saying that um we 'll we um we 'll look to the the person or the chair of chair personal portfolio person in there but then looking at uh advanced rock camp tonight i do have a have an idea and and and it 's something that 's evolving about how we can start to work on uh projects uh with a number of councillors there to to work and promote those those goals going forward so um if i might i might just allow that to go to work through that with some names and some changes and then and then we 'll take it from there if that 's okay so firstly with advanced rockhampton i 'd like to um to be the portfolio spokesperson for um for advanced rocky and events um and then moving on to waste uh waste and recycling uh cancel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be just the airport uh council of fisher now infrastructure is one of my previous was my previous portfolio which will the name change will go to transport and drainage i was hoping councillor smith would would take on that portfolio and then moving on to planning and regulation uh council smith that becomes vacant uh turning it to planning and regulation so uh councillor may the mathers with that with that portfolio as a new councillor moving into that space sports park and public spaces councillor rutherford retained that area communities council of wickerson and then water and environmental sustainability councillor kirkland so that was that was my thoughts on on where we were going with the portfolios now i 'm happy to open it up to the floor and uh and and take it from there that 's okay councillor wickerson um thank you mr mayor um i 've had a previous chat with alicia uh this is more to do with the op plan um and strategic plan that we haven 't even though we 've got lots of heritage elements but me that we come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the heritage rail people that want some assistance so we 've got lots of pockets of heritage happening around but no real focus or area responsibility that that sits under sort of historically it sits with communities with heritage village of course and archer park rail station and others but just to identify heritage as a distinct element that council is focused on moving forward i wouldn 't mind adding that to communities in the nation in the titleist communities and heritage it just flags at the to the broader community that we are uh focused on that moving forward yep i 'm i 'm not opposed to that if that 's okay um so we can add that to the to the to the name there now councillors there are uh assistance in portfolio areas so um at this stage with uh with tourism uh i know council rutherford has spoken to me about that one but um if i could just leave that one at the moment as we as we 're um still in uh some discussions with external groups so if and we could come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doesn 't eventuate but uh i know council election was um was keen to work with councillor fischer and um in the airport space so uh if council election would like to take on that assistance role uh and counselors i haven 't uh was there someone else that made an approach councillor wickerson or councillor smith sorry i 'm not no i was just thinking uh i 'd like to be the assistant for uh planning and regulation just to help counselor matha on the way because it is a huge portfolio yep no and i think that those synergies are great to work on that so if that 's that 's okay um we 'll put council smith down with uh with planning and regulations uh councillor rutherford then council wickerson um i would have an interest in being assistant at uh communities and heritage yep uh council wickerson um and i 'd like to be assistant for environment too if um councillor kirkland will have me yeah obviously still have interests there okay feel free to objectively and i 'm happy to work with councillor smith i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transport and drainage as an area that i 've had had a lot of involvement in for and uh and and to work with that one so council that 's probably uh probably a wrap up of that one and probably do we need to appoint that no that second item that 's that 's fine to drop that off is that okay okay cancers i 'll i 'll see a few lights on so i 'll straight away councillor rutherford i was just wondering whether we can go back to um park sport and public spaces as the title yeah please yeah that 's that 's just and with just the common not not the anne 's yeah park sport and public spaces and my comment was just with transport and drainage transport to me gives the opinion of vehicles um buses and and i 'm not sure that 's what we want to be telling you did you want to leave it at infrastructure council yeah just leave it back at infrastruct infrastructure if that 's okay i think that that really it 's not a long a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there that people relate to yeah take drainage out thanks linda yes council smith oh i just want to comment mr um mr chair that um you 've left big shoes to fill in infrastructure so uh i and i i suppose everyone knows i really wanted a change like from dogs and cats and local laws and pest management and whatever else but now i 'm really sad that i wasn 't talking about dogs dogs and cats anymore yeah yeah yeah yeah it 's uh now and again i i think it 's uh it 's great to be able to have a chance to have a bit of a rethink and re reset on some of these ones but again it 's a yeah a lot of work that 's gone into those portfolios over the years and you do you do take a lot of responsibility on in those roles so um again uh council of mothers they 've got big shoes to fill in that space it 's uh uh one but again it it 's it 's a great learning curve to to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll find that there 's a great opportunity to learn and and building those uh efforts that have been previously taken forward councilman thanks mr mayor just like to say thanks very much for um making something available for me so i appreciate it and council smith thank you uh councillor fisher yes thank you mr mayor um i reckon there 's a really good group of committee chairs around the table i think this is only going to just improve things even take counter to the next level i think that this is going to work really well and i know council maters there is going to be a great uh planning chair but also there he now gets is it the brass flying fox as the leader the councillor for flying foxes so welcome to that um i 'd also sort of like to say look i would uh if i could um be the um assistant with the waste waste recycling but really they 're not um in the strategic side of of uh waste and recycling which would sort of uh dovetail in with my work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus on that area we 've got a very very good chair in waste and recycling but in that section okay okay that 's all missed me no worries thanks very much cancer fish we 'll all i 'll move as those uh positions uh secret seconder secretary councillor fisher i 'll put that to the table eyes in favor against carrie thanks very much councillors that 's a great result i believe moving on to the next item 10.8 the appointment of representatives to external organizations so okay so i 'll ask ross to uh to walk through this one if we can counselors thank you mr chair in the absence of diamond i 'll um present this report that was raised lifted from the matters left on table this morning we 're still um looking for the appointment and we also have the uh wording now for the which is separated for the disaster management group so yeah and we 're looking for that appointment as well okay so yeah one team it 's up to the table mister did you go through yep right yeah um uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy to move on to that one that 's uh that 's one where traditionally i think it was the mayor but uh it 's not my i 've got enough on my plate at the moment without that one um the queensland futures institute and it 's one that we we 're still involved in but we may come back at those ones i think we 're still part of the budget discussion so i 'll continue in that role and similar with the regional capitals australia australia one uh now the rockhampton regional roads and transport group i chair that one but i 'll seek an assistant so councillor smith would you would you like to join um partner in that one i think it 's important as far as road networks and uh and the wider cq area uh i 'm also a member for the university rural clinic school i think that was one that we 'd we 'd started up one and also both with the rockhampton progress association inc i 'm not sure whether that one will continue or not but at this point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the public meeting but i joined uh as part of the member as uh the entry was parting being membership so i 'll uh i 'll record that at the moment but whether i 'll continue in that role it 's uncertain now uh the appointment of the chair to the local disaster and deputy chair for the local disaster management group council of wickerson has uh indicated uh interest in that position and councillor fisher was stepping down as the deputy chair uh councillor wickerson 's involvement with the ses and uh in that space is keen to work with those synergies in that area so that really does wrap up that side of it as far as the other the previous decisions i don 't see is there any changes there that we need to be made or is it just basically those no i think they 're all they 're all pretty much the same as what they were cancelled so uh with that on our council smith we 're talking these previous decisions uh just for the capricorn pest management group uh councillor kirkland has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so busy with other meetings she hasn 't been able to attend so can i change that to council made this and myself because i 'm still the treasurer of the organisation i 'm happy to hand it over but i still have an interest in pest management okay now that 's uh i 'm happy for them yeah yep um can i just add to that if i will yes um councillor mothers it will be the most fun group that you could ever hope to be a part of guaranteed again another another great opportunity to learn and learn a bit more about local government councillor maintenance sorry hardly here yes yes yep and remove councillor kirkland from that one okay now councillor fisher yes i was just going to just once again reaffirm that we do need to look at the value of a couple of these groups like the regional capitals and i would like to encourage council to to look at as being part of the queensland regional council of mayors i think that that has got a lot more value for us moving forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at how we actually sort of become a small player in a national group rather than being one of the big players in a state group i think that that would have more benefit so just like to urge that in that discussion yeah that 's that 's uh that can be taken up at that time cancer and understand uh seeing the the point made there oh i 'll have to put 20 in the phone box sorry about that um yes no that 's understood uh it 's something that we can discuss during our budget deliberations and workshops cancer so um take that on note okay uh linda 's we 've caught up all the changes there um cancer i don 't see any further lights on there so can i just there just a reminder again that counselors who are on these groups um to you know appropriate notes reports back to the council table either through cib or to the council table or a regular basis and just on your register of interest counsellors too any changes there need to need to go up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth as well so yes uh good point ken uh mr ceo uh getting that uh transparency and information back to the table is uh critically important as far as that uh those meetings go uh that said councillors are happy to seek a move in a second with uh regards to the officer 's recommendations move councillor kirkland second in council wickerson i 'll put that those in favor against carrie thank you you have a late item council is on the agenda okay thanks thanks very much council fisher uh cancels the late item agenda item there uh for the ordinary 10.9 uh who 's repair oh it 's going to be a bit of a mixed bag this one um angus has um added dream time assisting with their strategic planning so uh mr mayor and councillors we 've gone through particularly um some future programs for next year 's budget and we 've had um what we 're recommending for our works for queensland applications one is the north rockhampton sewage treatment plant augmentation uh the riverbank boardwalk repairs and refurbishment he recently had that as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works for queensland and in the future years i know we 're in the process of our botanic gardens master plan but remember this is over three years this one is that the um the playground is coming up for renewal and um so we put this project in there as well yeah and again uh this this uh round is is a longer round than previously normally they were over a two-year time frame this one 's three years and uh we need to have these projects put up now um for that for that uh decision for the state to be able to locate those those funds um councillor rutherford um yeah i love the thought of the renewal of the playground at the botanic gardens but the side of me that that goes can 't all be fun we have to do some other stuff would say that the toilet block is probably more important so unless we think we 're going to get um funding from somewhere else for the toilet block i would have thought that it was probably a higher priority than the playground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and out but compare amount of work we 're running the other part to it is we 've got thursday is our deadline for this so we just got a bit of time issues yeah counsellor so it does it actually does take pressure off us to actually fund the fund the toilet block ourselves so if it becomes a priority within the sooner time frame we can actually use that we 've got more funding there didn 't say that we 've got more money in our own budget for the total block yeah and and that may have been the case i wasn 't sure whether there was something some other way but as a priority i think it is it 's higher than the playground yeah yeah probably sorry if i could through the mirror is that we were looking at the uh playground renewal in the last year it 's probably one switch through the botanic garden so maybe the toilet block will be year one or year two or whatever it might be if we would look specifically at playgrounds then the botanic gardens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly in our playground strategy so it 's not that it 's not needed just on a broader botanic garden scale i think the toilet block is probably higher priority no that 's uh that 's understood and noted counselor we can we can work on that get information back as those budgets are delivered counselors uh having any further information on that i know that uh it 's great to see this works for queensland money coming through it 's uh something we we haven 't had the privilege of over previous years so it 's great to see that and uh putting it to projects here that we really um do need to need to undertake it 's a great program there like it 's fairly untied and we can use it right from capital through to our maintenance so it 's a really good one so um we 'll probably take normally a few months for um the notification to come out of the department to let us know if they approve these um projects but once they do or once we get something we 'll um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people know talk about it then okay counsellors look i 'm happy oh sorry councillor mothers sorry thanks very much miss uh mr may um just thought some background for myself um 2021 to 2024 works for queensland program does that mean that the those funds are only available that that amount of funds are only available for that period of time or but the program has to be run during that time we have to deliver all of those projects within that period within that period of time but there 'll be will this funding come up annually no no no it 's time we 've already committed funding um we 've just got to tell the the department what projects we 're wanting to put towards that funding okay and they just acknowledge that see if it takes all their guidelines and let us know okay so in 2024 there 'll be another round of funding we 'd hope so okay you 're welcome yes yes yes yes it 's a great program yeah yes it is we should um keep praising the government for this program that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not contestable uh funding uh we 're allocated on our population and uh and uh statistics there so it 's something there that 's um really welcomed and something there that allows council to do things that are probably a little bit further on uh down in their budget process so it 's a great project and we 've been able to live many many projects over the last few years really to tidy up and renew some of the areas around the region so some of those things have been new which come with a cost but now we 're looking at projects here that we will need to replace some of that critical infrastructure that that we need for our community which is a great opportunity council as that said i 'm happy to move move this report uh and seek a second uh councillor mothers i 'll put that those in favor against carried thanks very much councillors and so that brings us to the end of our gender items oh sorry my my baddie moving on too quick uh there 's a notification there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come back counselor would you like to speak to your notice yeah thank you mr mayor yes um councillors uh as per the um background and everything written here i just wanted to highlight that between 2018 and september of 2020 waxford street was actually the subject of significant operational works for flood mitigation and draining reconstruction works and part as part of those several properties were actually on the southern side of the wakford street all received considerable disruption and changes to the topography and the gradient of their properties and their verges and their pathways were changed and their driveways in some instances the majority of the properties that were previously affected by the impacting flood waters which was the reason for for the um reconstruction works excuse me we 're on the northern side of wakford street and all of those works that have been completed do appear to have actually resolved those flooding issues i 've been approached on a number of occasions by a resident on the northern side and i won 't read out the entire history there for you but certainly wanting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mitigation of obligation have been met by council as to the restoration of those verges and footpaths i believe that consideration should be extended to alleviate any inconvenience is brought upon any residents in particular the one that has been contacting me you can see here that the the above mention that the resident of wackford street contacted me on the 21st of december to raise the subject they considered that results come back coming back from the ombudsman were not satisfactory it 's been through the normal council process through the council 's complaints management process they were not satisfied that the works were restorative of the original condition of the property so i believe that uh it is my understanding that the resident has also contacted other councillors and is considerably feels considerably in their opinion disadvantaged by council 's works my personal opinion having looked at the property um i 've certainly seen photographs and certainly of my my own observation previously as the as the councillor for the division um saw the property before the works and after the works and if it were my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same sentiment that that council could could have probably done this a little bit better i 'm seeking all of your support to just have a report brought back to us from council officers in regards to the details relating to the matter and including the provision of assistance for appropriate remediation and in particular the remediation is sought by the resident mentioned in the report here who has lodged those official complaints thank you yeah so uh i 'll be move do i move that motion yes so if i could move the motion to have a report brought back to councillors um including uh what have we got up there i 'll read it out better report presented to next council meeting in relation to the remediation of property footpaths in wakford street park avenue following recent works undertaken by council uh question councillor happy second and councillor wickerson question counselor rutherford no i was i was haven 't gotten a second okay counselor if there 's [Music] yes peter the deadline the timing on that the reports close next that 's not possible okay okay um the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah um next available meeting council meeting is that well available it 's not the right word no i don 't okay um okay council meeting 11th of may yep okay the s second are happy with that change in the resolution move councillor kirkland second in council of wickerson i 'll put that cancers those in favor against do you want to record no okay thank you cancels that uh brings us to the end of our generation my apologies to jumping over that one there before but uh any questions on notice uh urgent business questions if not i 'd like to thank everyone in the offices for their attendance and uh close the meeting thank you [Music] [Music],"(-23.3786203, 150.5088889)"

we 'll just go back to uh our apologies and leave of absence and our mayor has uh has done the right thing today he 's not feeling well so he has decided there that he would uh go and have a test and just stay clear of us all today so uh our mayor is not um here other than that everybody else is in attendance so uh we 've still got to move the confirmation or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah okay next is the confirmation of the minutes of the ordinary meeting held on the 9th of march moved councillor smith seconded council latcham uh if there 's no business from those minutes all those in favor and that is uh carried we 've got no public forums or deputations no um item five is any interest to declare in any matters within the council agenda now you can either do it now or just before the item was raised but i 've got two lights council smith oh yeah thanks mr chair uh 10.3 when it 's talk we 're talking about disposal of council assets i have a conflict of interest with the victoria park tennis courtship because my nephew is heavily involved with junior tennis is also employed by tennis queensland so i 'd like to leave the room when that 's discussed kirkland um yes so i 've got a personal interest in the south rockhampton flood levy as my husband brett kirkland and i lease the premises on 55 gladstone road allenstown and the company is dalcrip proprietary limited trading as ultratune south rockhampton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council outcomes of the queensland treasury corporation financial performance review and credit review and items 8.16 8.16 the financial section update and items 8.1.10 the risk registers that 's the quarterly update as at the 31st of january 2020. they all mentioned the south rockhampton flood levy however as the reports are of a high level counsellors and providing information only they 're not for decision making i do not believe that i 've got a declarable interest in those items for today however if there is discussion on those on that south rockhampton flood levy i will declare a declarable conflict and leave the meeting thank you councillor kirkland i also have a second one council um fisher so that one is item 10.5 we 've got that one up there karen um i counselor anna kirkland informed the meeting that i have a declarable conflict of interest because my son-in-law troy graham is a beneficiary of the business his parents business trading as hde engineering designs and professionals rockhampton city and the property as well located at 18 albert street so that i will deal with that by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council smith but council action your light is on thanks mr deputy mayor yes 10.3 um there 's a mention of a property at the rockhampton tennis association which is a perceived conflict of interest and as such i 'll leave the bill leave the table on that okay so you 've got that and due to the conflict and sorry miss mary yeah um i think your councillor election you just have to um describe what the conflict is so yeah uh i 'm a trustee of a family trust that owns a tennis complex in north rockhampton so thank you councillor legend with those and if as we 're moving through the agenda if you notice an item coming up that you suddenly realize that you do have a conflict please put on your light or even interject before that item is dealt with so we 've addressed the public forums reputations addressed the presentation of petitions now onto uh eight committee reports and then we 've got the audit and business improvement committee meeting from the 11th of march 2021 um now any discussion as to items @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we need to scroll through that yes so um if there is no discussion someone happy to move the report be received council latcham seconded council kirkland all those in favor and that 's carried okay we move on to oh council smith mr t was just a comment that i 'm pleased to see mr balance has been elected as the new chair of the committee i think it 's important that we have uh one of the outside members as chair it makes us fully transparent it wasn 't always that way but we made it that way a couple of years ago and ross you had [Music] hi thanks ross okay we move on to the councillor delegate reports so um our first one there is uh with advanced rockhampton uh as the mayor is not here he is the portfolio councillor uh this report will ask greg to come to the lectern and present the report the resolution of the e-scooters morning uh acting mayor and uh and councillors uh always great to be standing in front of you with something exciting uh that 's for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is one of those so i hope you agree with me by the end of this conversation but today we 've spoken about this in the past but this is the formal side of it uh e-scooters as we 've said in our past conversations are a great opportunity for residents and visitors of our city uh they promote that active lifestyle they give an alternative to public transport uh they 're an economic connector they connect our cbd to our sporting precincts our cbd to our shopping other shopping precincts connects the university keeps people out of their cars where possible it gives a sustainability angle outcome sorry uh again from getting people out of their cars on some of those short trips the uh proposals the reason for going for an eoi is to look at as many options as we possibly can and then shortlist down to what we think best suits our city so that 's at that stage we would come back to council with a proposal to go out with a shortlist for a tender that tender would then be for a trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that trial they succeed in that trial and we think it 's something for our city that we would then progress to a longer term contract so while we 're out to eli i will continue to work on the legal and commercial framework from a tender point of view so it gives us that breathing space there as well to make sure we 've got that legal and commercial framework any proposal that we get back i would i would would not be bringing back to council anything that is not cost at least cost neutral to council you know if there is a financial benefit even better but the most likely outcome from early discussions are a cost neutral outcome to council probably the last point i 'll make on the operational side of these scooters is uh the data side of it and the data capture which i think we can use to a real benefit by watching in this case people slash scooter movement may help us with our planning whether that be from a traffic point of view uh from the roads but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people are actually traveling uh that may give us an outcome where we can go we really should have a walk track that way as well or or about new bike lanes or whatever that might mean along the way so from a city planning point of view it makes makes sense to be able to share that data with the successful proponent when we get to that stage so i say today the the recommendation is to go out to an expression of interest uh under the local government act uh which would then allow us to go out to a short-listed group of tenders after that thank you greg any council any questions counsellors to this report if there 's no councillor rutherford no no mr acting mayor um was really exciting to get this this information and be able to work through it you know it 's one of those things that it just means our region is stepping up and doing things similar to what the capital cities are doing and and the benefits that we talk about you know for those walking and bike paths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information and i 'm happy to move okay and a move council rutherford seconded councillor smith any further questions no further questions all those in favor that 's carried unanimously thank you councils our next uh agenda item is from airport well we 've got to change these names the airport committee yes thank you for that and this is uh the airport flight information display systems salt uh source supplier arrangements and peter there or peter 's online uh no andrew collins andrew sorry um yes we can all hear you um would you like to talk to this this report it 's very much i think read read the report it basically is sort of pretty much uh yes says it all sorry counselor you 're dropping in here um but uh thanks uh mr chair and councillor so this report is in relation to council entering towards the solar source supplier arrangement we seek council resolution to engage into system asia pacific propriety limited as a specialised supplier for flight information display screens at the airport in accordance with section 235 a and b of the local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place within the system into system asia pacific which expires in 2023 and their software systems are currently utilized at the airport so this request is to purchase the display screen hardware it 's a required software from inner systems to ensure uh interfacing and compatibility with the current software systems on site any questions councillors council wickerson um thank you mr chair um in principle i absolutely support this i understand that specialized gear but we had the discussion yesterday about the lift down the riverbank uh that you know some of this ski goes back to 2006. are we just topping up maybe 50 percent of the the gear that we 've got or is it more than that and is this not the time to maybe look at more later technology or am i off the mark with that andrew um well there 's 33 um display screens that that are being uh uh or 18 are new and the balance of the 15 are existing so it 's a combination of installing new and upgrading some existing display screens so so i guess the question mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have some redundancy issues given that it goes back to 2006 or is it different to probably take that question on that as councillors i 'm not sure if you know wrote ross okay i 'd have to take it on notice andrew you don 't know no i mean obviously we had this maintenance agreement up till 2023 so and there 's obviously a commitment but he 's got uh this firm to to ensure you know um stock and availability i mean it 's like any technology i suppose obsolescence will come into play but uh um i 'm not over the maintenance agreement um perhaps marcus might better shed a bit more light on it mr chair as long as officers are confident that um you know we 're going to get spare parts and and back up that 's fine i 'm i 'm happy mr ceo to actually just let this sit later in the meeting so that marcus can be contacted and just seek his advice if you would like uh leave at the meeting you 'd be happy to just uh if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a motion that we 'll just um have it laying on the table later on the meeting yes yeah happy to move that okay sorry but i 'll stay down it probably cancels if we 're going to go that way so you lay the matter on the table for later on the meeting and that further advice be provided at that time okay i 'm happy with that so leave councillor wickerson seconded council action all those in favour lead we move to communities portfolio council council wickerson and this is the disposal of council assets and alicia uh yes i 'm right here i i i was working to that uh i was just acknowledging alicia at the lecture and then i was going to ask those councillors with conflicts to leave the the meeting council just wondering whether we can discuss all bar the one issue that they have the conflict in so that they can be part of the council actually very important to go for the thing but happy to ask for that for the whole report yeah he said he was going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ item in the whole report we 'll put a note in the minutes to say that the matter is only going to be won 't be discussing uh the matter that it 's a conflict of interest for council latching and councillor smith yes we 'll just put a note of the minutes in that and then see where council goes because i wouldn 't like to put that in the recommendation quite right it quite at this point in time okay comfortable with that so ready okay alicia we 'll let you uh present the report thank you mr chair just taking into consideration those conflicted i will do so the principal counsellors of this report is that there 's a number of old buildings that are eyesores and to fix them up and improve them is not a viable option so if it were our own money there 's certainly you wouldn 't do it and so it just doesn 't make good financial sense to improve these buildings or to bring them back up to scratch and bring them back up to standards the other aspect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of vandalism um and they 're also that eyesore and that reputational damage as well in terms of um how they look now councillors we have worked through these particular facilities and there have been some that have been excluded based on your feedback and so we will work through those at a later time but um the other important point is that we 're in the resolution we 're talking about disposal okay now that might be for removal it might be for demolition depending on the nature of um what the viable materials are there mr mr chair i 'm happy to take any questions specifically about these items okay council any questions as to council wickerson um thanks mr chair just checking the the properties that have tenants in them is that one of the ones in question yeah um no in with conflicts no no no sorry uh i think it 's the third paragraph from the end on page 119 talking about extending the lease periods is it possible to extend that lease period to maybe 12 months i 'm just conscious of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be aiding uh the eviction of these people particularly at this time of yes yeah that 's certainly been the discussion that we 've had at workshop levels that we would proceed with that extension beforehand so that they 've got that there 's no um then that 's then to negotiate with the new owners of those properties that would be sold yep okay could that be added into the into the report or just just to quantify that i 'm saying it 's a bit open at the moment still um it is but then it would also be subject to their own personal circumstances as well they may not wish to actually be offered it could be offered just as long as you write it with some qualification like that is just making sure the right information gets out to the community about this as well i think there 's probably some sensitivity there with with uh when we go out to the community about sale of of council property and and that as well so probably just take some caution there i know that we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any further questions councillors if i could help to help the chair if i could if in this recommendation that the council approves a plan to suppose the nominated properties and associate structures as detailed excluding the victoria tennis club facility and then we 'll have to deal with that one separately okay okay there 's no further questions or council smith just a comment mr chair uh it was on the news this morning i thought it come over quite well that the we 're considering this because some of the buildings are derelict etc i 'm still not happy about the caretaker 's residence at the heritage village but i understand probably our reasoning so no further questions look i 'm happy to move that this oh no it should allow the committee chair the option to move and i 'll second that um can 't move and second so yeah so it 's been moved council wickerson seconded by myself all those in favor and that 's carried yes so you council rutherford you voted you voted in favor against okay yeah sorry councillors as there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of interest we just have to record how councillors voted um against the matter so councillors yep that 's that 's where i was leading to so uh it was in favor councillor uh fisher latcham mather uh smith kirkland and wickerson and opposed councillor rutherford and that 's where i was getting to just as you were doing that yeah so now we 're here the next one yes so our two councillors need to leave the meeting so that we can deal with the victoria park tennis club facility yeah victoria park tennis courts shed is how it 's described in the report okay so the council approves the plan to dispose of the nominated uh nominated victoria park tennis club shed as detailed in the report council has any discussion on that if no discussion someone happy to move move councillor wickerson seconded councillor kirkland all of those in favor and that 's carried unanimously and once again we 've got to we 've got to record all of the um all of the councillors so that was fisher maida kirkland wickerson and rutherford all voted in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that to the list of little little uh um as we 've gone through today 's meeting so far okay our next one there is uh infrastructure and this is the fitzroy basin association and again it 's a specialized supplier approval and we have martin who 's going to present the report or peter i 'm happy to do it peter if you want me to that 's fine hi peter oh martin sorry yes yes sorry uh i 'm sorry uh deputy mayor um councillors uh i 'm seeking your endorsement to uh nominate the fitroid basin association as a specialised supplier under the local government regulation 2012. councils are recalled back in february 2020 council endorsed the fitchboy regional resilience strategy uh which was developed by a number of councils and the queensland reconstruction authority out of that a group was called uh was a form called the future of basin working group made up of a number of councils operating within the fitroid basin a number of state government departments uh bomb and the fitroid basin association and the qra as part of that we as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assist with providing the administrative support to that group and agreed that they would submit a number of funding applications on behalf of the future base and we 're working with now one of those submissions has been successful so i now need to find or enter into a formal arrangement to provide council 's contribution to that to that funding submission now i 'm suggesting they 're a specialised supplier because uh generally they 're um they 're basically a state and federal government recognized natural resource management body even though they 're not a government body in themselves they 've got operational coverage across the entire fitroid basin which i don 't believe any other sort of natural management group have they 've got extensive knowledge of working within the basin and working with a wide range of stakeholders uh government departments uh private land holders resource industry and the likes and they 've got a proven ability to uh to deliver natural resource management focused resilience related type programs and projects i think council have recently had a presentation from the fitrah basin association so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing we don 't think it 's practical to try and find a similar body uh to who has got the same coverage as the fictional basin association to to help us uh with the work of the fictional base and working with or any particular i suppose council program going forward that might have that natural resource management bent to it as well so i 'm seeing council 's endorsement to call them a specialised supplier thank you martin um any questions councillors i think it 's pretty straightforward and i think this is actually a good outcome for council so no questions i 'm happy to move seeker seconder councillor smith all those in favor and that 's carried unanimously thank you next one there uh is item 10.5 and this is planning and oh i 'm sorry reading it out and then i was going to sorry i 'm just doing it in a different order yeah that 's okay i 'll sit on my hands for a while no that 's no that 's okay it 's always good to have that extra thank you so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as due to a conflict so council what i was doing was i was actually reading the report and then i was going to ask the counselor there just so that those that are online can actually understand what the report was so item 10.5 requests for a negotiated decision to development permit uh d28 2020 for material change of use for a service station and operational works for an advertising device um two freestanding signs one canopy and one fascia sign uh that 's making up those two freestanding signs so um i 'll cross to you bevin to present sure good morning councillors uh so you some of you may have already seen this application a few months ago um so it 's d28 2020 and the reason it 's brought to you today is the applicant negotiated one of the conditions that was approved so that was 19.2 so that condition required the developer to supply and install block out blinds or block out curtains to the front rooms of the external premises of 33 kent street so that 's that property there so there 's some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that current condition requires that to be installed for them to comply with that condition the negotiator change allows some flexibility for compliance so if that owner decides that i want it then the applicant isn 't impacted by that decision alternatively if they do want it then they have to undertake that work so just provide some flexibility for compliance because it 's kind of out of their hands in terms of complying with that condition so the applicant 's request to amend the condition is considered reasonable and is therefore recommended for approval any questions counsellors portfolio counselor councillor smith oh yeah thanks mr chair uh yeah i think it 's just tidying up the words really and yeah i 'm quite happy with the with the small change i 'm happy to move okay thank you councillor smith questions council rutherford um i have no issue with the report or the recommendation i i do however sort of think back to when we were setting this area in the planning scheme and there was a lot of discussion about whether this should have been commercial business and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can see by these applications now having to go through mcu 's that you know maybe the planning scheme should have allowed for this on a major highway you know and is that something we need to address yeah i think sorry if i could counselors if i come back the officer 's recommendation for this application originally was for refusal um and i think when you look at the planning scheme you 'll see that the commercial centers actually goes along um a few other different roads now we 're coming back to council over the coming months to do a commercial center study and i think you 'd include that in in that part of it to see that change and what it probably needs to do so yeah that 'll come back and be addressed by council all right thanks council wickerson um thank you mr chair i 'm in support of this as well but i thought this would be a good time to bring up that is there a process in place to advise or personally advise the adjoining properties i know this one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just did a recent one with the the coffee drive through i 've had a number of inquiries from residents adjoining that that the first they knew of that uh resolution they don 't follow us online whatever was when was in the paper so it 's probably just a bit disappointed that those immediately impacted properties uh weren 't um formally contacted i mean they went to the trouble putting in a um not a complaint but a report against it and they weren 't contacted back with the outcome so just wanted to make sure we have a process in place that it is that more personal approach back to the impacted uh properties adjoining yes that 's probably not our role in those in this case yeah so that would be if they put a submission in they would have been notified of the decision of council at that point in time well that 's what they were complaining about mr shea that they that they weren 't for some reason they first i knew as they read it in the paper yeah they would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the side of the proposed development that 's done by the actual applicant then those people then if they wish do their submissions to council as a part of that we would address where we can their submissions whether not they 're based around planning if well at the end of that decision making they would be notified of an approval or a refusal so if they don 't put it don 't put anything in they won 't hear back from us that 's definitely the adjoining owners also get letters yeah um so there 's letters signs in a newspaper ad that 's the three sort of prong requirements for public notification um when the decision is approved then they will get a copy of that notice and they have the ability to negotiate or appeal that decision with council as well similar to what the applicant can do so yeah they have that right to go through that process but um yeah i guess the issue is that it 's the media is probably instant so that they 'll beat us to getting some reply back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i guess okay so smith um i 'll just ask you but i think it normally takes a couple of weeks have we got 30 days or something to advise any submitters or is there a timeline on that i 've usually found this two or three weeks after by the time we um yeah so they that stage when the approval was given they have 20 business days to respond to council um and once that period 's lapse then the applicant has their 20 days to negotiate okay any other questions councillors so it 's been moved by councillor smith seconded councillor wigginson all those in favor and that 's carried unanimously thank you thank you um there is no reports from sports parks and public services yes i almost left donner out i missed that one you could you could have sort of said oh i was waiting for you to do it i didn 't forget you donna really it was my time i had no no well unfortunately we 've spent all your uh uh budget now so we 're good no look um moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and waste to resource oh gee no waste and recycling portfolio sounds so much better portfolio counsellors council election and this is item 10.6 lakes creek road tip shop resource recovery center and waste transfer station operations and ask michael to elect and thank you michael yeah thank you mr chair and good morning councillors um first of all i probably just apologize this is quite a lengthy report there 's a lot in it um this is possibly the most important report i 've put to council in a long time so i 'm actually going to spend a little bit of time to go through it in some detail if i can please so the purpose of this report is to provide an update on the current status at lakes creek road of the tip shop operation the resource recovery center and the transfer station up on top of the hill and i i will be seeking endorsement from council toward a new contract for that service so currently those three operations the tip shop the resource recovery center and the transfer station are operated under a contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's no further options to extend so we went out to tender late last year we 've received four submissions to that tender process i can say that none of the entities that made a submission were purely local companies they were all companies from outside of our region that were looking to employ local staff within our region to service this contract but the overall contract management would be done from outside of our region so the highest ranking entity is a not-for-profit organisation they will employ locally disadvantaged people from within our region long-term unemployed handicapped and as such they are very experienced in this space they run 13 similar facilities in new south wales and two currently in queensland so they 're a fairly large not-for-profit entity with a lot of experience in this space and from the reference checks as part of that tender evaluation process my colleagues got very good feedback on their performance so again just wanted to put a little bit of context around the importance of this operation so you know under the waste reduction recycling act queensland has a resource recovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ targets and diversion targets as i 've discussed previously that we need to meet by third by within you know over the next 30 years and the next targets are 20 25 20 30 40 and 50 and this operation plays a really important part in assisting us to achieve those targets amongst other things obviously so it 's estimated um from this operation that we divert some 2 800 tonnes from landfill on an annual basis okay and that 's through the operation of the tip shop more tons than that are diverted through the operation the resource recovery centre that you know feed that that also allows customers to drop off other recyclables that is somewhat but interrelated to the tip shop so there 's also a lot of local context for us um you know we 've got our waste strategy where we 've made a commitment to get to zero waste or 90 diversion from landfill by 2050 and again this operation really plays an important part and this the tip shop in the resource recovery and the tip shop really play a in my opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providing them inexpensive inexpensive items for purchase and also allowing them to drop off resaleable and recyclable items at no charge staggering numbers the resource recovery centre and the tip shop service 93 000 customers a year so it 's not insignificant and of those about two thirds so 62 000 once they 've entered the resource recovery center and or the tip shop they then exit the site so two-thirds of those customers don 't have any interaction with the landfill and don 't pay any fee which is another really important contribution to the community so items from the tip shop are sourced from the resource recovery centre closure of the tip shop would would cause again in my opinion or it would cause a majority of customers being redirected to the gatehouse to pay for disposal of waste instead of being able to drop it off for free this would also consume additional air space and i 'll go into that at the impact of that a little bit later and that airspace really needs to be managed very carefully because we only have one landfill and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that functionality of the resource recovery center you 're really just preventing that free drop-off for our community of all of those recyclables there is an attachment one which i 'm happy to speak to but it just sort of shows um a map of the site and the traffic flows and that 's some of the numbers that have already set us i think it 's fairly self-explanatory so the current contract scope so you know it it 's it 's removal of all the scrap metal it 's the staffing of the resource recycle recovery center it 's a staffing of the transfer stations and staffing of the of the tip shop and it 's really a very hands-on contract because a lot of the customers that go through they need that one-on-one direction and assistance to help them where to put their various items currently this facility or this operation does lose seven thousand dollars in the p l so we get a little bit of scrap revenue we pay the contractor a little bit they retain all of the tip fees and the balance of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this under this arrangement so recognizing council 's position at the moment and particularly the financial position we 're all looking for savings and we worked really hard in that space we 've looked at a number of options one was to award the contract which i 'll get to and two was to look at the impact of closing the tip shop and then for the resource recovery center to be operated staffed by my team directly so i 'll just go through some of this so option one new contract so the tender would include you know resourcing of all of those facilities um and what it does do it actually does also exclude the sale of the scrap metal and that scrap metal will be done through a through a separate quarterly tender process to make sure we get the absolute maximum value from that scrap metal based on the market value at that time we believe at the moment that the way that our current contract is set up that the contractor is is is um probably realizing somewhere between three to four hundred thousand dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we get about 70 000 of that which we don 't think is right so this alternative closure of the tip shot so should council decide not to award the contract and therefore we go down option two path we don 't have the staff to do it so straight away i 'd need to employ a minimum of four staff and i 'd say that 's a minimum i think i could do it but it would depend on how the operation goes and if we 're getting complaints because we 're not servicing the customers correctly giving them that level of support and assistance then i don 't know we may need to add to that and i 've put in the report here that closing the resource recovery centre is just not an option and one of the reasons why i put that is because that centre in that area we recycle e-waste gas bottles batteries tyres paint waste oils oil containers fire extinguishers all of the full suite of co-mingled recyclables mattresses like it 's a massive operation it 's a massive service to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh causes significant pain so if we were to employ staff obviously as a cost in related to that for staff it would be about 350k a year we 'd also need to get a forklift a small tip truck and some other sort of hand tools and stuff to allow us to do that so i mentioned earlier that we believe we 're divert 2 800 tons of material through that operation per year i just want to put some figures around that so 2800 tons would equate to about a 240 000 per annum loss in undervaluing our airspace at the landfill currently our cost of airspace is about 180 dollars per ton a domestic charge while it 's a unit charge it 's based on 94 dollars per tonne so we 're losing 86 dollars per tonne for every domestic ton of waste going into the landfill so you just multiply that out we 'd be losing 240 000 in airspace in undervaluing that airspace if we also shut this down and those 2 800 tons went to landfill then council would then be liable for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government on that and because we can 't charge the customer for that we 'd be out of pocket another 240 thousand dollars that 's just simply to 2800 tons multiplied by 85 dollars a ton and that liability will increase by five fifteen thousand dollars year on year as that levy increases by five dollars per ton year on year so in summary you know we think i believe uh my officers believe that option one provides the best overall outcome to council maximises diversion provides a fantastic customer experiences minimizes all of those risks that i presented and importantly it really does provide a really good employment opportunity for some of the most disadvantaged in our community and i this was something that i 've wanted to do since the day i joined council almost five years ago because of my previous life and what i 'd done it provides really good goodwill at that facility because of those people that we employ so there are budget impacts and that 's why this report is difficult and i appreciate that so again understanding that once we got the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to negotiate a some upside if they achieved a higher revenue through the tip shop than what we currently are and i personally believe that 's achievable and i 've spoken to cairns and townsville and makai and toowoomba and i believe we can achieve a higher revenue so what we 've done there and the table there at the bottom of page three just gives a revenue share that this contractor has agreed with us so up to three thousand they retain it all because that 's what they 're that they 're needing that plus what they wanting to charge us to cover their cost from three to four hundred we get an eighty percent share of that hundred thousand four to five hundred we get seventy percent of that hundred thousand and after that it 's a flat rate of 60 so i 'll come back to this but what i 'm asking for today is basing that we 're going to achieve four hundred thousand dollars of revenue through the tip shop so i 'm gonna i 'm going to take that challenge on and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if we don 't then i 'll have to wear it elsewhere in my budget so the overall financial impact i 've got a table there at the top of page four and all i want to do with you probably was um so we 've got option one new contract and i 've got year one and year two year one is what i 'm putting forward obviously with the view that we will work very closely with this contractor to try and absolutely maximize the revenue through that tip shop and if we can get it to 500 600 700 then we will certainly do our best to do that so what i 'm asking for i 'll get back to the resolution is option one year one scenario which has an impact on our budget of 435 000 so the big takeaway from this is i 'm asking for and i 'll come back to it but it 's a it 's an increase in revenue and it 's an increase in expense but the the net difference it 's an impact a negative impact to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i look at option two is around the closer of the tip shop and for me to employ additional staff to to run that resource recovery center is that the impact to my budget would be 372 000 so potentially by doing that and taking that fairly drastic action of shutting the trip shop we 're going to save 63 000 but that 's not even quite the case which i 'll get to you um shortly in addition to that i 'd need about a hundred thousand dollars worth of capital to get a forklift and a truck and that that obviously would be a recurring capital requirement for that so in summary closure of the resource recovery centre and waste transfer station is not an option i 've explained that i hope closure of the tip shop would have widespread and long lasting impacts on customer service costs incurred by customers landfill airspace consumption and i believe public perception 93 000 customers use the resource recovery and tip shop per year from this 2800 tonnes is diverted the reduction in waste levy liability is 240 000 saving by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to pay for all this material as it 's going over the way bridgeton 's going to be disposed in landfill we 're going to be passing that cost on at about 260 000 a year to our customers the operation of the resource recovery and waste transfer station closure of the tip shop in-house with uh or opera operation with in-house staff requires the employment of additional resources and provides minimal cost reduction which i said is potentially at 63 000 or if you look at that loss of airspace um or under value of the airspace which i mentioned before at 240 foot 240 000 it actually means that closure of that will actually cost council more by 177 000 it 's not there 's no saving it 's actually an additional cost if you try and look at the big picture and all of the costs related so so with that i might so yeah so awarding the new tender will require an adjustment to our budget and what would we would be asking for is an increase in our revenue of 257 000 and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ net difference of 435 the other point and i know you kind of only measured against what you achieved yesterday but you know year on year we 've provided a lot of savings to our operating budget far more than 435 000 and those savings have been made as a result of operational efficiencies tender processes and other reasons and this is just the outcome of trying to improve the service we provide which will be significant and a tender process okay so i think with that um so resolution well that the recommendation i guess is toward the contract as a whole to community resources limited who were ranked number one in the assessment and to adjust the budget accordingly okay thank you michael i 'm i 'll open up the questions with first portfolio counsellor um council latcher okay thanks mr deputy mayor i 'll step you me um just got it written here so um i 'd like to thank michael and your team for for compiling this report it takes a lot of time and effort to prepare the tender guidelines and take it to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best way forward from the quality of tender applicants received as explained currently the cost to rrwr lakes creek waste transfer station the recourse resource recovery centre and trendy trash tip shop facility this last year was a net loss to council of around fifty thousand dollars by comparison on a worst case scenario this proposed contract would be a net loss to council of 562 000 more than half a million dollars difference assuming scrap metal would generate 250 000 income i 'd suggest that the tender guidelines should have been more incentive based to encourage extracting more items that can be recycled and reused in our community to reduce waste material going to the landfill i 'd suggest another option would be to offer the opportunity for a successful tender applicant to take 100 from all the sales of the trendy trash tip shop and take a hundred percent of all sales from the scrap metal according to the report this is projected to be greater than five hundred fifty thousand dollars in year one and greater than six hundred fifty thousand dollars in year two that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there 's no cost to rockhampton regional council if there is no successful tender then i 'd suggest the council maintain full control of the facility including the running of the trendy trash tip shop i am concerned about the assumptions made in the report if sales from trendy trash tip shop does not exceed 300 000 and if the sale of scrap metal does not raise 250 dollars however if these assumptions are correct then it 'd be more cost effective to maintain our own staff and equipment and operate the trendy trash tip shop for profit while employing local jobs the trendy trash tip shop recourse resource recovery center and waste transfer station operation has the potential to be profitable we have a product that enables a savvy operator the opportunity to make this a successful business i know time is of the essence for a decision with the looming expiry date of the con current contract however at this time i do not support the council of the officers recommendations okay michael oh look um where do i start i guess in i dis i certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal because of the fluctuation in that market and you put all of that into one package then we will get a very very very conservative price and they will assume that they will get almost zero scrap metal revenue in their equation because there 's all there 's only pain for them if they assume they 're going to get a high rate and they don 't it 's only pain for them this way at least we know what our costs are we know we 're always going to get a fair market value because we 're going to test that market on a quarterly basis through a panel arrangement that we 've got set up like i believe this is value for money we went out to tender we 've got four submissions we 're not happy with the current arrangement on site um it 's under resourced i 'm not sure if any councils have been there recently but the site does not look up to standard um and it certainly needs to sort of be brought in together and managed much more better than it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table council rutherford um michael thank you very much for the report and thank you for the explanations it 's um it 's a tough it 's a tough thing for us to hear so it would have been tough for you to write just um probably on a broader thing is had we had our budget considered the increase in this cost moving forward um in the budget revisions we 've just submitted the council was that is that you well just as a risk we 've just done a lot of review on our um rural waste services and everything to save money and i 'm guessing that any of the money we 've just saved um will be used we did flag this as a risk because we went out to tender in december every time we go to december every time we go to tender you don 't know what you 're going to get back once we and what we 've done since we received these submissions back and this party was um shortlisted we 've actually gone back on multiple occasions to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where that profit share came in originally that was not on the table it was only after that and we realized well this is going to have a significant impact on our budget that we 've gone back to them through our procurement team to try and negotiate a better outcome and that 's the outcome we 've come up with i do believe it 's value for money i believe if we went out to tender again tomorrow it 's very likely we wouldn 't get anything better last time we went to tender for this same scope which included the scrap metal in it was just before i joined council so it would have been about six years ago other than the incumbent the next best price was over a million dollars a year i don 't doubt for a moment um the work that you and your team have put in it and and that you have achieved a great outcome i 'm not questioning that for any any minute but i just we had relied quite heavily on finding savings um from this area and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waste things to now find out well that 's really um not going to be for anything in the long run so we 're still going to have to find savings to make up for this now that 's not your fault i 'm not saying that for a moment it 's it 's probably just um yeah difficult to see the pain we 've gone through now to actually not have achieved anything with it does that negate the great work you 've done and the fact that you 've probably saved us a heap of money in the outcome of this certainly it 's just i i don 't know where we sit now with our broader budget um given we had relied on that money yeah i just got through through this i now have all offices yeah so i was just going to paint something uh through the chair and that is um we we did see this as a risk sorry and but we are looking at every budget and every process to see if we can have savings but at times there will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflect what the market and the cost is so i think what 's important is if you looked back over the last three years with the various collection contracts and the other activities we 're doing in waste even though this is a jump of half a million also ran off overall we have significantly reduced the cost and operation of waste and remember we 're picking up so many more bins than we did at the start with no more resources i actually just cut my overtime budget in what i 've just submitted by a hundred thousand dollars for the collections team because we 've made so many operational efficiencies like if there is a saving there where we 're putting it forward there will always be cases where there 's nothing we can do about a particular service and how we deliver it and the cost goes up ross would you like to um thank you mr deputy mayor um just on the broader budget i think that was your question counselor yeah at this stage the operational budget have just closed the packs closed friday we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of months ago but um you may recall that point we said we still they were the know and things we still had a lot of the budgets to be submitted so we 're still working through that so um yeah there will be there 's still a fair body of work to do before we can come back to council with that here 's a operational position to say we 've met those targets or not so sorry doesn 't give an answer but we just don 't have an answer just at this point and mr deputy mayor just just finish off um because i i know that sort of hit michael pretty hard um i congratulate you on the work you 've done you know i certainly do i it 's it 's hard to make um officers stand up there and justify but half a million dollars whether you say quickly or slow still a lot of money for us to to find so but congratulations on the work you did council wickerson um thank you mr chair through just um mostly comments a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work that 's gone into this to land on the table for us difficult to hear of course trying to find another 500 thousand dollars naturally enough but i think in the in the longer scheme like the whole life cycle of our current waste facility to put that into context too and you and you detail that out that that airspace does have a value and we talked about the food organics and garden organics the other day too that that would mean that maybe we would never need another dump site so this is a part of that as well and that 's big bucks and we 've got to start looking at that so in the overall scheme of it yes it 's hard to hear and and probably equally hard to find but in the bigger scheme of things it 's something we just have to do um what once you just ahead and probably this might be to evan uh would this not be a good candidate for our sustainable rockhampton investment fund if there 's any money at all left still in that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment really it 's just an operational cost i was just you know refreshing myself and we 've looked at renewable energy projects in the past solar and cycles but there is um a requirement in there for for waste avoidance and encouraging recycling this seems to yeah it seems to fit did roscoe jump into it or uh you go again ross through the chair um not really i guess to the easiest answer we don 't actually have a fund that 's sitting there that 's got money in it anyway that we could just allocate to it so it 's case-by-case basis but i mean you could certainly measure it against it but it 's certainly not yeah there 's no bucket of money there 's nobody sitting there okay no understood thank you councillor winkerson councillor smith oh yeah thanks mr chair i 'm glad to know the tip shop 's still there because one of my favorite places as well and yeah pretty i appreciate what council latcham uh is saying um but with what um michael said about you know the place needs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would cost us money in the long run i have seen a facility that the recommended contractor operates and it 's operated very well and i think you know if this doesn 't work we can always go to another option i think you know a great great lot of information thank you very much and i think waste is something that you know it 's always going to cost us money um and it 's councillor other but said we did cut back on a lot of hours in the rural areas and hasn 't gone down very well in places um especially gracemere but i know we 're trying to make that saving and i think when people appreciate that we are trying to make savings and and make things better they will understand more thank you council smith council kirkland um thank you mr chair i did just want to ask you michael how long is the actual contract for again um quite sure i can 't i think three plus one plus one right so three and then it 's council 's discretion to extend okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer term things that we 're trying to as well is get get this place working really well and have the tip shop operating you know much better than what it is and and really expand on that clientele so that again when we go out to tender in the future it 's a much more valuable proposition for someone else to come in at the moment they 're really coming in at a low level there 's a lot of work to be done to get it where it needs to be yeah yeah within that contract is there an option then if it 's three years um do you think that 's a reasonable time then for us to assess reassess it um make sure it 's all working yeah yeah i believe so awesome all righty thank you thank you councillors look there 's a number of queries i had with this report as well and i spent a fair bit of time yesterday afternoon actually talking to council colleagues from makai townsville and cairns and look this what we 're facing is not new and each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the perfect mix and what is the best value for the rate payers and cans have just gone through a process it at the surface it appears to be working okay but there 's still problems townsville has just basically gone it alone with then a contractor just looking at the recovery of the landfill the councilor there believes that it 's working well but it 's early days makai very much like us really trying hard to find a model that works for makai region so it 's not like michael and even talking with the other option officers can sort of say what we 've got here this is a perfect model it 's working in three or four similar communities no one has got that perfect model yet and i think while go there could still be you know some prickles that could arise down the track and is it going to have the best economic value to our community is it going to have this going to be provide the best uh result for our budget and what moving forward i think look that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's some unknowns i think the report from the detail of the report that michael has actually provided us today is that his team have worked extremely hard and michael has worked extremely hard to try to come to what is the best that we could look at at the moment and i take on board his comments that okay improvements as they get bored in the future this is going to have more opportunities but dealing with every part of waste at the moment is there 's an unknown 10 years ago waste was something there that we dug holes shoved it in the ground covered it over no one wants to know about it now it is not only a local government issue a state issue but it is a national issue and how we move forward to actually minimize the amount of waste that goes to our landfills and we 've all got to be mindful that lakes creek road will be the very last landfill that we will ever have and all of us will be long gone and it will still be operating so we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set in place now is actually doing something for the generations ahead of us and each of these little steps are worth moving forward we need to have that constant review and i think that what we 've been presented today gives us details of okay this is another step in moving forward to actually having as minimal amount of material going to the landfill as possible so with that any other questions council maters deputy mayor through the chair if that 's right michael just um quickly what 's the current revenue coming out of the tip shop now with the contract that 's operating three hundred thousand it 's so it is it is reaching that now yeah okay so the fact that we 're trying to push before should be something that would be doable i i believe it will be again i probably don 't want to say numbers but you know i know cairns is probably two and a half times that the contractor that does makai have said they achieved three times that um toowoomba have told me they achieve about close to two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff so i believe 300 is i believe 400 is certainly achievable but and i think it will take you know i 'd like to think that we 'll get to 400 and then 500 and then maybe 550 over that period of time but that 's certainly what we 'll be aiming for thank you thank you perfect any further questions counsellors counselors if no further questions um we seek a okay move counsellor rutherford seconded councillor wickerson now um they 've been moved any descent in the office 's resolution if none i 'll put that all those in favor all those against okay uh the motion has been carried uh council latching voted uh recorded his vote against the uh the resolution with that councillors i 'm going to call a recess for 20 minutes and just seek a second

supporting a better environment portfolio item so our next one there is budget governance and other matters and item 10.7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's i 'll just put that in that 's just one more for the christmas party that uh and would like to ask genevieve to the lectern thanks genevieve uh good morning councillors this report seeks the adoption of an advocacy framework for brockhampton regional council as well as the approval for the development of a 2021 advocacy strategy advocating for state and federal governments as well as partnering with other stakeholders in our region to achieve the best outcomes for our community is one of the key roles that council performs this framework which went to workshop on the 3rd of march is designed to formalize the process by which council performs these advocacy activities so that we can ensure that when we 're advocating we 're doing so effectively and consistently to this end the framework maps the roles and responsibilities of those involved in advocacy including officers and counsellors it also outlines a process for implementation and some criteria for measuring success one of the immediate actions this framework outlines is the establishment of project teams for each of the priorities which was previously adopted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relevant general manager or manager as well as an officer from the communications team and the project plans that these teams create will then be collated into a whole of council advocacy strategy which will be brought back to the council table uh what we 're seeking today is the adoption of the framework as well as approval to begin developing the 2021 advocacy strategy happy to take any questions you genevieve um firstly to councillor smith oh yeah thanks mr chief and just to um say it 's really good genevieve thank you and and to think it 's so important i 'm wondering why we haven 't always had one and why why are we just doing one now so yeah great work to all the team who brought it together i know we 've got to have you know things for every everything frameworks and and policies for everything but i 'm just wondering this is so important we and we do it anyway um i 'm thinking why haven 't we ever done this before but anyway it 's good that 's come to the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you 've said councillor smith is you 've just got to look at the townsvilles and the toombas when they get a cold the other upper levels of government give them hundreds or million dollar notes to blow their noses on and we 've always sort of missed out but they have been very very quick very swift and it 's having that framework to actually in place so that then they can move forward unfortunately we have been sort of very ad hoc in uh how we 've addressed things so i think what and i i actually think this has been a really great piece of work genevieve and that this is not only for the benefit of the councillors but it must mr ceo must make the role uh with your offices so much better as well so i think this is a really good start watch out townsville watch out toomba we 're on our way as well and and uh it 's time for us to get our share of the pie as well councillor wickerson um thank you mr chair exactly what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a problem in the past that we will have a list like this and then we sort of chop and change it around something you know might come out of left field and be elevated to the top of the list which is is not consistent so we 've got to really have the same hymn sheep we talk about that all the time and stick to it over a prolonged period not just until the next media cycle or whatever so it 's uh excellent work to have it all encapsulated in this this document i love the idea about teams um uh incorporating each of the councils around the table and and using their strengths and experience and networks or whatever uh to help officers achieve that goal um there was only one question i had it 's only a minor one under the political advocacy teams uh for council that had uh on a rotating basis i just didn 't understand what that meant to my mind if you had someone that had existing networks or or whatever you should you should keep that consistency and play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ didn 't understand what was meant by rotating that position around that was all but otherwise excellent through the chair the the because when we 're when uh the advocacy team is going to these meetings in canberra and brisbane um they 'll be discussing multiple topics it won 't just be the one priority uh so that 's why the uh the thought is to have an and rotating counsellor um and i believe there 's still some thought going into how that process um will be allocated uh but i 'm happy for evan or damon to if there 's anything to add [Music] and through the chair yes as jen mentioned probably in most instances where we are uh i guess making those deputations to ministers both in brisbane and canberra typically we take down a number of different priorities or different meetings that we 're looking at progressing to obviously maximise the time when we 're in those meeting with those ministers both in canberra and brisbane and so the idea is and depending on the relevant priority that we 're looking at pushing as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would likely have the relevant responsible counsellor attending with that but it may be that we 've got four or five different priority projects that will be advancing on any one particular day so this will just certainly give an opportunity then for that to be rotated uh across the board depending on future meanings thank you damon for that it 's and it 's when um it 's not only just the different projects councillor wickerson but it is as genevin said those existing networks and around the tables some of us would have great networks with one level of government where other councillors are going to have just a stronger network with a different level of government and townsville does this very very well and how they have even their their approach is it is very very targeted and they go for the throat all the time and and it is um the counselors with the best skills for that particular project you 're it and uh i think we can learn from that because gee they they do get a much bigger share of the pie than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have here and look around the table are the skills and and the networks that we all would have i think that it 's not only just getting to say canberra but then to get to that chance there where you can actually sort of have a one-on-one might be after parliamentary sitting and with the ministers and their key staff and you know just having that five ten minutes of totally uninterrupted uh chat could actually deliver you know those projects that we need or at least make it so that it goes to the top of the list for them to to hand to the bureaucrats so i think when you look around the table we 've got a really good group of skilled counselors that both levels of government we could actually go and knock on the door and we 've got councillors there that can can sort of really you know have a friendly chat but really sell our region so i think this is a great piece of work genevieve thank you for this i know that the mayor if he was here he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that i 'm in the hot seat today so i i would like to move this and congratulate everyone who 's been involved and councillor smith you 're happy the second and all of those in favor and that 's a unanimous vote thank you very much watch out canberra and george street williams williams street now yes i 'll have to remember that one okay moving on to our next item which is the summary of the budget management report for the period ending 28th of february should have made the 29th of february then you would have only had to have done that every four years marnie across to you thank you acting mayor thank you councillors good morning um so presented is the summary budget management report for the period ending 28th of february to 2021 um presented is the income statement with actuals and budget for the period first of july to the 28th of february as well as their key indicator graphs you will note that the total operating revenue is at 87 of the revised budget results should approximately be around the sixty six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our operating revenue is ahead due to uh mainly the rates and utilities charges which are sitting at ninety five percent of the budget currently due to the closure of the discount period on the 24th of february we also have private works and recoverable work sitting above budget at 73 however our grants subsidies and contributions are behind due mainly to the timing of the financial assistance grant and the interest revenue is sitting at 75 percent of the budget or ahead of the budget expenditure is within budget 61 and uh we 've seen contractors and consultants that 's 57 which are behind budget currently but um it 's expected that these will continue and the momentum will pick up once their works that they 're working on are completed and paid out some other things to note that the capital income is behind budget at the moment at 46 this is generally around that grants and subsidies area as well as well as capital expenditure being at 48 of the budget you will note that during february we picked up the momentum again in relation to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital projects during that period you will recall that we saw january very much drop off and it was about three million dollar spend during that period so hopefully that momentum will continue and we 'll go towards achieving our capital expenditure budget of that 153 million that we have set in the revised budget any questions in relation any questions to this report wow must be a very very good report no question that 's the first one um look thank you for the detail in the report and that 's why i don 't think we 've got any questions because you 've actually covered um probably everything there that we needed to ask so thank you for that everyone happy with that report someone happy to move that that be received move councillor kirkland seconded council election all those in favor and that 's carrick thank you marny for that okay our next item is the central queensland region uh regional organization of councils limited and do i need to step inside with these definitely don 't look this has just been a this is just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had one meeting uh where i was the primary director we just need to tidy this up so that our mayor actually goes into the role of the med so prior to that it was that i was there as acting mayor um and that 's basically just that tidy up that 's correct evan and i 'm happy to move that uh that this um uh this recommendation is moved seeker secondary councillor maters any questions to that no questions all those in favor and that 's carried thank you for that next one 's got a little bit more we 're following the cq rock limited funding agreements i 'll flick this one to me yes um council as i 've mentioned uh previously there 's been a change to the actual recommendation um when you read the letter you can read it a couple of ways it but in actual fact our contribution towards cq rock organization is a five thousand dollar base amount and then an amount based around population and revenue so that equates to around fifty seven thousand annual contribution will look like we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as a part of the revised budget so if council agree to this one i will notify the secretariat of cq rock and no doubt we 'll receive a partial pro rata invoice any questions to these counselors oh sorry it 's not so much to this but it 's a general question being unfamiliar with previous um interactions with cq rock do is this a one like a payment that 's each year and then also are there other requests for money from us during during the operations of cq rock there will be this one-off annual amount and that 's why we 'll just have to watch how how and what we use the cq rock for so it doesn 't grow and grow and grow but there 's also project based that we can contribute to so if we want to just to deal with say i don 't know a waste type let 's just use waste or tourism if we want to do some type of study through that we can actually combine our money and then those people who actually put their money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just mr man i think everyone knows my feelings about this that we 're i 'm so happy that we 're back in the fold and the fact that it 's now a company you know and being run very professionally um i 'm really happy that we 're part of the regional organization that 's advocating for this for this um region you know and it can only be a good thing and i think this is under the same pattern as we used to contribute to cq local government association but a lot more we used to contribute a lot more money but in those days we had a annual conference i was wondering if cq rock is going to have any conferences because we did have the last one was at livingston when we were a member then we pulled out and now we 're back in i just wondered because that they were you know just uh such good information and good speakers etc i remember that one very well councillor smith that one was where um another council wanted to actually uh be part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so dramatic i think everyone 's still recovering from that that particular one but i think that that 's actually quite good there was one uh prior to that in emerald that was hosted by central highlands council that was actually very very productive emerald as well and that was good because it 's not just just those that attend cq rock but it is a very good opportunity for the councillors to actually have that network opportunity as well so i think that that is a really good idea mothers uh thank you deputy mayor just a question maybe evan could answer it but would cq rock be um forming part of our advocacy framework there 's a further discussion later on the agenda about some regional or security regional advocacy so maybe if i could answer the question down there when we get to it there will be a part of that so yeah thank you well if there 's no further questions i 'm happy to move um that sorry sorry just a question just uh curious because in the past there used to um as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is there a reason why they 've gone away from that model um i think the ceos weren 't doing enough work for cq rock we weren 't there we weren 't achieving the ceos couldn 't do their ceo job plus be the cq rock secretariat um and that was the basis behind it so it 's really gone back to the cqlga model where there was a separate secretariat that reported through to so we 've got this so we had shane um we seconded shane to that role separately um but if you remember cq lga had its own organisation and secretariat cq rock is in the process of finalizing the appointment of a permanent cq rock secretariat so and where will that person be stationed i not quite sure i believe locally which this i think may be here yeah there 's i just it 's probably not a big one i just think there 's lots of little bits i 'm a little unsure of it it 's not something to die in a ditch over but you know the the devil 's always in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things have a tendency to blow out um with additional stuff or whatever where i thought the old model where it it whatever council was the chair the chair um dealt with it i thought that was a fairly cost-effective way cost-effective but um so yeah i i know when i was doing the secretariat role i couldn 't do it justice and doing what it needed to follow up and the small behind-the-scenes advocacy that a secretary does do i just couldn 't i couldn 't do it i know that the other ceos are struggling even to becoming a company it 's taken you know nearly 18 months nearly two i think nearly two years because you had one of the ceos trying to progress it on the way through so it just took so long to do i think with cq rock you know it 's again it 's a new organization so we just take away whatever secure lga was in the past or when we were just cq rock members this is a brand new organisation or entity let 's use that word and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to be a lot of work around its bounce and if i when we get to the next part of it it 's probably opens up to i do believe we need to set as a member what its bounds of of it is and so if we could just hold that point there because i 'd like to pick that up as a further discussion yeah yeah i guess probably just to add on to that one of the things i i thought about yesterday and i probably should have i 've asked it yesterday but um with the organization a few years back we talked about when we were council 's representative on different boards and given this is a a board where our loyalty sits so our loyalty is always to council so how do we with these boards whether it 's cq rock whether it 's law mac whether it 's you know cq pest management um you know where does the loyalty sit and where when there 's a conflict a matter of confidence and things like that okay probably two parts to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between law maples um capricorn coast many um yes if anyone you know what i mean um there 's a big difference between that so effectively when you 're on one of those um organizations your loyalty is very much with council okay legislatively your loyalties with council when we enter and councils enter into a company director it becomes very very difficult for them it is they can be conflicted out they can be confused because technically they 're very loyal to the local well they have to be very loyal to the local government act and hence their council but under the um introversion the triple c and all through the company law or corporations act is that you need to also be loyal to your company as well so we had tim fine clinton at the last cq rock meeting giving a presentation to those directors particularly councillors and mayors around what their loyalties will be and how to deal with some of those things so that 's going to be an ongoing discussion for cq rock as a their new organization generally i don 't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loyalty to their obligations under the local government act and their obligations under the corporations act because effectively we 're trying to do the both things but you 're working for local government generally so i don 't see that going to be coming out however if we were to go with our airport when we were looking at a um our airport company rockhampton air services there could have been a real conflict between um the former mayor and myself when it comes to dealing with being running that company and what was good for the council that could be one is trying to make money and the other one over here is trying to do the community benefit you know look after the community that 's when you get the conflict so it 's an ongoing one that the directors will have to be mindful of particularly directors in the in a council or mayor role all right thank you it it actually tim points clinton 's presentation was very very good and evan with lawmak we 're actually going through exactly that same so lawmak on friday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incorporation and that very same thing but i don 't know if that that presentation of time clinton couldn 't be is it something that the council is once it 's yeah i 've been approved it 's actually circulated in one of the civs or it will be circulated it was very very i found it actually found that was the best the highlight of the day to be honest yes there it is in the cib down on 12th of march i 'll just see if things talking to nothing yeah if it 's not in their councils i 'll get it circulated it was a very good presentation from tim i 'll get that done i thought it was included yeah i 'm getting mixed up between the lgaq so i 'll get that circulated um and i think probably the other thing council rutherford is we 've got to be mindful many of our organizations particularly where you know lgaq type organisms they always become top heavy and i think we 've got to be very very careful and mindful and that was really you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people working for us we couldn 't afford um and many of the smaller councils couldn 't afford the membership and uh you know even councils of ourselves we 've got to be very careful with who and what we 're members with so i think that that 's the first thing and evan i wouldn 't mind having a workshop just discussing our views of of direction for cq rock my observations here there are sort of some things there that i feel uncomfortable with and not been able to to move forward so yeah so we might sort of have that for a thing in the future so i 'm happy to move as recommended and seek a second to councillor smith all of those in favor and that 's unanimous thank you council um okay welcome 10.11 and this is uh cq rocks regional advocacy uh i 'm having trouble with that pronunciation as well uh plenty of christmas beepers from me today so uh damon across to you thank you mr chair councillors this next report for consideration this morning is seeking council 's endorsements for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock 's future advocacy agenda a number of initiatives have been recommended in line with existing priorities that have been recently been endorsed by council for the purposes of those recommendations for cq rock the priorities for consideration this morning have been identified particularly where they are deemed to have benefit for more than one local government area so not only of benefit to the rockhampton local government area but of broader benefit for the wider region and probably to come back to councillor may the jaw query earlier in terms of it fitting within our broader advocacy framework obviously advocating through cq rock is just one part of the overall advocacy plan that will be undertaken for these priorities it 's not just an inclusion in of a priority in cq rock 's agenda that and then that 's it it is just one tool that council will use to progress to seek support and funding for council 's priorities moving forward and certainly is consistent with the framework that council has just adopted particularly in terms of the tiers of priorities identified in that framework and also as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommending a movement away in cq rocks advocacy from individual projects but to those that do provide more regional benefits so that it 's not a situation where we 're pitting one council against another for a particular individual project um but happy to take any questions if i could just to help you elaborate sorry um i circulated a um i had a fairly good discussions with the um other ceos of cq rock on third on friday because i was a little i 'm a i was expressing my little a little bit uncomfortable with the current reef to red bridge it 's very much a singular project to go about that and i don 't think that 's probably the basis of cq rock when you look at ncu rock or wide bay burnett rock when they have their advocacy projects their base or advocacy and or priorities if it doesn 't which way you want to crack this one is that they 're very much at a policy level they 're targeting that so when they talk about a road upgrade they don 't talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole region that they 're going about and this is how we can do it and within that document there 's a bit of a strategy this road over here to both this over here for fish or whatever you want to do um the nq rock talks about defense that 's a whole big one and when you look at the wide bay burnett the same type of thing so during my discussion of the ceos i said yes my council is going to look at some priorities for reef to read rich but i i believe we shouldn 't take it any further by creating a new document until cq rock which has on their agenda to do with strategic priorities of cq rock i think the reef to red ridge is a it 's the next step over here we should stop set our set our um strategic priorities and going back to where diamond is is very much the ceo 's agree with this three-tier model that i 've been spoken for a fair while which basically tier one is and i 'll just read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cq rock it 's an entire region priority this will be the primary focus and effort of cq rock and including a letter of support okay and these things might be more investment in road transport or more investment in developing water supply right across cq rock tier 2 is where it benefits two or more members for the benefiting councils but seek iraq can resolve to agree to make the cqu priority the effort expended is reduced so our sikh rocks is always at the really high level to want to improve things tier three is there 's only a singular benefit in council and this is probably there 's limited to no focus by cq rock and that singular benefit and should not be supplying a letter support because effectively cq rock without no resolution of the fellow members could be writing a letter of support against for your project and which is your put it up against your project so i don 't think we should play favourites and i think that was the issue particularly of the former mayor when it came to these type of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level so going back to what damon 's recommending up here i don 't believe that 'll get progressed until we actually set this other cq priorities but it 'd be good to have this on the table to actually start a higher level discussion thank you so much for that evan and that 's that was kind of what i was raising in the last discussion that was one of my concerns as well so we 'll go to some questions around the table council smith yeah um i went to great pains to argue for grace near high school to be included in the non-council projects but it 's gone off the list not unless you meant it to be under community advocacy but uh i 'd like it to be mentioned on there and we put it on there but it 's disappeared it 's a different list and and through the chair council council smith through the um just recalling the timeline of how these advocacy priorities have been uh endorsed by council initially um back in uh the 25th of february um we subsequently did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discuss the cq rock and certainly as you 've noted with the the grey smear high school it has been included as far as a priority for council and certainly fits within that health and education development so the the list that 's included in the report is probably a a bit higher level um description of the priorities and then within each of those there are in certain areas a number of different priorities that are being progressed there both that have been discussed previously with councils so just to reassure you council smith that grace may high school certainly is in our list and we 'll be part of those discussions with council moving forward yes sorry i 'll remember now um forgetting that this is just cq rock advocacy so the the lists are very similar so sorry probably nearly the same they are we 've got a list that contains up a number of projects then what um officers have done have gone okay what makes cq what would we think maybe rocks how can we grab those and brought them to table that list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a comment if if i could and it really is to reinforce exactly what evan and damon said uh while i agree with the recommendation here because of the existing reef to to redbridge document i don 't agree with the document and i don 't agree with and that that tier three um my experience with cq rock was that those tier three projects it was probably the reason why security rock um fell apart and we need to we need to play above that right above that and it needs to focus very much on the broader region and and things like that i think the minute you come into things projects that just benefit the one local government area that 's when um you get the issues starting to arise and and that 's what that was what was happening and so we should we 're you know we 're loyal to our own local government area um so you know that 's so yes agree but do i agree that this is what cq rock should be promoting no no i don 't and i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know the new organization sits and and forms its list it holds itself higher than then at least tier three tier one and two and maybe not three not delve in that space at all okay any other questions counsellors council rather than i i share your same concerns with this document and you know i 've had a number of occasions where i 've been able to to express my opposition to sort of how some of these have been put together but in some ways i can sort of see where sort of some of the pathways that they were going why they were doing it but we 're looking at it probably not from a higher level and and the one that always i found was the better transport connectivities in within the cq rock is always very important and you know we 've raised some here we know that there are a number of projects that individual councils or joint councils would like to to see to benefit their region but we know that you know we 've always got to look at what are those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cq rock councils and one of the ones was always the capricorn highway and the importance of that and you know even with the roads of strategic importance that you poon to mount isa that they list is one of those key projects that the federal government are really keen to champion but how we get that connectivity to the capricorn highway and it 's not just you know where we have raised here uh the glenroy road and the glenroy crossing but it 's also we want to get more beef and more cattle into our region and it 's some of those connector roads that are very very important they are outside the cq rock area but if we 've got a strategic plan that actually looks at how we can better that connectivity we 're all going to win as each members of the cq rock so i think this is this is sort of moving in the right direction um quite often you 've got to dip your toe in the water first and i think this is what this document was and moving forward if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're going to be much better prepared to be able to put up those those sort of documents and those proposals that we can take to other levels of government so i commend what has been recommended and happy to move i know that the mayor would be there to move those so all sitting in the chair i 'll uh take that opportunity to move seek a second council of kirkland um no further questions all those in favor and that 's carried unanimously as well thank you thank you for for that work that 's gone on behind the scenes this is probably we 're already starting to to move our region into a much better place that we can actually go and and secure more opportunities okay we 're getting towards the end of our meeting notice there 's a motion no i was just before urgent business oh yeah but i said when i said at the when we uh there that i would do that just before urgent business so no questions on motor notice well then uh and next time we 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm happy to move seek a second uh councillor smith all those in favor and that 's carried so ross um you were going to just find out those uh bit of information yeah about that uh that signage and the the package thank you yeah thank you mr mayor um cut along i 'll go back a bit more detail but in a moment but um the bottom line is at this point in time they 're the most up-to-date screens that are available as we have so that 's why they 're moving forward to go back a step um the current system we have has sitting behind it there 's controllers and so forth and software that that 's why the um why we prefer to stay with the supply because all that background stuff stays there and it 's just these new screens tap into it so we don 't have to replace all that background support infrastructure and it is used it 's that it is the industry standard type system lots of over 30 airports using it so it 's it 's the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they currently have so that 's hopefully that answers a question counsellors council wikileaks yes mr chair satisfied with that and thank you for doing the research to find out yep thank you very much thank you so councillors we have a recommendation um there 's no further comment i 'm happy to move secret seconder council wickerson uh all those in favor and that 's carried now we move on to general business if anyone has got any general business council wickerson um thank you mr chair a couple of things the first one probably a little bit disappointed that um the launch of beef festival was on uh the other evening apparently there was no council representation there at council level i should say i don 't know about offices um not aware of it no i understood that some members of the media were quite critical of council that yes that we weren 't there i don 't know if that was an oversight or why but they 're just disappointed through the chair just in relation to some background on that beef australia did forward an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfortunately due to other commitments the mayor was unavailable and we spoke with beef and they were happy for that invitation to be extended then to the deputy mayor but unfortunately again the deputy mayor was unavailable to attend that particular event and essentially that 's where the invite ended it wasn 't a broad invite that went through beef australia i spoke to the ceo of beef prior to the event and he and again i 'm not sure i wasn 't at the event myself but he was confirmed that he would pass on to those in attendance council 's apologies there okay accepted um the other two probably bit more positive i wanted to thank uh staff damon and many others for the community consultation with the friends of the heritage village i know some councillors that could make it to those two events uh appreciate your tendency i think it it was probably better than what uh what we expected it might be we 're half expecting torches and and pitchforks but uh there 's a little bit of that but they were they were blunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward that uh i think we 're coming together on the same sort of a page i think getting getting closer and closer together that we 're all heading in the same direction probably with some little um differences but along the way but we 're all heading in the same direction so that 's a good start and i think the next stage damon correct me is then we get in probably the more detail of uh we had a bit of a state of the nation uh which uh which was good information and very detailed for the volunteers but the next step is what would that look like on the ground in in time to come and we explained that that would be will be quite a time uh just given the other pressures of ronda uh and finally you would have seen uh mia sent through a quick um a pro forma for anzac day we had our first external agency meeting yesterday we 've had plenty of internal offices and myself trying to work out where we 're heading with it and it is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day to day depending on what the health officer my recommendations were but uh yesterday was their first meeting we had the external agencies so all your vietnam vets and and the nashos and ses and police and everyone coming together uh everyone was very positive about it even though it 's rushed just the the nature of it is where about seven or eight weeks behind schedule just because that 's when we got advised it was shaping up to be just the uh light you 'd like your dawn the end of the driveway um ceremony for a long time and then all of a sudden it opened up but have you changed it uh and it 's still changing a little bit but every change is getting a bit more and more relaxed so at one stage we 're looking at having to put a ring fence around the center half to control the um the numbers there and do the contact racing all that at this stage knock on wood it 's uh that 's off the table now so it 's uh come be sensible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have some mechanism whether you scan with your phone and and uh through advanced rockhampton there 's some new app that we 're trying to make the standard so that people can self uh regulate that and self nominate for their contact details so all those changes mean that it 's going to be as as close as we can to be uh normal we 're not having the civic reception i think it 's been reported before that 's the one thing that we thought we could drop just given the time we just don 't have the staff resources to do everything so and yesterday everyone was happy with that too so that 10 minutes happy with it so uh so so far so good if you turn up at the the dyess i think mayor tony sent an invite out uh don 't go to east street because we won 't be there it 's in in key street it 's just a bit wider to get people in um and it 's at denim denim and keys where the dice is going to be normally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes a salute this year they rotate that around so so far so good there 's a report so can i just ask one question uh council wickerson the light up the dawn is that still going to be encouraged or yeah absolutely mr chair that 's a council don 't do any organization around that other than to promote that yes that 's certainly an option uh one slide change that we 're looking at doing is to live broadcast the audio from the dawn service at the cenotaph audio only because the lighting is difficult to video that 's all but i suggested to ashley yesterday that if it was possible and without too much extra demand on already stretched resources we 've got could we not do a a live broadcast with video from the parade you know set up a camera something near the dyers i said yes the video is no problem at all that 's something we do all the time but we 'd look at when we 're working with a radio station to do the announcing so if the groups could send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a a marching list for that uh that maybe a radio announcer could do the emceeing for that so the people that can 't make it or choose still not to go near a crowd can still enjoy the the march pass which is good so we 're investigating that now and we 're trying to split that between the two local radio stations can 't go any further with that okay i 'll stop checking it and that 's all i have mr j thank you thank you uh councillor wickers and council smith yeah just for the beef um event uh i think when the official actually the the actual official um launch was last year and it was video conferenced but i when i i 've always been invited to that i thought we always got an invitation but when i didn 't get one this year i assumed it was because of the the fact that we 're sponsoring them and the conflict of interest etc i 'm not sure how those sort of things are going to play out because there is quite a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'm actually have i 've got ross working on a policy to assist council work their way through the conflicts of interest for sponsorship in events so not so much our internal events that we put on like rocky nats or whatever else a river festival they 're quite easy to deal with but when council give quite a considerable amount of money to an organization to put an event on then you receive tickets back we 're working our way through a policy that can give a council give us some guidance of how to do it because they end up with staff potentially getting a conflict of interest theory the decision maker to give money to something or other so i 'm trying to get some separation there it 's a quite a complex one to do we 've got i 've got to get some decisions made around particularly around the beef side of for yourselves but i just want to make sure it 's right so that when we go to implement it that 's as best we 're going to get it so and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working at walking into because there 's no precedence and no other rules out there so we 're trying to navigate the perception which is always a hard one so we 're just going to be very mindful that when you accept something and there 's different rules for different levels of politic politicians as you know some of the rules around ministerial gifs is that hospitality isn 't a gift it 's got no tangible value after it 's been consumed it 's gone so but however that 's a different view for local government councillors and employees so we 're navigating our way through that ross will have something hopefully over the next week or so to work through council because we do have a number of tickets to give out for um well tickets to administer for sponsorship at b so i 've got a lot of working events for staff to attend to so they are legitimately working but then there 's some of the things like the ball how we deal with that type of stuff i just find it very difficult within my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably the first time councillors have always been actively working during beef week at different parts whether it 's our own displays and and that and this is probably the first time we actually even haven 't even got our roster raw or what we would be they would we 're there to do so rockhampton regional council usually has a display and you know we 've made quite an effort over the last decade of go where to uh the public that if you your products that good that your board of directors will go on the showroom floor it 's pretty good and i think that 's been one of our strengths but we still have got to find that bit of information too yep okay yes so i 'm happy to do that no further no further general business councillors more than happy to declare the meeting closed at 11 47. thank you very much for for your attendance join the front line ain 't nobody left behind everybody 's swimming in sunshine everybody feeling fine everybody joined the fine line ain 't nobody left behind [Music] @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good with the ups and downs,"(-23.3786203, 150.5088889)"
AUS,QLD,Rockhampton Regional Council,RRCouncil,https://www.youtube.com/user/RRCouncil,Rockhampton Zoo Cassowary Keeper Talk,21opbpl118c,20200726,347.52,"Rockhampton QLD 4700, Australia",1102,[Music] hi guys my name is tegan and today i 'm going to do a bit of a talk with you guys about our beautiful cassowaries here at rocky zoo so i 'm inside the cassowary enclosure at the moment we 've actually got our enclosure split in two so on this side we have our beautiful male hemi and on the other side we have miss b our gorgeous female now they are separated at the moment that 's for a very good reason in the wild generally speaking cassowaries are solitary animals they 're quite territorial and in fact in the wild they only tend to come together when it 's time to mate so during the breeding season we will open up these enclosures and let these two have contact with each other in the hopes that we will produce some offspring and have some little baby cassowaries around so they are called the southern cassowary but that 's actually a little bit deceiving for us here in australia these guys are found all through the northern parts of queensland up in the tropical north in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ southern cassowary is because there is another species of cassowary that 's found further north up in papua new guinea so in australia our cassowary is the southern cassowary now like i said these guys are found in the rainforest their rainforest dwelling species and they are extremely important for the rainforest these guys are frugivores which means they eat fruit and they eat a lot of it and they 're super important for the spread and dispersal of seeds of rainforest plants they 're extremely important for one reason in particular these guys can spread the fruits of trees that no other animal can so they can eat fruit that is highly toxic they 've got a really short digestive system so just goes in one end out the other so they can eat fruit that would be poisonous to other animals they can also eat fruit that 's really large so the biggest thing i 've ever seen one of these guys eat is a mango whole so these guys are really important to disperse the seeds of those rainforest plants that depend on them there 's nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important for the environment and to continue the dispersal of all of those seeds and to keep the rainforest growing it is very possible if we lose the cassowary in the wild that we 'll lose a large array of our rainforest plant species as well it could completely change the structure of the rainforest it 's a super important species unfortunately in the wild these guys are classed as endangered we don 't really know exactly how many of them are left but it 's probably only something around 5000 in the wild very very low numbers unfortunately for them their biggest threat is habitat destruction we just keep knocking down their home to build ours and there 's just not enough room for them anymore um so we also built our roads our railways all sorts of things straight through the middle of their habitat destroying their habitat but also creating danger for these guys so if you are traveling to north queensland and you come across a cassowary on the side of the road please don 't feed it it encourages them to come down to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like i said it is really important not to approach these guys in the wild they are very territorial and they do sometimes come down into areas where there are people because they 're looking for more food unfortunately they can cause a little bit of an issue in areas like mission beach you can actually see these guys walking along the beach and even coming into public areas where there 's streets and buildings looking for that food they are quite dangerous they 're actually known as being one of the most dangerous birds in the world if you ever get a chance to have a look at one 's feet they 've got three toes and on the inside toe is a claw it 's about this long it 's like a dagger and that 's what they used to defend themselves so if a cassowary was to feel threatened what they would do is they would jump up kick out with their feet and claw down your chest and potentially cause quite a lot of damage there have in fact been multiple deaths from cassowary attacks so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them guys best thing to do is to stand nice and still slowly back away and give them right of way um because they 're a pretty cool bird like i said we are here part of a breeding program where we 're hoping to breed cassowaries we have had some success we had a chick a few years ago that moved down to a different zoo and it was part of the breeding program down south so we are hoping to be able to contribute to the genetics of the population australia-wide unfortunately at the moment there 's no breed to release program and the reason for that is simply because there 's nowhere to release them to all the territory that 's there is already occupied because they are so territorial and because they eat so much fruit they really need a very large territory to be able to find enough food every single day at the moment these guys are eating about eight kilograms of fruit each every day in the wild and even breeding season these guys could eat up to 15 kilograms of fruit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they need to cover to find that much food and unfortunately there 's just not enough of it left so what we 're doing in captivity is we are breeding what we call a backup population so essentially we want to breed as many as we can in captivity so that if something happens to the wild population we then have backups that we can start releasing into the wild and hopefully keep these guys going for a really long time well that 's it from me guys if you have any questions don 't hesitate to send us a comment bye,"(-23.3786203, 150.5088889)"

the top of the nose cone on your right now you also need another piece of a5 taken up and we 're just going to fold that in half like that and I want you to cut along the two fold lines be [Music] one cut and then another one and then with this extra piece of paper that you 've had from your life and I don 't want you to fold it in half that way and then slice into that and I want you to also now just cut off the corner there on each side that 's for the engines on your robot I think we 're set to go so we 're going to be using blue paint today now you 're welcome to use any crayons or colored pencils at all that 's fine we 're just going to use a bit of blue paint nice bright blue [Music] painting up podium etymology that beautiful wood is you I just not take a little bit longer to dry [Music] it will take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got the nose of your rocket that will also got those two engines those shapes that we cut the diagonal of the corner on each one so just make sure when you 're going to paint them that the the day off diagonal comes in like that so maybe that 's one they like that and this one here like this a little bit of blue a chompers that 's all our blue pieces painted there we 're also going to be doing some more color we 're going to be putting some red on the fire that 's coming out of our engines and we 've got the three windows now I 'm not going to put any color all the windows I 'm just going to leave them white at the moment so I 'm just going to get nice red crayon and I 'm going to use the side of it again just to make it a little bit faster it fills in much bigger areas when you use this article engines or out of it also the little nose so now that the paint has dried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll just need some glue some PVA glue is fine or any kind of glue will do and we 're going to start with the body of our rocket the rectangle standing up and we 're going to the triangle on top now if you could just put a little strip of glue at the bottom of that triangle thing like that and just glue it onto the top of the rectangle and then we 've got the two shapes and we 're going to blew those onto the bottom of the rectangle so just a little bit of glue at the top and paste it on like that [Music] another bit of glue at the top of that shape there and connect it on so you can see that the diagonals go in towards the middle for the engines now the next step we 're going to be putting on our to shape that up the fire coming out of the bottom so a little bit of glue on the top of your red rectangle on the bottom and a little bit more red glue on the top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rectangle and stick that on with the other shape another injured fire coming out of the engines of our Rockets and you 're almost in it next we need to put some some windows on so we 've got three four circles around now and we need to put some glue on the back of this and just one [Music] [Music] windows and for the most part you little red triangle and that is right at the top of your brother what about now a flawless finish it just needs a little bit more decorative work so I have a piece of blue paper here and I 'm going to just cut a couple of very thin rectangles out of this blue paper by just folding a couple of rectangle shapes and then I 'm just going to cut along those lines you could use any paper that you could have any colored paper will be fine just as a little bit of color on the side of your box or any wrapping paper so long in blue rectangles like that just on strips [Music] [Music] it 's storytime now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

's other glues stick blues that are just as successful so just a little bit of glue on the bottom of the so cool like that and glue that go to the the top of your bigger plate and on to the bottom of the other small circle so the thick just peaking about and now pull the two arms just a little bit of glue at the top and so little monster with two eyes and two arms and two legs now we 're going to

@ @ you can ask your parents to help you maybe by using a skewer or a fork and so we 're just going to catch a little hole in the top of our monster I just hold there a little bit more glue and it 's rip the thread the string through a little hole and it was not at the top [Music] most and you wear it like a necklace and it 's really gorgeous don 't you and now for our story time our story today

ball down the bowl and around the ball until it was time to go home he ran day after day week after week year after year sometimes he felt bored but he didn 't know why sometimes he felt lonely but he didn 't know why sometimes he wished things would change but he didn 't know how or what or why one afternoon a friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped because that 's what Bob taught us do he said don 't you ever do anything new and different asked the Frog no said Bob Trotter ah said the Frog and away he hopped well Trotter stared after the Frog he sighed hmm he shuffled his feet poking between his toes was a pretty yellow flower can you see the little yellow flower for the first time in his life he picked a flower he twirled it he stuck it behind his ear ah said both Trotter and off he ran that night in his bhabhi bed both Trotter went to sleep holding the flower his heart hopeful the next morning Bob Trotter went running as usual but he made himself stop to make friends with a family of muskrats the morning after that he stopped to swing from a tree and the morning after that he stopped to make a daisy chain of tiny pink flowers ah both Trotter from then on blogtrotters still kept on running because that 's what Bob trotters do but every now and again he stopped to do something new and different he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped to dance in the summer rain he stopped to slide down a

after the Frog he sighed hmm he stared at the flat green line of the bog where it met the huge blue sky he ran as usual but for the first time in his life he stopped at the uttermost edge of the bog taking a deep breath he climbed over a rotten log he scrambled up a grassy Bank he clambered over an old stone wall ah said Bob Trotter and he started running more blogtrotters and he 's happy he 's

AUS,QLD,Rockhampton Regional Council,RRCouncil,https://www.youtube.com/user/RRCouncil,Rockhampton Zoo Chimpanzee Keeper Talk,0EjCz_AH-Xg,20200713,647.42,"Rockhampton QLD 4700, Australia",2171,[Music] hi guys my name 's Blair I 'm one of the primary key us here at Rockhampton Zoo and today I would be telling you guys a little bit about a chimpanzee family so Brockhampton zoo started out in 1986 with two chimpanzees Cassie and Hakeem Casius is unfortunately our only remaining original male here 's now 48 and a half years old now casting off he arrived a rock Indians in 1986 from a little zoo in the Gold Coast and call them Gator called Nate chillin that Zoo is closing down the Rockhampton zoo stepped in and took the two boys on to give them a new start in life they moved into what we now refer to as the old exhibit and then in 2010 after 25 years of living in the old exhibit moved into what we now refer to as the rainforest exhibit the rainforest exhibit is over a thousand square meters of three-dimensional space and also includes a new management facility at the back for the chimpanzees so it 's absolutely fantastic by building this new exhibit and the facilities out the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ female chimpanzees in rock engine zoos history a 2012 two years after moving into the new exhibit Cassie and Aki met their first ever females Samantha and Holly so Samantha is now our oldest female at 36 years old and Holly is now 31 with her first baby in dolly Polly and Samantha just like Kirsten okay with what we described as socially deprived chimpanzees because of the situations they have been put in by humans cassia Sanofi were hand raised on the Gold Coast and because of the way that they were hand raised they ended up very socially deprived and missed out on what we call the chimpanzee learning period as did Holly now when she Benzies miss out on the chimpanzee learning period which is the first ten years of their life they miss out on all of the learning opportunities that chimpanzees need in order to be chimps such in Benzies they actually born not knowing anything really they don 't even know how to climb chimpanzee infants have to learn how to climb and have to be shown how to do a lot of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing how to mate unfortunately they never walk so when we introduced and Holly in 2012 unfortunately things didn 't quite go as well as we were hoping we were hoping with having two males and two females that would have have the pitter-patter of some baby chimpanzees unfortunately that never happened with them being hand raised as well we did have a few issues with Holly unfortunately Holly suffered from quite severe anxiety and depression because of the situation she had been put in by humans Holly unfortunately was hand raised like a human child and she spent the first five years of her life living in a house being raised like a human child because of that she unfortunately ended up with a lot of mental health issues and when she moved to rockhampton 0 2012 we had to work on those after her introduction to Cassy and Aki along with Sam she unfortunately decided to have Casillas beat up and she had cement thrown off he helped her with their so the best situation for Holly back then was to sit right here and work on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 18 months and after she was assisting it was decided that she was okay to go back in she was slowly reintroduced with the other chimpanzees unfortunately after her reintroduction ork even had a heart attack and passed away Aki suffered from cardiomyopathy which is enlargement of the heart now heart disease is something very common in us humans it 's also common in a non cute non-human gradate families both in captivity and in the wild there are many projects around the world that are trying to find the cause of a gradate heart is partnerships heart disease and working on trying to save great apes both in the wild and in captivity from heart health issues so samantha is our other female that was originally introduced to our two boys she 's now 36 years old she arrived originally Tomoko 0 2010 from Willoughby Wildlife Reserve in New Zealand then alongside Polly she moved up in 2012 to rockhampton Zoo so Samantha was born in New Zealand time she was born at 2 nimnim jennifer gardens in zoo today parents Charlie and Coco now Charlie and Coco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't know a whole lot about the history of her mother we know is that she was born in the wild she ended up at Taronga Zoo and then she moved to the Donita Botanical Gardens and zoo for Samantha 's father we know he was born was now known as the Democratic Republic of Congo he was originally captured by poachers and his family was slaughtered unfortunately for chimpanzees that is still happening today around 3000 great apes are being stolen out of the road every year for the legal pet trade and their legal bushmeat trade so for Charlie Samantha 's father he actually receives up in Belgium as part of the illegal pet trade from the pet trade he has been sold to a circus in New Zealand where is used as a performing chimp so Samantha 's father Charlie used to ride motorcycles and smoke cigarettes and when he was deemed too dangerous he has bolted in a steel crate nobility turn around and eventually when that circus was closing down he was moved to the Dean and botanical gardens and zoo where he was introduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along they moved to Willow Bank and after moving to Willowbank Sam 's parents unfortunately Milo and his mother Coco both passed away and Samantha prior to moving to Australia lived with just your father for about 15 years so compared to Polly and cassia samantha is actually had a better life um she is one of the lucky ones she was parent raised so she doesn 't suffer from a lot of social issues like the other chimps she 's a bit more socially awkward than socially deprived like castigating Polly so that 's all of the chimps were introduced unfortunately Aki did pass away Hollie then bit cassia suffered had to be separated she was in reintroduced and then we decided the best thing for watch in population was to bring two chimpanzees over from Israel so in September 2015 we welcomed alone and Leakey from Ramat Gan Zoological Gardens in Israel Ilan was a juvenile chimpanzee back then he was only about 30 kilos he 's half the size he currently is is a very young juvenile male Leakey was a young female as well the reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two main reasons one other words to bring socially normal behaviors chimpanzee behaviors to our socially dysfunctional group and they 've done exactly that pretty much on arrival the two chimpanzees wanted to get him with Casius so they were introduced pretty quick smart after being introduced our other chimpanzee started showing a lot of natural behaviors like to loosen grooming which doesn 't sound exciting but for us it was very exciting at the time because that was the start of the rear tation process the other reason that Alon and leaky report over from Israel was part of the Species Survival Plan now chimpanzees are unfortunately threatened with extinction in the wild their numbers are dropping down to around a hundred thousand and nine hundred thousand is split between around four different subspecies of chimpanzee so to keep our captive populations genetically viable we need to ensure genetic diversity Ilan and Leakey are unrelated to all of the chimpanzees in Australasia so they 're breeding and along breeding with our other females is critically valuable to the Species Survival Plan in the infants born ear depending on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can share their genetics and help keep the Species Survival Plan viable for the next fifty to a hundred years as part of the insurance population so it 's a little bit about a leek unit alone not long after arriving along with through a growth spurt with his grouse Betty also hit puberty with Beauty he got leaky pregnant and then nine months later almost nine months later more eight and a half months we welcomed our first ever baby chimpanzee little Capri so Capri was the first chimp to born in Rockhampton zoo 's history and the first chimpanzee to be born in Queensland in just over 40 years which is pretty special I 've been very lucky to watch Dupree grow up over the last two years literally they 've been absolutely incredible along then impregnated cement they 're our oldest female unfortunately her boy did pass away at birth which was unexpected but it does happen bunch of Benzies usually lose their first infant and it 's part of the mothering process with chimpanzees it 's how they learn and unfortunately for Sam her baby passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth of Samantha 's infant Holly gave birth to a little boy that has since been named give dolly there was now three months old and is doing extremely well we were a little bit of worried about how Holly was going to go with an infant being hand raised it is unpredictable how hand raised female chimps will raise babies but Holly has been a superstar with her training we 've actually done a lot of baby training with Holly over the years to ensure that she was ready to have a baby and that she 'll be able to look after the baby so things like bottle training and how to hold the baby holly has been taught i 'm luckily she 's actually just an true when it comes to being a mum and all of our training which was really important at the time has not been needed which is absolutely fantastic now let chimpanzees unfortunately they are going extinct in the wild poaching and habitat loss are the main threats for chimpanzees you may have heard of palm oil palm oil is actually an African @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threatening orangutan unfortunately because they are running out of land to harvest to grow palm oil they 're actually now encroaching on the rainforests in Africa so one thing you guys can do today to help save orangutans zone Indonesia and chimpanzees gorillas and banana blows in Africa and is by buying sustainable palm oil you can get apps on your smart phones like palm oil investigations which means you can scan the barcodes of the products you 're buying and find out if there 's palm oil in it and if it is sustainable palm oil there 's over 200 different names for palm oil that can be used so unfortunately you can 't look at the back of a product and go oh it 's got palm oil in it or its palm oil free and some companies do promote that they are palm oil free but the best way forward is to promote sustainable palm oil with that as well with your mobile phones most people these days have a mobile phone in the circuit board of every single electronic device you own as a metal called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Congo and one of the reasons why they 're currently mining it out of the Congo is because the Congo is so mineral rich what you can do is because it is fully recyclable is you can recycle it through here us here at the zoo and we get three dollars per mobile phone through our local recycler although all of that money goes to the jungle Institute Australia who do amazing conservation work for chimpanzees in Africa as well as programs here in Australia like roots and shoots which is educating our future generations so that they can when they get into positions of power make huge impacts to save our species for the future if we don 't make a small change today unfortunately all great apes around the world will be extinct within the next five to ten years and it 's up to you guys to help us make a difference thank you for coming alone for my talk today guys enjoy their sue day [Music],"(-23.3786203, 150.5088889)"

learned to say i 've been fine and i do but we both know that the truth is hard to come by and if i told you the truth well that ain 't quite true cause some days are times and some days sometimes a hard time [Music] some days and some days now the face that i see in the mirror is more and more stranger to me [Music] sometimes a hard [Music] [Music] some days [Music] [Applause] [Music] cause some days [Music] some days [Music] cause some days [Music] some [Music] i released an album in july last year called travelling salesman and uh the idea behind the song was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and uh the

kid spent 20 ideas so mackay is home always will be and now i 've found myself in rocky so i 've titled myself as central queensland kid but um this song is all about an incident that happened out west that uh made me want to pick the guitar up and and right head long after this musical dream it 's called travelling salesmen [Music] i 'm just another traveling salesman from town to town trading my [Music] with a guitar and auspicious plan i approach each day as a lesson [Music] for i 'm just another traveling salesman on this lonely road [Music] it might not always be easy [Music] and i 've forgotten the lyrics by speaking i shouldn 't speak in the middle of a song my friends that 's the that 's the third verse let 's do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain all mind it 's just what i do for i 'm just another traveling salesman on [Music] but i 'll be leaving soon [Music] my old life damn near killed me shifting steel in a black long town the money was the factor redeemer until it all came crashing down so i packed up my six string and suitcase everything that ever run true my friends called me reckless and crazy i said pain don 't mind it 's just what i do for i 'm just another

AUS,QLD,Rockhampton Regional Council,RRCouncil,https://www.youtube.com/user/RRCouncil,engAGEing through ARTing _ Art Talk with Amber Countryman,lao5HIZ1EJA,20200624,1468.03,"Rockhampton QLD 4700, Australia",3881,[Music] hi I 'm amber countryman I 'm an artist based in there on Campton region and in order for me to tell you about my arts practice I kind of need to tell you the story of how I became an artist and how I 've evolved since now it does start off a little bit depressing but it does get much much better so hang in with me [Music] the beginnings of me becoming artist started when I wasn 't at home um I have two children I have one with disability and a medical condition and the other with behavioral diagnoses when my daughter was born before I could even take her home from hospital for the first time she already had two surgeries one on her spine and one on her brain here she is here she 's a happy ten-year-old now so it 's all good but for five years there my life was I was in survival mode it was not fun it was an existence and I went through divorce as well and look eventually I decided to get a handle on things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there and I 'd started creating things and I started decorating my home and the feeling that I was left with after that creating was such a contrast to the rest of my life that I just kept going back I wanted to feel good more and more and I kept going back to create art and that is how I became now that it was it was our therapy basically it 's how it 'll happen for me last year I wanted to kind of talk about that experience of being thrown into this world of disabilities and birth defects and the whole medical world and what that was like for me so I 've started creating this is going to be a medical chart but from the mother 's perspective it 's really a birth and rebirth story this is the birth of my daughter and this is the rebirth of me as a person you become somebody new so this is how it started actually the 20-week ultrasound us that I was coming out with some pretty pictures and I come out with a whole new life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painted in coffee and wine I chose those because of the the likeness to blood but also coffee alcohol and caffeine the things you stay away from when you 're pregnant you do all the right things you 're supposed to give the the right result at the end if they 're also forms of self-medicating as well so I really wanted the materials that I used to be part of this story I wanted to put big words in there because big words there this new language that you have to learn it 's talking to all these medical professionals and it 's so confusing so when I people look through this art book I want them to be confused I want them to be shocked at the blood splatters I want them to feel those things as they turn the pages because that 's how it felt from my point of view so and you know the anguish is my child gonna be in a wheelchair for the rest of their life at the time it 's the worst thing in the world I believe me it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know that this is it 's unfinished because you have to be in a certain place to create like this and at the moment life is good I 'm not going back to finish this out work just yet so we 'll put that aside I 've learned how to paint I 've learned how to use different materials and how to incorporate into that story and I 'll just put this back in the drawer and when I 'm ready then that 's when I finish that artwork back when I discovered this feeling that gave me I started creating using things that were around the home I 'm quite frugal as a person but also environmental so you know I started using discarded materials and making art out of those things and actually ended up being an environmental artist throughout five years I did mainly public art and installations and I did actually quite well as an environmental artist my Art 's been seen by tens of thousands of people around the country I 've had a lot of great feedback and a lot of media attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out there to make the world a better place you know that was my purpose so I 'm proud of that but then last year happened and last year was not so good so last year changed my arts practice I had a few events happen in my life that I needed to deal with emotionally I had I was offered two huge professional opportunities and lost them are those family trauma personal relationships my daughter got sick and I thought that I might lose her and that stuff affects you and as the year progressed I noticed that my art was being informed by my emotions and my experiences rather than my environmental concerns I needed to process those emotions I needed to get them out of me and I needed to feel good again so that 's kind of how things have evolved for me since last year and look admittedly I have been a little lost with purpose in that way because I was so driven and I had this purpose and then everything changed this is the kind of art that I started creating in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened you know what it 's like when you feel what people are treating you poorly and that 's how I was feeling at the time as well and I wanted to express that and get that out and a piece of artwork so I had to work out how to do that so I felt like a doormat and so doormat came to mind and so that 's how the form of this sculpture came about and the fetal position this is a self-portrait this is me curled up this is me protecting myself this is me hiding from those people who are treating me like that and and then I wanted I wanted her to stop and I wanted people to stop walking over me and I wanted them to know that so how do you then betray that in an artwork so then I started thinking about walking in and tripwires and booby traps and and things like that so I wanted a deterrent there for people to stop walking over me I 'm sick of this so that 's where the tripwire came in and these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and become Truman anymore so this is kind of this was my first wood carving and I was rather impressed with myself being able to actually do it and get the outcome that I was after so this is kind of this was where those emotions and those feelings started coming out in art as I started creating these new artworks I started sharing them on social media I was nervous about it and I didn 't share all the details in the beginning because these were my emotions and my personal experiences and who cares right like what was the point of this so then after a little while I reminded myself of a playgroup that I used to attend when my kids were little every mother at that playgroup had a child with special needs or disabilities it was not your average playgroup believe me and occasionally we would get the chance to sit and chat and share what was going on in our lives and fall apart and cry and all those things together and in those conversations through the sharing and the just the it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left those sessions able to cope with what we had to deal with at home it 's not a normal life that we lead so it just gave strength and and those remembering those playgroup sessions with those women that 's informing my art today and that 's informing the value that I place on sharing so I feel like you know what I 'm doing here is the sharing I received the benefit of that so this is my purpose now this sculpture is called gift and I made this one after my daughter 's little medical adventure last year it 's made from tissues and glue so tissues obviously represent the emotions and the tears that come from you know little medical adventures that we have that are a regular part of our life and boxing gloves because you have to fight like you have to fight every time you go to the hospital every time something happens and you know something 's wrong you aren 't being listened to you have to fight your whole life to make sure that you and your kids have a quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though you have these ups and downs so that 's what the boxing gloves are for and this is your child 's diagnosis everything changes once this arrives is no going back after that so that 's really important too but it is a gift this stuff is a gift like I said my life has changed and seriously my life has changed for the better we 're a very happy family we have a really full happy life and that 's a gratitude it 's got a lot to do with that and I think we really value our good times you know because we have the bad times there and that 's the balance of life so before all this happen I didn 't realize that you know mundane that was that was how it was now now life is wonderful you know and and I appreciate it so that 's the gift [Music] when I post my artworks on social media I usually write a bit of an explanation to go with them sometimes it 's a hidden meaning in there sometimes I live it quite general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own connection to the artwork but whatever I do right it 's important for me to write and get it out of me in the hope that it 's also going to help someone else and I don 't always find that bit out but I do get messages from people and I do get people pull me up in public and tell me what a particular artwork or a particular written piece has meant to them and how they related to it so I do feel like what I 'm doing has worth and at this point in my life I 'm just trying to do what feels right and this feels right to me and this feels like my direction so private tea ceremony this painting is actually painted with tea so straightaway you have the relationship between the materials and the meaning of the painting as well so private tea ceremony is about that sacred little ceremony with yourself loving yourself basically this is about personal growth and about loving and appreciating who you are as a young person low self-esteem was my biggest problem and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's only you know 40 now it 's taken a while to get to this point and it 's through having my children having to do go through all those experiences deal with all those medical professionals having to stand up for what I believed in along the way I was forced to do that and I 'm grateful for that I 'm not everyone 's cup of tea as I 'm sure we all aren 't but I 'm okay with that these days you don 't have to like me I 'm fine with that I 'm building self esteem obviously you can hear that and I 'm developing strength and the strength is about the personal growth and resilience to go on and deal with all the ups and down to the guaranteed to keep coming in life so this is this can be very general very relevant to a lot of people in their own way so that 's private tea ceremony this sculptures was about some pretty intense feelings not anger but very close to I had done well enough to be offered some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through you know reasons that were nothing to do with me and that hurt you know like I you know I really one of those opportunities and I wanted what came after them they were going to be like these platforms to leap off and I lost all of that as well so I was yeah I was not in a good place at that point because I was so driven and you know on that mission so I felt like that donkey who you know it gets tricked to walk down the path with the carrot dangling in front of his face on the string and the stick never gets the carrot does he so feeling like the sucker I did I grabbed the stick and I snapped it over my knee and I 've just bundled all this stuff up together and I 'll return to sender and clearly I wasn 't going to use real carrots for this so all the materials got an upgrade to make this something that could be displayed as an artwork in a gallery or somewhere like that so the carrots are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I 've carved and the string is a silk string and as I was making these and I was bundling them up some of them broke there 's a few little bits of carrot that I 've snapped off and I thought you know what I 'm frustrated at the moment and I 'm doing this really tightly and I 'm not being gentle and in a way I think that shows when you have broken bits there and I just do not care because that is actually part of the feeling that was coming from this artwork this sculpture really work for me to be able to process that those you know really horrible feelings you know that trick where when you 're feeling terrible and you write everything down on a piece of paper and you burn it or you turn it into a paper airplane and you fly it away and you instantly feel better that 's what this kind of art does for me it just allows me to kind of express it and get it out of my body process it and then feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that 's what art does for me art is not about play for me it 's not about looking pretty it 's not about money it 's about overcoming and then sharing in the hope that you know you 're going to make a difference somewhere down the track [Music] this sculpture came about after that rough patch that I had so this is about direction this is a positive sculpture unwanted upwards clearly and these the writings actually crushed eggshells that I 've embedded in there and I said that 's because you know you come out of these rough patches and you see the light again you know and you start smiling again and it 's your change every rough perhaps you change and I 'm not going to be careful anymore so I 'm gonna stomp on those eggshells I 'm gonna crush them it 's not about being gentle it 's about you know going up onwards and upwards and and this is my direction this is trajectory and that 's where I 'm going so this is a really positive positive sculpture from from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is on your way you know get on with it so as I 've kind of explains my inspiration for my art comes from emotions felt or experiences sometimes it 's a conversation sometimes it 's a point I want to make but I don 't want to voice it verbally and I really enjoy feeling that emotion and then working out how to then turn that into an artwork and what materials can I use to be part of the story what form is it going to take what structure is going to be involved is it 2d even you know so I really enjoy that problem-solving and the challenge that comes through creating sculptures that I create this one here said there 's a Christmas holiday activity actually I was my kids were with their dad for a little while and I wanted to make something anything I didn 't know I didn 't really want to get emotionally involved but my brain wanted a problem to solve my hands wanted something to do and I had these old phone books lying around and I had a hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shape and I just started twisting and gluing and twisting and gluing and this is hours of work in this thing and there 's lots of paper and lots of glue it 's quite heavy it was very telling actually how much I need to create and so I kind of learnt a lot about myself with this sculpture just that I guess that need for art that I have now that I didn 't realize before and so I 've called it dial or therapist because phone books it was therapy that 's just the way it is and then I 've actually painted it in fiberglass resin because I wanted it to have that durability because I wanted to have a lifespan as a sculpture but also I wanted it to pier appear as if it has durability and resilience because that 's what comes from doing the things you love and whatever form of therapy yours is it makes you healthy it gives you a longer life doesn 't it so clearly my art does not exist to be beautiful sometimes it happens but it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the meaning or the message is so much more important to me than aesthetics and that 's just who I am as a person as well as an artist being an artist has helped me appreciate my differences as I said I 've never felt like I fit in anywhere but as an artist now I understand that 's actually a good thing that 's actually something to be valued so these days I actually feel comfortable being myself and only myself so that 's massive as a person to finally get to that point in your life [Music] this is another self-portrait this is called the over-thinker and this is inspired by a conversation but of course inspired by Auguste Rodin 's the thinker you know the thinker so apparently I 'm an over-thinker and apparently I have a very active brain and I get told this quite a bit I 'm okay with that so I 'm always questioning and processing things and analyzing things and people and situations and whatever I see it as a strength so this is my own normal arm here but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the original sculpture because I see overthinking as a strength and don 't let anybody tell you otherwise you got to use your brain and just a hot tip for anyone out there who 's going to tell and overthink and not to think about something as soon as you do that they 're gonna start questioning why you don 't want them to think about that so that 's a little bit of a backfire I have to say so yeah overthinking is a strengths keep it positive let 's see I 'm primarily a sculptor but I don 't stick to specific materials because it depends on that individual artwork and the meaning that I want to draw out of those materials for that artwork so as a consequence quite a lot of what I do I 've never done before so every new sculpture sculpture can be an experiment I actually find that very stimulating as an artist I am a problem solver and I really like that the thinking that goes around every individual artwork I get a real sense of accomplishment and I get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creating bit so I love it and I get a lot of stimulation from being an artist [Music] one last capture this is birds on fire this was a response to the bush fires that we all experienced here in Australia last year this year I wasn 't directly affected thank goodness a lot of people I know were I did find myself unable to read the news reports on the wildlife and what was happening there that was just it just got too much and I just couldn 't take that on board I did want to do something with it though and this was a tribute that I created I had a piece of blue gum from my pop shed blue gum is the favorite food tree of koalas so it just seemed fitting to create that and I 've made a feather because you know even the ones who could fly was still perished so what what hope did all the other animals have it was heartbreaking isn 't it really so anyway I 've created this feather in the shape of flames and I 've taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sell this and I 've made five smaller ones as well for cheaper prices if I sell them I 'm going to donate that money to our local wildlife charities here because I feel like I want to do a little bit to help with that so yeah that 's kind of my contribution I guess [Music] so there 's a look at my arts practice and I hope you got something out of it and thank you for listening,"(-23.3786203, 150.5088889)"

AUS,QLD,Rockhampton Regional Council,RRCouncil,https://www.youtube.com/user/RRCouncil,engAGEing through ARTing _ How Art Galleries Shape Our Cultural and Economic DNA,qdB39sqKTYA,20200624,901.13,"Rockhampton QLD 4700, Australia",1933,[Music] I 'm professor John Rolfe from CQ University I 'm here to talk about what the value of arts is to regional communities so cities across Australia all have our galleries and are very keen to promote them and to many expire to have bigger and better ones but the challenges to justify them and to come up with an economic value for these assets the proportion of people who engage with art galleries is typically pretty small and of course governments have very competing priorities for funding so it 's important to understand why art galleries are so important art is a part of human nature so one explanation for why art galleries are important is that they are helping to reflect something that 's really important for people and something that has been around for a long time the paintings here are from the caves prehistoric art in France was of course the other painting by Picasso is a very famous painting expressing human emotion there are other reasons why art has been important in society it 's often been a very essential underpinning of communicating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both Catholic and other churches art has also been used by by rulers and dictators to communicate to the society and their people about why they should be in power and to maintain their power other types of reasons why art has been important in the past is to tell stories particularly at times when people when there wasn 't very much literacy to commemorate really important events such as the opening of of Australia 's Parliament from nineteen hundred and one to record visual data to provide social commentary and a straight-out propaganda but we live in a new world now a world where people can have the information at their fingertips where it 's easy to find entertainment digitally where you don 't need to go out and see art to be to see something that 's beautiful or something that 's or provoking so what are the real reasons why art is so important even today to regional areas and I want to talk about five in particular they represent progress they 're a way of achieving of satisfying curiosity they represent beautiful things they allow communities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in history the Renaissance was a period that started from the thirteen hundreds and ran to about the seventeen hundreds in Europe and it basically was about rediscovering classical philosophy and scientific insights and it also represented a period in which people focused on better ways of doing art one of the important things about the Renaissance was that it had a humanism focus so put people at the center of things rather than necessarily putting religion or rulers has been the center of things and as a part of explaining this change of thinking to looking at the better ways of of making society work Hart was a part of the mix two other really important disciplines were architecture politics science and MIT and literature and art science and music we inter woven as types of learnings that aggressive people and rulers pursued if they 've wanted to better society another really important historical trend with the Reformation so this was a search for freedom from religious and political masters starting in in Germany in the fifteen hundreds with Martin Luther it culminated in a lot of Protestant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Europe and actively searched for better ways of doing things one group of them moved from Europe to England as a part of a religious wars from Germany and from Holland and then a generation or two later were the pilgrims who then emigrated across the Atlantic into colonizing America so they were after freedom from the English church and from the English state and art was very important as a way of helping those people and those societies to find better ways of of organizing themselves and placing more emphasis on individual development and it 's helped to underpin a lot of Western modern societies over the last 400 years another theme that underpins art and the importance of art is how society progresses in one of the ways in which societies progress is to find new ways of doing things unfortunately a lot of the big advances of society have occurred at times when societies been under a lot of pressure particularly in in world wars and other catastrophic events that 's when a lot of the big innovations tend to occur and the reason why it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that when things are when people are in trouble when they desperate to achieve something that 's when they find really novel ways of doing things and so it 's no accident that world wars and the Cold War have developed new innovations such as penicillin being developed in the Second World War of course we don 't want to have those events as a way of stimulating progress in our society but one of the things that we have noticed is that people who have been particularly curious have been those who 've generated a lot of science and other advances it 's a curiosity is something really important to advancing knowledge and a lot of the people who are very curious tend to be very interested in the arts so there 's some overlap between training people to be curious or encouraging people to be curious and encouraging artistic expression another important reason why arts is we 're supporting is introspective so society in improving society is not a one-way street where it 's just a formula to keep finding better ways of doing things and better ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a like a bag full of competing interests and ideas the politicians and governments are busy trying to select which are the better ways of progressing society and dealing with some of the pressures and it 's very important to have people who are critical because not all ideas work not all new directions are worthwhile you know in our democracy we have a division of powers between the judiciary the executive and the Parliament or the legislature and media is typically charged with playing a Fourth Estate role so this media has a purpose to be able to be an outside Inquisitor if you like identifying what 's working what 's what 's not working and bringing up people 's attention but the media his backward-looking it 's only reporting things that have already happened arts and artists have a similar sort of a role and so but they tend to be forward-looking so they 're considering what could be done so arts is an important way of being critical you know in a positive way about what 's happening in society and what could happen so painting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it feels to exist in society at a time how to change opinions install values and it allows people from different cultures and different times to communicate with each other so what art helps to allow society to operate and it helps to identify what are the things what are the changes in society that are more viable and more worthwhile as well as that engaging in art is something that is very essential to people so it 's something that makes us human and it 's something that 's been around since Neolithic times so what is a is reflecting something that makes people interesting and make society interesting so without those types of drivers people would be very boring and and very mechanical so art is something that 's capturing the essence of what it 's what it is to be alive so reflecting on that art galleries are really important for a number of reasons and they and the reason why they important is that they reflect the culture that we have and the culture that we want to have so it 's identifying that people and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ societies that are curious that are wanting to advance that want to be independent and free thinking that are prepared to look at themselves and be self-critical that are wanting to improve knowledge that understand what it is to be human and to enjoy life and many respects art and artists also communicating that it 's great to enjoy life and not necessarily be too serious so turning them to the role of art galleries in regional cities they have four key roles there they send a symbolic message about the type of community that a city wants to have and the dreams of its inhabitants they play a catalytic role so historically arts and sciences went closely together so a community that supports art is also likely to be a community that 's trying to advance society trying to bring themes of progress together to make society work a bit better for its members Arts also has a transformative role it helps people to appreciate life and feel a part of the community so so people who are going through challenges people societies where there may be mental health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are societies where the arts and art galleries have a really important role to play and last but not least is the economic role so art and art galleries are really important for attracting visitors they bring people to regional areas and they help to maintain the attraction for local people to stay there so the economic drivers provide some really important attractions for people they project a positive image to the community about what type of community and its dreams are they underpin debates about the community and what the directions they want to have they 're essential for tourism so the picture one of the pictures here shows the the mona gallery in tasmania it 's been estimated to create 30 and and full-time and part-time jobs in Tasmania since 2011 simply because of the boost to tourism that 's occurred and art galleries contribute to social life and well-being they have spin-offs in terms of attracting retaining people and help to justify why these things why these assets should be supported so the implications for regional galleries roles galleries have in regional EOS have changed a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building a collection and categorizing but nowadays their new roles are much more about engaging with the community interpreting how the community thinks about things and what has happened in the community over time providing different insights they tend to be very important focal points for engaging with tourism which is a major economic driver of many communities and they help to get to bring together different influences in a service economy different influences in people activities and generate positive economic impacts on communities and the businesses that are within them so thank you for listening I originally presented this talk or a larger version of this talk at the Rockhampton regional art gallery and I 'm very passionate about how do we justify and encourage our in our regional communities

then worked in an office and I was located there and then I was a on the side became a private investigator and ended up repossessing cars for rental companies which wasn 't it was okay but it was a nice single Shepherd moonlighting stuff I thought it was not what I thought it was going to be and i segue into first of all moving household goods for a large company they then they had a part of their division division in their company which did aren 't moving they asked me if I to do that because no one else seemed to know anything about it I did have an interest in the arts and I dunno what about us so I grew up with a lot of artists so I had any interest to start with so I 've set way through all of that I buy my own business I have done project management for Calvin public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven years so I 've sort of fitted a lot in I don 't know everything and every day there 's something new to look at which is why I love my job and a new conundrum a new problem to solve so art and weaving story so things we like to look at we like to look at kids this is my daughter Ruby she 's now 11 she 's they 're starting to show you that we like traveling and looking at things overseas we like craft we like looking at history so there 's something we all like to look at animals pets is my dog bridge and Max this is this is I 've been told this by Davis ranch has never undergone but Max is still around so we probably all agree on this because we 're here with our buyer so and it 's one of those things we can all I think I 've never met a person that has not been able to tell me something that they like in the art world you know this then doesn 't matter how negative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they like but have you ever thought about how it got to the gallery have got to the park how it got to the house how it actually got to we 're now looking at it that 's all some of us think about the Andrea why won 't we and this was an accident photo of her for ages and this is in my office I 've got these crazy animals so case studies sensory boring that I 'm sure of one thing so broth this was one of the most nerve-wracking things I 've ever moved so this is broth from 1888 louis pasteur supplied this broth supply 12 of these single flasks so it 's a glass flask and it 's sealed at the top the broth itself is as clear as anything but at the very bottom there 's a sediment so like but if you make anything broth you know you get that sediment that 's going to fall to the bottom this could not be shaken the sediment could not be lifted because it 'll make the broth the broth will take ages to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louis Pasteur to in an attempt to eradicate the rabbits in the late 19th century so this was the most important thing that this museum Island and this is part of the University of cities pathology Museum and they 'll meeting a brand new beautiful he is named something had to be that this was what they 're obviously and look like you can 't see any of these things properly you probably don 't want to do they 're just bits of bodies so they were moving into this brand-new Museum and this is the unit 's in use by still completely clear the thing with my job is sometimes when things get really nerve-racking I can 't take photos because I 'm too busy fussing about what I 'm doing and making sure that things are right so I do not have in all the photos I have I do not have a photo of a packed but it was packed very much like the white Brendan 's been packing things the most thing today the ceramics so there was an office and it was nestled with phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for protection its travel perfectly not a problem so so so relieved but the day after I taken this photo I went back think of him doing something else and it wasn 't there and I was like god what 's happened to the girl and the someone had taken away to photograph it and just picked it up carrying it put it down brought it back and he was cloudy I was like well yeah so it was that nerve-wracking but it got there Stella how fantastic is this like it 's a great word but it 's 313 point the 3.05 meters high centimeters high 300 plus some insight 940 long and 720 for those of you in the audience would like to know that 's team laughing it 's really really big it is so big that the gallery had to build a wall over it too because I couldn 't get out of the gallery and I couldn 't work out how to get it out so there have been a wall over this work for 20 odd years they eventually redid that gallery and pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oh okay so that 's where that went so is that by the goose up there just found behind the door I agree exactly it is the same thing that sorry I put a still so it is big and really hard to move so this is a high cube 40-foot container so it 's higher than usual the usual one even container and the guys here like they paid I don 't think it 's gonna fit so it is a huge exercise to move this it is so big that we can 't wrap it because it won 't fit in the 40-foot high cube container if we do wrap it so it 's a job and a half it 's an app skin this is a dog leveler which makes life so much easier it goes into the truck and then we have to screw timbers into the truck so it doesn 't slip but it literally just fits it 's an absolute bastard ever thing to move the last time we moved in admittedly there was a lot of gallery staff which are often a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people need these things all the time there were about 18 people on it so it 's a it 's a sizeable and I 'm just going to fund until the other day that it 's moving again as a suggestion just put interest you might want to drive the 44 fire container over and wait reach before you put it on there now people zone to keep not here with your life that 's a really good idea between CP to get out of the city for a while yeah yeah so and because the other thing is we have to do when the conditions are correct because of its size we can 't use a reefer container or a container which is anything you shouldn 't in any way or insulated so if only this would work had a distraction Egyptian god okay so this is part of the collection of the clay Museum at Sydney University they have a large Egyptian collection and we do a lot of work there for them so this we have to lift up one reject it up one piece of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check out the other side too low because it is so heavy and we need to be able to get something underneath it to be able to get it out of there there 's a lot of with what we do there is a lot of standing around and looking at things and making sure everything is okay and double-checking so sometimes things take a lot longer than you would think they take but we 've done that many times before so we 're now used to it the so then doing this piece by piece every time we had a tumor we have to screw that tumor into the next tumor because you just at our the Phil who 's here holding that the screwdriver he will create this and then that ends up getting chucked out unless we can use the tunas for something else because they 're not they 'll be used to get when we I don 't do it but then after that it 's already been screwing in a good time so which is a waste so if you see here there 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height that we can fit a trolley then we 've wrapped that we 've dreamt of in Tyvek and lots of pads we need to not wrap it too much because we need to be able to know where we 're holding it and and every as you 're moving and we 're checking at the whole time so this is a small crew for moving something like this but we do have a couple of these guys do the work to me and they 're really strong so that 's a lot as an advantage so we push it through the building onto the truck this is where it 's been delivered into this floor is a painted cement floor so that 's fine for us to work on that this floor timber floor the wheels tend to get a little bit on the floor it 's some here I don 't know how it happens but we 've worked out that we just have to put him as down anyone so he put Timbers down take it to where it 's going and go through exactly the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the to barge okay so sometimes we getting things out to the front door because sometimes people have houses which are ridiculously bad access and they like to open up works to go in those houses so this is your basic waterfront mansion it 's so everyone 's house mine certainly looks like this say this house isn 't the real estate photos it was literally packed without works a lot of them we were able to take out these smaller works of course all the small words on the ground floor so they were really easy to get out they had building work done after at the front of the house the straight side after all of the works have been delivered in so the access was just completely changed from when they bought the works so this is where the house is so are you just I am expose their it bronzers or gorgeous feminism there so that 's the scenario this with an arrow is that be going on that way is the driveway so that house is behind it that 's a new house being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaches structure so yeah it 's a great house so the first ID we will build it seven travel frames and we will use a crane the huge crane that we had to pull off the road permits and everything we will lower it down the face put the arm load here and then we 'll visit it back up again move it back up again I said I think we should just try it with the immunity travel frame just to make sure that that 's going to work the wind on the water this travel frame was just if I could have attached the video it was just flying everywhere so he went and I can 't do that I have to do something else so the second idea the works were and there are only five works that could fit out but these are worth more than my house in Sydney like I think one of these one of these was nearly two million dollars there 's five of them so we wrapped it multiple times multiple multiple times then used foam it 's textbook shrink wrap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lots of men so it 's two pool cleaners in this pool sorry just my husband nice thing to pool cleaners so we lowered everything had to be lowered down to the ground level where of course there were no paintings so we loaded them all down piece by piece we were so close to the pool it was ready then we put them on to this the barge company this this frame that is fantastic we can get lots of works on that we 've used this for lifting on cranes as well and the birds companies have been provided to us for other jobs the the wolves get strapped to that that the crane on the barge lifted it over to here we attached it onto here this is the day before the house settled so settlement for this house is the next morning at 00 a.m. so these works have to get out because the people who have just bought this house have said anything you leave there we 're keeping so so we are all ready to go barges then this barge is has these big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was just to keep it at credit stables so here we 're all getting ready in the wind picks up oh we can 't do it it 's too windy I 'm like okay what are we going to do I said we 'll come back in the morning when they start as much we will come back at 30 in the morning okay let 's do that first baby of the morning rain it was not only rainy it was we need it was absolutely dreadful the crew were looking at me the boys are looking and again are we really gonna do this we have to because the people that own these artworks wanted that they didn 't care what happened now so and they left it to the last minute so if we ordinarily would do this a week before settlement for this other job so they set up the crane this some of the guys had to stand really close to the pool with the guide ropes so we lifted it up it didn 't have to go it was about five meters of scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was very ambitious so we 've got lifted onto the bottom to be covered it up fantastic so if we die to know if we 'd waited and started it at 30 would have been fined by the usually usually the wind is the lowest around 30 in the morning so we do know a lot of crank jobs in the city in Sydney and Melbourne I don 't know why there 's just lots of crane jobs there and we always have to do though it 's really early so yeah then the Sun came out and the guys that had bought the house was the kind he was on the driveway he 's mostly the boat he was making that I couldn 't no air that yeah but I did point out to him as I was Lady Wolves out on the worm he wouldn 't have been out he would have had to try on the floor because you only to be able to get that back up again because we chose that we 're not going to haul them up that so that has been so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 55 days the Australian Museum leads from the storage space so that they can have the Tutankhamun exhibition which is opening the only next gene in the space was Australia 's largest collection of cultural objects artworks not your logical material in the Sydney 40,000 objects including cooking banks collection carved figures sleep drums canoe parts dance costumes you name it there was bag of doom no one wanted to pack the bag of doom yeah I wasn 't sure I feel like my name I 've been fine exactly so before we ever started we had to measure everything so this is Tom and Simon the measuring towards two weeks to get everything an idea of everything that had to tell me the team of spillages which to the frame is the same because that was everything these are the two most Allegiance so we did those in 22 days we to get that done we had to bring people from our office in Seattle so my boss owns a company in Seattle so he said to them do you want to go to see me into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can have time off and so they came over they absolutely loved it because they just finish to be Museum in Seattle and this was different material that they were going to be handling so they were really excited to come so what we had to do is we had all of the still agendas these still itches we haven 't made an hour workshop in Melbourne we didn 't have any capacity in the city to make them so we made them in Melbourne and then we set up this on-site store our on-site workshop in this train museum they have an old schoolhouse there and we were lucky enough to be able to use that that site the ground and everything the floor all we had to put Gator board down because the it 's a historic building so we had to protect everything and we just made up these stations these packing stations and everyone absolutely this was our we had three teams this is the first team and we took the photo for the first time so that was our first time we lots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things that are black down that 's because there are some things that we can 't look at they 're culturally sensitive so like those things out so every still each number three Jason bar coded so we had to do that because the new stores will be ready in time so we had to bring them all back to our store so we had to have a way of tracking everything we one of the guys came up with this great idea we had all of these plates made and just set in so they 're a little plate and they had holes drilled in them so that we would just get out struggling and they have a clip a normal clip strap with a clip on it like you would have on a bag we screw that in there screw the other side in and then it just gets secured tightened and clipped so it made a lot of those things a lot faster to do all of the tie back all of that white tie bag we had that cut by the distributor where we bought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually it comes in a roll the roll and we just made up the dispenser it 's like a toilet paper dispenser and that sat there on the bench and they were easy it was easy just to pull it out cut it you didn 't have to muck around with what size were turning it on to it was already small small enough to use so it all came to our store in Sydney and Sturridge guys said to him I 've got some still it is coming in you said oh yeah how many and I always because actually made that entire store so we were like we 're lucky we 've got lots of room for incoming and travelling exhibitions of is to cut that space so first part achieved so excited when I was finished so part two is the object relocation 40,000 objects 55 days so we had to relocate the Stila jizz to write on me an hour away from antique though plus pack 40,000 objects and get them to Rodney 55 days in the river 155 days is the bill that was coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would otherwise didn 't come with a pump no pressure so amazing things like this was something collected by Clinton corner yeah amazing so the conundrum shelf to shelf in 55 days so the shelves were the place was so packed so tightly packed and an incredible different collection of items and all different like these baskets that yet everything was different there were a lot of things which was great but they wanted to still adjust but the yeah everything was different I had very different that 's the rental time and because this store was in the middle of the Australian Museum and had been added onto they didn 't know a lot of what they had so you would move things and find a pole or find something this racking and someone would spy something behind it and I think there 's something behind there so we pull the racking apart and find something there that they haven 't registered they did another head Wow you know their insight they were a lot of exciting so we found I was three the third thing that the museum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these cars they look a little bit different to this but this was the basic idea start with drawers that stacked on each other so this is what they look like at the end so they 're structural ply is two weeks because the shelves come in two weeks so their shelves which is sixty centimeters deep and ones which are 97 so we wanted to take that into account there are two heights 30 or 40 centimeters because most thing was fitted within that range we had at best a big bag of pillow base which in my counterpart in our Melbourne office and his wife spent I think three weekends making all of these beanbag vases and standard clothes as space villains JUnit ops so report k9 we buy lots of things from Kmart and the purchasing people must must get so excited that it 's been a run on queen sized dinners we 've got a whole lot of dinners we 've had them cut side down the middle so that we can sit them on top to make sure things didn 't turn around and pillows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think and I would have people buying pillow cases I told you more animated from all different came out so over at New South Wales Victoria and camera and we would fill those and sew them at the top so they would make everything we needed and then apply lead for the top of each stack so usually those stacks only needs three high only because this they 're heavy to be able to leave so we unstack them all load the bottom one put an empty one on top stack that next one so here it LLL stay packing these ones so these about the dune is in the bottom they come off the shelf in me they just keep this 'll be in so we didn 't have to actually physically pack anything because if we have to pack it we would never get it done we 'd soon be there now load number one this was so exciting huge lift Australia 's in slightly bigger than your one here this yeah hugely so we 're able to fit Lots in it was very exciting when this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was just beautiful so the one of the things that we learn when we 're doing this also we had to learn all of the shelves you can actually buy that either you can you usually buy it in a big role and the lady started to like how many rolls on it and she said oh do you want us to cut that to size and I said okay so we had the the roll was cut into the width of the shelf but also they kiss covered so then we just made up a roller we would roll it out and there was a perforation that would tear it put it on the Shelf Tara put on the show didn 't have to cut me think was fantastic so it learning things all the time or between these so the first part real stating then talk about how we 're going to unpack it here 's one of the things that went out and I said about the museum 's conservation staff the materials conservation staff at the Museum attach things to boards that was part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are some things that be nestled into those be maids so what we did we would just drill them these boards directly into the cards and then that would travel like that was great so that 's how big they 're either 90 white ones and then a deeper so they 're 40 centimeters high and these kids we just had a half of those made up so they were good for moving we could move things directly on liners or we could pack into these so this is the new this is the old like it was just the old the old store there were things that they just couldn 't see what they were what they had this wasn 't enough space so the new stories are beautiful and oh my gawd we 're finished Esmond his manager so this is in the new museum visitor the new store and it 's beautiful I mean they can see what they 've got you can get down the aisles the community can go visit they have lots of visiting Ireland and people come this cause it 's a complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's great miniatures so this was a corporate client and this artwork if the way it came to us was all of these boxes flattened so we had to put them together they 're tiny this is a public museum wax so they 're like this be so we had to put them together then we had this this is the way they all had to go so we had to then find my father going crunch and they 're Americans things that we recognize say if you like if you guys watch yeah the goalie crunch we didn 't know what the packet was look like so we had to find that um we were given this map to put put it out it was a big job so we have people who have very patient so he 's totally busy and wakes on and then he 's just laying them all out it was his life he was three days he was there after we put them all together just load them all out and then the director of the company said I don 't know if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the foyer and then someone else said oh no maybe we could put them so we 've left it with them and it 's been there like two years so you only want to move on so random everyday things so these are just a mix of things that the specialized packing that we do this this is great he had to his arms had to be supported I thought it was they were covering up his kids no he 's arms to support it so until they actually there 's actually blocks under his arms there in under his hands you can 't sleep so we do that sort of packing as well this is done in our workshop so you know workshop things are more unless we set up a workshop at a client 's premises we have to make do with what we 've got and we do create things go but here this is very standard that 's Grammys so yeah this is let go so we do a lot of Lego packs and we do the packing for and that can be quite nerve-wracking because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things like this this is just made out of trial or cardboard it 's a stand for the glue gun so the boys will be doing something and some of those are committed because it 's not I did something but the glue gun on hang on a second and someone will make something and that 's what we ended up with it 's great models quite an elaborate pack for some models going overseas we don 't tend to do as many model packs as we used to because people are tending to do models with 3d printers now and there are more solid there are more solid product so they don 't really need as much handling so what 's next so this is the next moves are working on and it is an extensive archaeological collection and we will be using those museum carts we will have to build some things for it but it 's so much easier than me now having those music carts and being able to go in here and go okay I 'm going to fit those two will go in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before when I used to have to work at how many boxes I was in her name because yeah that was such a waste of cardboard but also time and time is money so moving out means I get to look at it in my stays which is fantastic I absolutely love what I do and I think it 's interesting [Music]","(-23.3786203, 150.5088889)"

AUS,QLD,Rockhampton Regional Council,RRCouncil,https://www.youtube.com/user/RRCouncil,engAGEing through ARTing _ New Home for QLD's Centre of Photography Collection,J2bnVzfekCs,20200624,2171.0,"Rockhampton QLD 4700, Australia",5641,[Music] first of all I like to acknowledge the consider traditional custodians of the lands that we stand past present and emerging and with that when I say that I always would like to consider they and express my great gratitude to the stories that have been passed on unfortunately not enough yet and I 'm hoping that it will be much more in the future what 's very fortunate to be living in Brisbane when Maurice Ortega Camilla berkland marry Andrew ray cook Jay younger I believe started the Queensland Center for photography in 2004 so what we see here is a small glimpse of a 10 year celebration of photography in in Australia I 'm saying Australia because there are quite a few artists here that were not from Queensland as it later came Christian Center of Photography qcp grew but in the beginning it was set up as a platform for Queensland photographic artists now again when I would say for the graphic we need to think of the word photographic in a in a very broad spectrum it 's a it 's a platform that where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only with the medium of photography and the medium of photography and all its form so it could be a work that is is created on Photoshop or darkroom techniques or the combination of the two or cutting and pasting drawing onto the photographs painting onto the photographs anything was possible so that 's really one of the premises that they said from the beginning it look at contemporary photography an experimental photography so that 's really what was one of the main drives now look at that we look at the history of photography of course we come back to weather particularly the history of art in general we look at landscape we look at we look at still lives a little bit portraiture they were really before the three main streams and for those in terms of the history portraiture is really where it mainly started it you had a portrait and around the portraits you as in in terms of complete art you would have maybe a few items that were on the table one from the person that was being painted in you had a landscape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that person and then slowly they separated slowly you became you had more of a still life painting and you had a landscape but in the past was it was just one landscape was part of the portrait double spend or it would have been a indoor setting so here the closest representation to that idea of the of of the still life painting it 's and you pre sought as you walked in is the one of the founding members of the Queen 's of the center of photography marry Andrew much-loved friend of mine and fantastic artist and Paul 's in one of the best-known photographic artists in Queensland at the moment so Mary Andrews work looks at that idea did the history of of still life a German artist how they used still life in their pendings but then she looked at the idea of dead animals in Australia native animals in Australia that she placed on the table the background that you see in the works is often based on the landscape where she would have found the animals or where the animals would have lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit because it really talks more much more about a traditional way of photography but at the same time it doesn 't and because if you look at the a lot of these still life paintings in the past there were much more based on the idea of wealth so if you were if you were a musician and you you had money pain to have so a painter paint still life for you then it may have a instruments in there or a sheet of music notes or if you were a well-traveled person and you had recently come back from from or we 're trading with Japan there might be a really beautiful porcelain cup in there but if you 're also better trading with the with South America then in that beautiful porcelain cup may have been some hot chocolate so there 's beautiful combinations so when you look at these pens it 's not just a beautiful still life painting it tells you something about the person who it was painted for or the person who commissioned the artist now in Marion 's ruse and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life and and history in treadle into the work so it 's a it 's a an ongoing aspects of of that genre if you like now that when you look at the collection of the prints at center of tog Rafi keep in mind it 's ten years 2004 to 2014 so if you look at it now or if you look at it in the future because yes you can look at it this in the future because it will be part of the collection here this entire set of hundreds and eight works where yeah we and we are really excited the fact that it is become part of the collection here of a amazing new building that you 're about to have which is extremely exciting and when a few years ago when I year ago only be even less I think we talked about about the building and I saw the site and and I knew that we still had this collection that needed to find a home it was just really wonderful to to finally have to have that heaven and have the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so but always think of the time and it 's that 's with every artwork I suppose we need to look at okay when was this artwork created what was the time what happens now one of the reasons I 'm saying that as well as like this show is is what 's what 's hanging here is it 's pretty good in terms of its it 's it 's one third of the artists represented in this is female and two third is now it should be 50 okay but we have to keep in mind that if we look at a collection you 'll find that the majority of it is also male so I would say the ratio is probably about the same now if you were to curate an exhibition now or collection then it would well I would like to think that it would be one of the things that you keep in mind that you have a collection that is that is much more based on equality of all and now I 'm not saying that Maurice and Camilla didn 't think of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that equality was always there and it was quite really beautiful to see that and there they really pushed push that as well they really it was Quizlet center of photography was one it became one of those community centers one of those community places where people would go to to to not only look at art but have that have that drink and talk with each other to get ideas to work together on projects so they started off in Berlin bar just over the river from from the older wool wool wool stores in in or just off actually it wasn 't Oxford or anyone been to a belieber just off Oxford Street and yeah so those I was a warehouse a small warehouse that they converted to to the center there 's some crazy parties that happened there which was fantastic yeah one of them ended up in a I wasn 't it was a wrestling party but in in jelly that happens at the front and then someone complains but somehow they knew that the person complained so they quickly cleaned everything up and had only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night and and then police games like not sure what you 're talking about here so it was quite quite funny some of those parties but I think that the most important part of being part of that community was that dialogue between artists and between everything was possible and so there there was this really healthy competition between the artists that was there to to push further to see a to be part of a group where Marilyn drew was part of Ray cook already quite established artists in the industry and to be part of that to be able to have conversations like that it differently pushed me as an artist into a very different different world I when I started my photography I started there 's a documentary photographer and I wasn 't quite sure or how I fit it in that that world but slowly I became part of that world as as an artist and of course there is that there 's there 's there 's always that line between well there isn 't anymore but between people say art and photography Indonesia photography art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at so and so did the works that you see here they vary between most of this self-expression they vary brother what they do they vary between traditional photography combines with historical photographs stories of a past but most of it is conceptual driven so concepts comes first and then the rest so that is pretty much all of the work you see here is conceptually trips are really looking at contemporary art form rather than photographic as as photographic practice now I 'm saying that but not undermining the idea of technique if we look at these works they 're all artists that have worked within that technique or have developed their technique to a to a and most of them are still practicing so you have we look at right cooks the elephant 's there it is a darkroom print silver gelatin print and any hand turns it with a brush so it is that process that 's that he worked with and Camilla Burke lands a beautiful setup of word of the work this I 'm a Camilla berkland was Maurice Ortega which we have here standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Boston director of the Queensland center of photography Camilla Birkeland his wife was the artist of that work the person standing on the right here with the glasses that 's right cool who made the work of the elephants and gia is standing on the sides their idea said that they started off Maurice and Camilla started off with organizing getting a place together for Queensland artists now very soon we started that he started looking thinking further I mean Maurice he 's Mexican and it was quite funny too to have him work with with all the people and most of the artists came from the Queensland from Queensland College of Art for in the photography department Maurice and Camino both used to teach there of course Marion drew used to teach there Jay younger used to teach there do we reach a younger no no this teach there I know there is a nation quorum of the work used to teach at the college Ray cook used to teach at the college levels Alex Perry who 's lying the reclining female photograph there see used to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partly volunteer she now works at for the Museum of Brisbane the and there is also work by Martin Smith I believe in the collection he still teaches at a Queensland College at Queens College of art as well so be they were very much connected to that now the collection that you see here was a combination it kind of happened the combination of two things majority of it there the works they were directly donated by the artists there 's two works in the collection of Lumbee and let 's yeah so yeah I had a show at the gallery and the amount of things that they did for me as an artist I appreciated that and Maurice was quite forward with asking about it too we should like to donate this particular work to the collection and it 's like and at first it was not I 'm not sure how many artists I hear but as a I think as an artist you think oh it cost me a lot of money in that frame around that cost me about eight hundred bucks and it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time if your work is then part of the collection then you can put it on the CV and if that organization is indeed doing a lot of work for you then it 's absolutely worth it now especially now to look at this it 's a ten year looking back at the Queensland central photography is going into the history of the organization and it 's only because of all those collections that work stands very strongly as a body of work without that your students we 're leaving a legacy behind for an organization that lasted lasted ten years and sure unfortunately it was only ten years but I like to think or the other way around it 's like 10 years is a long time any business that cancer can continue to go for 10 years that 's a long time for a director to be working on a project in a gallery or any business is a long time I don 't think there 's many of us maybe more in the past that stay in the same job for 10 years and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way the qcp grew from a small place that was in Berlin back to a organization that organized three photography festivals that went around Queensland so different as in different venues were part of us and I think there was one or two more like a conference where he came together and we talked about about art but I think there 's only one or two and the publication so several publications that they printed we had shows in Melbourne in Adler in Sydney few times and the Queen 's of several photography also started going to photography fairs and mainly fall to LA so they 're wonderful to LA five times and from that some things that happened from that Marion drew is part of the Getty Museum [Music] now coming off that I know I know and three artists were picked up by the Getty so the Getty LACMA one by one but Mayor injury by by the Getty and three by LACMA the Los Angeles County Museum of Art now I 'm not sure if you 've been in LA but they are massive institutions like we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about three times the ngv so that 's how big that organization is so it 's a very very big collection Chris Bose which i think is part of the collection as well it has one work in that collection I know I can see their female artist in front of your accounting of her name now and the artist the other artist that 's part of this myself so they picked two of my works so to be part of that collection it 's really quite amazing and that came through Queensland center of photography if they hadn 't gone to LA that moon of heavens the collection actually mark Kimber salt I worked to the Hells Angels but they did the guy who started Hells Angels so it 's really like no those beautiful connections that that you make it was really quite but it was one of those places to that after-hours Liana they are not all DiCaprio see ya came through the space and there 's some of those he selected works that he bought sir I don 't think from Howard booth but that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each doers I believe it and you stew it from from the police they guitar because aerosol drummer any police fence here he came Tribble he 's also a photographic artist so there was all those type of people that that 's walked through and then through that process to a few of the artists also got picked up by commercial artists economic commercial galleries like Kim DeMuth Kim the booth and myself we both are represented by a gallery in Germany who Koons complex so those are the things that kind of happened because it created a platform for us to do so they were a voice for us too today would carry our our art as a force to other people and it 's it 's it 's been a wonderful a ten years and unfortunately after 10 years the Newman government stopped funding the arts and that was one of the reasons there was the main reason that 's that they couldn 't continue I was only a board member of the last three years for the organization but it was I 'd learned I 've learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I think it 's I think that 's the most important part was it was a community and we worked together as a community and we we didn 't we didn 't it was a very healthy competition and if if someone got through then we applauded that altogether it wasn 't like I don 't feel that was definitely not something that I that I saw it was a healthy a very healthy organization and and we support us and they never got any I 'm proud to have been part of that and so we 're in a really interesting time I think Rockhampton I 'm keen to know 2004 Brisbane Queensland what was the drive behind standing qcp what was the thinking is it that these giants n effective photography is do them we didn 't have a photographic voice in Queensland how did it come from its very concept idea and had it Maurice materialize that I have to speculate the most of that but if I if we look at 2004 indeed you had they said they the Australian Centre on photography so Maurice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were all working at qcp and there weren 't any galleries that support us there are practice so wherever they has a go they always had to go a higher space or do it at the at the gallery at a university gallery but they of what that university gallery also was opened for a lot of other artists not the wouldn 't be able to serve the breath or photography they came out of QC a so thing is to create a space and a space that would push people to there 's one thing about and that that Marie 's always looked at what after university as a student what do you do after University what is your platform working you show work and it doesn 't matter it 's not only universities also we can do other courses where you go what do you do after this so Maurice and Camilla and ended the fount of foundation or qcp they created a space for people to continue and for people to spend to continue to share the love and passion for photographic art practice and that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it where as when yeah and getting his faith who 's going to paint the walls the community has galleries has students but if you didn 't have that how do had a QC become a better physically I think I 'm the I don 't know what the first steps were one day did it the reason I don 't know was because I was overseas I wasn 't in Brisbane I was doing an artist in residency in Estonian as one work of that in the collection that books here too on that I feel like I 'm promoting my own work here I was part of it I suppose still AM and so I don 't know how what they how they got the financial aspects together and how they started Maurice and Camilla lived in Berlin bar so the area was well known to them and for them to then find find a space that was suitable yeah and then funding and then others and obviously they were the nucleus behind the activity from them yep amenda always had sponsors though they looked at sponsorship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's been digital imaging Martin Barry did a lot of the printing for the artists and it was always at this kind of right yeah there was quite a few organizations that really supported qcp and they had of course government funding there was always government funding for the first few years and then also applying for other funds like every other arts organization yeah that you have to do but I think it was when it 's knowing what what what you need to tap into in terms of what is the art what is the government looking for or what is the education were looking for and to make sure you tap into all those parts saying that I think Maurice became part of the Lions Club because he knew there would be people with money there so that would then come to kyusu Peter by work and and it said those type of things but then we also had we have a healthy group of people that were and that it 's also had money so they would buy the occasional artwork and anne-marie 's would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember a few of those days they attack you CA they had art auctions and the money would go to the end of the year exhibitions and some of those works you saw there it was like all and it was quite interesting to were to be in that space and Maurice would either bid put bits in for some of the collectors if they couldn 't make it and yeah Darrell Yuson was was pretty one of the art one of the people that was a regular face and a an absolutely lovely man and he he has a very substantial collection oft sort of photographic prints and photographs got larger than this and but a lovely man Rafi and was really good to have him and his way of looking at art as well so but those he does yeah it was a great play stick shift by I too remember one time Maurice was bidding for someone and it wasn 't Mary Andrew and but the idiotic work boss it was a work that was created in the powerhouse Britain powerhouse before it became the powerhouse the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got another one 's version number two because I was bidding against Maurice and I won stage he looked at briefs like I 'm gonna get this I think he realized but it was it was this beautiful thing that 's that 's where yeah we that we shared and yeah we 're just I think the main part about any organization is it is be upfront and and ya know what you know what your what your aim is know what your widget goals are your your and then then go forth with that probably worth joining you know the conversation we have some representatives from the photography from the print makers from the contemporary artists so I guess in multiple hats running individual practices and then also others run spaces as well so Henry okay Henry if you have any ideas or thoughts about qcp Henry as well as a splice backs did they have equipment and resources that artists and especially in emerging photographers could access at the center as well primarily to promote the beautiful yeah promoted promoted finish products but if you has if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the partner past them absolutely if there was there would be there and they would also give you letters of support but there was also because their affiliation with the Queensland center of with the Queensland College of Art was so close that of the most hardest would go there to get that done yeah yeah yeah and of course ours from the four other universities were also involved with the center but was mainly the most artists came from the Clinton ecology culture art Kingdom came from QUT and then there 's also some artists that Peter mills that he was actually lecturing at at UQ art music at Duke you and so yeah but it was there was always that overlay so we had we had a very strong connection with universities where they could then go and yeah and work with yeah yeah so you mentioned that there was quite a dialogue between the artists so much a place where you could make work so did you just do that in the in the gallery opening nights but also if you for those that were working at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those all those places yeah but we also has in there were some dinners involved as well and but yeah there was limited and yeah I would have liked to see much more of that but that 's think that 's saying that now then it was different things like I think it there is a big difference between our situation now through the past they when everything is rosy when everything goes really well we all sit very comfortable within our own environment and create whereas when times are tougher we tend to look more at each other and help each other and I mean last time I was here I Bianca showed me the beautiful space they just call it a four-story building of all art forms but one of the first things that came to my mind why are they all boxed into their own low environment why they 're not working together imagine do a collaboration works with all different artists look to me like I would I would want to do all of it every every single floor I would wanna do everything but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me saying that actually it just makes you funny you don 't know saying that because I 'm a one-trick pony with my art practice I do one thing and that 's it but I the idea of being able to do so much but I suppose that probably comes from nothing that 's like I also come from an art teaching background I did some teaching at QC I as well as QUT so to help to have stood be surrounded by students and have them come to you with ideas and brainstorm with them that constant firing of ideas at each other it 's also something that continues with all with qcp and it was it was so wonderful like I always come back from the openings at qcp but and completely either my mind is complete like what 's the next thing I can do or a really completely exhausted because I gave my all my Nietzsche to everyone else but it was wonderful it was wonderful to be in that position and to do that and it 's like I think it 's something that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and listening to people with their ideas I can 't stop thinking about Oh have they done this what about that have they thought of this and I yeah constantly and I think it 's wonderful that to me that it create a dialogue that 's if that 's missing then why have an organization through the qtp collection and the activity that it did in Brisbane in that ten years what was a standout opportunity for engaging throughout that it 's supported strong engaging through arts in Brisbane or what its overall support it yeah it 's called the premise with art yep so what was the best thing the the most memorable engagement outcome there stands with you that was a success of PCB yes the wrestling was up there yeah I wasn 't part of the it must have been when I was in 2004 when I was I would have joined them in yeah up with joint I think the Queensland Festival photography was probably the thinned-out and part of that too was that three people would travel to different parts in Queensland and and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would discuss portfolio it was always from from the center and then the artists so it was a really beautiful dialogue and it was also really good because sometimes the other person didn 't agree with that person and we also said that and with about agreeing and it was about getting different perspectives on your work and it was quite clever with that too because from that to some of those artists were then able to come to Brisbane to have a show in Brisbane so it was that continuation of that as well so the premise really was to create a centre of Queensland photography and to put quince and photography on the map and I think it did that I really think that we never will be it 's that whole things like when you live in when you live in in a small country town then you look up to rockhampton if you live in Rockhampton you may look up to Brisbane when you live in Brisbane you look up to Sydney and no one and I mean I don 't know why but that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way around where people in those centres think they only live in Brisbane what would they now like as in Melbourne and Sydney so a lot of artists and have moved from Brisbane to Sydney and Melbourne and under only artists in every industry that happens that has also happens from here of course to to Brisbane autumn Melbourne and Sydney and also from smaller country towns and that 's a phenomena that happens everywhere how can you stop it you can 't that 's just the way it is and I think it 's it 's it 's part of it that 's what you can do is acknowledge that these artists are from that and I think that 's an important part they if we look at our state galleries that 's the job of the state gallery true to say these are artists from our state and and it 's the same and we create an archive of artists from the state 's a Queenslander photography try to do that with the photographic industry as well but looking at they they change the great shift in photography @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art and then really embracing that idea of conceptual photographic art practice in Queensland and these are the works that I come from Queensland and then they were able to go further around Australia and be shown further in their understudy and be placed next to it and after a little while it also when can you became the other way around where people down south heard about the Queensland center photography and then started engaging with us and started sharing with us Ben Ali on the two black and white works on the sides there Deborah paui they three works next to each other there otherwise been been early on in Sydney and then the work who write on the top with the light in their house that 's mark Kimber and Mark Kimber is actually showing in the middle of the work that 's a portrait of him by William Wilson took that photograph that photograph was actually taken in as far as oli he had a studio set up and they are done with our sorry one of those really old processes but I can 't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talks it 's messy for luck but not even fight for but plates that big that 's the size of the plate that he would hurt huge so a really beautiful work process so yeah there 's yeah [Laughter] [Applause] [Music],"(-23.3786203, 150.5088889)"

AUS,QLD,Rockhampton Regional Council,RRCouncil,https://www.youtube.com/user/RRCouncil,Spanish Mackerel Swim Baits,sVXNomgqWHU,20191008,722.72,"Rockhampton QLD 4700, Australia",1743,the tropical mackerel clan are amongst the most popular target species found in rock Hamptons coastal waters the monarch of this family is the Spanish or narrow barred mackerel which can reach almost 2 meters in length and weigh nearly 50 kilos in exceptional cases one of the most consistently successful ways to target these larger Spanish or narrow barred mackerel is to troll natural swim baits however these swim baits need to be rigged correctly on multiple hooks and a wire leader or trace so that they look lifelike in the water and don 't spin or twist dan catalyst shows exactly how to do it a lot of guys when they troll they there 's a lot of perception that you just put the put the baits out and put the rods in the holder and then and then just drive along until you can find it with your feet up but sometimes a strike sometimes a strike can be really really subtle you learn you 'll only feel a light tap on the rod and then and then if you might miss it and your bait might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even know so important that you have the right in your hand the other important thing is to be aware of what 's going on around you looking for current lines looking for bait that 's chopping on the surface looking for birds so being aware and probably the most important things to have a really good sounder and keeping it on the sounder so we can mark fish so we know what areas the trial where the fish are holding what depth they 're holding and if they 're holding a bit deeper we won 't use a deeper jig head or something like that to get them down or even something a little bit lighter speed the boat up a bit if they 're if they 're sitting there higher in the water column so just being aware and just being active all the time when trolling is really really important to fishing success want a fairly firm drag for the initial hookup set those hooks it 's nice and still and stable it means that the bait is just moving through the water perfectly straight and wool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it specifically targets advantage vample that 's definitely what you want to be using and it 's mostly because I think it 's a real delicacy for the for the Spanish really really do though I thought there 's this tropical North Queensland what 's going on like a full laser close on I 'm cold you 've got to chase pelagics up here you got to come and do it in the wintertime really this is pretty much at the moment the target species up here and [Music] nice fish being Spaniards we 've actually got a lot of big fish on us at the moment a big flat line which indicates expending a ton of the boat now we 've got a kill tank under your feet there and I pull this go in that 's all that 's left [Music] we 're going to go through making a pretty simple wolf hearing ring to start with probably the most important part is you need some type of weighted keel I really like to use a way to g 'head because it allows me to vary the depth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is I like to use or either a six ounce or an eight ounce jig head a six ounce jig head will swim your bait around about 25 to 30 feet if you 're in deeper water say 60 60 feet 70 feet an 8 ounce you get will be ideal that 'll get your bait down to about 40 40 50 feet some of the tools that you 're going to need needle nose pliers very important I have a ruler here six centimeter ruler which we 're going to which has a sharpened edge but we 're going to use to slide down the warfare in to create the cavity to put the hooks in some cutting tools obviously your rig which we 'll go into later stainless steel needle which we 'll use to actually pull the hooks through and some rigging wire okay so take your hook most people use either 900 or a tow hooks very important that you that you have a straight shaft at all okay these mustard tar ponds are excellent using the eye-opening section of our of our pliers we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their hooks and that allows us to put our barrel swivel through using our pliers we can then close up the the eye that we 've created closes up the eye nicely and then we can take our barrel swivel and push it down through that hook then is secured to the jig head now you want to you want to do this keep keep keep this proceeding this procedure until you get the rig long enough so that it will fit into your desired you get down to zayed Wolf 's hearing first thing to do is just make sure that you secure the mouth closed with a bit of wire if you leave the mouth open it 'll create a cavity for water to go through and then therefore the the watering won 't be able to swim properly we take our sharpened edge metal ruler and I like to use a middle rule because it 's got a bit of flexibility you don 't want something too rigid and you just open up the gill cavity of the wolf herring and you take your metal ruler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp an edge just to break through the gills the gill area and what you want to do is you want to find that backbone and once you find the backbone you 'll be able to just push through here and you 'll hear a bit of a cracking noise and that 's actually the ruler running down the backbone of the fish and what we 're actually doing is creating a cavity put the hooks down inside and just a sharp motion sharp motion like that lifting the fish up and this is where the flexibility the ruler comes into its own because it can bend with the backbone and all you have to do is run it down through the backbone so as you can see you 've created a cavity there and that cavity fits perfectly for the master hooks as you can see see which fit perfectly in there as well so once we 've created that cavity we can then take out our needle you can run it down we can run the needle through the cavity we 've just created very important to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little bit of mono attached to it and the reason why it has that more nervous because we 're going to use this end this tag in here to actually pull the hooks through just attach that tag mono just make sure it 's very tight we can now begin to take our hooks and pull them down actually inside our fish it 's very important that the hooks remain upwards facing upwards with the fish so just take our first hook slide it and then we 're able to just pull that through and it 's important that you take your time because once the hooks go in they won 't come out and as you can see the hooks are moving down through the fish once we get out our weighted keel to there we can just simply slip that up underneath the fish like that cut the remaining tag end here alright so now we 're going to attach the weighted keel to underneath the chin of the fish and it 's quite simple we can just take a bit of wire rip through the eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it 's just a simple matter of twisting that wire so it 's nice and tight if we keep twisting with the needlenose pliers until it 's very tight and sitting real central to the middle we 've got our finished wall faring okay all rigged up inside all the hooks are in Cyprus it 's can 't be seen and a perfect little kill running down the front and with this with the six ounce jig head and then if you like to finish it off you can take a little skirt push it down and through and what this will do will actually create a bit of a traction as well as hide the weighted keel as well one rigged warfare intended dan had a big boat so plus I have to crank more wolfy and I 'm good hit off by in there you guys there he is a beautiful Spanish here we 're gonna do this Dan you want the calf until a so I guess I can do a sigh I 'll leave my fish out Ward down I 'll just put him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down hard on this coil keeping that Ward 's big is your origin do you look like a pretty good fish oh that 's I got the gaff underneath your name I don 't be good underneath okay I came you get for a bit getting yours [Music] even though it 's good [Music] what you think [Music] [Music] yeah it 's a bit of a wake up when they hit million bases the thing they don 't can 't really stretched boys a nice fish it 's going to be a pleasure to get module-based down early morning Spanish mackerel lying on the bottom of the toy double next time you 're heading offshore in the Rockhampton region make sure you try rigging and trolling a couple of swim baits you just might find yourself connected to the fish of a lifetime,"(-23.3786203, 150.5088889)"
