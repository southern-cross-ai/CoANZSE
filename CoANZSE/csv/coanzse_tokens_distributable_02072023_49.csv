understand the change that I can put it into context for you so first of all we have a little bit here for you which was made at the expert that was held in london millions years and it 's talking a bit about the instruction employers one of the things that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly businesses struggle to find school workers a few of the calculations are difficult and complex loosely low-level possession Reuters complete boys still seems to be here six because I asked people to put themselves forward to be selected for equate to employees were looking for their skill sets really simple roles and because as accounting errors are real great temple from business I can put a future development of the business and the Tribune tree itself really into your feathers are technical skills York City deserves programs are suing us the ability to access skill buyers from Kosovo ASA who but I 'm ash pile of boxes it will enable people to get visas in quickly not in contention that why black clothes truth international 5 record they will have a complete application which should be assessed very fast excuse elect website would be I think we have production me for us because we have to go to single entry points and view potential employees come to strengthen so we can go through categorized and it 's just not to me for us to find holy month Isis if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong Joe Fred better outfit with the recipes anything that can be utilized to find Russell people are often very quickly we need to find people that get them working in australia soon as possible so yeah still select is going to help us do that messenger okay so I do not hear about what 's coming sorry to explain in a little bit more detail the skills like that they 're talking about is to do with people wishing to migrate to Australia as well as employers need for people to build both positions in their business so at the moment you 're probably aware there 's a few different Oscar migration programs and people were seized machine to go to Australia afterwards an application for a visa skills legs a little bit differently for the various independent strong of evolution to migrate here in that now I work our Georgian application they 'll have to watch what 's called an expression of interest and then based on their qualifications their work experience that IH as long as I make a particular pathmark for you vibration and they 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's about us being able to choose people that we think have got you know the best qualification is chance of doing well and shooting to the leg market here in Australia that 's essentially what skin select is all about New Zealand has very similar system in place and quite what 's called still selling everyone so we 're kind of meat museums idea well in collaboration so looking at work functions to eat and what works in other countries and now they 're introducing it in Australia so yeah as it 's a lot there is an online system that allows our skilled workers interested in bringing to Australia to leave me details 2011 another part of this whole school sewage system is doing employers to access that data see whether the person might have publications experience that that they need to feel position in any business and they 'll be able to contact the person to discuss whether and it 's suitable and possibly employ Swanson will be an option so people wanted tomorrow at this will have to watch called an expression of interest for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can indicate an interesting employer sponsorship and also if you 're going for your state or territory to sponsor them as well which is where they 'd be willing to leave work so as this diagram shows there 's the intended migrant lodges the expression of interest employers who have an auskey we are to access lower rates will graph the potential employees they 'll be able to contact the person directly through the system and either the person inside songs application or at very least we have contact once they arrive here in Australia it is so the whole idea behind six left as well is stock pipeline that is currently happening in action skilled migration system so at the moment we 've got about 50,000 both a thousand people waiting for attendance killed peasant dependence dream so another I guess gold having some select is that won 't how many people waiting in line for visa that would be able to choose you know the people that we wish the way that feels like mention work is that eventually occupations will be capped possibly so that would prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play so good example slowly it is too many cooks and addresses at the moment in Australia who were not working their profession so this will prevent that from happening and listen to industry and others about what occupations are in times and possibly based on that we going to amount of certain occupations that will be offered an invitation to dinner so such as specifically for our employers as i mentioned canadians and was keen to have a look at the doll race which emotional skills by understanding swatch answer order to get almost equal you can search for were intending diamonds and then contact them Jewish discuss further any potential latency so I mentioned just very grateful we were curious in the skilled migration program at employment just supposed to be you don 't know too much about it such was this world this one- hostel by seven major to the temporary for eight days program where a person can be sponsored throughout four years second we should not use that widely labor agreements you may have heard recently there was the introduction of asian enterprise migration routes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's just announced its regional hydration friends which again is more to do with businesses lacking skills in areas where there is very low unemployment with high board so certain parts of Queensland and the third emotion there is a pervasive original sponsored migration scheme which must be mine oh gosh lady Jang you 're eligible she saw someone under this game the next responsiveness is an abomination see which is usable by metropolitan cities but it can be used by the reasons you wish and lastly there 's the general school migration will be independent to say church responsive strength which is one of the month of about 30,000 big 12 to answer just very briefly do they don 't use it for person and friend so some of you may be aware it 's a very different to be payment invoice lots of programs in that it 's not counting this very part of the migration program therefore there 's no cap on the number of 457 visas that can be granted each year the occupations that are nominating to them to the list the employees page what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temperature vibration commercial which for markets our own history of crucial employees focusing upon each other skills and qualifications and there 's also a mission on this message visa so that 's it briefly I don 't want to go into mush now we thought you 're probably more interesting changes to that happening soon also callosum visa holders can break in Australia for up to four years they 're able to change employers pretty easily and that 's a question that we get a lot from four varsity policies how will change mark where they 're able to bring any eligible family members and that the Ventura thousands coming in South Australia very possible to use the program it 's a three step process for employers so sponsorship and nomination and the visa application and I thought this may be of interest some of the feedback that we 've had from local governments and the state government is that a lot of employers consider using this program for small to medium sized employers possibly don 't use it because they feel that it 's too much work she must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show you that over 10,000 businesses are currently using the program at the moment we have highest number of us and holders in Australia they 're demonstrating the program so I think because of the fast processing times that we see with the four by seven processing area I think at the moment they looking at processing it about 22 days if the application is complete revision around about 22 days which is about pasta so they 've ever done so I think trying to make the program a lot easier a lot more accessible faster an outcome where we 're seeing a lot more boys checking out his vegetable sure no I 'm just going to stay that here can everyone hear me okay yep and as Caroline pointed out obviously some of the significant changes that are occurring on july one relate to our permanent employer sponsored programs which i 'm assuming it 's probably what most of you are here to hear about today so just to get an idea who here currently uses the regional sponsored migration scheme program our SMS program yeah and anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already obviously it 's been a show of hands for four five seven so that 's obviously you 're on your other alternative as well so with the reforms earnest and our SMS as i 'll refer to them they 're probably really almost sort of like the last cab off the rank so to speak in a range of reforms that have been happening to the skilled migration program for some time so i think initially it was back in 2009 the general skilled migration program or the independent migration pathways as Carolyn already mentioned them earlier in relation to skill select they 've already had significant reforms in that space so ENS and our SMS is almost sort of like the last lot of the reforms to to occur to ensure that the skilled migration program is a more targeted responsive program putting skilled migrants into labor market shortages so it 's more about I guess you know ensuring that school migrants are coming to Australia and they 're going in to jobs obviously and also making sure that it 's a highly skilled program ok so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ migration scheme there may have been some misconceptions that perhaps it was a semi skilled program these reforms the government have made it quite clear it 's to make sure that our SMS is being used appropriately as a skilled migration program and we 'll talk a bit more about that as we go along so a new visa structure so basically at the moment the way you probably use our SMS or ENS you 're probably very familiar with 857 856 maybe 12 11 19 as part of the reforms we 're actually going to be simplifying the visa sub classes that are available so we 're actually only going to have to so onshore offshore the distinctions that currently exist they will go so there will no longer be on short and offshore categories there 'll be one visa for E&S which is going to be your 186 visa so that will essentially replace your 856 visa and your 121 visa and then with your regional sponsored migration scheme so historically you 've been using 857 or 119 you 'll now be looking at the 187 visa okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a skilled migrant who might be here on a tourist visa or a working holiday visa they can apply on shore that for obviously the 187 or the 186 there 's no qualified provisions and so forth anymore that the visa applicant will need to meet which makes a lot more simple for a lot of employers and the visa holders themselves now within each visa subclass is going to be three streams so again forget about your unsure and your offshore the way we need to get you thinking these days it 's the temporary residents transition strength so largely when you talked about the onshore visa category so say for example and I 'll use our SMS as an example your 857 if you had applicants that were here on a 457 transitioning across to permanency and you would probably be using the 857 onshore category now you 'll be using the trt the temporary residents transition stream then you 've got the direct entry stream so perhaps previously when you had skilled migrants that you will bring into Lee from overseas using maybe the 119 program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entry strength so in all instances where you 're sponsoring a skilled migrant who is not already here on a 457 and they haven 't been on that 457 for two years or more it is the direct entry stream that you 'll be looking at any questions about that okay the agreement stream refers to labor agreement so as cavs mentioned earlier labor agreements they 're not as widely used as your other employer sponsored programs so we 're not going to be touching on that too much today but that is another stream which will be available through your ENS and our SMS programs all right so the key reforms so this is significant reforms I guess that will be occurring in the ens and our SMS space come july one this year so as i already mentioned they 're going to be collapsing the existing subclasses from six to two with the three streams which will be available to you now one of the key announcements as part of last year 's budget announcement it 's actually the budgets I think being announced today so looking back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that they were going to remove the red tape so from 457 visa holders going through to permanency they wanted to streamline the process to make it easier for those that have been here for a significant period of time when I say significant period of time I 'm talking two years they want to remove that red tape so to speak so it 's an easier path way through to permanent residency so that will now actually make it easier not just fit obviously that the visa holder but also for you as an employer sponsoring that skilled migrant so if you if many of you obviously use the 457 program you have visa holders that have been here for up to two years or more the process should hopefully be a lot more seamless for you now when your sponsors and for permanency and I 'll talk about that a little bit a bit more later and a very good news story they 're raising the age limit 45 to 50 now when I say 50 that means they have to be under 50 so pretty much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're you know in your late 40s or turning 50 I 'm sure it 's not the end of your working life there 's many skilled migrants out there who at that age have a lot to offer a lot of experience skills and qualifications at that age that can still come to Australia and obviously contribute to the workforce in the Australian community so that age limits actually been raised to for all the independent the general skilled migration programs that 's also been raised up to 50 as well changes to key visa criteria which we 're going to talk about in further detail shortly and I 'm sure some of you have heard about the changes to english language and to skills that will that will certainly be occurring and particularly in the english space and yeah the bar will be raised in that respect which i 'm sure again that you have heard about already and refocusing the work that the regional certifying body RCB i 'm sure most of you are perhaps familiar with the RCB in damage along here if you 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to focus purely on those coming in by the direct entry stream so the people that are coming from offshore that are not already here who have clearly you know if you 've been here for you know a number of years and a 457 you already have you know you 've proven yourself in the workplace so it 's considered to be a tested position with the direct entry RCBS will be looking to focus purely on the untested being the direct entry and then the other key reform is the introduction of one consolidated sponsored list so you 're probably going to hear and be referred to as the sea soul i think they 're trying to find a better name for it but at this stage if you hear the word see soul thrown around that refers to the consolidated skilled occupation list so that means at the moment and you 're probably aware depending on which skilled migration program you 're looking at there are a number of different lists so it can be quite confusing and with the consolidation of this particular the employer sponsored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the list that currently exists for your employer nomination scheme being your ENS will be consolidated it will be the one list this actually means and it 'll probably be a broader list than what it already is so the 457 lists for those of you that who use the 457 program from what we 're told it will pretty much probably remain as it is and the ens list or the 856 visa list that will expand to include those occupations that can currently be nominated under the 457 so the news obviously for employers and it makes complete sense because currently the way that the programs are structured and the ens list or the end sol en sol sol which you probably are may refer to from time to time that has a limited amount of occupations on it as opposed to the 457 list which is broader so what at times happens is you get a 457 visa holder applying for ens but the occupation is not on the list for ens so it makes it very difficult for that skilled migrant to be sponsored for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem it will should be far easier for the 457 visa holder to streamline to permanent residency any questions about that ok so the lists which I 'm just talking about and so we don 't have to go through this in great detail now so as I said you 're going to have your employer sponsored category you 'll have the one main list which is your thief oh so you 're solid ated skilled occupation list now the one thing that we haven 't mentioned yet is regional sponsored migration scheme so currently as you would all be aware there is no list for the regional sponsored migration scheme they will continue to be no list okay so if anything with the changes to our SMS it probably will open it up slightly because now under our SMS you 'll be able to sponsor any occupation with school level 123 on the and sky is everyone familiar with ansco yet you must be if you 're obviously sponsoring on 457 and then our SMS so currently not all skill level three occupations can necessarily be nominated under our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you guys are we going to look at the answer is that was that now or is it later oh we 're going to look at the esco ever at some point so we 'll save that for later and the skilled independent or the skilled occupation list the soul that relates purely to general skilled migration so when we talk about general skill migration that 's that other big program that 's that Kaz was talking about that relates to people who apply independently and something that we should probably point out when we were talking about skill select and we 're talking about this being an option for an employer 's and it 's great new products to connect employers to skilled migrants which it is I just have to make clear it 's not mandatory okay so if you are looking to sponsor under the employer sponsored categories you don 't have to use skill select so if you already have your own methods in place and recruitment processes that 's fine you can continue with that there 's there 's no change in that regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional option for employers and particularly if you are having issues in perhaps sourcing and skilled migrants from offshore or filling your labor shortages this will just be an additional resource to link you to skilled migrants I guess probably the the positive point to note as well is that when you 're looking at you know potential visa applicants in the skill select system you will know that they 're clearly going to have the relevant qualifications and skills and so forth in order to meet the visa requirements so there 's something to keep in mind okay because I 'm if you 're having difficulty perhaps finding someone that has the appropriate level of English for our SMS purposes have a look at skill select because you know that everyone that 's in that I 'm going to have the appropriate level of skill and English Tilly is another step you 'll have to go through to work out as to whether or not they 're appropriate for you know the position that you might be trying to fill and so forth but it 's an additional option @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though it is mandatory for gsm for general skilled migration okay but that 's the only visa categories that it 's actually compulsory for everyone 's fear on that yep cool alright so we 're just going to go through the streams quickly as I said there 's there 's three main streams are going to exist within employ nomination scheme and the regional sponsor migration scheme okay so we 're going to look at ens first and foremost so just trying to make sure we separate for two and we 're going to look at the temporary residents transition stream so this is for the people that are already here on 457 visas and have been for up to two years so that 's that 's the key criteria to use the trt stream as we 're going to be referring to it so that 's that 's the main requirement that they 'll need to meet they 've been here on the 457 with the sponsoring employer so working for you for that two years in the skilled occupation so that 's obviously a key that they need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nominated for as long as they 've been doing all of that that box is considered teach so there 's going to be no reassessment of the visa applicants and skill criteria we don 't have to go through that whole process again so again that 's making the the making it easier to get through the actual visa application process now with the nomination the celery is going to have to match market rate so that 's again it will be the same so what they were nominated on the 457 to do and what though you were paying them as an employer the market rate their 457 stage that needs to continue at the ens stage so at the employer nomination scheme stage the position needs to be full-time and available for at least two years full time being 35 hours per week okay so that that 's what you need to be nominating them for and you need to obviously be making a commitment to employ that person for two years the employer needs to continue to meet subclass 457 standard business sponsorship training requirements so again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs to be met again as already mentioned in things have been working for you for the last two years in the same occupation and in terms of the employer and whether there 's a cost to you the nomination charge is currently five hundred and twenty dollars so that 's potentially subject to change you probably find every you july one normally you know the nomination charges and the visa application charges that they tend to be indexed so that may well go up but currently that 's what it is the visa applicant again skills what be assessed because it 's already considered that they 've met that requirement having been hit on the 457 they need to be less than 50 years old unless exempt and they need to have vocational english unless exempt and we 'll talk about those exceptions a bit more later so many of you are probably aware of exceptional circumstances exceptional circumstances will no longer exist but there will be exemptions that can apply so again we 'll discuss that in further detail still with ENS the direct entry stream so again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been untested in the australian labor market they 'll be coming by this this particular stream so with ENS again we 've talked about that Cecil the consolidated list you 'd need to be nominating them under one of the occupations that are obviously on the consolidated skilled occupation list then you need to be obviously willing to pay than the market rate so whatever the Australian employee is paid in that skilled occupation in the workplace you need to be making a commitment to pay the overseas worker at the same rate the position again needs to be full-time available for two years you need to contend continue to meet the training benchmarks as with 457 and the nomination charge again is 520 subject to change these applicant so this is slightly different so to the trt or the temporary transition stream the direct entry is the visa applicant will need to provide evidence of three years work experience in the skilled occupation and they need to also provide a skills assessment as well okay that need to be less than 50 years old and this is the difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level of competent English okay so just to give you an indication competent English when we talk about IELTS tests and so forth competent would be six in every band vocational when we looked at that previous slide in relation to the temporary transition strength we said they need to have a minimum of vocational English vocational five in every band so for those who have been here working for two years and applying under the trt stream the level of English is slightly lower its locational as opposed to competent for direct entry oh this is where we look at the answer yes so we 're going to write our SMS but first and foremost and we just wanted to show you the ants go which is where you obviously go to search for skilled occupations and to try and work out I guess whether the skilled occupation that you need to feel in your business is actually of the appropriate skill level okay so I think again most of you have already used ants go or you know how it works but we 'll just look at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there 's a search facility which is available to you does this look familiar to most of you yeah no yes no okay so say for example you need a motor mechanic for your business you just literally you put in the in the occupation title being motor mechanic and it will take you straight to the relevant ants go um unit group okay um actually just something to point out with the 457 visa holders the one to potentially you are going to be sponsoring for permanency for say they 're coming across on your DNS all your our SMS visa and we talked about the skilled applicant obviously needing to have been working in that skilled occupation for two years there is a little bit of flexibility in that can you just roll down a bit for me cuz so say the guy is a motor mechanic that you 're sponsoring but in that two years on the 457 know they might have been promoted or they might be doing something slightly different to what they were first nominated to do on the 457 visa it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group because that does happen you know sometimes you know as an employer you will sponsor someone to come on shore and a 457 and you know it may be that the the overseas worker does you know get promoted or go on to do training in a different area and work at a higher level so as long as the occupation remains in the same unit group that is acceptable for ens or our SMS purposes but not anything less skilled that would not be acceptable obviously so when you 're looking at our SMS and obviously we talked about if you are wanting to sponsor someone under a nominated occupation for our SMS purposes it needs to be of a skill level 123 so you can see Caroline 's just highlighted here skill level 3 so when you 're looking at ants go and you 're thinking or where do I have fun you know the information to tell me this is a skilled occupation our SMS purposes if you look down at least you 'll see quite clearly it gives you the school level so Mon a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all trades will fall under skill level 3 and that is acceptable for our SMS purposes so if you say you looked up an occupation and it told you still level for skill level 5 know if you know that obviously it 's not going to meet so school level 1 just free all of those occupations will be fine for our SMS any questions about that so that 's an scope so regional sponsored migration scheme are SMS so again like with ENS there 'll be your temporary transition stream and there will be your direct entry stream okay so looking at the trt the employer nomination again if they 've been here on a 457 we 're not going to go back and reassess that okay so that box will be ticked the visa applicants considered to still be working in that position we don 't need to revisit that requirement they meet the skill requirement the position needs to be full time again 35 hours a week and available for at least two years needs to match the market right again so much like with your 457 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ENS your employee nomination scheme our SMS will have its introducing a market rate so again as I explained earlier you need to be you need to demonstrate that you 're paying the overseas worker the same rate that you 're paying your Australian workers again the need to have worked with the employer so coming through the trt stream they 've already obviously been working for you for two years and with our SMS as you know currently there 's no fee that will continue to be the same as far as we know again and as we 've already pointed out a lot of this is all still subject to change because the legislative change process is still in effect so hasn 't actually been signed off yet so when we talk about the regulations and the policy they 're not actually available so we can tell you how we think it 's going to look but we just need to make clear that anything we discussed today and it is subject to change so just keep that in mind but as far as we 're aware the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the visa applicant again as I said if they 're coming off the trt stream their skills won 't be assessed again because they 're here they 're on a 457 no need to go back need to be less than 50 unless exempt and they need to have so this would be a key change for our SMS they need to have a minimum vocational English but again if they 're coming through the trt stream they 've been on the 457 shouldn 't be an issue vocational English should be met unless exempt so direct entry so again this is an when you 're bringing the bike would be the 119 the offshore category this is if you 're bringing the skilled migrant indirectly from overseas this is the stream that you would be looking at and I should just give you an indication currently with our SMS probably sixty five percent of applications at the department received are actually for existing 457 visa holders so it actually shows how you know significant the the pathway is from 457 to permanent residency with enf it 's about eighty-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stream to remove the red tape in that regard but with a direct entry for those that do choose to bring skill margaret 's directly from overseas these are the requirements that will need to be met so as already discussed as an employer who need to nominate an occupation that fits in the skilled level 123 category okay and they need to you need to be willing to pay the market rate again obviously the position needs to be full-time and available for at least two years there will still be with the direct entry and rcv component applicable so an RC b assessment will be required so again when we were looking at the trt stream just before you would have noticed as I 've mentioned earlier the rcv won 't need to assess those that have already been here on the 457 it will only be for the direct entry and again there should still be no nomination charge for employers the visa applicant and this is a bit of a change so for our SMS for those that are coming directly from offshore using direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skills assessment okay so that 's from trial so a skills assessment for skill level and that will be mainly am obviously school level three occupations unless exempt less than 50 and again much with E&S the direct entry dream will be a competent level of English so the six in every band on the IELTS unless exempt any questions about that one yes yes yep needs to be with you yeah with the sponsoring employer yeah so if you do find perhaps an employee that has already been on a 45 7 for 12 months with a previous employer if they come across to work with you which is fine that 's easy to do on a 457 they would need to then work for two years with you before you sponsor them for permanency yeah of course unless you go the direct entry pathway so and generally with most I 've been talking to the nurses lately actually and it would seem that you know a lot of them they may not have been here on a 457 for two years but there 's no reason that an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would just be that they have to have three years work experience that can be from offshore or onshore it just needs to have been in a skilled occupation and it can be from any time so it doesn 't have to be the three years immediately prior to the date of application and they need to provide a skills assessment so there is an alternative it doesn 't have to be that you go from the trt stream and yeah I think you 'd buy most well a lot of the skilled migrants do have that three years work experience sorry for ens yes oh if our SMS night you don 't have to don 't have to have the work experience for our SMS only for Eunice okay your exemption categories these are them now this is definitely very much still subject to change so unfortunately if you 've got any sort of technical questions about these exemptions we probably can 't really give you a lot of them answers in that respect but this is sort of how it probably will look in terms of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we said have you have to be under 50 so 49 and under unless you are nominating someone that potentially falls into one of these categories so ministers of religion for one Australian universities or CSIRO perhaps nominating academics or research scientists and so forth they as well potentially would meet for an age exemption and transitionary applicants so those that are coming through off of the 457 who have been working full-time in Australia for four years on a subclass 457 and a paid the fair work australia at high income threshold so when we talk about height you come I think it 's around about 100 118 or 180 see that so it 's pretty hard so that person and to meet that age exemption category would have need to have been here for years not getting paid fifty five thousand dollars for the three of the years and then 118 it would need to be obviously over that entire four-year period okay skill again many ministers of religion and actually it kind of mirrors the age really so those that have been dominated by Australian universities CSIRO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of these are actually going to be when they 've formalized the whole process it 's going to be a legislative instrument available so I don 't know how familiar you guys are with the existing exceptional circumstances categories but the way that they currently work they 're very sort of grain they 're very gray there 's no real black and white it 's a lot of discretion currently in the exceptional circumstances categories so by introducing alleges legislative instrument they 're hoping to eliminate that so it will be very clear to case officers who are assessing those applications whether someone meets or does not meet under these categories and English see currently the exemptions that they 're suggesting would not many of them but they 'd pretty much be four passport holders from any of those countries so UK Canada Island USA and or alternatively if they 've achieved Abby passmark in your own OE test oet with a bt sterile not entirely sure there you go off the post thank you and that 's also available to Africans I think my understanding of it are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aisle it 's just so um yeah okay sure Oh in so Oh yeah yeah I suppose the way the pathway for them would be and I guess the way which the government would look at it is that for those highly skilled categories like the ones are talking about then probably get paid 118,000 which means that they can still come on the 457 there 's no age limit for 57 they can still count on the 457 work for four years which would clearly demo understand where you 're coming from in relation to the PR but as it is that the pathway I that exists for them yeah no problem and the focus on regional Australia so the objective obviously the our SMS program is to encourage and attract skilled migrants to areas outside gives the general metropolitan areas so whether that be along whether that be broom obviously we 're just talking about country towns and small cities that are outside of the areas that are named here and this existing programming or financial year is the first year that they 've actually allocated a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being 16,000 so this year the government will grant 16,000 visas to people applying under the are SMS program so we haven 't heard the numbers for next year yet but I would assume that they would be similar to what you see there and as Caroline mentioned there 's going to be regional migration agreements available for regional areas you 're our mas and an our SMS currently is when you talk about processing priorities is actually visit the minister releases like a direction and they list in order you know what 's top priority in terms of processing arrangements and our SMS is actually on the top of that list followed closely by ENS so the employer sponsored category was definitely receive the highest priority when it comes to visa processing these account oh this is a very important point visa cancel a and no training requirement has been retained for our SMS so you know when your sponsor for our SMS currently there 's a provision that visa holders they come they work in the regional area they have to remain the two years in the regional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visa that still remains that will still be the case so those cancellation provisions will still be available to the department potentially if these applicants do not obviously come to the regional error which you can imagine if we didn 't have those provisions and yeah the retention of the skilled migrant in a regional area would be a lot more difficult so that 's a positive for employers and clearly there 's still no training requirement you know how we were talking about the ens is the training requirement which mirrors the 457 there 's no training requirement for our SMS either our lodgment so those of you that sponsor under 457 you 're probably familiar with the fact that you have a lodgment available to you from july one that will also be the case for ens and our SMS which means that you 'll be able to load your applications online okay so finally we 're sort of moving with the time so the way it is currently it 's all paper paper-based for ens and our SMS from and july one and they 're also going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a positive because i think you 'll find for those of you that use the online lodgement for 457 i believe it 's a lot it 's a lot easier but employers and like to point out watching decision already i 'm sure you 've all heard this before decision already applications being complete applications and they 're a big positive so for you anything I guess the department in terms of from a processing perspective if you lodge a complete decision or any application you 're going to get a quicker outcome on the visa application sometimes significantly quicker because then you 'll remove that whole you know the request process of 28 days and then potentially another 28 days if you can make sure that everything on the application up front so in I guess your discussions with the potential person that you 're nominating as well try and encourage them to ensure their visa application is complete you can ensure that that occurs at the application stage you 'll get a much quicker turnaround time and that goes for any of the visa and visas we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key point vivo does anyone use VEVO cool VEVO is it 's it 's good for employers to check I mean because I 'm sure as an employer you might sometimes be approached by visa holders who perhaps what I come and work for you and for your business and they tell you I 've got this such-and-such visa yet I 've got for work rights no problem as an employer you might you know perhaps wonder if that 's actually the case so by using VEVO you can verify whether or not a visa holder what visa they 're on what their work rights actually are and prior to you actually employing or nominating them so that 's actually it 's a really good facility for employers to use we 've got some discs actually at the back of the room that to be bringing yes which Caroline remember to bring so if you want to grab a disc afterwards that will actually step you through the whole process of how to register video on how to actually use the under VEVO tool for further information so there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's using these days and and i would suggest as we talked about a lot of this information that we 've given you two dates it is still subject to change of course of that legislative change process and so forth that we 're currently going through so to keep an eye on everything and where it 's at and what 's going on you can get on facebook you can get on Twitter and there 's a skilled migration blog as well any of these channels will give you the quickest and most up-to-date information on what 's happening in the skilled migration space and we also have a regional outreach officer so Jeff I don 't know some of you may have dealt with Jeff from time to time he 's a bit like us but he purely specifically for the purpose of assisting employers in regional areas so you can contact jeff on his email address there too if you do have any questions about anything we 've talked about today okay any questions you 're all very quiet yes sixteen thousand places no that 's that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unit so yeah so when you 're talking about yeah that yeah exactly that would be that would be considered six places yeah I haven 't heard that was that that 's a potential change I think when we talk about skilled migration programs any of the migration program so when you I guess you hear about the skilled migration program on a whole obviously there 's different components so you 've got your independent yeah employer-sponsored you 've got your monetary and new families they always talk about it in places so indicative planning levels and every visa that 's granted whether it be to the primary applicant or to the dependence is considered one visa there 's one per person so I haven 't heard of any changes in that regard but yeah and probably I think last year when you go back to the last program year yeah what about 1000 hours but yes it 's about six thousand places increase of what you know every year when you look at the status is growing and growing but yeah the additional six thousand as you say and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent so they 're in the pipeline that fabulous pipeline so hopefully as Caroline pointed out that 's what skill selection you know go towards eliminating because clearly applicants will be invited to imply as opposed to just everyone apply and they will still be processed as normal i think gsm or general skilled migration are going to great lengths at the moment to get through that pipeline and I believe processing times they 've they 've improved dramatically to the point where even like you know how we talked about the priorities in terms of priority processing so independent migrations about third on the list after employer-sponsored so there 's it 's up to five priorities basically but even the priority five is being allocated to case officers pretty quickly no I don 't have to know they will not have to apply again or go into skill select know their applications will be treated as normal and will continue to be processed based on the boot the time of application provision so it 's dated from when they apply they 'll be assessed against whatever the requirements were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sponsor them or get them out of that pipeline to help them get their permanent residency you can do that in any role ok let 's changes things but yeah look I think you 'll find that there 's some improvements really happening in that space so hopefully it shouldn 't be too much longer for the independent yet is in the people from okay said when you say they 're going to slide across sport from 457 or as they 're already on our thing I live here Matt residents so you don 't have to do anything in that regard I mean our SMS is a permanent residence visa so if you 've already been granted they 're fine and well get that so that continues as normal so if you 've done a year they still have to see out the two years in the regional area anything that occurred prior to one july this year just remains as normal so just treat it as you currently ward that won 't change so just as you saw the our SMS cancellation provisions will remain anyway so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will still have to commit to the two years in the regional area I okay as far as we know dependent visa applicants will still have to demonstrate a functional level of English so that we think will remain unchanged so it 'll be just as it is now it 's just a functional level of English for the secondary applicants it 's only the primary applicant or the skills assessed applicant who is going to need to demonstrate against the new English requirement the government feels quite strongly about english and i think you know when you look at the reasons as to why they feel that that visa holders needs to have a high level of English is I think historically for those that have come in you know using a lower or whether it be functional English or even you know under the exceptional circumstances provisions you know might even be limited levels of English there 's been found that those visa holders perhaps don 't assimilate as well into communities that also they 're subject to a higher level of exploitation in workplaces and so forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's raising the bar in English they are the main reasons as to why yep yes in truth yep yeah gnosis yeah when they when you apply so when you put in the eoi they would under the skill requirement is the independent migration the skills assessing body and I 'm sorry for this is probably be confusing it 's a neck so it 's not actually our prop so they 're the registering body so for gsm visa applicants the way that they dint for nurses the way that they demonstrate their skills by providing a skills assessment which they obtained through and mac i think it 's more than an mac look at the registration as being as you know if this nurse have the evidence you know they can obviously work at the level of an australian nursing Australian workplaces but as long as they 've got to the skills assessment for gsm applicants they have to obviously demonstrate that they have that at time of EO I so when it gets to the point of actually the visa application being processed see if that skills assessment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at the date of the eoi so it would still be that it was valid at that date so therefore they would still be considered to meet yes your assessment only this is where it gets confusing i 'm actually going to run a session for health providers so i 'm not sure if you 've got the invite or not but maybe talk to me after i 'd suggest that you come because it is going to be a little bit different for nurses under the trt stream so if you 're already hear you 're sponsoring them on a 457 it 'll just be evidence of registration so that will continue it 's only going to be that direct entry stream they will need to provide a skills assessment yep can I be confident that they have had any voi they meet the criteria for yes yes yes yeah network absolutely and that 's a very good question and yes so the government is going to introduce legislation I guess what penalties almost so for those that you know clearly they lodge an eoi say they dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's actually found at the visa application stage that person doesn 't have the skills and qualifications that they said that they had potentially it will be resulting are not just to refuse or their visa but also potentially aren 't like bars so it might be that they then it will prevent them from applying for further visas for a period of time and so forth yet from the skill set some bodies completely apologists advise against many more times obviously know yes yes that you 'll find I 'm not sure how exactly it works really aquifers and they the skills assessing body but migration purposes is listed it 's in The Gazette all instrument so when you look at the skilled occupation list for example for general skilled migration it will tell you who the skills assessing body is so they provide they assess whether this particular migrant has the relevant skills in order to migrate the person will still need if you 're employing them you know as a sponsor they are still going to need to get the relevant registration or license in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assessed is being eligible to migrate but they 'll still they 're going to need to get the various registration or license whatever that might be to work in the relevant occupation obviously before they can commence working but that 's not part of no 457 guests it would be registration and license and for NS and our SMS yes it is as well but when you talk about the skill selecting the independent criteria it 's yet it varies depending on who the skills assessing body is yep operation yeah what the department would need to see so if you 're sponsoring under NS and our SMS they forget about skill select for a moment just say that you 're sponsoring someone from the health sector on one of those sorts of jobs dentist for example they need to add visa applicant of the visa application process demonstrate that they 're eligible to hold registration so often with some registering authorities they won 't issue the registration tool the visa holders on and Shore physically in front of them and so what the Department will need to see is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority before they go out the visa so then we grant the visa they come on sure they pick up their for dentists for example they 'll pick up their registration and they 're good to go so to speak so with that well the provisional letter it says it they 're eligible for so they still have to go through that registration process or service with opera they go through the whole assessment process it 's literally just a matter of doing an ID check and that 's what they wait for them to come actually physically even to you 've got a registration yeah they 're really they 're probably better off to go to the registration process first getting that provisional eligible to hold at us that you can see that as well and then they can also provide that to the department to show that they 're eligible to hold yep because it 's the same for nurses as it is for dentists yes yeah I know yeah but as long as they like that professional letter yep anything else it can be quite convoluted immigration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so yes yep yeah which I 'm sure we 'll see a few were those yes yep yes yes and I can still do that yes sure yes so correct me if I 'm wrong but from what I understand the processing area the way that they 're going to be treating it because they 're very much aware of this issue is that yes cavan july one you know it 's going to be as it 's sort of always is it 's essentially like a time of application with criteria that the nomination has been certified by the RCB so clearly with the influx that we 're expecting RC beads and already sort of suggesting that they may not be able to get through them all in time so in which case we 're saying to people that you can still launch it 's still a valid application even though the RCB certification will not be on it they 'll get placed into the queue as they call it so that will give a period of time I guess in which for the RCB to provide the certification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I roll if by the time it gets to the case off with his desk it 's a case officer goes to assess it and there 's still no RCB certification I think they potentially have to move to refuse that right yeah so and that 's been I believe there 's been a letter that has been sent to our CDs to clearly articulate this so there should be aware that yep any other questions as we 've talked about again everything as we said some of its still subject to change so you know you can keep updated by referring to any of these websites and I suggest that you know you all do that if you do have further questions as we said you can contact us or Jeff by the relevant email address there so clearly would be happy to answer any questions that you might think of later if they come up that I 'm otherwise we 'll be here I think for a little while so if any of you want to come and have a chat that 's fine as well the health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be happy to take your details to include you in the session I 'm doing specifically for thoughts provided but otherwise thank you so much for having us we really appreciate your time lovely Amanda and Caroline monster I think I said Katherine at the starburst and so I do apologize thank you very much for coming on to the session today we do actually have that type of education and we certainly are forward as well if you need can I ask you to thank Amanda and Caroline thank you good luck with everything you","(-38.1471348,

Geelong VIC 3220, Australia",998,we 've always had a moral conscience here at la marjorie bakery but we 're certainly no experts all we really do is try to make our business as sustainable as possible the early stages of la madre 's environmental journey really i was probably just curious just curious about the environmental impact that our business was having and from making those discoveries it sort of starts to make sense and and from then it was it was a really easy journey to take lava dre been operating for a couple of years before we started to get a curious about the impact that the business is having on the environment once i started to investigate things i was quite surprised at the impact a small business can have behaviour change was at the start and will continue to be a challenge for all businesses going through any environmental journey it takes one person with passion to make a change and once you change your own mindset then it 's really easy to convince others because it just makes sense and that behavior change starts to flow beautifully and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lemandre bakery because we use organic flour in all of our breads and we try to use as much local ingredients in all of our products i suppose that 's a good feeling knowing that we 're helping out the environment by doing these things the ultimate aim of lumadro bakery is to become a carbon neutral business so we decided to engage an external admissions auditor it 's really important from the start to get an accurate baseline so you have a good understanding of the energy use and this enables you then to work out where you want to make improvements in the last three years since we relocated our premises we have increased our production by 150 so we 've only increased our carbon footprint by 16 we started really small uh things like the way we printed documents to pay for purchasing recycling toner cartridges in the office and through that time we started to shift our attitude and into other areas of business and really continually ask ourselves was there a more sustainable way to do things currently the bake house is a certified low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to relocate their premises and the new building was three times the size of the old one but we didn 't want to triple our environmental impact so we started to have conversation with our landlord who was happy to engage with us and we were able to retrofit the building with some of our environmental initiatives it didn 't make sense to me to install heating in a bakery when we have these massive ovens so i wanted to work out a way that we could trap that heat and and warm the other areas of the building that get cold in the winter so i got onto the sustainability victoria website and found a heat shifter and downloaded it showed it to my builder and asked him to make it for us we looked at the roller door in our dispatch and storage area because we were having trouble with the temperature control and so we replaced it with this super thick refrigerated roller door and it 's really improved the temperature in that area but also the efficiencies of the building we installed double glazed windows in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the walls and in the roof space in any retail space good lighting is vital but it just doesn 't need to be expensive when we were installing our lighting at la madre we chose t5 energy efficient fluoros for our production area we don 't always get it right our first set of downlights that we installed were expensive to run and time consuming to replace so it made sense for us to change our down lights to leds and we 've also started d-lamping in some parts of our production area the great thing about lighting technology today is that it 's moving so fast and the costs are crashing down we 're constantly reviewing and reassessing our suppliers to make sure that all the products that we make are sustainable as possible but it 's really really hard to get a brush we started to look at our olives and we were originally importing them from grace and we found a fabulous local supplier based in grampians who make a biodynamic olive which was cheaper than the imported olive and a much higher quality but it doesn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we haven 't been able to find a cost-effective solution within australia so we didn 't do all of this alone we did get some outside help some online resources on ways to reduce energy and to maybe you know reduce water as well and we also got a small grant which helped to put some of the infrastructure into the new building the product that we 're really proud of is our hot cross buns they 're 100 carbon neutral which means that we 've offset the production the ingredients and the distribution so my passion has led me to study a diploma of sustainability at the gordon and now i 'm a member of future proofing geelong reference group for small to medium enterprises it 's really exciting to be a part of this project to reduce emissions in geelong so what does it mean for la madre well right now we 're in a great financial position we 've also got an awesome point of difference over our competitors this

football club it 's great to see so many local faces um like i said we 've got each candidate is going to have five minutes to speak um they can speak on whichever they whatever they like to speak about we will then at the end of the introductions um open up the four to questions so if we can save our questions to the end uh we 're gonna go in alphabetical order because um that way there is no bias in regards to who we choose to go first um so sophie you will be invited to go first um sophie uh is probably very well known for her pink bikes and uh is an independent candidate and i 'd like you to come up and share your thoughts with us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one so i 'm a little bit out of my depth but anyway we 'll give it a go i didn 't really want to be first but here i am um once upon a time in australia if you worked hard you could get anywhere today if you work hard you might be lucky enough to put enough food on your family 's table and maybe pay the rent or your mortgage payments what has happened to our once great country my name is sophie baldwin and i have chosen to stand as an independent in mali because i believe an independent best reflects those who went before us across this electorate independent people and independent families who could work towards progress community and a shared prosperity today australia 's progress and the australian story for the age the families the singles and our children has lost the plot shipwrecked on the corruption of party politics a system of snouts in the trough where big bucks are poured into the major parties from unseen industry mates and foreign investors australia has sold its soul and it needs to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community and agriculture politics was never really on my radar until i stepped into water advocacy and i witnessed first-hand what has happened to our great country my dad was a dairy farmer and i 'm proud to have been one as well i believe in australia and i believe in our agricultural industry which established our modern country and still underpins the success and wealth of many towns across mali the organisation i represent in in my real world job annually creates six billion dollars in agricultural production and yet we couldn 't even get the water minister to respond to a letter southern riverina irrigators are 1800 generational hard-working farming families families with proud independent histories who have watched their irrigation allocation reliability halve even though they pay licence fees in the tens of thousands of dollars each year whether they receive an allocation or not and they produce the staple foods that feed our nation rice grain dairy horticulture and livestock sri are a reflection of society but nobody seems to care i 'm a single mum and i have two daughters they are worried about their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nobody seems to care i 've spent my life in rural communities i 've been a dairy farmer and a rural journalist and i 've spent my life talking to people across rural australia and i do care i think we are all poised on the murky precipitates of party politics where the true rulers are powerful donors ruining our country i know it 's ruining ruining water we have a federal government which talks about building the economy yet still treats provision of early learning and child care as if it was optional babysitting in rural areas there is highly skilled workforce available if families have access to child care for the budget to offer funding for 20 day care centres just shows how out of touch they really are we could build 20 across mali alone and still not solve the shortage the city-based model of care does not fit in the country we have residents in towns right across mali who cannot access basic health care gps have closed their books or only come to town a couple of days a week often it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a specialist appointment and let 's not forget the expensive and long drive to access the services but no one seems to care canberra has allowed a privatised aged care system only the wealthy can afford but where people become extremely wealthy from providing substandard care we have long waiting lists for access to health care we face a mental health crisis amongst our youth in regional victoria most of our towns have nothing to offer not everyone bulk bills either making services in some towns out of reach for those who desperately need them we need investment in nation building infrastructure like rail roads and bridges the cost of living is out of control fuel is two dollars a liter or more if you can find a house to rent in regional victoria there 's a better than even chance you probably can 't afford it one minute thank you we don 't have anywhere near enough social housing for anyone let alone victims of domestic violence or homeless instead of a government investing in the long-term manufacturing technology agriculture research we have become totally reliant on imports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxes without access to medicare and that 's okay australia needs a federal icac government needs to be held accountable the country demands it and i support it as you 're independent i may never be in government but i 'm never in opposition either i have the power to vote on every piece of legislation the way mali wants it treated and i have the ability to present bills and legislations without fear of party politics i truly represent mali not parties not big business not the lobbyists and definitely not overseas interests i am your independent voice in canberra the only way your voice will ever get heard thank you thank you sir not too bad for just finding out you 're going first um you guys have all worked out claudia hanel uh a incumbent abortion rural city councillor uh an independent candidate and um third generation wimmera president i invite you to come up to the lectern thanks everyone for coming along tonight i 'd like to also thank my fellow candidates and our incumbent um and dr ann webster for being here tonight as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past and present and the land that we we stand on um so a little bit about me so i 'm a local government councillor just down the road in horsham we were a girl born and bred and have grown up here passionate about this area and i 've been concerned about politics i guess and that was the reason for stepping into local government because there are so many issues here in our community and i was just down here at the football club and nipple club this afternoon so thanks for showing us around and there are so many issues here on a local level that we can assist and help with from a federal perspective but most importantly i 've chosen to be an independent um i 've never been a part of any party or political party and i 've decided to be step up as an independent candidate because it is just those communities like we see here represented tonight that i would like to that for um and negotiate for in canberra i just feel that and with all respect to our incumbent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be very hard to tow a party line but we have had the same since federation so i think it 's really time for a change and as an independent candidate i don 't i 'm standing as a community independent meaning i 'm not backed by any big groups or self-interest or vested interest it 's just purely me backing myself in my experience as a local government councillor and also in my diverse experience working in very many industries over my lifetime i 've worked in the agricultural sector as a wool cluster in the wool industry in the wine industry as an advertising manager for australian vigneurons i 've traveled overseas i 've traveled around australia you know i 've have lived life experience so i think that 's something i can offer and bring to the table when representing you and i guess fairly importantly too people always ask me well what do you stand for and what will you deliver for us and and what will you do and i think that 's why it was so important that we came along to the football @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i think that i would want it 's more what the community says they want and things like expansion of local sporting venues where it involves um its health and well-being uh it 's you know it 's these are the these clubs are the fiber of our community you know it 's it 's when i hear that these are the projects and these are the things that people want take on board and i think if i was to be successful and represent you all at a you know federal government level in canberra on the cross benches we have that power to negotiate for sporting clubs and any other community concerns that i would represent so sitting on the cross benches as an independent for you for you the community actually gives you power because you can say to me these are the projects that we value this is what we want this is what we think is important so bat for us and on the cross benches we can just we can do just that so if there 's legislation um and various things that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negotiation and that negotiation power for you our communities within the electorate of mali so that said my door is always open um i 've got a website www.claudiahaynell.com.edu i have a 12 policy plan for economic recovery for our electorate of mali um it 's currently being revised due to the budget that we just had so um you 'll see a clear outline of how i see malik can progress in all the sectors from economy agriculture health all those things that are so important to us so please reach out i 'm happy to talk and find out what 's one of the specific concerns for all the communities here at mali and hopefully i 'll be able to represent you all in canberra thanks for listening thank you claudia uh next up is stuart king a united australia party candidate he is a third generation mallee farmer a father of nine children and uh a former engineer

after it looks like 10 000 hectares covered in 100 notes it looks like a stack of one dollar coins that goes round the earth 70 times it looks like what the nationals call getting it done now if it meant that you were driving on a freeway standard road network the national rail system was fully interconnected for freight and passenger rail services you could use your mobile phone anywhere and you had high speed internet you could get an ambulance when you needed it and it would take you to a local hospital and you would actually see a gp then maybe just maybe you could justify a trillion dollars of debt but you don 't have any of this you have around forty thousand dollars of debt for every man woman and child in australia and why is debt so bad because debt drives up inflation drives up interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither the liberal national government nor the labour greens alliance in their budgets last week offered a debt repayment plan just more spending and you can 't spend your way out of debt united australia party will release an economic plan for australia this thursday which sets out a definitive plan to repay the debt to manage interest rates to keep families owning their own homes and farms and to deliver nation-building infrastructure with sound financial plan we can offer real relief for rural people including a 20 tax concession for people living and working in regional australia this will stimulate growth in regional economies and facilitate the reinvigoration of processing and manufacturing industries in australia a manufacturing economy requires cheaper energy and we will find a balance between coal-fired nuclear and renewable sources to achieve this locally i will listen to represent and advocate for communities and the local councils who represent them the funding model for local government must be reformed so that they can actually afford to deliver the infrastructure and the services that you expect and deserve telecommunications roads rail hospitals health services water the list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governments all requiring actions which we will deliver and of course the united australia party will restore and protect the freedoms that our forefathers fought and died for what is freedom margaret thatcher once said a man 's right to work to spend what he earns to own property to have the state as servant and not as master they are the essence of a free economy and on that freedom all our other freedoms depend in that context where are we now a man or woman in many cases doesn 't have the right to work or do many other things unless of course he or she complies with taking a government mandated experimental vaccine with digital identity and a central bank digital currency we are but one step away from a social credit system removing your freedom to spend what you earn ownership of property will become out of reach for the majority and the government has allowed unelected bureaucrats to be the master and each and every one of you is the servant the united australia party will give you freedom from mandates master lockdowns we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work freedom of thought and speech not

infrastructure bank from which local state and federal governments can borrow for infrastructure projects to build australia and create jobs ending australia 's reliance on foreign borrowing asset recycling privatisation and expenditure public and ending public and private uh partnerships as we 've seen here recently with the murray darling or the murray basin rail plan which has become an absolute disaster i took the time to look into the project and what it 's achieved and what it hasn 't achieved and i can absolutely say this is the poorest example of how public and private uh partnerships for major nation-changing infrastructure can be undertaken prioritize projects including the bradfield water scheme and the bre and the clarence river diversion schemes in north queensland or makers and the iron boomerang the project bringing natural resources from our west across to the eastern seaboard and taking back uh materials from manufacturing back to the west this all can be done with a national credit bank and natural credit system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a postal bank guarantee financial services for all guarantee all deposits keep our postal services viable including licensed post offices lend and local lend to local and small businesses invest in local areas invest surplus deposits in the national bank of force essential regulators and health ladies and gentlemen we have a choice we can stay with what is what we 've known or we can go for something that 's proven this has been done in the past and we can do it again we can build australia and make it a great nation thank you ladies and gentlemen our last speaker is uh our incumbent uh representative of the seat of mali is dr ann webster a member of the nationals party she was elected in 2019 and is the chair of the standing committee for the communications and the arts the joint committee on human rights and the joint standing committee on the national capital and external territories your hands together for dr anders [Applause] good evening it is great to get to this time of the three year cycle back to elections uh you will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last three years most of it unexpected and managing that um has been a real challenge for every level of government the federal government the state governments and even local governments i think history provides us the opportunity to learn a lot of lessons and if we you know the old adage is if you don 't learn then you 're doomed to repeat the mistakes of history and i i think this three-year period has certainly provided me with many lessons to learn many opportunities to represent this great electorate of mali and uh to speak up for the interests of mali and the people of mali whether it 's business whether it 's charities whether it 's health whether it 's education whatever the federal government component is has been a challenging but absolutely incredible experience uh i want to thank the people of mali for the privilege that i 've had in the last three years there is much talk about the uh the fact that we don 't get what we deserve in mali what i want to do is talk about the two billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back of some newspapers shortly the two billion dollars that has come into mali uh whether it 's albuquerque bridge whether it is roads infrastructure across mali there has been a tremendous amount invested in mali and i 'm really proud of that and tomorrow i go and see the albuquerque bridge and uh really looking forward to seeing that bridge built there are many things that have not yet been funded that matter to the people who live here and i see our davis park um football club here and very very aware of that particular project locally and for those who don 't know i it 's my big stuff up in my three years is announcing that i 've actually funded it when we haven 't yet yet i say yet um so yeah look confessing that one not my proudest moment um the the work to support um business has been incredibly important i am very proud of the fta that has been signed with the uk that has meant again because nationals were in government and we worked very hard as a party to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who aren 't into agriculture which i find hard to believe here but anyway i 'm going to say it the ag visa means that unskilled semi-skilled and skilled workers can be brought in from countries that sign up to that and right now we have vietnam who have finally signed up and we have other countries looking to sign up and it provides a workforce that is desperately needed all over australia but particularly for mali you would be aware we have large swathes of horticulture in the north and many farmers have not been able to actually harvest their crops because they haven 't had workforce it has been absolutely dire and desperate with international borders closed and this is a huge sigh of relief for most farmers and they are absolutely looking forward to having a sustainable workforce going forward this is um the ag visa will be for abattoirs and other industries as well it gives a pathway to permanency and that 's been one of the serious lacks in our visa programs for workers the ag visa is um profound the other areas that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course is managing the um outcomes and the consequences of the covert pandemic economically australia is actually positioned well yes i acknowledge the trillion dollar debt i also want to acknowledge that this week alone commodities uh have been um stated to have been exported at 495 billion that 's incredibly significant in less than a full financial year it 's a really great outcome in terms of our oecd partners australia is actually doing incredibly well in terms of our double vaccination rates in terms of our death rates australia can be very proud and it involved every australian doing their part for that to be achieved in my office i look over this last three year period and there 's also been a lot of sorrow the covert closures the border closures have meant that loved ones could not be with loved ones who were dying or giving birth there were certainly a lot of tears in my office supporting people and getting some wins for people to be able to be with their families in those um last days and being able to get surgery that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politician thank you very much sorry i 've frequently been told that i 'm far too loud in the workplace but i apologize uh ladies and gentlemen this opens up the time where you the constituents of of this seat get a chance to ask questions we ask that you wait until the microphone is there because otherwise the people at home and the people in this room will not be able to hear you please if you have a question directed towards a particular person please identify them initially so they can hear the whole question uh i will open up let 's see do we have any initial questions oh there we go very quick to the draw thank you my questions to dr ann webster before the last election at this candidate 's panel ray kingston stood up as an independent he told us we had to get rid of the national party or get rid of this as being a safe national party seat or would continue to just be taken for granted uh and then the situation we found ourselves in is that the nil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shotgun mckenzie in her wisdom decided to dud that for us and have us miss out i was incredibly disappointed that as our national party member for mali what you came out to do was defend senator mckenzie as being entitled to do what she did rather than speak out against the injustice of us being denied who 's interrupting sorry guys if we could just keep the questions to the form of the question and if we could limit our calling out from the crowd this night will move much smoother death so given that why should we be supporting the national party uh the role of a minister when it comes to grants is well in fact every grant there is a competitive process uh and uh then that goes to the department the department determines which ones tick a box etc and then the minister has the final sign off what i was i believe i was saying at that point in time that that is her her right to make decisions that 's why she has been chosen by the leader of the party at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that under control i 'm pretty sure that was very early on in my tenure too is that correct if i got that right i 'm not sure about that yeah um anyway the the the thing that i would say is that i 'm very very aware of the nil grandstand and i have been advocating very hard for it um and you know i can 't promise anything because it 's not my job to do that but i am certainly fighting very hard for it um it 's been requested from the candidates that uh at the start of your question to identify yourself who you may represent or um just your name in general just to help out the uh the process thank you thanks philip next i believe we 've got one from the uh the new tigers football club yeah my name my name 's brett wheaton um questions to the panel and look thank you for all coming to neal tonight and representing it neil 's a bit of a regional hub and attracts a lot of people to this town a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employment and all the other things that come and people that do come and stay here they need recreation and as you 're all aware we 're actually giving you some information to take home for a bit of light reading our facility at davis park is very old very out-of-coated and is in need of a lot of love and care we 've unsuccessfully had five different opportunities for grants and just two reps before with the end we 're still seeing and i mean um richard mckenzie we were 82 out of 100 votes so we were very high up on that list and it was disappointing we did miss out but that 's an old story the new story is and that 's to everybody if you are elected to the mallee seat what are you going to do that 's going to help local communities like north spoiling club to be able to offer those facilities and have that opportunity to deliver sport safely in in our community town is there a particular person you 'd like to answer the question first no i don 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that all microphones are on there okay thanks for your question um and i indeed feel your pain um having been involved in a sporting club and still involved in a sporting club you know i 've i 've been in the position where we 've waited nearly 17 years application upon application or funding application once any application knocked back and and re-routed and all sorts of things so i absolutely understand your frustration and your pain fair to say what what i would bring to neil and this electorate would certainly see the the the implementation of uh uh infrastructure and development banks because this is where these things um get funded from important um uh hubs like this that maintain community welfare and health are absolutely integral in in the sustenance of of these communities that they 're in so i would absolutely say that funding comes from a different source that would make sure these projects are well funded and completed rather than being a squabbling match or or as you 've just mentioned you 're in a list and well that 's just that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'm happy to go i 'll be i 'll be brief because i 'm sure there 's plenty more questions um i have the benefit of being a councillor in swano royal city council i 'm leave of absence at the moment but i have to have some understanding of how local government funding works or doesn 't work and projects like yours that you 're talking about the the funding models simply don 't work um this whole grant process so much time and money is consumed with grants with with grants and by the time the money actually gets to the community group i don 't know what percentage of it 's been spoiling up along the way but it 's a hell of a lot i think a better model would be a funding model that 's based on somehow based on taxation or gst revenue the size of a municipality the population of a municipality and then some sort of correction factor for for need because at the end of the day what works in the country in the city doesn 't work in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doesn 't necessarily work for nil so there needs to be more equity in funding and i think it would be a better model would be that councils local governments actually knew before the start of their financial year how much money was actually going to come in and more money could be spent on community facilities if we refined this grants approval process thanks hope that helps i also think there 's opportunity to look at the way um shires are funded and particularly through the federal assistance grant that hasn 't been um [Music] updated since the 70s i think it 's a it 's a pretty old model so obviously there is um ways that they could re-look at funding shires not based on a on a population but um rather whether it is the size or things like that obviously too i think that there 's um community groups like neil here that that are combining a lot of their um different clubs together in a hub is is awesome and i think you need to look outside um also at the benefits of um that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know all those other things when you 've got an engaged community you 've got a thriving community so you know you shouldn 't continually miss out i mean if you 've applied for five grants you obviously really want your your um facility and and it 's obviously well and truly needed when you 've got so many other clubs supporting so you know i think you 've got to look at the federal assistance grant um and the way that 's funded to make that better for shires and thanks for having us out there today so uh i know that um that venue i was a massage therapist for the um horsham demons so i 've worked i 've worked in the change rooms there um and i understand you know what it 's like there on on a busy saturday and uh needless to say um you know projects like this are integral to community health and well-being they um bring families together they bring communities together they uh you know it 's important for the those that have been part of those clubs over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the young children young people coming through you know to to um find friends and build relationships and you know sport sports always done that for communities so and having been involved or being involved in local government i understand how competitive this process is to get this funding that said um if this is the priority for this community then if i was elected and was representing eu in canberra this would be the priority project that i would be putting forward and stating that you know based on what government is wanting to put through across the table legislation bills that you know this is the negotiation for this community because it 's important it 's the number one thing that 's come up when visiting this community so it would be something that i would definitely bat for because being here tonight i can see that it is the priority thanks hope that helps um what i would say is that you know covert hasn 't brought terribly many positives but one of them is the local roads and community infrastructure grants and any of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electrode is responsible for have told me just how incredible it is because it 's money that goes to the shire council which is untagged they don 't have to do x y or z with it they can do what they like uh councils have loved that they have loved that because it 's given them some flexibility the grants have um i think we 're getting a forward payment on those again soon building better regions funding has brought millions into mali building better regions and local roads and community infrastructure grants are both national party policies they 've come to the regions because we know it 's really important you can 't have funding based on population done work basically you know our regions need funding which gives them some flexibility fortunately you don 't need to get a new grandstand every couple of years and you know the shire council makes the decisions on the basis of the lobbying that have uh that has been made by community groups and members so uh it is you know from a federal perspective we absolutely prefer to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cream off a significant significant amount of the funding before they get it out and it 's not necessarily even spent where you you know from a federal point of view where the federal government says it should so that 's our preferred route as the nationals is to make sure more funding comes to local councils and then you know because they know what 's what 's important in the in the um region uh state government often doesn 't and uh federal government is not necessarily on the ground in terms of the bureaucrats in canberra who go through all the grants it 's the local council so it 's incredibly important that we work well with local council to be fighting for the needs that are presented by the community so from my point of view we just need you know we 're really keen to see that it continues that the lrci continues because it 's great for jobs it 's great for outcomes um and it 's great for businesses that provide the uh goods and services to make that happen hopefully that provides you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you might do in the future um i understand that you and many other sporting clubs and community clubs are feeling the same pain um having been a president of a sporting club myself still waiting for some funding of a hockey field 25 years later so thank you you 've dropped me yeah yeah sorry i 've got a question um from the internet yeah from the internet there 's a couple a whole range of them but i thought i 'd just throw in one or two as we to mix things up a bit uh i 'm a disabled person who has had my ndis funding cut by twenty two thousand dollars is anyone running prepared to back fully funding ndis with individual focused needs driven plans and that 's from our roseanne may online um just to be equitable i think we 'll go in the reverse order of what we did before yes thank you for the question yes we have a lot of inquiries um from people who struggle to get the funding that they need and the system is being upgraded all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um yeah just yes it 's an open-ended question so if anyone wants to respond call you thank you and thanks for the the question um i think ndis and the funding that is um that the model is at the moment with uh is really really needs review and this is part of my 12 point economic recovery plan and that is to future proof particularly ndis because right now that not all i don 't believe is sustainable it needs to be revised for instance a recipient may be eligible for a hundred dollars say just for instance they may only receive a portion of that forty or fifty dollars because the other fifty or sixty dollars goes to providers and assessors who whoever these middle middle guys are or all the middle companies and and the recipient really um is missing out so i honestly believe that it really needs to have some reform and it needs to be reviewed for it to be sustainable and we need to future-proof ndis for a lot of people in our community thanks for the question um well i don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't think i can really add anything much else either i 've heard the same stories so the nds model is is broken and obviously needs fixing so yeah i would agree agreed as with as my conversation with the grant system ndis aged care um the money 's a lot of the money is getting scooped up in the middle um by privateers private providers the system is broken and it needs to be reworked i don 't have much more to add to that other than um for this person online um once again i um i completely empathize with you i have my actually uh son here tonight who has down syndrome and we are in the battle of our life with the ndis and i cannot feel for the life me fathom why they are doing this why this system has become so broken i have to agree with everyone here that the system needs to be changed and the where where it 's managed and how it 's run and we have a plan and one of our points is is to deal with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your question online thank you guys uh i 've we 've got a question at the back that 's uh scheduled next um could you please stand up and identify yourself and if you 've got a question targeted towards a particular candidate for deborah nelson hi marsha um has had such a dramatic impact on our communities and still is i know in my community there are so many elderly people who are still scared to go out and are still isolating fairly well in their homes so my question is i 'd just like to know just a very quick answer on what every person thinks on vaccination mandates in keeping our communities safe thank you um so if you might go left or right to this next group response um as far as vaccinations go um i guess a lot of people have have have gone and got themselves protected against covert and done the right thing or if that 's i still believe that um [Music] essentially it 's your body and your choice um really i think it comes down to that most people have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah mandates i don 't think have um [Music] some mandates have probably been harmful and perhaps not delivered what they should have so um as far as mandates moving forward i think you know if you 're vaccinated and you 're and you 're up to date well you know your life should um go on and obviously yeah sorry that 's about it for me that 's a hard one for me stuart on simple and vaccine mandates it 's as simple as that if you want to get vaccinated get vaccinated if you don 't want to get vaccinated don 't get vaccinated let doctors do what doctors are supposed to do and restore the doctor patient of the sanctity of the doctor-patient relationship and allow them to practice yeah on that on mandates i don 't believe mandates should be the answer to our vaccination um outcomes um everyone should have a relationship with their healthcare professional and and let that relationship determine uh your decisions on how you um exercise your your your participation in vaccine programs so but mandating um as as as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um i 'm working in an industry that i 've chosen to be vaccinated because i enter into high risk environments like aids care facilities and child care facilities and i 've chosen to do that because i believe it 's the right thing to do but those people who haven 't got that option have become unemployed and the likes so that is not a good outcome it just highlights the crisis our medical health care system in australia is in if we had the options to manage people 's participation in vaccine programs as they would see fit then i think that 's that would be a better uh way to approach this rather than mandating thanks for the question um i 've been not in favor of mandates right from the early days fundamentally because australia has a really incredible history with vaccine with vaccines immunization and i didn 't believe that the government needed to put anybody 's arm up their back to go and get it i think that there 's been a lot of ill feeling in the community because we don 't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mandates and the pressure for people not to be able to work are appalling given how short we are on workforce all over the country um you know i have professional people who tell me that they 're not at work because they don 't want to get the vaccine mandate uh sorry the vaccine i 'm vaxxed four times so you know i 'm pro-backs clearly but i think people should have the choice um i think that the regulation that has been imposed on workforces you know you have to sign in we did it tonight you know i think we 're all over it we just want to get on with our lives and the more people get on with their lives the more it will give confidence to our older people who are feeling really insecure who are worried uh and who don 't go out my mother 's one of them uh don 't go out very often anyway and i think we just need to stop now we don 't do this for the flu we don 't all stay home we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home if we 're not we go and do our job yes this has been a hot topic hasn 't it keeping our community safe through covert and not having mandates okay so um it has been the toughest time that i can remember in our generation um these lockdowns and and what our and that the mental health and well-being of our communities but i think we do need to and i agree with um dr anne that we do need to progressively go forward now um you know we are coming out of this we have economies that we need to rebuild um and we do need to get on with our lives and clearly the electorate does not want government interfering in their lives any more than than we have to that said i do find it 's problematic because for those of us here tonight who have said they don 't agree with mandates and let 's just be clear i mean this isn 't going to be the last pandemic that we face in our generation i don 't believe so that said going forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is going to happen and what would you do if you were elected to canberra to keep your community safe in the next outbreak and i know i 've had this conversation with stuart already over the phone and you know i said to him stuart what would you do then if you were prime minister of australia and i mean i know that there 's the iva mecten option um i would actually just like to know what people 's thoughts are on this ivermectin option i mean stuart and i have already had this conversation so stuart maybe you 'd like to answer that for me because let 's face it this is not going to be the last time that we are going to have to keep our communities safe so could you help me out with that and answer that for the community thanks i 'm not a doctor so i don 't have the ability to prescribe ivamectin or alternative treatments however however thank you i 'll get to that um my point of view is simply that the sanctity of the doctor doctor-patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the health system have shut down doctors from having alternative viewpoints the only viewpoint they can have is vaccination the government has funded media to drive the propaganda of fear and that 's why the old people are suffering that 's why the children are suffering that 's why so much that 's why people can 't go back to work people are scared there 's people who can 't attend tonight because they 're not vaccinated now that 's not a crack at the hindmarsh shire council whatsoever you 're just following a ridiculous rule it 's as simple as that um the the um the research is in the vaccines are only i only have efficacy now for i don 't know something like eight to 12 weeks there 's research studies from overseas that prove that there are alternative therapies that work um uttar pradesh a province in india actually handed out millions of blister packs of alternative treatments because they couldn 't get access to vaccination and their covert numbers went down significantly so the simple answer is that we should let doctors be doctors we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how pharmaceutical companies are funded we need to look at the directors of our government agencies and how their research is funded because if you have a look you 'll soon find out how those people that sit as directors of boards unelected bureaucrats for government have a look you 'll find out where they get their money from and it doesn 't come from the government some of it does but not all of it um so we need we need to bring independence back not just into health we need to bring independence back into agricultural research into climate research the whole lot bring back some independence thank you stuart uh there 's a very patient man in front uh would you like to introduce yourself and ask a question uh alan malcolm hopkins dawn all right um look before i ask a question i 'd just like to point out to the candidates respectively that a number of the issues that you can was in your five-minute talk were actually state issues this is a federal election and uh some of the points you made were maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to federal government so please check that out now my question is is one i 've asked at several of these forums in the past toward the independence because uh independent sources will stand up and tell you what they 'll they don 't have party affiliations and they are they 're independent now we 've had the experience in mildura of two independents in the past 20 years who have claimed the same thing and uh have invariably turned out to be labour supporters put labour governments in so my question to you is basically if you are in a position to determine which side and remember you won 't be the leading party you 'll be one in a there are 158 to 170 seats in the house and maybe say there 's 10 or a dozen independents so you 're not going to form government but if we get a close election it may well be that you can determine which party is in government and my point to you is i would like you to answer honestly most of you will say i will wait and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or we 'll wait to see their policies this is not the direct answer we would like to know and i think people have every right to know that if you were elected as an independent but you had the choice to choose which party of the major party which you would support in government would you which one you would support as i said it 's uh historically if you look at the malcolm would you like the candidates to answer the question yeah well i just want to point out one point with it that the historically nearly all independents support labor or the greens and the second part of the question is why don 't independents stand in labor seats okay so claudia it 's a two-part question would you like the question of six parts in that question there we 'll stick to uh which of the major parties would you support as an independent and why have you not stood out no that 's one of the questions repeated sorry i think we 'll just stick to the first question in regards to uh because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question and that 's that 's fair enough you want to know what your independent that you would vote for is gonna do uh i 've always said that i would i 'm happy to sit down at the table and negotiate with anybody um and when i say anybody either party um or any of the parties that are in in government but right now we don 't even know who the alp candidate is there 's no greens canada i mean you know at this point in time we don 't really know the state of play in fact the election hasn 't even been called so none of us can officially really nominate um but the fact that we 're not in an actual party where we have to tow a party line that 's actually a cause for celebration that is something to be you know to to that is our power i mean on the cross benches we can sit down and sit at the table and negotiate what it is that you the community because again i don 't have any vested interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever it 's me i back me based on the knowledge of my communities my lived experience and what it is you tell me that you want so this is our negotiation power now if you have the same you 're probably going to get the same so at this point in time all i can say is we don 't know the state of play yet certainly i don 't know whether you know um independence back greens and the labors i mean i don 't know what the facts are there um but all i can tell you is that i 'm listening to my communities around the electorate and that is what is important and that will be what i 'll be discussing to any particular party that 's in power and that 's that is our power as an independent on the cross bench hope that answers your question malcolm um i just chose to stand as an independent because i don 't feel like i fit in any of the parties and i think if you really want to progress the country you need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all about the policy so for me so that 's why i chose to stand as an independent chris if we could limit the questions to people with the microphones then this night will move i wouldn 't put any and that 's why i was an independent so so malcolm i i am not an independent i am and we are an independent political party we are not affiliated or or give any of um our our political clout to any particular party um just so you know that we actually have had senators in the in in parliament um in the past and we continue to work with senators um in the parliament right now uh and as a matter of fact a lot of the the work that 's being done on some of our bills that are in before the the selling senate estimates committee i think one of our bills has been in before um we were working with a number of senators from from various parties fair to say they weren 't from um the conservatives or uh they don 't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would change the landscape of australian politics for the better the the major parties don 't want that they want they want this they want this oligarchical control and that 's what 's happening so to answer your question no i certainly wouldn 't be wanting to side with one of the two majors but i would certainly be seeking support if one of our points was to get up and they were interested you you uh you pick anyone who 's going to pick take your uh your your um your legislation on board or your your policies on board i 'm not an independent i 'm not standing as an independent so i don 't think the question 's relevant to me okay uh i will answer it just for content sure what i might do is open it up to yourself i 'm happy to answer it i 'm happy to answer it for alan um that 's fine um because you know at this point in time we 're we 're a minor party obviously our preferred option um is that everybody realizes the importance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number one and then we don 't have to worry about who we 're who we 're supporting and stuff like that that 's our preferred option is that we will form government second option that we win enough seats that somebody wants to come alongside us to help us form government third option we sit on the cross bench simple as that yep dr webster as a member of a major party question is possibly not worded correctly for you but um it would be of our interest to find out why you are a member of the nationals i think that politics should be about outcomes and politics should be about strength and it also should be using democratic processes i sit in the nationals party room at this moment there are 21 of us and we battle out the issues in the party room and we don 't all always agree that won 't shock you um but we don 't always agree and i am uh known bad or good to be a little bit ferocious in the party room about the issues that matter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for queensland so i 'm also fussed about queensland i am very fussed about mali and so there are disagreements that occur in the party room and it is a matter of doing all those political things that you need to do which is ensuring that you 've got the numbers to be pushing a particular issue forward that is the nature of politics and then the nationals party goes to the liberal party i.e the leaders do and they fight for the issues that we have raised in the party room there is actually strength in party it is not all bad sure i don 't get everything i want first to admit that i don 't get everything i want but i 'll have a darn good crack and if i 've got 21 others and ultimately the rest of the liberals to come alongside then that 's a huge win for us because we actually can make decisions we can change policy we can make sure that more funding for example comes to regional centers as opposed to in urban infrastructure so for me party parties are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength when everyone is shushed up and you can 't say what you want to say but you 've also got to have wisdom about what you 're going to gain for your electorate if you 're going to blow everybody up and not be in not be in government but be on the other side that 's not a win for anyone so it is a matter of this is why they call it politics i hate to tell you but that 's why they call it politics and um yeah you just got to work really hard thank you uh greg yeah we might do one another one online just to mix it up a bit this one 's from pauline mccracken who 's a local uh where do candidates stand on environmental issues and three things in particular climate change national park preservation and the barrier reef that 's me again i went right to left the last yeah i know that 's cool that 's so good um so climate change um is a complex issue um especially in regional australia um our economies are closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um [Music] has there 's lots of opportunities for mali with renewables obviously we need to have um infrastructure that we can actually put the electricity into that 's generated from those i think there 's real opportunity through agriculture to [Music] pursue environmental outcomes i think there 's a real opportunity around technologies that are coming there 's carbon sequestration um green hydrogen so there are opportunities that that agriculture um can help with environmental concerns um also i think particularly with agriculture we also need to invest in efficient supply chains and if we have efficient supply chains well then obviously which includes rail investment in rail you know we 'll reduce our emissions and and take some trucks off the road so as far as that goes um i 'll admit i don 't know too much about the barrier reef um obviously i 've been there a couple of times i know that it is in trouble but i also know there 's been some areas where there 's been some good um uh regeneration work as well so um i can 't really comment on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's national parks oh national parks um national parks i think could benefit from a different funding model and i think national parks should be accessible to people for some activities and um but i also believe that you have to respect our indigenous heritage within those as well so i do think that national parks need a um a um perhaps more of a collaborative approach moving forward i 'll go from bottom to top to answer those questions i 'm not over the issues on the barrier reef well enough to to pass comment on that the same with national parks not um not over those issues enough to to pass comment on that when it comes to climate change i 'm assuming um pauline i think it was to ask to ask the question if she 's referring to carbon emissions what it will say is that as a party we 're committed to investigating nuclear as an energy as an energy source nuclear has no carbon emissions and like i said earlier in my presentation we 'll balance between um coal nuclear and renewables when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to to climate change i think it 's important to note that australia accounts for about one percent of the world 's carbon emissions i think we 've got six remaining coal-fired power stations in australia china and india together have over 1200 another interesting statistic from a mate of mine who works in the energy industry is that in china alone they build the equivalent of australian australia 's energy industry every single year they add to it and the majority of that is coal-fired we want to talk about renewables let 's talk about lithium so to produce enough lithium for a car battery you need to mine 250 tons of ore so if you think of the mcg you need to dig a big a hole as big as the mcg to get enough lithium for two and a half thousand cars that 's some pretty bloody big holes that are going to be around the world the other important component of lithium is cobalt the majority of the world 's cobalt comes from the congo deep in africa where children as young as eight mine cobalt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the sort of future that you want if you care about the environment then we need to look at other other options for in terms of carbon emissions but there 's some hard start facts that you need to consider before we go on a headlong path to net zero 2050. thanks okay so um i 'd like to speak into this uh with a few points that um that uh stuart has also mentioned and sophie as well um but one of the things that we can we can do immediately here in mali uh in terms of uh i i know that pauline is about carpety missions firstly um we can uh and i have been talking to and by the way one of my children who has graduated from deakin with a bachelor of marine science um we have a a very robust discussion about um uh the great barrier reef in our house so i think i understand uh what is going on and and for me to sit here and think i can solve it is is is would be just misleading you um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get into that um here in the mallee uh we can uh adopt sustainable farming practices for um for farmers across somali from broad acre through to irrigated agriculture and horticulture the use of to help reduce the use of chemically uh produced fertilizers petrochemicals etc trying to increase carbon content in our soils and these practices would be in line with regenerative farming i don 't have any farmers out there at the moment who understand that i do i was a dairy farmer in the riverina and this is what we did on our farm 20 years ago and we found it was very very successful in terms of changing the biosphere and making things work differently and better by not using chemicals and not using fertilizers as as as we do highness fertilizer so that 'd be that 'd be one thing that needs to be looked at secondly i heard it uh mentioned about the trucks on on the roads well and i 'm just making uh going to malcolm 's point he brought up that um an issue that that 's a state issue and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the uh murray basin rail project but it is funded federally as well and and it was an agreement between the two the victoria and the federal government and also some private uh uh companies as well and what that was designed to do was one take all the freight which is now i 'm not going to quote the figures but it is it is phenomenal the amount of um product bit uh grain mineral sands uh containerized goods i think in the in i think i was just having a chat to someone the other day about that uh we 're looking at what four million tons of um of grain three million tons of mineral sands and some thirty to forty thousand containers going out of this region from from mildura around this region to the ports so the failure of of the completion or this project to even get halfway done has meant that this project is and this region the mallee is in a worse off condition or position than it was before the project was even started so what that means is we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are going to see thousands and thousands of b doubles on our roads on our b and c c-class roads and that 's why our roads are falling to pieces we are going to have trucks all over us because this project has failed uh in its delivery because it has run out of money so that 's just one two the points that i would like to bring up in terms of energy and carbon emissions we have no choice at this point in time we have to go nuclear we have to consider it and one of our policies is to repeal first the the insanity of the australian government to to uh have a uh uh prohibition on nuclear power even if tomorrow we said yes we can 't because it 's been enshrined in law that we can 't so we have thorium on our beaches to to produce nuclear power and we can 't we have uranium in our minds and we and we can 't even use it ourselves so we need to start doing that sort of thing and just a just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of carbon emissions that go into producing wind turbines solar panels lithium batteries if you knew the truth you would be disgusted we are told a lie thanks ben thank you um so many points great barrier reef the federal government has invested hundreds of millions of dollars into the great barrier reef and yes there is um a huge improvement in it the current situation needs to be reviewed but i 'll leave that to the research scientists in terms of the renewables in mali i 'm extremely proud of the investment of renewables in mali what has been missing as has already been alluded to is the ability to store when the sun isn 't shining and the wind isn 't blowing and one of the investments has been the solar hydro um piece in car warp up in the north there need to be many many more investments to make that viable i 'd absolutely take your point about subsidies as well it 's not just the fact that solar and wind is made out of products that aren 't any good when you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsidies and the subsidisation of renewables i think that needs serious um a serious look into going forward australia we are the highest solar roof top nation in the world in the number of homes that have solar and you know i mean that does make a huge difference we can 't upload our power at this point in time there is a lot of work going on in the interconnectors that are happening in victoria um the karang link the uh interconnector the west i haven 't got that name right but anyway that one it 's down south um and you know we don 't have enough gas in victoria up in our way there is no gas being mined here there 's no coal being mined here so renewables is what we can produce i have been a member of the parliamentary friends of nuclear energy from the day i stepped into parliament and i 'm very proud of that and we have to have a bipartisan approach without a bipartisan approach we go nowhere with nuclear so that is a work to look into moving forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't beat people over the head to say we 're going to go nuclear we need australia to come with us we need labor to do that as well so that is um i can 't tell you how many scientists i 've heard uh presenting nuclear energy and the safe options of small modular reactors all around the world including rolls-royce who make them um and where they are providing the cleanest energy available uh so that 's a piece of work going forward what was the other one did i do them all oh national parks look national parks are fundamentally a victorian state so i 'm not going to go there oh so much to unpack there thanks for the question pauline mccracken um well i just found okay so first of all um when it comes to the impacts on our environment um climate change action on climate change the science is out there i mean i 'm not the scientists same as we 're not the doctors when it comes to you know a pandemic but the science is out there and that 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical advice when there 's a pandemic and the science clearly says that you know we need to as a as a community address climate change now there are benefits to that from homes to farms to businesses i mean we have and mali is really well placed for renewables in fact that 's where part of our economic recovery lies um for instance there 's there 's orange in new south wales they have just finished trials and a test where the whole town was sorry the whole the whole town was energized um by renewables in fact they were able to onset they produced that much that they were then able to on sell it and make profit from that so you know there 's so much out there as far as science goes but essentially the government the federal government needs to have the funding to invest in these new ways and for us to go forward to be able to transfer that energy that we are well placed to create in mali and bring that back across the electorate so as far as action on climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that 's that 's what we need to um to look at and i know dr anne said that politics you know is about outcomes well not really well yes and no but more importantly politics is about people and you know we 've got a couple of three generations of people in our audience tonight so what is our planet going to look like if we 're not listening to the science for the people of the next generation um you know and again but again that 's what you want as a community if i was elected to camera as an independent and i was able to negotiate for you it would be what you would want as a community as for nuclear i mean you know we were up in arms about children working on for the lithium and what do we do with the batteries and all this sort of thing the elephant in the room on nuclear is what do we do with the nuclear waste i mean you know this is a massive problem do we just dig a hole and bury it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ocean and forget about it i mean there 's so much to work through on that but it needs everything on climate change needs investment from government research and development to get the right things for us going forward now okay and just just on the transport option we talked about um trucks and rail we have b triples going through our towns right now okay the roads are impacted we talk about yep let 's do let 's do rail and let 's get everything on rail that 's awesome and that 's great and let 's do that but the fact is um and again this is from my experience in local government the fact is that it is simply not viable compared to the cost of transporting something on a on our roads so you know these are all things that we have to look at but um anyway thanks for the question as for for parks correct it is a state issue and the barrier reef is important thanks thank you uh it turns out one topic more uh nuclear than uh kobe turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think we have one two more questions um we will slightly grow over time hopefully no one wants to watch the finale of maths but you can watch it online now down here we just can 't hear you because the microphone has uh ceased working um is it off do you want do i repeat pam kappa dimboola there 's a large number of independents probably going to be standing in the coming election and i suspect it is because people feel that we don 't have decent leaders in our main parties political parties that 's certainly my concern that we do not have leaders and politicians who are honest and genuine about their support for australia and so on so could i ask each of you please to make a very brief comment about how do we get decent leaders in our political system um if we could limit this uh one minute is that okay uh thanks for the question pam uh leadership is only possible if people follow and in a party you are selected to be leader because of your track record because you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can necessarily trust everybody who 's a leader obviously uh but generally it 's a democratic process within the party um in some parties there are factions and there are all kinds of other things at play we understand that but i think the first step is electing people who are honest who at least attempt to be honest and who do what they say and if you elect those people then they eventually build the party platform and hopefully make it into leadership um [Music] yeah look i 'll leave it there thank you chris for your for your question it 's a it 's a pretty deep question and and and um you are quite right um if you look over the the history of australian politics we have lost the statesmanship um of our politicians we 've had some wonderful and amazing politicians over history of australian politics and that needs to return and just highlighting what um uh dr webster 's just said that we need to um focus on strength of character in in our in our organizations and i know in our organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus on um the common good uh what is good for our communities their communities welfare and well-being and i believe those sorts of traits if they are in your organization will overflow into the leadership of those who represent you if if elected and i know that 's one thing that i do i i strongly focus on uh people and focus on what people really want not what they want a politician to do but what they really want in their lives and a lot of that stuff it takes a little bit of chipping away and that 's where that one-on-one thing with people in the community brings you to a point where you understand and that i guess empowers you to then be a representative i guess and a shining staff for those for all those people you speak to thank you chris thanks um yeah i 'll be brief i think you elect people who have real life experience and who have runs on the board in terms of leadership whether that 's at community level whether that 's at a lower level of government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high moral integrity moral standing and great character and then you will get if you had 151 of them in parliament house then you might actually get one decent one out of the whole lot of them thanks um yep i pretty much agree with um stuart as well but um i 'd also like to add that i think empathy is an important um characteristic of a leader i think strength is is obviously valid as well but you know you 've got to have empathy to listen to people so that you can actually work out what the problem is and and help to move it forward sorry uh claudia the question was why do we not have good leadership why do we not yeah thank you okay thanks for the question um yes good leadership well how would just you know back what these the rest of um the candidates said but good leadership essentially for me this is my personal um mission and point of view on it um you know in politics we you know i 'm not a career politician i 've got i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest through how it affects community but it 's true we want to see more not career politicians but real life people who 've had real lived experience you know i think as community we want to see people that look like us that reflect us and you know able to to stand up for us and represent us in camera but also it comes it 's it and emotional intelligence is definitely part of it you need to be able to you know care listen to people and also um i think a major part of this is actually vision you know we we can 't step into um representing you as a community without vision so you know you really need to find out what the vision is um for us as leaders and as i said i 've got a 12-point plan um i 'm happy to chat to anyone about that but need vision emotional intelligence be able to listen um and you know to have real lived experience and a good moral compass um that 's about it for me thank you thank you claudia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there i know there 's a couple more questions but the candidates will stay around afterwards i 'm going to hand over to the mayor in a moment but there 's a range of questions and comments being made online i 'd just like to indicate to the candidates if you want to go in there and respond to some of those we obviously haven 't got time to go through them all that chat will remain open and if you want to personally respond to them you can i 'd just like to hand over to the mayor thank you i 'd just like to thank everyone that came tonight and everyone that 's watched along we 've had a really good range of questions and it 's covered a lot of topics thank you so much to the candidates for your time coming this evening and for your informative answers thank you ben for facilitating the forum and as greg said there 's some light refreshments if those would like to stay around and chat with the candidates you 're more than welcome but thank you for coming [Applause],"(-36.3325565, 141.6509318)"

Australia",1111,[Music] good morning everyone and welcome to another story time online my name 's whitney and i would like to start by respectfully acknowledging the traditional owners on the land on which we meet today we acknowledge the traditional owner groups of the wimmera maui region the watchabolic yadwa yadu yali wurgai dripakul people their elders past present and emerging i think we might start with a song today we 're going to stand up and we 're going to shake our sillies out sometimes do you get a bit silly sitting down for too long i do ready we 're going to shake shake shake how sillies out shake shake shake our ceilings out shake shake shake how celie 's out shake our ceilings away we 're gonna roll roll jump jump at vehicles up jump jump jump our jiggles out jump your jiggles away oh that was a fun way to start everyone i hope you were jumping along at home too today we 're going to read celeste the giraffe loves to laugh and it 's written by celeste barba celeste was a friendly happy little giraffe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but celeste sometimes worried that she wasn 't enough it seemed like other animals did much cooler stuff look at hippo here could she be more like hippo why not give it a bash but when she jumped into the water she barely made a splash oh dear celeste tried to be a lion fierce and strong and proud she yelled but no one cared her roar just wasn 't loud that was a pretty loud roar can you do a loud draw at home do it celeste looked at the ostrich but then the poor thing found it really hurt her head when she shoved it in the ground ouch how about a cheetah she thought now that would be the best oh but after running 100 yards celeste needed a rest oh poor celeste maybe i could be a fish i 'm great at blowing bubbles but the bubbles they came out the other end which started major troubles oh dear swim celeste the kangaroo told celeste you really are not ready you can 't become a kangaroo with overalls and teddy is he just down here i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear cut but when celeste sat on her eggs she smashed them with her butt porcelain no matter what she tried to be elephant or snake or snail rhino or flamingo she seemed destined to fail the monkeys were so graceful swinging to and fro with ease but celeste was far from elegant as she crashed into the trees i may be clumsy but i know that i am very strong and i can reach more than others because my neck is long i can do so many things like grab things out of reach so i shouldn 't need to copy when i know that i can teach i don 't need to be someone i 'm not thought celeste the giraffe and so she began her very first class how to make others laugh oh look at them all everyone has a banana that 's a great book now we 've got another song and i 'm singing this one for someone that i work with because i think it 's his favorite ready the gloom flames the little green frog one day the gloom went the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day and the frog went to golf gloom but away [Music] oh that 's a fun song isn 't it hi everyone now we 're going to read one of my other favorite stories and this one is called the very cranky bear and it 's written by nick bland in the jingle jangle jungle on a cold and rainy day four little friends found a perfect place to play moose had marvellous antlers and lion a golden mane zebra had fantastic stripes and sheep well sheep was plain none of them had noticed that someone else was there sleeping in that cave there was a very cranky when the cranky bit run run row he gnashed his teeth and he stomped his feet and he chased them out the door so in the jingle jangle jungle on a cold and rainy day four little friends had nowhere warm to play wait a minute said zebra as she scratched her fairy chin maybe if we

the land in which we meet today i 'd like to acknowledge the five traditional owner groups of the watchabolic the yardwa yardwajali where guy and jupiter people we respect their elders past present and emerging now we 've got a really fun story for you today and it 's called all of the factors of why i love tractors i 'm off on an outing with mama today and not just down to the park for a play where are we going can you guess take a look i 'll give you a hint and the hint is a book hmm where could he be going down past the school and the pool and the shop i run through the door with a skip and a hop the library ah hello there frankie mcgee miss squid the librarian it 's a place where you 're not meant to shout yell or cry so i whisper back high as i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very big groan when i show her the book that i want to take home there are more than a squillion good books here to try why is it always those tractors frank why why thank you for asking i say with great glee i 'd love to explain why they 're special to me and all of the various glorious factors that make up the love that i have for tractors look at them all first four big black tires on wheels that can travel through huge muddy fields or across pits of gravel a rumbling engine a pipe that spits smoke a rake if you 're raking a hoe that can poke a seat for the farmer a wheel that she steers and a grumbling noise as she changes the gears levers and buttons and pedals to press trucks have those two mama loudly protests a little more hush thank you mrs mcgee the librarian calls use your library voice please [Applause] i say softly but mama trucks just cannot do all the things that a tractor can let me tell you a tractor has all different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plow to turn earth so it 's ready for seeds a sharp blade to chop all your troublesome weeds please stop says my mum i 've heard quite enough but i 'm only beginning they do hate small stuff you used to like trains my mother complains but then i got brigade bigger and so did my brains and i realized trains only chug around on a track how boring i 'm snoring just thinking of that police cars have sirens gliders have wings and forklifts have forks if you 're into those things but not one of those is a good enough factor to challenge my love for a shiny red tractor like an old massey ferguson what a machine or if red 's not around well i guess i 'd take green it 's a color of tractors made by john deere i know says my mum i 've been hearing all year what about ladders and hoses or planes with their wide wings and cute little noses cranes that are so tall they can help build a wall they can lift things up high they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is go around ah steamroller just sort of squishes the ground a mower for lawns is a big bunch of yawns and a trawler can only go trawling for prawns what 's wrong with tractors i don 't understand oh frank i am sorry but i just can 't stand any more books about them will these do instead cable cars submarines taxis a sled this one has rockets high flying in space well that one has cars driving fast in a race no thanks i say in my most polite voice but i think you will be very pleased with my choice i 'll lend it to you if you 're interested too there 's so much you could learn about what tractors do frankie yells mama hush says miss squid did you find something frank why

elephants escape but eric decided he better not do that looks like they 're going to make a big mess doesn 't it finally he had just the right idea he found a very very very very very big box he cut a hole in the top for a chimney and he cut another hole in the front for a door look elephants said eric the elephants looked they wondered it 's a house in eric just for you of course an elephant house just for elephants one by one in a long elephant line all the elephants went into the elephant house and when the last elephant was inside eric shut the door there 's not too many elephants in this

wanna hear something cool do it don 't tell everyone but my dad is a robot wow not the awesome futuristic type unfortunately apparently he 's an older model he doesn 't have laser eyes and he can 't fly with jet powered feet he doesn 't have retractable bendy arms or claws fridge magnets don 't even stick to him he can robot dance really well for an older model but i think he definitely needs some oil in his joints he 's not a totally useless robot i guess he does have x-ray vision see him looking through the bedroom window saying no jumping on the bed oh how did he know that he can crush a medal he can crush metal with his bare hands kind of crunch he can let off toxic stun gas at will pull my finger he runs entirely on leftovers he is a lean mean fighting machine with supreme intelligence and a variety of special features according to him he 's always working on inventions and scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's shed for short see him working in the backyard like most robots he has no actual sense of humor but he does try did you have a good trip oh see him tripping over the rock he also struggles with basic communication i feel like an ice cream you don 't look like an ice cream dad i 'm hungry nice to meet you hungry honestly it 's like he speaks another language can i have some money please dad that request does not compute you heard any of these at home from your dad sometimes i think his programming is completely faulty he totally forgets who he is maybe because he 's an older model what am i an atm what am i a garbage can what am i a tissue what am i a butler what am i a trampoline what am i a chauffeur what am i a personal chef what am i a bean bag sometimes he definitely needs to upgrade his power source his batteries are always running low more often than not i catch him in sleep mode like that time had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his batteries were absolutely flat can you see him flat batteries on the couch i thought it might help him if i made him a solar paneled energy helmet out of everyday items just right running around the house when dad saw it i think he was so happy that he must have short-circuited smoke came out of his ears he just stood there staring and he didn 't speak for ages i have to remind dad to wear the helmet all the time it must really work though because he hasn 't gone into sleep mode again it 's pretty fun having a robot for a dad even if he is an older model he 's robot dancing again when i grow up i want to be a robot too all right and that 's the end of our story time for today we 'll do our farewell song now and we 'll catch you all again at our next story time online now it 's time to say goodbye say goodbye say goodbye now it 's time to say goodbye we 'll see you all next week bye for now [Music]

Horsham VIC 3400, Australia",1987,i 'm pam cupper and i live at dimboola i 've lived there for over 30 years and i taught at horsham high school and horsham college for quarter of a century um and i suppose the reason i 've i 've prepared this story is because my specialty is the first world war in australia 's involvement in the first world war so this is sort of one of those stories associated with that okay so ernest robert newell was born at miniv and he grew up on the family farm there and when war broke out in august 1914 i suppose he thought he was still a bit too young or he other things were pressing so two years later in 1916 he then enlisted and he went to ballarat with two mates from the area as well wilf hewitt and linden who was known as lynn vaughan came from warrick nobel and all three enlisted in ballarat on the 26th of may 1916 and they enlisted in the 39th battalion which was had been formed in ballarat earlier that year and the people in ballarat really adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's war service as they sailed out of portfolio bay the writer commented the 39th battalion aif was on its way to the great adventure so earn and his mates arrived in england at the end of 1916 but he didn 't actually go off to fight at the front immediately because like a lot of other australian soldiers he got mumps so he 's in hospital for a few weeks and he didn 't get to france until early in 1917 and we know quite a lot about what his experiences were in england france and belgium because he wrote a lot of letters and he also put together his career in france and belgium so you can really piece together what he thought at certain times and he was a great letter writer he wrote in one of his letters that he left australia a few months earlier i 've sent several letters to you and commented that he was fairly lucky i have a few dozen since i landed here and three parcels and later on he wrote that he had received 21 letters in the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in february 1917 he wrote that he had declared war at last and he just spent nine days in the trenches on the western front and during that winter of 1916 1917 the australians were in what was known as the quiet sector around arm in tears northern france belgium and he wrote things in general are fairly quiet now although they might get a bit warm for us at times but it wasn 't if it wasn 't for the big guns there would be nothing to break the monotony of the affair but that was really a lull before a storm and in 1917 in early 1917 in that sector there was a lot of raids across no man 's land and raining parties would leave their trenches and creep out at night and the hope was that they would capture a german or two and they 'd be then interrogated for vital information about dispositions and reinforcements and so on and on the night of the 29th of may 1917 earn 's close friend lynn vaughan was wounded in one of those raids and he was hitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wounds were bad enough that he was returned to australia and then discharged as medically unfit in early 1918 so for him the war was over and the two remaining great friends will hewett and urn were about to really enter the fight and the battle of messine began on the 7th of june 1917 and it was a meticulously planned attack towards um the y sheet methane ridge and it was intended to be the first step in breaking out of the the front in what was known as the third battle of eep so and wilff were part of the 39th battalion that attacked on the southern flank and that was their first real day of going into a battle and this is how he described it on june the 7th at about 3 o 'clock in the morning the hell on earth was loosed we struggled up during the night through shell holes and clouds of gas to a forward position where we waited for the barrage to open at 3am it opened and at the same moment they blew up three or four mines in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair i can tell you we wondered what had happened for a moment but we looked over the bags and there were our lads swarming across no man 's land and in less than five minutes prisoners were coming back in droves and this continued all day i can tell you we were in our glory all went well and we 'd reached our objective by 10 am but poor old wilf was not there he 'd fallen just beforehand wilf hewitt close friend to earn and lynn and he was engaged to lynn 's sister mildred was killed in action on the morning of the 7th of june and his body was never identified and his name is now on the men and gate memorial in eep the success at messine led on to the planning for the third battle of eep and on the 4th of october earned took part in the first battle of passchendaele and again he described it in his career the first passchendaele affair was a great success we moved forward on the night of october 3rd as in the scene and at daybreak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fritz started his barrage first on us i can tell you i thought it was all up i thought we knew our they knew our game but when we hopped over the bags we soon found out that we caught him napping we cut him to pieces with our artillery the barrages did not leave a square inch of ground not rooted up the germans ran to us with their hands up crying like babies and muttering mercy camarade the first attack towards passchendaele was successful but a week later ern joined the attempt attack on to take passchendale itself and so he continued his description the evening of the 11th of october when we again moved forward to do what we call the second passchendaele stunt which was a blank we hopped over early in the morning as usual and pushed on and on to the passchendale ridge which we wish to capture but his positions were too strong for us and for some reason or other our artillery was rotten and that of course gave him a better chance to get his to play he was one too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position with him sniping at us and his machine guns going a treat there were men falling all around but i marched on with the old lewis gun on my shoulder and came out without a scratch now earn was really one of the lucky ones he 'd enlisted in may 1916 and that meant that he was too late to fight at gallipoli and he also missed out on the disasters at framel in the middle of 1916 and he wasn 't in the battle of the song his first action was that messine and that was where his great mate will hewett was killed and he emerged unscathed from the two passchendaele attacks he served in three major battles in 1917 and that year was the worst year for debts in the aif in 12 months nearly 20 000 australian soldiers died not just wounded died in one year from fighting on the western front and the towns and villages around here suffered almost unimaginable losses warrickbill had at least five local men killed at messing in a week and at least seven were killed at passchendaele horsham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone and earned survived all of that and nearly a scratch throughout his time in england um and france and belgium earn remained a son of the wimmerer his letters just resonate with comments about home and the seasons his ever-growing family back in minyap and warrick nabil in january 1917 he asked his brother fred i suppose you were well into harvest now taking off about 12 bags to the acre and under riley added a month later he inquired of his new young niece that he hadn 't seen yet how is pearl getting on i suppose by the time you get this she 'll be pretty near able to walk later he 'd written he wrote that he 'd received a letter from his brother and sister-in-law and was pleased to see that you were all well and able to go for holidays clearly there was one of the perennial mice plagues here he wrote you must have had some great times catching mice fred i can just imagine what they were like in mid-1918 the 39th battalion moved to the villair bretner area and on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he was invalided to england his wounds were not considered life-threatening and he spent the next five months in hospital at northampton war hospital and then he went on furlough in england so he was in england when war was ended on the 11th of november 1918 but for the australians it wasn 't the end of their time in that area they still had a long wait before they could actually travel home and his battalion like many other units in the aif was returned to france where they helped with reconstruction and earns battalion was sent to bullam corps which is a village just southwest of abbeville and it 's about 50 kilometers west of ammian near where urn had been wounded six months earlier and his letter that he wrote in january 1919 describes the main thing to do now is on this educational stunt there are lectures every day he described spending christmas and the new year with the village kids and he wrote that the battalion had helped french kitties of the village celebrate their first christmas after five years of war there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child in the village got chocolate and biscuits he noted that he was looking forward to having seen the three or four new nieces and nephews when he got home i didn 't expect that many and he was also chuffed that there was a nice litter of pups and asked if they 'd keep the speckled bloke for him he so looked forward to going home and to being on the farm and with his family again in february 1919 the 39th battalion left france for the last time and they proceeded to weymouth in england take their ship to australia and on board men completed questionnaires about their future in australia and urn noted that he preferred to live in the country and that he was a farmer but willing to work at other trade the ship sailed across the indian ocean and to stop briefly in colombo and a few days out of perth earned was admitted to the ship 's hospital with acute appendicitis and he died at 6 30 pm on the 6th of june 1919 and was buried at sea you,"(-36.7142554, 142.2016929)"

your own questions just by com commenting in the facebook under the video there so i 'll start with our first question from belinda horsham really needs another road bridge across across the river why is council planning another pedestrian bridge instead mr balor would you like to answer that question please thanks robin and thanks for your question belinda we need both a road bridge and also a pedestrian bridge the pedestrian bridge at the planned location in hamilton street will serve a growing community in that part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nice bicycle and pedestrian loop along the river for residents and visitors to the town council has developed an urban transport plan to guide future development of road network in ocean this plan has identified the need for an alternative truck route around horsham to remove the truck trucks traveling through the town which will also include a second bridge crossing of the river this truck road and the road bridge will cost millions of dollars and will have to be funded by the state and federal governments following funding announcement by the deputy prime minister last monday he was in ocean last monday the planning for the truck route and the road bridge is expected to commence shortly thank you mr bala we now have a question from brittany how can what can horsham do to attract larger musical festivals and big bands that don 't play shows at the sound shell because it is too small this would help keep more young people in horsham mr o 'brien would you like to answer that question please thanks robin yeah so at the moment we we 're quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park uh and we we 're doing some planning of the city oval sawyer park precincts and one of the key parts of that is to ensure that we not only plan for the future uh recreation sporting needs of city over but also look how we can create a better connection between sawyer park and city able for major events so with the planning safe so far we 've got some key uh input from event organizers to look at how we actually can enable those major event opportunities to come online uh improve the current facilities not only the sound shell but also enable better access to and utilization of city able so that we can actually get those significant major events music festivals to to horsham so that we can get our whole community particularly young people to enjoy the the festival on their on their actual doorstep thank you mr o 'brien i have a question from sharon some reports say farmers are getting a rate decrease and other reports say the rates for people on farms are going up by 10 percent what is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living in town mr harrison would you like to address that answer please uh yes madam mayor sorry i 'll just yeah so look rates are both a simple but also a complex and difficult thing to explain um but i 'll give it a go um overall council rates will rise by only 1.5 percent which is the minister 's minister 's rate cap but what happens with an individual 's rate um will depend on very much on what their own individual property values has done with respect to the average so if your value um this is your property value rises more than the average value across the whole municipality then your rates are going to rise by more than 1.5 and vice versa if you if your property value doesn 't rise as much as the average then you your your rates will go down so for farms this year um their property values have risen on average by 27 so that 's a significant increase for farm values in in one year 27 increase for farms compared to residential values which only rose by 4.5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the farm rates um then what would have happened is farm rates would have risen by around about 18 and residential rates would have fallen by three percent so in order to balance that what council did or has proposed is to adjust the farm differential which is um giving the farm sector a further 8 discount which means that on average when compared back to last year 's budget the farm rates will go up by 10 and the residential sector will go up by 3 so effectively what 's what we 've done is we 've given a larger discount to the farm sector and that discount has been passed on to the residential sector but even after that additional change in the differential the net increase of farms will be seven percent more than than residential sector so it 'll be the 10 increase less the three percent increase so the difference uh between the farm and the residential sector is a is a seven percent increase more i did say it 's never straightforward but hopefully that explains it and we 've also proposing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 240 dollars which also is going to benefit every household who pays the municipal charge so thank you mr harrison and it is incredibly complex um being new to council i certainly have um appreciate the challenges that uh that we have in balancing the books um we now have a question from bruce where is the rural road network plan at nothing seems to have happened for over a year mr martin ah thanks robin look that 's absolutely correct nothing did happen for a year in about march of last year we had a series of meetings across the municipality at which we were going to seek input from our rural ratepayers into the rural road network we had to cancel those consultation sessions because of covert but just last week we have now held eight initial sessions across the municipality we 're conscious that those sessions may have clashed with cropping for some people so we over the next couple weeks we 're going to do some follow-up engagement which will be well advertised what we 're going to do is compile the feedback that we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at something based on the initial input we 've had from farmers and other people within our rural communities and we 'll provide an opportunity for people to have input into that work as i say over the next couple of weeks thank you mr martin uh we now have a question from craig what is happening to development parkland in horsham north and in particular the old rail yards mr o 'brien would you like to address that question please thanks robin and thanks craig for your question the um we just first i 'd refer in the first is the rail corridor so uh since 2016 we 've had a plan to redevelop the railway corridor and look at improving open space in that area um one of the key issues there is that um because of the um some of the contamination issues within the rail corridor uh sort of north of the railway station uh vic track actually has to complete some cleanup um requirements around uh remediation uh as a result of an epa notice which they need to do by the end of next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's put on hold our um even though we 're still having ongoing discussion with vic track uh around getting that um particular rail yards redeveloped so we really can 't read about those rail yards but obviously they need to be remediated and then we need to work through through uh to look at how we can actually um take on some of that um that land and then redevelop that for public open space that certainly council 's intent so uh we 're very mindful of it but um we need to ensure um that big track does what they require to do as far as the cleanup notice in the first instance so we can improve public cabinet space along the railway corridor uh in other parts of washington north we are mindful through our open space step strategy that um some of the open space throughout the horsham north needs to be improved so uh we 're wanting we will be looking at committing some funds to improve out the playgrounds and so forth there 's also been a fair bit of work done in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there and but we are mindful that we need to um improve um various um open space areas across horsham north so that 's something that um we 'll be looking at to rolling out over the over the coming years thank you mr o 'brien we now have a question from billy are we any closer to getting a bypass mr bala thank you robin and thank you for your question billy the bypass of porsche as was previously proposed by vicroads had few issues it was going to bypass only the traffic along the western highway we need a solution which also addresses the truck traffic along the other three highways which uh traverse rosham the vimra highway and the henty highway with a huge price tag the bypass of portion is unlikely if not impossible for many many years the urban transport plan this council has developed which i mentioned earlier instead focuses on an alternative truck route which can divert all through truck traffic around ocean the truck route will hugely increase the safety and ability along the existing highways to the town and the cbd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much sooner thank you mr bala we now have a question from fletcher why can 't we build a ring road at curran road and a second bridge over the river to bring all the trucks out of town they can rejoin the highway at the caltech 's roadhouse mr martin would you like to comment thanks madam mayor uh and uh our ceo cinel indicated an earlier answer to a question that uh earlier this week there was a funding announcement for the study of the alternative truck route that came up in the previous answer as well so we 're keen for that study to proceed as an input to that though council doesn 't have a predetermined view on where the best route for an alternative truck route would be so the the route that the fletcher suggests is i anticipate one of a number of options that will be considered as part of that study we don 't yet know the timing of that study the funding 's only just been announced this week so we expect to hear more on that fairly shortly thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what about spending a bit of money out at haven as it 's beginning to be our biggest growth area mr o 'brien uh thanks robin and thanks craig good question so we 're well we 're we 're very well aware of the um the growth weeks uh around haven uh we 're actually uh in the process of developing a structure plan for horsham south and uh uh it included in fact by the time we it 's quite a significant planning exercise but tommy worked that through and part of that is to clearly articulate what that future growth looks like uh through that area and then how that informs what uh facilities um open space um access paths and so forth transport connections through that whole portion south um what the structure plan has identified is that we need to improve community facilities particularly uh at haven and so we actually get undergoing a precinct planning exercise at haven uh we have done some works recently on a on some better car parking in around the school there and there 's still further line marking works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually having quite some discussions also with uh various user groups of off haven so it also includes looking at the um currently the community hall and seeing uh what the future needs are and making sure that we plan for those future needs and develop the facilities to meet those needs so uh certainly um quite aware of of the growth we expect for haven and uh we 're working through what that will mean for the community and therefore looking at getting some plans and some development up some designs and so forth around facilities that will meet that future community name right thank you mr o 'brien we have a question from david is the 1.5 rate increase due to the councillors giving themselves a pay rise mr o 'brien would you like to speak to the budget please so i think that is going to graham so um beg your pardon i met mr harrison i 'm sorry that 's quite all right madam mayor look certainly not the um the 1.5 rate increase um generates around about close to nearly 400 000 um councils got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 80 plus services um we 've got a total budget of nearly 60 million dollars uh the extra costs associated with paying the councillors at the at the the top of the allowance band is around about fifty thousand dollars so it certainly has not been the reason for the one point five percent rate increase thank you we have a question from jacinta congrats on getting the nature and water play park when will it be finished and ready to use mr bala thank you robin and thank you for your question the center works on the nature and water play park i plan to start in september with the expected completion in december 2022 so it will roughly take us 15 months to finish the project thank you mr ballard there are all the questions that were pre-submitted and i no and there 's no further questions have been asked so i 'll just do a quick run around and see if there 's anything that um any of you would like to to add to tonight 's session before we um we say thank you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more from me robin okay thank you i 'm mr martin uh look thanks man man there 's just one thing i 'd like to touch on and that is we 've got a bit of a change to the nature of our road program this year we 've been looking at ways to improve the the cost effectiveness of our program which i 'm sure is of interest to our ratepayers to ensure we 're investing wisely and we 've been using technology such as laser sensing of the roughness of our road lengths our sealed roads traditionally what we 've done is when we 've had a problem with a section of road we 've normally worked on sections of road in rural areas that might be a kilometer or longer and reconstructed the whole section at one time but with this laser data we can now break the road system up into 20 meter lengths and only actually fix the sections of road that are in the rough conditions so hopefully that means we 'll be able to get around to a greater number of rough sections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and really address the hot spots that many of our rural roads users talk about to us um on a regular basis so that 's one of a series of measures that we 're trying to put in place to make the dollars go further madame thank you mr martin now i 've had um a few people comment on the auto seal um article that was in the weekly advertiser today would you like to comment on that too yes indeed madame and that 's part of the trial of a few different things to as to improve the cost effectiveness of our of our program the otter seal ota is is a different technique from normal road construction it 's only suitable for what have been traditionally gravel roads with low to moderate traffic levels is not suitable for higher traffic roads but it 's a cheaper form of putting a seal on which according to experience in other areas could be cheaper than maintaining a road as a gravel road in the long term so we 've recently done two pilot sections we 're calling them of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a lengthier section in plush hammond 's road out at lower norton so that provides now an all-weather sealed surface it 's only in the early days so people be aware that there 's loose stones here at present it doesn 't look like the finished product yet but it creates a potential for us to as i say reduce our long-term maintenance costs and help make the dollars go further with our road maintenance program so early days we 'll monitor that over the next six to 12 months and see how it goes and if it proves effective then we should be looking at doing some more of that terrific thank you mr harrison is there anything that you 'd like to add about the budget that we haven 't already covered yeah i suppose i 'll just um just generally around the process obviously the um as i mentioned before the the budget is a you know a 60 million dollar budget um there 's a lot to it there 's a lot of complexities a lot of different programs and and services that we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is encourage people we we 're going to have a um a drop-in session if someone wants to ask some more detailed questions um we haven 't actually locked those dates and timing times in yet but it will be um an evening and a lunch time um in the next couple of weeks so if we um if you have a burning question that you want to sort of get answered in more detail then i 'd i 'll be look out for those dates and encourage people to come along and and ask more detailed questions when um officers will have time to respond the other thing obviously around the budget is people can make a submission so there is an opportunity up until uh 5 p.m on the 7th of june for people to make a submission they can make that submission by going to our website and having a look at the have your say page and under that you 'll see the budget 2122 and there 's a link there to a a simple little form that just asks for a for you to complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the budget or on the revenue and rating plan you can also just simply write us a letter and the details of that on the website but it 's basically sending it to council support here at the civic center roberts avenue or you can um also do it via email as well to council at hrcc.vic.gov dot ayu so there 's a few ways that people can make a submission and we 'd certainly encourage people to do that you can also be heard by council on your submission so if you want to do that you can mention that and we will hear uh submitters on the wednesday the 9th of june um and then um council will consider all of the submissions over the the couple of weeks basically before we adopt the final budget on the 28th i think it is of june is the council meeting date so that 's sort of broadly the process for the budget um and i suppose just while i 've i 've got the opportunity the other thing that links into the budget is just is the community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a campaign running now for a number of weeks called horsham talks where we 're trying to get as many comments and views from people from all sectors of the community young and old and no matter where you live um so there 's opportunities again on our on our website to sort of to just do an online survey it 's a quick five question um an answer survey on the on the website all that information will come together and be fed into a community panel which will help well the community panel will will provide us with a community vision for the next 20 years and they 'll also provide input to our other key planning documents being the council plan asset plans and long-term financial plans so there 's a lot happening but in terms of the future direction of council and the and the budget and those documents are really key in setting the strategic direction so i 'd encourage people with sony open for another uh only open until sunday so you 've got till this sunday to um to get in and and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are open until the 7th of june thank you thank you mr harrison and i spent a couple of hours in robert 's place today talking to residents passing by about the budget and last friday we spent about four hours i think down in robert 's place talking community vision and it was fabulous talking to all different people all different ways right um walks of life all different age groups demographics it was terrific and i certainly encourage people to have their say as well mr o 'brien is there anything you would like to say in closing nothing further robin thank you madam me if i may i just see that uh craig from i think he 's interested in haven um didn 't necessarily hear the response earlier to his question he might have joined us late so i wonder if we can have the question about haven asked and answered again to help cry out certainly mr o 'brien so yeah so craig thank you for your question uh we are doing uh a lot of work in uh haven particularly also our portion south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mindful of we 've got a very good understanding of what we see as the growth in autumn south and uh and we 're also doing some precinct uh plan at home we 've just convinced the process so to meet some of those future needs so uh we uh and recently there 's been some upgrades to car park at haven so uh we we are aware that um we need to meet um some changing needs with haven and uh we we 're well advanced now with our planning around what we need to provide for that community into the future thank you so i 'd like to thank um sego sunil and john graham and kevin for our directors for joining me here tonight thank you to the community members who 've sent in their questions and to all of those who 've taken the time to watch i hope this has been informative and as mr harrison said we 're going to have a couple more opportunities some drop-in sessions in the next couple of weeks for residents to call in and have a have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it takes many months to put together and it 's incredibly complex so happy to come to welcome anyone to answer their more technical and detailed questions so thank you very much and i wish you a good evening,"(-36.7142554, 142.2016929)"

just like to welcome um councillor robin galen our mayor and she can just do a little welcome for us thank you susan and welcome everyone before i start i 'd like to acknowledge the traditional owners of the lands on which we all meet and pay our respects to elders past and present um thank you for joining us today um community grants are such an important part of council 's budget and program and it 's our way of helping the community to help themselves so some of the groups in the past have used this money to upgrade their own facilities or to bring programs to the community in the last financial year council donated 255 000 to 17 not-for-profit groups they were sporting groups kindergartens local hall committees and a range of other local community groups and events so we certainly look forward to seeing um a diverse range of nominations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that now and i hope she can answer your questions now or if you have further questions she will be available and her contact details will be made available for you to contact her so thank you one and all and over to you susan thanks thanks roland um the other person i just wanted to introduce is mel janeski that you can see on screen so mel is the other part of my uh community grants team and she 'll be the one that you most likely speak to if you first call council with a query about your grants so mel 's there um and can can take your queries also um we 'll have some question time at the end of the presentation so if you 've got anything specific to your project we can have a quick chat about it then which would be great so what i 'll do now um i will just share my screen and we 'll do a quick run through of the the grant guidelines um so we 'll do that first then we 'll have a quick look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assessment criteria at the end so i 'll share my screen and hopefully you can all see that okay oh we 've got some more people i 'll just let them in [Music] hopefully we 've got a few more there now we 're still waiting that 's for one more right hopefully we 're all in and can see that uh and mel if you just remind me if you see anybody else waiting that i haven 't noted and also just to the to people that have just joined us just to note that we 're recording this session um so that we can pop it up on the website and people can look at it um later on after this so welcome everybody the the community grants program for 2022-23 is now open grant applications will close on the first of march so there 's about two more weeks and the best way to apply is online and we 've got a link clearly online it 'll be easy for you to step through that if you do require some assistance you can contact mel and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form so basically just running through the guidelines um mayor robin touched on why we do this program it 's basically um council 's way of helping not-for-profit groups to improve the facilities that they work in and provide activities for the rest of the community it 's helping them help themselves and it 's a really important part of our annual budget we some general information on the guidelines we have a maximum grant allocation of ten thousand dollars um but i should say that most of our or the majority of our successful applications range between 500 and 5 000 we may fund one or two very large grants each year but a lot of them are smaller than that and also just to note that you 're encouraged to include some cash and or inclined contributions to your application it will just ensure that you know you 're very committed to the project and that it potentially scores more highly uh once again just noting that the applications close on the 1st of march and very important date is that your project must commence sometime after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30th of june 2023 so basically this grants program is for the 2223 financial media and just highlighting there that our community grants team which is basically mel and myself can be contacted on the general council phone number of a 538297 now every year the grants priorities are targeted towards our key strategic planning documents of council and they 're listed on this page as being the council plan community inclusion plan the innovate reconciliation action plan the use strategy and our aged care sorry our age-friendly community implementations plan so on the next page when i flick over you will see that these are our key funding priorities and it is important to have a careful look at these and review them because you will be asked in the application form to tick as many as you can of these priorities that your project supports or is in line with these have changed and i 'd like to just spend a little bit of time on that they 've changed from previous years so if you 're used to seeing the old funding priorities these will look a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um 2021 to 2024 and they touch on a range of key priority areas for council the first two values and respects the culture of our first nations people and improves first nations health and well-being so that 's a new new two new categories related specifically to supporting our first nations community then we have provision of accessible inclusive safe and welcoming spaces supporting tourism and events and this is still a very important one for council as we come out of covert to support the reactivation of events where we can assist addressing family violence alcohol and other drugs tobacco and gambling harm supporting gender equality improving mental health and social connection encouraging participation and diversity in sports events arts and culture i imagine that will be a fairly common one that most groups will take child and youth initiatives support social inclusion and positive ageing for older people looks at something that looks at innovation in new technologies in our community supports adaptation to climate change and reduction of emissions and supports protection and conservation of our natural environment and if you 've got a project that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of those please feel free to still apply tick the other box and provide some details and i do encourage you to tick more than one box and we 'll have a look at those in the application form shortly on to the next page who can apply basically you need to be a not-for-profit group um you need to have the endorsement of all user groups within your facility and also if your facility is on crown land you do need there is a new specific requirement that you need that crown land approval before submitting your application and to submit that documentation with your application so that will impact quite a few of the groups that normally apply because a lot of those groups will be in if not council buildings that are on crown land they 'll be on other buildings that are on crown land managed by delp so it is very important that you do seek that approval from delp to in to apply for funding and it 's really related to where your project is external works to a building or the grounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know buying a new tv for your hall that doesn 't it doesn 't require any modifications to buildings then there 's no need it 's only really we 're looking at where there are building modifications or fencing or external landscaping that has some impact on the crown land itself and i can answer any questions about that later if you have some uh some other key things your project must include direct benefits to residents of our municipality so we 're looking for projects of being undertaken within horshams the horsham municipality and a benefiting residence within this municipality uh you must be an incorporated body um if your application is for more than one thousand dollars in a grant if uh you 're not and you 're applying for more than a thousand dollars you can have an auspice body handle your ramp which this just means that you find someone who is a not-for-profit group that 's a little bit larger and is willing to manage your grant funds for you so we would pay the grant fund to them you they would purchase your items @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that moving on to the section all the applications should include and these are just some of the key requirements and i 'll just run through them again quickly the details of what you want to spend your grant funds on some indication of the funds that you 'll put towards a project yourself some estimation of of your in-kind support if you 're doing any volunteer labour on your project an important one is if you 're asking for funding for an item of equipment or an item that you 're going to purchase that is greater than one thousand dollars you will need a quote for that item and we have every year we have applications that might have multiple items you only have to include a quote for the individual items over a thousand dollars um oh sorry i 'm mark that up there moving on um you will if it 's a large application and you 're putting in a lot of money from your own organization of more than five thousand dollars we will ask you to attach your latest um audited financial statements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last two points on this section that you need to have all endorsement of all groups that use your space and the crown land approval oops once again so the the ineligible projects the one people that can 't apply just very quickly uh you can 't apply if you 're an individual or you 're a private or commercial business the committee grants program doesn 't fund organizational operating costs so we can 't reimburse you for the cost of your wi-fi or your um sec or tel tell telstra we also won 't fund groups that have not expended an old grant so if you 've got any queries about that it 's probably worth uh talking to mel and myself directly about that just to make sure if you 've got a grant that you haven 't managed to spend for two years then you probably need to have a chat to us about that before you apply if it 's just relating to the program that we 're currently in which is 2122 that 's fine you 've got until june 30th this year to complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project you 've already commenced so that 's really important we can 't back date if you 've already installed for example an air conditioner in your hall um because it 's warm now we can 't back date the grant application and fund that retrospectively so your project will have to commence after first of july so that 's after the council have um approved the annual budget and then be completed by the following june 30th uh you we won 't look at projects that need ongoing funding from council you do need to get your application in on time by the first of march we also look at we don 't fund projects that are the responsibility of another sector of government and that probably um relates a lot to school projects um or hospital or health related projects projects that are funded in light in a to a large extent by other sectors of government we also don 't look at funding religious assets or where there 's a clear duplication of existing services just some other key issues to be aware of if you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have um or give consideration to planning and building permits and i would suggest talking to councils buildings area very early on if you haven 't already done so you 've only got two weeks because basically you you may have to fund a building permit and that will be part of your budget for the project and you just need to be aware of that and factor that in uh we do like where possible to um for you to acknowledge council 's assistance with the project and that just also helps to [Music] promote the project in an ongoing way for future rounds just to also note that the council may only allocate part funding for the project the project 's always over subscribe the program so unfortunately we can 't always fund every project or to the amount that you ask for and i 'll explain that a little bit more when we look at the application form and then once again the reminder about the crown land approvals so just on to the last page the applications will be assessed on an on a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the top of this page so we look at the level of contribution that your group will be putting towards your project we also look back at the level of previous assistance provided by council for groups over the past five years so if you got a a large grant last year as part of community grants program please feel free to reapply but it will mean that you perhaps don 't score quite as highly as someone who hasn 't received a grant in the last five years so we do look at that equity factor we will look at how well your project supports council 's priorities and we will look at value for money in terms of how many people will be impacted by the project in terms of membership or users or benefits people that benefit from the project and a new one just to probably highlight this year is that we will be um [Music] looking specifically at projects that support diversity and inclusion so really support in a practical way um members of our community that that have difficulty um being involved for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question on the application form this year that we 'll have a look at shortly notification of outcome it 'll be towards the end of april this year or early may that you 'll receive an uh notification of whether you 're successful or not if you 're successful also how you go about claiming your grant so i won 't go into claiming the grant in any detail because it 's on the website and it 's also will be included in your your letter of outcome and also you are required at the end of your project to report back via a very simple online one-page report um just letting us know that your work 's done and where possible providing us with a photo which is always handy for future um use so probably one of the important things is how to submit your application so the method we prefer is online and you can go in via the link on these guidelines or just simply from the front page of council 's website and you can fill that in you can also fill out a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at and you can email that into council or you can fill it in as a hard copy post it into council or deliver it into the civic center customer service area so there 's a number of different ways you can do that and then finally if you if you need to know more or you 've got any questions please ring up and talk to mel um in the first instance um on that general council number and she 'll be able to help so i will stop sharing that now and i 'll be able to see everybody which is um excellent and welcome for all those that popped in halfway through that and i apologize if you if you 've missed any um anything but we will have the full um video or recording of this on the website so you can go back and check if you if you need to so having shared the guidelines i 'd now like to quickly run through the application form which is your other key document and i 'll just share my screen to grab that so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and i can see your new nodding so that 's good i 'm showing you the word version of the application uh it does look slightly different to the version that you 'll see online but all the questions are the same so i 'll just scroll through this and note anything that 's important um so you 've got your applicant details which are quite um which are fairly standard once again just emphasizing here that if you 're a small group who 's not incorporated um you may need an autism or a not-for-profit group to apply on your behalf and and handle the grant funds on your behalf and i 'm happy to answer any questions after this if we 've got any groups that fall into that category if you have an abn we 'll ask you to put that in if you don 't have an abn we will need you to fill out a form that 's called the statement of supplier form which basically just means we won 't um take out withhold tax from the grant and this is a government requirement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got an abn that you fill out this statement by supplier form and that 's available on the website as well or via the link and we can help with that if you have any any problems with that so then there 's just your gst status there and we get into the project details so the title of the project and then this is where we get you to tick the funding priorities of council that your projects support and once again i 'd encourage you to tick all the relevant ones [Music] and think quite broadly about that and where you are unsure you can just use the other box and add [Music] another priority in this is a new question um that we 've put in as i mentioned before does your project specifically support diversity and inclusion and we ask you to say yes or no and if you say yes we just need a couple of sentences about how it specifically supports diversity inclusion and what we 're getting at there is that a lot of projects will just by nature of say being a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attend the hall but what we 're after here is projects where the focus is really on diversity and inclusion and access and that includes accessibility so if you if you have a project that is for um a ramp access to your building so that you can have people with accessibility issues more easily um part of your organization that 's a definite yes because that 's specifically being spent on something that will support inclusion so um if in doubt put it down and and give us the details and we 'll just have a look at each project on its own merits so location of the activity event project that 's quite simple here 's the questionnaire which is also new about crown land um and that 's where you would attach your online you 'll be attaching your landowner consent so once again clearly here the commencement and completion dates next page this is where we talk about the number of people benefiting from the project so and also the age groups so think fairly broadly in this if you 've got um you may only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event or holding an event where you expect to attract 100 people then you would put 100 because there 'd be extra people benefiting from your project so think quite broadly there and same with the age groups involved tickle that you think excuse me all that you think will benefit and then the next three questions are really quite simple what is your project event activity why do you want to do this and what will it achieve and we 're really only looking for two or three sentences in in these questions we don 't expect you to write a lot it 's just really providing the basics of what your project is if you uh feel that you have enough room to do that feel free to attach another document that that can give you or give us a little bit more description i 'm just going to have a drink i 'm sorry too much talking next page is the budget page and hopefully this is fairly self-explanatory what uh what is the amount that you 're requesting in the grant first and foremost uh what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the second section what cash is your organization contributing to the project and then what are you going to be spending your cash on and quite often quite often if you 've got a piece of equipment worth three thousand dollars you might be asking for a council grant of 2000 plus you 're putting a thousand dollars in of your own funds and in that case you 'd put the same descriptor up here you 'd put two thousand dollars for the council grant you put the descriptor again there and one thousand dollars for your grant and at the end you would attach a quote for three thousand dollars and happy to answer questions at the end on that as well and then finally you 're encouraged to put in any in-kind support that you 'll be putting into this project and that can be things like working bees or just your own time organizing the quotes organizing delivery that sort of thing then finally you get a total project value which is your a sum of uh council 's grant plus what you 're spending on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that question there at the bottom of this page there 's a really important question uh which relates to um if we have to reduce the grant request that you 've you 've asked for and it basically says should the grant amount be reduced please indicate the minimum amount of grant that you would that would still allow the project or part of the project you proceed um and you just put a dollar amount in there so if we can 't give you the full amount you 've requested of 2000 but you think you could still do a project for 1000 you put 1000 in there and then just a little reminder here for any groups contributing large amounts of cash that we will need your latest financial statements attached and then the final page which is just some confirmations and also your account um name and bsb and account number and then a little checklist at the end which has the um most important details so i 'll stop sharing that for now and so i can see everybody again and probably uh before we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to talk a little bit about was just the assessment criteria we 've touched on a little bit um but i just wanted to run through that one more time so that you 're aware of the important areas and how the granus project or your actual location will be assessed so there 's uh four basic criteria that we look at and i think i mentioned that the level of cash and incline contribution your previous grant assistance from council how many of council priorities you support and then your participation outcomes how many people will benefit from your project and then there 'll be an extra weighting applied if your project will benefit inclusion and accessibility so in terms of assessment after we receive all the applications uh they all come into council we have an internal council panel of staff members that come from across the four areas or four or five main areas of council we sit and go through them all and uh rank them and make recommendations from there they 're also reviewed by council senior executive management team and then finally recommendations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as part of council 's budget process uh so look i think that 's all and i 'm sorry if i 've put you all to sleep with that or you 've had questions but very happy to take any questions now um that you might have feel free to just take yourself off mute and [Music] ask any questions susan greg put one in the chat will oh did he i shall have a look at it i 'll read it out will dealt be able to turn around approvals in time for the deadline are they aware that they will be getting a bit of an influx of requests soon that is a very good question greg and yes they have been told that our application process is underway what i expect that they 'll do um if you if you haven 't got a adult contact please just uh contact council and we can provide a a contact person for you but most likely if you 're an adult managed facility you already have a contact person that you deal with anyway um yet most likely they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to do they will just give you a quick email or a letter saying we approve the application going in they may later on at some point want more details around for example if you need a building permit they 'll want to see that before and give you final sign off but i 'm sure that within two weeks they will be able to say yeah that looks like a reasonable project and we support you putting the application if that makes sense i 've got one from john are these grants applicable for solar power yes yes john they they are um we and there 's specific criteria around that around sustainability in there so yes definitely encourage uh solar projects there is also some other grant projects okay or programs occasionally out um in the community or broader state funded solar power programs but yes council does include and encourage those sorts of projects [Music] anyone else no mel do you think there 's anything i 've forgotten there as i went through very quickly no i think you covered all the main points really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if anyone has any questions beyond this they can always reach us on our main council number excellent all right thank you everyone i 'll let you all go back to your busy days and um good luck with your applications we love getting them we get between 70 and 100 every year and it 's a great program so all the best thank you everyone i look forward to seeing the end results thank you,"(-36.7142554, 142.2016929)"

3400, Australia",5245,right so now that you can see the screen um in front of you i 'm just going to run through a few areas on here um now the first thing you need to do when you hit this landing page is obviously register by clicking on this blue register button here um and just something to be mindful of when you are registering to a portal and if you are auto filling details out sometimes it can mess up a little bit so you really need to make sure that just admit some more people into the room um you need to make sure that you 're aware of that and when you get to areas uh here for instance um it 's auto filled a number whereas so um just a few um you know areas to make sure that you make sure that you are aware that this particular area should not be that i mean that 's just what autofill will do it 'll just uh okay so someone says my sound is breaking i 'm not sure what i can do about that um i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if that helps okay um yep so auto filling will auto fill um from your caching and maybe muck up some areas that you need to make sure that you enter correctly and all the one asterisk fields here means it 's a required field so you need to put something in that area okay and then when you move down um to the classification and you click on here you 'll find that there 's generally there 's around 63 standard classifications that the councils or organizations will use and you may look and think you know nothing of that really relates to my business don 't get too hung up on the classification list it 's really um just for the organizations to have an idea of what your services are if you can find something that 's general then choose that we might just click on cleaning for instance add the classification and it will add that to our registration you can choose as many classifications as you like and if you find that there 's nothing really that does relate to your particular business there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something in that other area you need to go and view the terms and conditions of the organization and then accept after that it 's going to take you down to i 'm not a robot and after that you can register if you have any issues registering on to any portals then you can either use the online chat help which if i click it it 'll ask you to put in your name and your email start the chat and you can just type in and you can see when it 's red if it comes up with a more details area it 's probably because the people on the chat are taking a break they 're not there at the moment and it 's going to flicker email straight through to the support team and as you can see somebody is replying to me now it 's going to confuse him somewhat i 'm just going to think what 's going on anyway just let them know that we 're just training so um yep um if you can 't you know if you don 't if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1 800 number which is on the home page um should really be on this page so you can see but anyway um i 'm just going to click there and register and once i do that it says uh thank you for registering uh you will receive a link to set your password via email and here 's if you 're having difficulties here 's the number that you need to call okay if you don 't receive that email straight away check your junk folder often you know things will go into the junk or contact us and we can help you with your registration okay so logging in um if you 've already got a registration you can just log in on the side here and just be mindful as well that there is cash case capturing here where it 's auto populated these areas where i could have used this earlier on another portal and i may have a different password so just be aware of that that when you 're logging in not you don 't necessarily have the same login details on every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some councils will have or some organizations will have terms and conditions that you need to agree to every time you log in and others will just have it when you register now um if i go up to the top here you can see there 's my watch list and that is um any i can 't see that till i log in silly so i 'll just go in here log in okay so it 's telling me username passwords and correct and that is because i logged in with this these details earlier and that 's not actually my login details for the portal here so if that ever comes up you 'll know why um so go up to my watch list and i 'll see any um tenders that are that i 've watching on this particular portal and it 'll show them all quite a few i 've been watching over the years my details is where you can go in and reset your password or change any of your details the only thing that you can 't change yourself is your email address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to update your email address for obvious reasons you can view your classifications there and see which ones you 've chosen and change them as well under the awarded tab not every one of our portals use the awarded tab and they do you 'll be able to see um the opportunities that you that are pending evaluation and the ones that have been awarded so not not all of our portals use this feature but when they do you can go and see and they may give more details um for instance this one 's given the contract value um the start date end date successful supplier and the suppliers that responded some of them might give less details and just have the description of the tender uh the help and frequently asked tab here um you can send an email through to our support team by contacting us here and our frequently asked questions are all here and you can just click down and check and see right um another thing to note is not all of our portals send out uh tender alerts so um you may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yari and becca yerry ambiak i believe do so when they create a new public tender if you 're registered to their portal you 'll receive an alert saying uh this tender has been released now these notifications they aren 't uh profile match to your business so therefore um you will get all tenders regardless of whether you know they 're ones that you 're going to be interested in and the reason why it 's like that is because when i showed you before registering and choosing your classifications um if you haven 't chosen a classification you know by error or otherwise or you 've changed your business module you wouldn 't be receiving the tenders and you could miss out on one that that you otherwise should be receiving and the other reason is um you know perhaps it 's a large scale tender that 's out and you are just one part of that large scale you know in contracting maybe um you know there 's a fit out and you 're you know a flooring person or whatever um you know you can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may go to the main contractor and then subcontract out to that particular tender so it 's just giving you an idea and knowing what 's going on in your community as well um or you know joe down the road might be interested in that tender and you can say hey look you know i 've just seen this tender you should go for it so so it 's an all or nothing service um the alerts go out with all the tenders if you 're not interested in getting those alerts you can uh unsubscribe so just flick us an email to info at eprocure.com and we 'll unders and subscribe you from receiving those email alerts um let 's see what else do we need to go on to now okay so um you 'll notice um when you 're not logged into the um portal you 'll see the page with any public opportunities if there are any at the time and once you log you 'll see any opportunities that you 've actually been invited to privately so any private tenders will come up here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ email address so if the organization is invited joe at yahoo.com and joe 's not the one that 's going to be completing the tinder it 's sam um sam logs in says i can 't see this tinder or you know it 's been passed on by joe you will need to request through sending an email to info at eprocure.com.au and we will forward that on to the appropriate organization and ask them to add uh sam to that particular tender so so the only person that 's going to be able to see these private tenders are the ones that have been invited by their email address okay so once you have logged in and you 're wanting to have a look at the tender so you click on the the hyperlink here and you 'll come to the tinder details page and what that will show you is all the documents ready to download and they can be separate documents or they may have loaded them as a zip file you can see most of our council 's document download fee is free it 'll show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the registration when it 's closing and it 'll show you here if you 've responded to that particular tender so it 's just a matter of clicking on the documents to download them they should never take more than a few seconds and they will download to the bottom of in your downloads folder now up here you 'll notice that there 's a one on here and that means that um prior to you registering to this tender an addendum was issued so you can click on here uh and it says please replace the documents for the attached so i 'm going to download new a new tender document to replace the one that i that was in the tender details area the addendum area can be the dender area can be used for you know other communication perhaps the tinder has been extended out the closing date or any of those types of reasons when once you 're registered to the tinder you will get notification via email of any addendums that are issued and also questions that are asked on the forum so any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll be able to see here so and equally you can ask your own question here and submit your question now um whoops let 's just try that again i get a few glitchy things happening sometimes in my demo portal so now it says your question has been asked um now that won 't show up in here until someone from the council has responded and they may respond privately or publicly depending on the question if it 's i can 't download the documents they might just respond reply to you privately and say can you please contact ebrakyo here 's their number um if it 's something that everyone needs to what 's this oh sorry i just was reading something in the chat there um i 'll have a look at that later so uh yeah so privately or publicly depending on the question and then once it 's been answered it 'll appear here and you 'll also get an email it won 't appear here obviously if it 's been answered privately now here 's the response button here and this is where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply where you download the documents fill out your responses and then upload your files so you would just add your files here now i 'm just going to add this file here now if this ever happens uh where it says uh webinar and suppliers doc this file contains illegal characters so please remove the illegal characters from this file name so here 's a list of what their legal characters are in my particular file name has the ampersand in it you know that little and um symbol and it 's just merely saying that you can 't put that in there so i would need to have it webinar a nd suppliers so i 'm just going to go back and choose my tender document there and it should never take a long time for the documents to upload the the limit there 's no real limit except that we say anything over 100 megabytes can cause issues with um with the organizations downloading your files so if you have really large files and you may have drawings or something like that then it 's always a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um and uh yeah and if you do have any problems with uploading files definitely get on to us sooner rather than later and if it 's getting close to the closing time and you you think you 're going to go on the chat and say hey i 'm having trouble get on the phone it 's much quicker you know if you 're pushed for time give us a call it 's quicker we can get it done you know faster than back and forward chatting um and yeah and never never leave it to the last 10 minutes we know that always happens but um yeah it 's sometimes difficult for us to help you if you 're calling in two minutes before the tender 's actually closing and also i just want to point out this clock here we have a disclaimer on this clock and it says it 's an indication only and the reason for that is if i was to walk away now and leave my computer my computer goes to sleep and i come back say in three hours time and i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clock 's going to have stopped for those three hours and it 's going to give you a false indication of how much time you 've got you should always go by the tender close date and time on the tender details don 't rely on that clock hang on somebody 's trying to come in um yes so so always go by by that um there 's other times when that clock can get um a little bit uh caught up as well if you 've got more than one window open with with this particular epicure page that can mess with it as well so yeah always go by the attender close date and time on the tender details now you can see here this is ready to submit um and that does not i have not made a submission as yet um and so yeah you always need to hit the submit button to make that submission you do have the comments area here for a cover letter just just know that this particular area isn 't evaluated with your submission it 's just purely if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not required so once i 'm ready to submit i can submit my make my submission by hitting on there um and i can go back and resubmit right up until the close time so if you 're ever you know waiting on something to come that um you know waiting on somebody else to produce something to to make your submission and you think well you know it it 's okay how it is but we just want to make some changes always hit that submit button and you can go back and resubmit right up until the close time um the the organization will only receive one submission they won 't receive all your submissions that you 've made up until the close date they 'll just receive the latest one that you submitted um another button i want to mention here is the intent to respond button that is by no means means that you have made a response it 's really just a courtesy to say to the organization hey i 'm going to respond to your tender you know i intend to respond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 've already made a submission it 's gone what what are you doing um so yes so basically that is just your intention telling them your intention to respond right um then of course you know withdraw from tinder um i 'm withdrawing my interest so i 've already made a submission so i actually have can 't withdraw my response unless i delete out my submission so if i go in here and delete that out i can then withdraw from that tender i don 't know why it 's still got that message up but anyway um so i 'm just going to go back to the uh front page again um and i 'm just going to just check my list to make sure i 've got i 've covered everything um yep so i 'm just gonna go through and we 've not got very much longer to go um the webinar uh completing a tender with an online form okay so um this particular tinder like the last one was a document download upload this one has actually got an online form to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same again i can download the documents i can make mine show my intention to respond by clicking on here which will work this time because i haven 't made a response um i can also withdraw from the tinder at any time and what that will do is it 'll stop me getting all the notifications of the addendums and the questions and everything if i 'm not interested i mean you know you might go in sometimes register your interest download the documents and go no this isn 't for me so one once you know you 've decided you don 't want to make a response click on that withdraw from tinder and you won 't receive any more of the updates so i 'm just going to register my interest again and i need to go back into the response tab here and it 's showing online submission form and it 's showing it with the red candy cane is incomplete so what i need to do is i need to click on this online form and we come to this page where it says okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the pages first do you want to start your your submission um do you want to download um to review it you know you may want to send it on to somebody else in your company to have a look and say you know here 's some here 's the tender can you fill out your part before i make the submission um and here when you 've completed the submission you can download uh your submission that you 've completed so i 'm just going to start this online form here now you might find that some have a front page with some instructions telling you what to do and read through those and it really it 's just a matter of working through this form by going save and next now get to the first question and it 's a yes no not applicable and i also you 'll see that you 've got a comments area beside each question so i 'm then going to put my name and it 's telling me that i 've got 350 characters available in this particular response field now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well i 've got more than 350 characters to go in here so i can come over to the comments field and i 've got 20 000 characters i can fill out here so a lot a lot more detail can be put into this area however what 's going to happen with this particular form if this is a mandatory field which it is and it requires something in this response area when i get to the end of this it 's going to say hey your x amount percentage complete you 're missing something okay there are some areas that might just have comments only where you just type in your comments and then you may get to others that are just the yes nose that you work your way through now once you get to the end and i 'm just going to get to the i 'll just point out here that you can add documents in certain areas as well where they are required to upload it 's saying you want we want a maximum one side a4 each for each project add your document @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm at my pricing area and i can see here that i 'm 13 complete on this form you 'll find that you cannot put dollar symbols or any words in this particular area it 's simply for your lump sum price now once i 've got through the whole form which i 've done it 's telling me i 'm 16 complete because i haven 't really done a lot i can go through and i can see all these areas that are highlighted in pink and that means that those are mandatory fields that i have not completed and i 'm saying well look i actually put something in this particular one and it 's still showing that it 's pink and that was because there 's something required in this particular field so what i could do in that instance is go back and put in here see comments save and next and then i 'll just go back to the draft and it 'll show you here that this one is now complete because this was a mandatory field that was required and i mean that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um however a lot of our our portals do not require you to be 100 complete when uh you 're filling out these forms but it you know it 's peace of mind to know when you get to the end of it that it 's showing here 100 when you get to the to the end and mine 's going to show 19 complete um now occasionally you 'll be able to add a file outside the online form but not very often mostly when there 's an online form they require you to upload all your documents to their online form and the reason for that is because the online forms are there to make you know the requirements easier to get you to to to get the right information in there and for their evaluators to be able to evaluate your submission online um now i think there 's just one more thing that i want to mention and that is um is uh working on a session timed out um a timed out session should i say so um you might find when you 're adding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because i can 't do it without timing out my session but you might come here and you might get a little triangle the yellow triangle the with the exclamation mark in it and it 's saying your documents aren 't loading and it or it might be spinning round and round and round you go what 's happening you know it 's about to close i 'm panicking here um and generally that 's because you 're working on a timed out session and and what that means is you 've logged in to eprocure you 've walked away or you 've gone on to an another tab and you 've started working away and you 've come back you know maybe two hours later and you go oh yeah it 's still here and i 'll just upload my document and then you 'll come across these issues and the best thing to do is to log out log back and even even if you close down your browser and open up a fresh browser log back in and then you 'll find you won 't have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware of if you have more than one window open as well you can also have issues with that as well so i 've got two windows open now if i go back back backwards and forwards you know it looks like it 's working fine but i might find that at some point that i come unstuck from having those two windows open and working on the same document um so i 'm just going to finish up there and just see if there 's any questions in the chat um just got sorry guys i 'm just trying to work out how to get to that oh here we are uh can you have more than one options in other can you have more than one options and either hang on just the chats just going all over the place hang on a minute uh okay let me just scroll down and see if i can see can you have more than one options and other i 'm not sure what that means sorry um just bear with me i 'm just trying to scroll down it keeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ councils charge for download of documents um yes some do uh actually lgp which is an account so obviously local government procurement they do charge for document downloads and i think there might be uh i think uh maybe hobson 's bay or i 'm i 'm not 100 sure i can 't but generally no general most of our councils do not charge for document download of documents um and no horsham and gary ambiak don 't uh sure will you explain answering the questions for evaluators okay so michelle said will all the information in the online form be saved in a timed out session um if you have clicked on the save and next any information that you 've typed in there and clicked on the save and next will be saved you can log out at any time log back in and all your information will be saved you do not need to keep the session open to keep your responses saved uh right let 's just have a look um does anyone else have any linda has a question she has a hand up linda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think linda might have got her um question answered if we have any more questions can you type them in the chat and um then we can can you have more than one other option in the section oh okay yep i 've got that um i that 's a very good question actually um i am not 100 sure that 's um something i 'll have to have a look at let 's have a look at that right now i think like yeah i guess it 's really just a single box um however i might just um have to investigate that um something that i 've never really looked at to be honest um so um yeah i 'll i 'll have to get back to you on that one linda is there a way for the same username to work for all e-procure portables if not can we request that feature also we would like a way to download all our view yeah so um there isn 't a single sign-on um [Music] mainly because they 're all individual portals but you can use the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can use exactly the same email and password but you but we don 't have a single sign-on that will get you into all of them so yeah use the same username and password as fine and no we don 't at the moment have a way to download all the rfq documents at once um and sometimes you know it 's a good idea to separate them out so that um you can look at the you know tender documentation and decide whether you want to download them all um but yes i do think that that 's a feature that would be useful and we we we have been requested that before so we will be looking into that for future development yeah michelle says if the council uploads them as a zip file then you can it will allow you to download as one file which is correct um if there 's no more questions i think we can finish it off there hopefully i 've covered everything i 'm just looking at my um my little list to make sure i 've covered everything off and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um questions you have could you please um email us at info at eprocure.com.au and we 're only too happy to answer any of your questions and julia yes you do have to register to each council individually i 'm afraid thank you guys you,"(-36.7142554, 142.2016929)"

rest of time i lived out at war took on a farm where i grew up i 'm back and i 'm from pimp and i o my name is joel i 've lived in the horsham community for the last 10 years i moved here in 2010 my name 's wendy and i live on the edge of portion at national and i 've lived there for 15 years prior to that i was living at quantum i moved to the area 40 years ago so i 've got a bit of knowledge about living out of town and in town my name 's noah i 'm 20 and i 'm from austin so i 'm cecile and i live at the siberia central taiwan portion i 've actually found working with others really good i think that everyone 's been really respectful of other people 's opinions there hasn 't been any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been worked really well as a team really willing to hear other people 's ideas and bring them together rather than just choosing one um sort of letting everybody have their say and projecting that as one way forward i guess yeah i think it 's different i wouldn 't say challenging i 'd say unique a good age group which was good working with different generations so it was a good insight into different opinions so i think it was valuable i find it really amazing and i find it that they 've got a lot of brilliant ideas and they 're passionate enough to say what 's on their mind to help to make this place a better place to live and to attract people to come to horsham so that 's i think really wonderful oh it 's been interesting i 've enjoyed it and the most difficult difficult question was the last one today about rebuild or refurbish i 've really enjoyed it and it 's probably highlighted that i haven 't got enough got out in the community enough because the ideas and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really well-rounded idea of what we want and where we 're going i found it actually really interesting and really good it 's engaging with a lot of people that i wouldn 't otherwise have engaged with i guess and it 's been really really insightful to gather different perspectives on the sat community that i 've always lived in pretty much something that surprised me um has been how much i 've got out of other people 's views on the panel so it 's been a very interesting bunch um everyone is very passionate about the community they live in and what they would like to see walton become and i think that we 're quite lucky to have people in our community that are so passionate i haven 't really found anything surprising but i have learned a lot about council and i guess because i 'm involved in it i 've looked up a lot of stuff on their website i 've gone to the expo that was held down in jubilee hall so i guess i 've taken more interest in what 's happening and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy to express your opinion or get your point across i guess which was one of the things i was i guess anticipating i really to be honest i didn 't find it hard because people as a migrant i thought i 'm the only multicultural member being in this community and i thought that they were very welcoming and they were very open enough to listen to what i say as well and my thoughts and so generally it was really a positive environment there were challenges for some topics but and it ended up so well well it 's been interesting because you 're getting many different views it 's it 's been pretty worth having i guess it 's like a lot of talking and listening um but yeah it 's all sort of come together it was a little bit daunting on the first day um said everything and like trying to take it all in i guess and but now it 's it 's not been too bad at all to the council i would say this group has worked really hard to encompass everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest at heart um they want so many amazing things with this region and they are really good um i guess panel of experts about the community um and i think that you 're never going to please everyone um that 's not what we 're asking you to do but we 're asking you to really take this on board and move forward with some of these ideas just listen just listen we 're here for the future and the future betterment abortion i think it 's a worthwhile process definitely and yeah hopefully maybe in the future process you can get a bit more representation from certain ages and demographics but apart apart from that it was all still pretty well spread out in terms of people in the area not just in horsham itself and yeah i think it 's definitely a worthwhile process so much passion which you know raise voices here but i think as councillors and a community we all want the same thing we want the best for abortion it 's just working out what that is so please stay engaged increase engagement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's just a chat and i know it 's not always comfortable i know it 's not always easy but we really really want it,"(-36.7142554, 142.2016929)"

the in the areas and um yeah it 's been uh it 's been good being good good journey so far so fantastic thanks for that so tonight uh is a q a session um and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been submitted prior uh on facebook and various other mediums um and uh so i 'm going to kick off proceedings we might just take a one each if that 's all right with you then um so one of the one of the questions we received was um i live in an apartment complex with a shared community pool uh and the person was just wanting to know who 's responsible for registering the pool pool or a on common property managed by an owner 's corporation the owner 's corp is responsible for the registration inspection and certification of the pool or spa barrier i guess following the same process as if a person who owned a dwelling at a pool it 's the same process but the the responsible person or entity is the um is the owner 's court um ben here 's one for you uh if someone is constructing a side fence does this require a building permit yes it does and only if it exceeds two meters in height there is an exemption in the building regulations for side fences as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are exempt from a building clearance so yeah and it 's a it 's a big one in council isn 't a big council because it 's um at council level because it 's the point of much contention amongst neighbours as to um fence heights and new fences and who plays for them and that sort of thing that 's right yeah all those types of things yeah who 's who yeah who 's going to construct them like you said and who 's going to pay and um you know some some of these issues are civil matters between the owner you know between the two owners um there 's also a requirement um in addition to if the fence hiding seats two meters like i said before it would require a building permit but there 's also citing under building regulations where report and consent is also required for defense you 've got to um it 's a separate application and there 's also consent required as part of these sorts of things but um yeah hopefully that answers that question as well as possible so thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone 's not on mute if they could just mute themselves i 'm getting a bit of feedback somewhere along the line along with my son who i can hear bouncing a basketball right out the front of the window where i 'm doing this so um yeah if you could just pop yourself on music if you 're not so already um i 'll take the next one uh and it again it relates to pools and spas it says i 'm renting a property which has a pool of spa as a tenant do i have to register and notify the council um and the answer is no the owner 's responsible a bit like the owner 's core the owner is responsible for registering the pool aspire with council and for arranging the inspections and the certification of the barriers [Music] the the note here goes on to say however as an occupier you may inspect council 's register for information relating to the pool or spa on the property you 're renting including whether the pool or spa is registered and whether the barrier has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we 'll find that quite useful um you know if they are looking at a rental property and that does have a swimming pool just to check whether the um whether the registration process is up to scratch or not um the next one 's for you ben then i 'm going to place myself on tape take screen off for a moment and just ask my son to stop bouncing that basketball um when someone built a shed on the boundary of their property and are there any specific uh requirements relating to the size uh for compliance in this location so i 'll leave this one with you ben and then i 'll um i 'll be back in a moment if you just excuse me thank you no thanks you can 't yes you can you can build a shed on a boundary um there 's some requirements that you just need people need to be aware of when building sheds on boundaries um one is that under the sighting of the you know building regulations um these sheds can 't exceed like they shouldn 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they shouldn 't exceed 3.2 meters in average wall height and they also have a maximum wall length that they need to be within the building regulations to comply [Music] now if they don 't meet these requirements they then as i want to mention before there 's a separate process in addition to the building permit which is applying for what we call report and consent which means that the height or the length of the shed may be outside the regulations and consent needs to be applied for and consent from the neighbor on the affected side needs to be um given uh as part of that process as well so um well i think they 're trying to say can they build the shed as the bit what the boundary pull through could could we just again i could just ask if everyone could put themselves on mute um as i mentioned before we are getting a bit of feedback and can hear a few people chatting away so that would be much appreciated if you could thank you um so yeah and there 's just the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 200 mils off the boundary line um and that 's just basically two uh it could be a couple of scenarios it could be where the sidewalls on the boundary and you 've got a gutter that is on that side and the generally you you 'll set the shed back at 200 mils just to allow for that gutter to not project into the neighbouring property and things like that um otherwise yeah if it was it shouldn 't swung around and the gable end was on the boundary then um you could go right to the boundary line yeah and i think that the 200 mil was changed wasn 't it been to it was initially 150 ml but that was just a bit tight to allow for the gutter and fascia and whatnot so generously given another 50 ml to squeeze it all in wait it 'll make it all work here that 's wrong yeah okay thanks for that mate um the next one uh next questions again pool and spa related uh and the question relates to rental property and the person says they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backyard and they just want to know what obligations they have in regards to that um so in my presentation last week i spoke about exemptions in terms of pools and basically the threshold is uh if it can hold more than 300 mil of water um then a pool barrier must be installed but there is a but with that [Music] in that if it is a blow-up pool uh it doesn 't require a permit and thus doesn 't require a barrier um and it does require a permanent barrier if it 's considered to have parts to the pool and the example i gave last week was some bracing around as well as a filter attached to the pool um so that 's sort of the trigger for it um the information goes on to say if you intend to keep your relocatable pool erected for three consecutive days or longer um you should notify the landlord of this because the landlord is required to register the pool uh with council after those three days so again it just it comes back to the type of pool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's considered to be i guess a temporary temporary structure but if it 's something a bit more serious with some bracing or a filter um then it is required to go through the process um and here 's one for you and it 's a pretty simple one how do i get a copy of the building permit so if you could just explain to people the process that they go through to get a copy of a building a permit that 's been uh issued and potentially your plans which is usually what people are after in this situation yeah look it 's just a matter of speaking to admit admin at council they can generally provide if you 're the owner of the property they can provide you with the copy of the building permit and the approved plans that were issued in previous years and there 's a um yeah there 's a there 's an opportunity to be able to get that without too much hassle from council because council has to keep all these documents regardless of whether it 's the building permanent speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private building surveyor previously um council 's the record keeper for all those types of documents yeah okay um i 'll take the next one and it again it 's paul inspire related it says what happens if i don 't register my call um so because the registration of pools is a statutory obligation if you don 't register your pool within the required time you may face it on the spot fine or a penalty fine uh and this can be up to sixteen hundred and fifty dollars um so if the council becomes aware of the pull of spa on your property they 'll send you a written notice requiring you to to register that or um and you 'll also be required to pay the registration fee and the information search fee if it 's applicable uh so that 's that one um in the next question again relates around building permits and it 's a it 's a doozy for um people who work in the building department at council and it 's what do i need a building permit for yeah look basically you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the building regulations have a specific schedule um that relates to what work can be exempted from a building permit um but you know there 's not there 's not a lot that you can exempt these days it 's this um it really depends on what you 're wanting to do if it 's a if you 're wanting to build a little garden shed in the backyard um that is less than 10 square meters in floor area um he 's not higher than 2.4 meters in height within you know close to boundary and things like that and it 's in the backyard that 's the sort of thing that you possibly could get an exemption for a building permit um and what i mentioned before things uh certain fences that are under a certain height and those types of things but there is a requirement for a lot of construction to have building permits these days yeah yeah from my experience in council there 's seems to be a misunderstanding within the community that things like decks and pagolas or sorry dickson verandas are exempt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught out because of that and they uh employ someone to build it and perhaps they don 't ask the right questions and then they can find themselves on the end of a building notice or a building order from council because the structure doesn 't have a permit um but there is a there 's a list of exemptions in the um in the legislation and it 's fairly basic as ben mentioned anything 's anything that has has a structural element to it pretty much requires a permit um unless you have something like the shepherd have been also mentioned and it meets those requirements um but things like even um shop fit outs and things like that um there are other triggers in regards to health and safety involvement so i guess my advice is to go and speak to the building department and uh run run whatever you 're proposing past them um to see if if it does actually require a permit or not because you don 't want to get caught out and find yourself in that under the pump from council exactly exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing your research asking questions to us we 're always always happy to help answer these questions so that you know for sure that um you do or you don 't need a permit yep that 's right um the next one is a is a query that we 've had in it and it 's in regards to indoor spas and do they need need to be registered um so the query says it 's it 's a spa located in a bathroom but it 's not a spa bath i guess where it has a plug and water escapes it 's um described here as a standard spa that you 'd normally find in an outdoor area but it 's actually inside um so my understanding is that because it has water in it pretty much all the time and it doesn 't have a plug that you can just um remove the water that it does need to comply with with the requirements um the new requirements i should say for uh safety barriers uh and another example of this i guess but on a larger scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're still required to have the um the necessary fences or barriers around them um so yes i guess the the short answer is that it 's a it 's a spa bath and it doesn 't require it but if it 's a spa that has water in it all the time then it does need to meet the requirements um another one for you ben if i was thinking um maybe if you could just give a brief overview of the requirements for protection works notices and the potential for those and when um when a building surveyor might ask uh for someone to serve protection works notices on on a neighbour yeah basically um it 's it 's more so when the the works that are happening on a particular property [Music] are going to somehow affect the adjoining property and that could mean that the works may compromise the building that 's located next door on the adjoining property structurally if there 's earthworks happening on that property um uh if there 's any work that needs to be carried out um on the adjoining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the the work on the property and mention um yeah these are the sorts of things that we need to look at and each um project you 'll basically determine um whether it will need protection works um on their own merits depending on what 's what 's what works involved and um yeah it 's it 's the building surveyor 's discretion there as to what you know what would trigger that so yeah and there 's a proof just to follow with with protection work and forms that are required to be um completed by the builder for the work that 's happening um there 's also going to be a notice given to the adjoining owner and they 've got to provide a comment back and these sorts of things as to whether they 're you know consent to the work being carried out and these types of things so yeah yeah so it 's um it 's just basically a protection mechanism for adjoining properties when you 're when you 're proposing works on your property um and just allows um i guess the process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the to the adjoining property during the construction process that there is as i said that has been documented and you know the sort of evidence of it rather than he just keep relying on esa or that type of thing so it is a pretty important part in the building permit process should it be required and something that quite often gets overlooked or perhaps doesn 't get the um isn 't given the importance that it should should do in the process yeah that 's right sorry sorry i was just going to say it 's important to especially where there 's been site cuts um where excavations happening for works on enjoying property and you need to be you need to be assured that you know there 's not going to undermine footings on another you know things that i 'm not a building next door and things like that that that can happen so you 've it 's just just another example yep uh we 've had a couple of queries in regards to who who would be in conducting the inspections for the for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and i 've got a note here uh just in regards to um i guess uh people are sort of jumping the gun a little bit and they 're getting the inspection conducted before their ball gets registered with council and before they receive the letter stating which which copy of the standard they met that the barrier needs to adhere to um and there 's a there 's a note saying that council 's getting a few compliance certificates from owners who don 't realise the process and they 're jumping the gun which will might likely cause them to have their pools inspected again which then costs them more money because you know obviously doesn 't come for free so um i guess i just wanted to put it out there that if if anyone 's watching this um please make sure that you get your pool registered first with council and you get the letter and then you can start the process of finding someone to inspect it and in terms of who can inspect it it can be done through council or it can be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point last week of just reiterating that people should do their due diligence in regards to the inspection in regards to the inspector conducting the inspection uh just because there are people out there who are saying they 're registered or possibly not saying they 're not registered and conducting the inspections and basically the the the inspection isn 't worth the paper it 's written on if the person isn 't uh registered as a building supplier or a building inspector um and that that again reiterate what i said last week that registration can be checked online at the vba 's website um it 's a pretty simple portal whereby you punch in the person 's name and it will come up as to whether they 're registered or not and whether their registration is current um so that that 's that 's an important factor to note um we 've also had some queries in regards to the fees uh now i 'm making it a bit of an assumption here so uh just cut me a bit of a bit of slack if it 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the fees for the inspection will be 300 plus gst through council um now obviously if you go through a private person for that they may choose to charge more or less but that 's what council is is charging um and if a re-inspection is required it 'll cost 185 dollars plus gst so that sort of goes back to that point it gives people an understanding of how much the inspection 's going to cost and how much extra it 's going to cost if they 're getting one before they 're before they all gets registered um and you know i 've also got an idea saying that it 'll cost approximately 20 to lodge the um the compliance letter with council once approved um so that 's pretty much all from us uh ben thank you for your time tonight much appreciated no thank you thanks thanks every everyone that 's involved tonight it 's been great yeah and hopefully there 's been some information there that people out there have found useful and as i said at the last at the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the building department at your local council or visit the vba website for additional information so thank you and have a good evening thanks ben,"(-36.7142554, 142.2016929)"

VIC 3400, Australia",2169,oh yeah i 'm bruce johansen i was born and bred in the yarra valley in woberton in 1927 and in 1927 the yarra valley and the mountains all around the the alps there was the center of the timber industry then when i finished uh school i had a brother who was and he was eight years older than me and he decided to get into the timber game in those days we 'd been through the 39 fires in in the whole through the whole of the alps and there 's thousands and thousands of acres of burnt mount nash the bark is killed and falls off and it 's like like stark sepulchre thousands of these trees so he went into cutting pulpwood for the ipm australian paper manufacturers of tomorrow and men in those days well when we we got started in 45 men were very scarce but they were coming in from overseas after the war of the like the lugar nations and so we 'd get these fellas off these ships bring them up and put them in the raw bush uh 50 miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food and stay with all their requirements and because it was all piece work they were able to whatever they earned did they got paid for so if they didn 't work hard they didn 't get any too much and so that 's how we started and i used to run teams of men in the timber in a for falling timber for the sawmills and i 'd have a team of foilers and i 'd be driving the dozer and pulling the logs out and it was in when i was in logging in mount sterling that ronald ryan the last man to be hanged in victoria he worked for me he was one of my fallers which was quite interesting when we look back over the history so we worked i was working down through gippsland and i had a team of men we were logging out at murren gower at the eastern side of our bus and then my brother decided to buy a property that was nearly all bush and he said would i like to go and manage this property for him so i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at farming so then i moved on to the farm and so-called farm the um the house was made of rough timber just um as it was cut out the poles out of the bush it was lined with um flat iron and lined on the outside with corrugated iron no insulation and it was six feet up off the ground and uh it was so cold in winter in the as the the the two older kitties would go to bed and we 'd put a potty under the bed and in the morning the contents were frozen solid so we lived it pretty rough and no pair no electricity no running water and uh no modern cons and uh we thought it was was great fun but but uh we worked i worked so hard there and we had two kids when we went on the farm and then where third boy there first was a girl and seven and three boys but the second boy was born while we were on the farm uh now the third yeah the second boy and then we we built this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pulp wood on the farm and i had a tamer man logging cutting the milling of the milling logs and then we were sending the milling logs down to to melbourne and all the pub would went to the um paper mill but as well as that we 'd cleared the property we 'd sown it and ruined built a dairy and uh fitted it up and we were milking 80 cows my wife was helping me and then we were expecting our fourth and final baby and joan was looking after the schooling for the two older kids and the third one was coming onto schooling and i said we can 't go on living like this because it 's just too much we 're putting too much on you i 'd get up at four o 'clock in the morning go start milking and then i 'd be running them team on in the farm and logging and pulp cutters and then i 'd come home and with milk and it would be nearly 11 o 'clock the time i got to bed so i was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do i 'm not qualified for anything i 've only run worked earth moving machinery and so i always had a bit of a yen i thought i wouldn 't mind selling in the selling game so i thought well i 'll try that and i answered ads everywhere and of course most times you just get a knock back thanks for your application and so i just keep looking but one ad i did get an interview and he was from an international um agency in new south wales and he 's there interviewing me and in the finish you know i did thank me for coming and went out and joan said to me how do you reckon you went i said i don 't think i 'll get it and i said because i don 't drink i 've been a tea tattler all my life and i said i don 't reckon he 'll give me the job anyhow a few months after that we were going on a holiday caravan holiday up to sydney and i said i 'm going to call in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasting my time so i called him to see him and he got a shock to see me and he said what can i do for you and i said well you just uh tell me am i you think i 'm wasting my time trying to sell so we led over to the filing cabinet pulled out the filing cabinet and said you remember i was filling out a sheet well he said the possible score was 37 you scored 31. he said you 're a big bloke and we like big fellas selling big equipment and he said then he said here 's the reason he turned it over and on the back he 's got a big scroll no he doesn 't drink he said that 's the reason and you asked for it and he said i 've given it to you i said that 's all right that 's why i came here and he said i 'll tell you something he said you 'll never be able to sell anything above the value of a thousand pounds and i said yeah you know i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to get fellas on the edge of signing a deal and then you just get a bit of grog gets them over and i said but that would work against me because i 'd be drinking with them and i 'd be losing my alertness and so i know he says it doesn 't work that way anyhow away i went and what he did say to me he said bruce don 't waste your time answering advertisements you look at a company decide who you want to work for what you want to sell and then go and see them something like this say i 'm just here to sell yourself just go and say look i want to see the sales manager and you 'll think you want to buy something and then tell him well you know you know their equipment and so that 's what i did so i rang up alice chalmers and said i want to make an appointment with their sales manager and because he knew the name from my brother and i we were well known right throughout the whole of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said i would love what i 'm not here to sell for and to buy something i 'm here to i would like to sell for you oh beauty he said save me putting an ad in the in the paper on the weekend he said you can start monday he said you 're going to have a choice of two areas you 'll either go to wangaratta and do the northeast or we 'll get you to go to hamilton to do the western part of the state as your territory so i got a place to rent at tarrington and we rented there and i was one day when i was just come to the area i went to the uh called willie adams branch up here in horsham and i introduced myself and i said i might as well be friendly competition we don 't have to be antagonistic so i introduced myself to the salesman and the manager and off we went well then the next thing there was a contract a tender called for grader at the wimmerashire which was based in horsham and i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so on the day that joan had let me know that she thought she might have been going to hospital to have my uh our youngest and in those days all you can communicate with was telegrams so i got a telegram in encode i went down to the shire to see how i 'd got if they had any questions on our tender and the engineer came out and said we 've bought a caterpillar and i said oh grotto that 's good well i 'll give a better run for my money next time and i wanted to get back to melbourne quick because for the baby being born and then i thought no i won 't go back to melbourne straight away i 'll go up to the office and i 'll congratulate willie adams on their win so i went up to him and the manager and the salesmen were in there and they sort of looked at me and said what do you want and i said i just came to congratulate you you know i need to sally your cat 12. where we sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shire and wimmera i said i 'll tell you what the trade-in price was and so i told him and he hit the roof he said if they have told you what we 've tried to do our prior training mostly so they 'll be held by i said steady down dick steady down i 'm here to shake your hand and tell you that i 'll give you a better run for your money next time and i told him i was shifting to tarrington where the house i was getting when i moved the family up a few weeks later as we went in and opened the back door there 's a card under the door and it was his sars wraps card he 'd left a note telling me that asking me to ring deck the manager no not to ring here to ring him so i rang him and he said i 'll drop in when you 're in horsham i 'd like to ever talk to you so i called in and he he said he wanted to offer me the job because his sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in in the end of 1960 and so he he said there 's no roach and i said right oh i 'll think about it because we just made one shift and you wonder why my wife ever stayed with me because people prior to coming to horsham in 20 years we 'd made in 17 years with my 21 moves so this was going to be move number 21. and i said i came back and saw dick and i said look i think i might give it a miss because we 're sick of shifting and he said no i don 't have to hurry he said let me know by the end of the year so in here we thought about and i thought look here 's the opportunity of a lifetime you 're selling the machines i knew i could sell and i loved and knew all about them so we moved here i moved the family here in the beginning of february 1961.,"(-36.7142554, 142.2016929)"

Horsham VIC 3400, Australia",1088,uh i 'm robin lardner and i have been living in the winrar for 37 years i love this area because uh it reminds me so much of tuscany the patchwork of the crops of the canola and and peas and beans just provide a beautiful carpet i love the people and i love the adventure that it has given me both personally and professionally and that 's why i 'm delighted to be able to share with you uh my opportunity of being a board member with the royal flying doctors victoria for the past nine years i 'm passionate about the role flying doctor service for the fact that i started my career as a nurse i had the opportunity of being the director of nursing of a small country hospital at matoa and later it was done mental health services and to have the opportunity to apply to be a board member and share my experiences of the difficulties but also of the accolades of providing rural and regional health services has been fantastic and the fact that unbelievably the royal flying doctors service victoria had lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position of fundraising only and i felt that i have been able to assist bringing about this range of services that i know is so important to people living far away we don 't have the same health status as our city counterparts and this is one way bringing services and at least trying to ensure that we are equal to our city counterparts surprisingly enough western victoria has quite a few connections with the royal flying doctors service victoria section and that is that the founder reverend john flynn was born near santana at a place called malagal also the inventor of the pedal radio alfred traeger grew up near dimbola in a small location glen lee and he really uh opened up communication for the flying doctors receiving emergency calls another uh plank that is important to the flying doctors was uh hugh mckay he was the inventor of the sunshine harvester machine and that factory was in ballarat and he bequeathed a great deal of money to john flynn to [Music] experiment using planes for emergency call-outs a little bit of jest is that in the 1980s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called the flying doctors and is now filmed and ed all over the world and lastly that i was appointed nine years ago i was the first regional director that the board had ever had and that was through my experience in the health industry when i first started on the board there were five part-time staff and we had the honourable job of fundraising for all of australia and that was renewing planes and although each of the states have their own boards and their own fundraising we were predominantly responsible for that process and we could see that as a newly reinvigorated board that we would have to look at opportunities that might provide primary health services to the whole of victoria i invited the board to come to the wimmera and have a look at health services in general and the barriers and hurdles that people have to endure about accessing health services and so slowly we have been able to add services now so for the past nine years we have uh been able to offer services now to 90 percent uh across of victoria um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health services so the sorts of services that might uh surprise people to hear that we provide under the banner of flying doctors is a dental service we have a custom-built dental vans that go all over victoria we offer um eye care tele health particularly for chronic illnesses this saves people time and money not visiting larger centres to perhaps have a five-minute check on how their diabetes is going this has been very well received we also have a non-emergency patient transport service over 100 over 100 vehicles are in that fleet and we provide services for inter-hospital all over the state we also have a volunteer transport service we have trialled them at heathcote and rochester and that is a free service whereby we take people to their appointments to larger centres and we hope that that will really take off and we will be able to offer that to many more centres in victoria another service that we have is the fact that we have transported over 3 000 people that either have covert or suspected covert since the pandemic has started we 've also transported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aboriginal medical clinics we also offer speech therapy to children we know that um if that their language skills are inhibited in any way this really affects children 's ability for their literacy social well-being and their mental health so that 's been a fantastic service that we have started also in the last two years we offer a wellbeing service this is a free mental health service and well-being service to people we also offer a women 's gp clinics throughout victoria it 's important that there is a gender uh choice for people and so that this um allows people to have those services within their times they 're not driving more than 50 k 's to access those services lastly through the wonderful donations of five people donating a hundred thousand each in the last 18 months we are now offering a service called memory lane and that is a custom-built ambulance and we 've got two of them and so people in palliative care or end of life who might think that they would just love to go back home back to their farm to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all volunteers from the royal flying doctor service makes that happen for people and so that 's just started and it is really been well accepted my tenure will finish next year and i am absolutely thrilled to have been associated with a wonderful iconic service providing health care for the last 93 years so it has been my privilege to be a board member with the royal flying doctor service and also my privilege of sharing my journey with with people in the wimmera thank you you,"(-36.7142554, 142.2016929)"

owners of the lands in which we meet both past and present and acknowledge any aboriginal people who may be joining us tonight in this webinar um thank you everybody for making some time tonight to spend half an hour um listening to i suppose a little bit of the an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water play um sue newell and i have been involved in quite a lot of group small group discussions and conversations over the last two months and we 've had some feedback through those consultations that there is i suppose a degree of confusion or people would like to know more information about what the natural water play area is as part of the riverfront activation project so that 's the purpose of tonight 's meeting or discussion um i think the i 'll just move on to the next slide so we 're going i 'm just going to cover off on a little bit of background assuming that some people were not at our first webinar and just to give you a little bit of context so the riverfront activation project covers a very um defined area and this map is small but i 'll just talk you through it basically the area that we are talking about is just west of the rowing club room so the rowing club room if you follow my my cursor or mouse you can see the rhine club room on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the rowing club room it runs basically just around the watonga basin and then on the south side of the caravan park so the caravan park is all that area through here uh it covers off on the end of the southern end of fibroid street the south end of the miniature rail along this point here it includes the angling club room but not the sound shell um structure so the line goes directly between that point it covers it goes along the um kind of height the rise or the track along the sound shell cuts in behind uh wilson bolton and then there 's a little bit of a dog leg in here under the bridge and to the east of the bridge just shy of the fence that um has just been put up at the showgrounds and then along the edge of the river all the way back so that just describes i suppose the area that we 're talking about in relation to the riverfront activation project the area that we 're going to be focusing on tonight and discussing tonight in more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'm going to show you on this map so basically if the area if you know this area quite well you 'll know that there 's a number of cabins face the river in the caravan park the proposed site for the water play area is this area through here that i 'm just circling around so that section in here is what we 're talking about in relation to the location for the the water play park i also want to give you a very quick snapshot of where um the community reference group and i suppose the progression of the project has evolved from many of you would have been involved in or contributed to the master planning process for the whole city to river project in 2019 and a little bit of 2018 um many many submissions were made through that process and um what basically we did some collation and consideration of those inputs and and points of feedback and there 's close to about 550 uh references made to either the river or the riverfront um those pieces of feedback they 're honoring those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um community reference group and you can see it in there 's a map down the bottom again small but it will just give you the indication all of the good bad neutral negative positive comments were summarized and basically located on on a map and shared with the community reference group and also provided who tracked consulting who are the landscape architects on this project that information that was provided through the first phase consultation for the city to river project formed the basis of the the initial concept plan for this riverfront area so honoring what has been said beforehand gathering that data informing and distilling it and putting it into a concept idea uh was the basis from which the community reference group have provided feedback and that we have had some ongoing consultation with um stakeholders either located in around or users of the space i 'll talk a little bit about that in a moment so the draft concept plan that um that uh it has been developed uh basically comes from that process there 's been a mention johnny mentioned that he is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community reference group for this project and they 're a critical link between the work that council does the work that stu and i do and the work that broader council does in relation to bridging this project and important feedback from the community community reference group is a model that we would like to continue on using for further precinct development work um the conversations that we 've had in relation to looking at the draft concept plan and getting really constructive feedback has been incredibly valuable and the intent is really um the purpose of the community reference group is supposed to sharpen and provide feedback on on any of the planning that 's that 's been undertaken but also have a very keen eye on ensuring that engagement that we do through this precinct work is um transparent and and actually addresses the needs of the community which is some of the feedback that we heard through the master planning process so we want to do this work better we actually want to reflect the interests and the needs of of our community and particularly the users @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can so considering function use um you know future use and and and consider those um elements within the planning that goes forward and and the input that 's been provided by the community reference group today has been incredibly valuable and i just would like to acknowledge their time and commitment for this project and that 's the list of the names of the representatives community reference group will be involved in the next phase of the engagement process as well this is just a very quick summary of what has been done today in relation to talking to community groups over the last several months and who has been consulted we have carried out both face-to-face and some online consultations referencing the draft concept plans that i mentioned before which was just built from the work done last year and that was informed by input provided around the riverfront or the river um you can see quite clearly um there 's been a number of conversations that have been held in april and june um one of the lessons learnt from the master plan process ways that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to really talk to those people who are most impacted first so those stakeholders the technical experts experts the land holders traditional owners speak to those parties first and make sure that we understand what is doable what 's not doable so we actually start sharpening um from a long-term concept a long-term master plan which is a long-term vision plan and we start to distill down to what is actually practical and appliable in this particular context and a lot of that information the technical and the user group inputs have been very very informative to shape up what could work and what couldn 't work in july there 's been a lot of discussions with very targeted groups and i won 't read them through all of these but you can read through at your leisure when this goes up online so quite i think there 's going to be close to 20 25 different consultations with different groups over the next um by the end of july by the end of this week we still have a few more people and groups to consult with in early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of these inputs fed into the draft concept plan you come up with a still a draft concept plan but to take it out publicly and seek public feedback and hopefully by the time we do that which will be mid-august a two-week intensive um consultation either face-to-face down at the rowing club rooms or online so there 's a couple of options and a couple of ways that people can provide input we 're very interested in hearing from individuals people who use the space providing some specific feedback around what they think what they think about the plan the concept plan and what they think about any suggestions and ways forward so i 'm going to briefly touch on one other point before i hand over to sue who will talk more specifically about the natural water play area so hopefully that 's giving you a bit of context around um the broader planning across the precinct is that there 's been some questions around the water play area and funding so just to let you know um there has been an application made to sport and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the water play arc we 'll talk about what that actually looks like in a little more detail in a moment and that application was um considered in early late may early june the community reference group were aware of um this opportunity um and council have also supported the application at its june 20 meeting on june the 22nd so an application has gone in this was for stimulus funding for sport and rec related infrastructure so it was very explicit about what we could apply for and it will be a relatively quick turnaround so generally grants to sport and wreck victoria take about six months six months to process this will be relatively soon and the intent is to promote um post covered or covered um stimulus outcomes into the regions with sport and rec infrastructure and uh the application made by council is to hopefully offset the cost of um of this part of the project um and one final point before i hand over to sue is the imprimata of the crg is really to um you know undertake very good engagement through this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do two things which comes out of a council resolution at the end of last year which is to identify a site for a cafe within this precinct and also to look at the water play feature as one of those outcomes so they are the two things that we need to consider as part of our design where and how they fit and locate within that precinct is what we 've been seeking input from community around and the consultations today have been really um really useful and i just would like to also thank the numerous people and organizations groups and clubs that have actually come out and contributed and participated in that process thank you thank you carolyn um just to further touch base i guess on on the grant application um with the sport and rec um you know they 're obviously very keen to ensure that any anything that they do or invest in has maximum usage and i 'll just talk a little bit about what the sport and ref victoria grant entails so the idea for the natural water play area is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that you use hand pumps creek beds rocks a little bit what 's like depicted here in the pictures to actually play in a natural way so it 's incorporating these the gates um channels that the water flows through so that children can actually control the water as the water goes goes through the cycle if you like the water usage um because it it basically requires that you need to use hand pumps or some form of seesaw or any any other way that you can get the water to flow because of that there 's not anticipated to be large volumes of water going through the sash and what is actually coming out at the other end ideally council 's looking into recycling that water back into our irrigation system so we 're very keen to make sure that any water that actually does get generated actually goes back into our system to be be reused again the natural water play is designed to be all accessible that 's actually a criteria of of anything that we put up to sport and wreck victoria so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all users have equal ability to be able to use the space and in doing this application and in working up what might actually look like the water play we 've had a lot of conversations with the wimmera cma obviously about flooding and and how that might work in a zone that 's right next to the river um also our traditional owners and and the landowners delp have been involved because there is actually a number of requirements and limitations around that particular space and the cultural heritage management plan which we 're having completed at the moment we 've also obviously been in in close uh contact uh about what we can and can 't do in that space already but that report will be done and uh delivered to council at the end of uh august uh to really give us an overview of exactly what 's in that area so the natural water play as you can see um is very much designed around keeping with all of the feedback that we received from the master planning process which is that we really want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh the look and feel that you 're seeing now these are just a couple more images just to highlight what sort of natural play we 're talking about um it gives this the idea that you 're actually you you 're in the in the uh in the dirt if you like and as well as that our accessible toilets will actually have a spray um in there so should you wish to spray the the children 's legs off or wash their hands before they hop in the car uh that will actually be included in our all accessible change rooms as a change room as well and toilet just looking at some of the material and elements this slide is a little bit hard to see so i apologize for that but what we 're trying to do here is show that the elements that are in the space are actually fitting with the area so we 're not having lots of colors and lots of bright big mushrooms if you like this is very much around using wood sand and water as a play area also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well so that it actually gives that full water play experience so um the water play is not uh a splash park or a slide um it 's it 's nothing like that and and obviously that 's not suited for that particular environment along the river so we just thought we would we 'd put this up there to say look it is it is definitely not any of these things um and what 's been depicted in the natural place is very much around what we 're doing so um i thought i threw any further comments in relation to the technical or the located elements of the water play area uh no thank you carolyn thank you sam thank you so just to um wrap up and then i 'll pass back to johnny um is just to give you a bit of an idea of the next steps in relation to not just the water play component of the riverfront activation area but what we 've got proposed and i 've alluded to this in in the in the introduction so during july uh april @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct feedback and input um and that information has been gathered and majority key points have been shared with the landscape architect so any informative or structural or functional issues that have arisen out of those consultations have been fed back to the landscape architects tracked consulting um the reason why we 're not showing you maps tonight specifically around the water play and or the um the the actual draft concept plan is that it 's still iterating but it 's still being um modified and and adjusted and the community reference group do have a meeting next tuesday evening the fourth of august and that will be the point where we hope there will be quite a clear sign-off point in relation to that feedback being um taken on and actually and it reflects the plan the draft plan reflects the feedback that 's been gathered and the feedback predominantly from um you know those entities that are located or adjacent uh to the um through the precinct so the crg will actually be looking at signing off on the draft concept plan that then becomes public uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that just gives a bit of an explainer to why we 're not looking explicitly at um maps tonight but we certainly do want to make sure that people understand the concept and the idea of what the splash park is and generally where it will be located during august we will provide a couple of options for people to provide feedback on the plans we have booked the angling club room from the 10th to the 22nd of august and at the angling club rooms we will have a schedule of times which start promoting after our meeting next tuesday um which will basically be alternate morning afternoons and some and some weekend times community reference group members will be on site as well as council staff for you to come down and view the agreed draft concept plan and we 'll be seeking some input and feedback from anyone who 's interested in contributing these dropping points uh you know will obviously be undertaken in a covert safe way and we 'll be dependent on whether the situation within regional victoria stays the same so mandatory mask wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will certainly be keeping a watch on whether we can still maintain those drop-in sessions we 'll also be providing an online option for people to view the maps and also provide feedback through the process which will be distributed back to the community reference group there 'll be some further refinement done on the draft concept plan and and and work towards a concept plan that has um had the appropriate levels of feedback and input not just from the community but also from those technical uh land holder and land owner inputs the cma and other other parties so all of those inputs will actually feed into what we hope to have as the you know a concept plan to go forward and a concept plan provides more detail around how that 's how the site can function there 'll be elements that we look to advance um there is a budget overall for the whole site of about 10 million dollars if we get the three million dollars allocated from sport and rep victoria we have about 2.5 million dollars for um further works across the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the community reference group to decide on what elements we do first but maybe we invest in the civil works and we 're also looking at feedback from the community during august also on what aspects and elements we proceed to further detailed schematic work so that we 're in a really strong position if funding does come forward and through to take advantage of that funding and to be aligned to a plan that is reflective of community interest and need and also takes advantage of any funding that does come forward so basically the public um consultation or public drop-in sessions or online sessions will happen from the 10th to the 22nd of august throughout august as well i mean some people prefer and we 've certainly had a number of people make contact directly with council with council staff or directly to crg members so you can speak directly if you know a community reference group member or if you 'd like to speak to either sue or myself at council or other council staff involved in the project you can certainly do that we invite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like answers on or you 're interested in knowing a little bit more about particular elements we certainly invite that in september as i said earlier the concept plan will be developed further with the inputs that have been gathered by the august public consultation and hopefully further refined hopefully we 've ironed a lot of the bugs out in the in the consultations that have been done to date and that we 'll seek to get some feedback from the crg particularly and the community on what areas um we prioritize across the precinct with the resources and the funding that we have to date then the plans will ideally go out up to council at the end of september um council goes into caretaker mode towards the end of september and we 're very keen um to ensure that this council has an opportunity to see the outcomes of this work so that basically is a summary of um i suppose an overview of the of the riverfront activation project but explicitly focusing on the waterfront the water play area natural water play area as we 've mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving um the webinar open for about 10 or 15 minutes after after we 've finished the information session for people to put forward any questions that you might have or that have been elicited from from the information session this evening joining your hand over to you thanks carolyn and sue um i hope people that have tended tonight um got something out of it and understanding the difference between a natural water play and a um a splash park which is something you would see down in geelong or in those bigger sort of areas and um you know it 's it certainly has been hot on hot topic among a lot of people in the community so just hopefully laid some of the fears of thinking it 's going to be something big and plasticky and not all natural which is what really comes through with the um the feedback from the city river master plan um i 'd like to thank everyone for attending um again remember the dates from the 10th 10th august to the 22nd august down to england club rooms to you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and be heard make sure you lock those dates away and keep an eye out in the media and stuff like that to make sure you can attend and have your feedback and also any questions that you have for tonight um you know make sure you get them in on the chat line and um hopefully the guys can answer all your questions that you have so thank you,"(-36.7142554, 142.2016929)"

after training up in the mountains i 'd never seen snow in my life experienced this condition but we were trained up near uh in the mountains that uh snow fields there after three months we did the trip down on the nile dan which in itself was an experience and i hadn 't had an experience for life on ships and passing through the roaring 40s and the screaming 50s then underestimated at all the the ship rolled at night when i got out of bed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drown i 'll get dressed so i did and i went up onto the bridge with the captain he 's a danish man and watching the incliner meter on a ship going over and 45 degrees list less than overalls and back to 46 or seven and he would say this ship it will go to 50 degrees oh well it might i didn 't want to it was pretty pretty terrifying going through that part of the sea but once you get down further the uh it 's very it 's pristine it 's calm it 's a [Music] great experience you start to run into the pack ice about 100 kilometers out from the antarctic shelf itself and not a dam could handle it wasn 't a icebreaker but it could handle the pack ice but we could only get within about 20 miles of the antarctic that 's itself the base that we 're going to morrison and there we unloaded the fixed-wing aircraft onto the ice the helicopters of course could fly off the ship and we transported all our goods and then the changeover crew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant man plant detractor running the powerhouse and the tractors which were d5s with grousers on them your temperature 's so cold down here the tractors ran on aviation kerosene you take two years supply with you when you go and in case the ship can 't get back when it 's supposed to return it 's daylight from about november to about march it 's 24 hours a day like that takes a little bit of getting used to some of them couldn 't adapt to it real well but i did i disciplined myself to sleep and then go down to the powerhouse on time so i 'm willing to skip those out then comes about may to end of september it 's dark as i was at home i 'd be into breakfast at night past seven and back to work about eight and worked through till five and uh that saw me through it yeah it was great you could see the difference in the men when the sun came it was just like uh with plant life they blossomed they weren 't grumpy and uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blizzards were quite an experience you have a white house when the visitors come if you 're caught out in those it 's like being in a dark room that you don 't know north south east or west so if you 're out going in the field and traveling quick thing is to shut down show up the parker tents that we lived in they were quick to erect and uh stay put until the blizzard passed over most of us in if we were back in the base and we 've just stayed indoors but the engines in the powerhouse had to be refueled so it was your turn to go down and refill and keep up to the engines that was an experience i can remember they had a blizzard lines down which he hung onto holding onto the blizzard line my legs were just straight out i thought well if i let go there 's a blizzard line i 'll finish up out in the sea ice and halfway home to australia we were close enough to we used to have the russians call occasionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where their beds and uh all but they they proved themselves to be very friendly when they flew in to our base they had aircraft where they could fly all through the year but we didn 't our aircraft going down there for three months they all came home but we had the experience with the russians that had been caught out on one of their bases for 10 days without supplies and they passed in they landed on our base and they were absolutely exhausted and starving but they were very reluctant to eat our food they said oh you might need it but we convinced them to eat with us and then we let them our beds were every man only had his own bed but we shed so they they took our beds and slept for quite a few hours but in return for that we needed some welding electrodes and we were short and they knew so a week later they flew back and bought a swelling electrodes and they they were very friendly they wanted to know all about where we lived in our family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to man to men it was yeah they were just the same as we were they uh very friendly and normal people was great [Music] so i think that 's my life i 've had a wonderful life and always i 'm lucky to live to where i am,"(-36.7142554, 142.2016929)"

Grenfell,xMGQspjqr2Q,20210610,3322.559,"Roberts Ave, Horsham VIC 3400, Australia",10905,my name is robin gallen and i 'm the mayor of horsham rural city council i would like to welcome you to tonight 's covert vaccine live q a with dr rob grenfell dr grenfell is a registered medical practitioner in public health specialty general practice specialty with the ahpra australian health practitioner regulation agency rob has over 25 years of gp and public health experience he has developed and implemented regional and national immunisation programs he has also developed and coordinated gp and community level immunisation programs welcome rob and thank you for taking the time to join us tonight look uh thank you so much rowan for this opportunity to speak to the community tonight and uh and probably actually take people through the journey of uh the this virus and also uh attempt to answer a lot of the questions that people have got and i think through my talk i 'll probably answer many of the questions that people will be asking and again thank you so much for those that have already submitted their questions uh and also for those who will be submitting their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the q a session so uh again too robin i would like to acknowledge the traditional owners on this land that uh that we 're speaking on today and pay my respects to the elders past present and emerging i was very fortunate to grow up in the wimmera and uh to also be educated here and after i actually started out as a doctor a number of years after that came back to practice here in nutty mark where as a gp in a public health physician i was engaged in as robin said a number of the immunisation programs one figure that i want you all to remember and to be proud of is that in the late 90s to the early 2000s we became the most immunized area in australia and held that title for 10 years running and importantly even in some of the hard-to-reach groups and the indigenous groups we achieved up to a hundred percent uh actually adherence with the childhood immunization schedule so something that we should be really proud of in this region and something we held on and something that i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we talk through where we 're moving with regards to this virus now this is a i 'll share my screen and bring through to you uh here we go so bang we 're now sharing so this is uh a picture of the virus itself and this is the uh sample of the wuhan one which uh arrived in australia in january of uh 2020 and uh this virus itself was grown in our laboratory that csiro 's laboratory down in geelong and allowed us to start working on candidates that would in fact get us out of this problem so this of course actually created a great degree of pandemonium and uh most of us actually panicked to a large degree and uh emptied our shops of particularly things like toilet paper in one sense pasta rice and a whole range of other things and the chaos that 's actually caused in our community over the last number of months has also been insurmountable one of the big questions everyone asks is where did this virus actually come from now the coronaviruses are a family of viruses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of covert 19 uh in the past now sars came out uh in uh certainly in singapore and canada back in the early 2000s and it was actually very nasty it had a fatality rate of 25 that is a quarter of people who got it died um and it was actually controlled um uh over a very rapid period by isolation mers was even worse now mers actually appeared coming out of the middle east but uh certainly created a great degree of trouble in korea uh in south korea where it had a fatality rate of up to 40 so really really nasty um so covert 19 when it appeared was something of a family of viruses that we already knew about now this is a class of viruses that come from animals to humans and it 's important to reflect that so many viruses that actually affect us come from animals to humans influenza is one of those and influenza comes certainly amplified in chickens and pigs so hence the reason why we have avian flu or or swine flu examples uh and bats align as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and certainly people in contact with those and there are many other things that actually come from the animal space and most of these are the emerging diseases now some of the things that we 've learned many people say well not many people seem to get that sick from covered well the answer here is that around about 80 percent of people will get a mild or moderate disease and look like they 'll actually get over that so what i will do is talk about the clinical course that is what actually happens to you when you catch this and i guess this is also emphasized in this recent case of the couple that traveled from melbourne up to queensland is how could they have done this without actually knowing they were sick well apparently what 's already coming out of that is that they were not overly sick when they arrived and they actually got sick a little later because it takes up to around about seven to 14 days to get sick the bad part here is that you 're actually infectious before you 're actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a particular challenge for us again think of the flu the flu you captured and you 're usually sick within two days and you 're spreading it in two days and it 's fairly obvious but covert is not like that then after another week or so that 's when the severe disease can start most people may go on and resolve from that point but around about 15 go on to become severe with difficulty breathing and what that means is that breathing can get even worse and certainly after another week or so and we saw that with boris johnson he thought he was getting better after around about a couple of weeks and then bam he actually got worse and ended up in intensive care and that unfortunately is something that actually does occur and one of the things to note is what does covert cause to you and what does actually one of the principal reasons that you actually get very sick or die from this is it makes your blood clot and by doing that it actually causes disease in your heart your kidneys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in who wear intensive care end up there for around about two weeks which is actually a quite a long period of time now that 's the problem if lots of people are getting sick all at once your hospital gets overwhelmed and we certainly saw that in many countries around the world this is uh the evidence from the the american uh studies now america has got the most reliable data for us to make judgments on what actually has happened but what 's important here is in 2020 covert was the third leading cause of death now remember that heart disease is a multitude of diseases from strokes to heart attacks to a heart failure and cancer is a lot of cancers so covert as a single cause was in fact the third losing cause of death in the u.s last year now that is in fact actually serious and the other thing that 's serious is this thing called long covered and what 's becoming apparent is that around one in three people who catch this virus will suffer for months and here 's what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatigue that goes on for many months they may have trouble with their taste and a sense of smell they may also have a number of troubles with their lung function and also there are some neurological problems that are coming through or even persisting depression so these are these are this is not a disease that anybody really wants to catch it is not a mild disease and again i emphasize none of us have actually had this infection before with a flu we 've had a variant of flu before sometime in our life we have never had this uh infection before so this is new for us and so it is likely that when we catch it we will get the disease and we may end up with long covert now long covert as well um sadly can in fact persist in people who haven 't got that sick when they 've caught it and we don 't quite understand why that is and what is certainly clear is it appears that the vaccine will actually reduce that long covert as well so that 's actually a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are finding that they are actually having symptoms of long covert so when this disease struck we actually looked at thinking about how we would manage this now the red line on here is what happened in wuhan what happened in northern italy and spain at the beginning of this completely uncontrolled overwhelmed the community and overwhelmed uh the population but when you start to flatten that curve you actually then run the risk of actually having further cases but i 'll emphasize the reason why we actually had quarantine isolation and social distancing was to prevent a surge of sick people overwhelming our hospitals and i want you to think about what this means for us by flattening the curb as much as we have in australia when we had the major outbreak in melbourne our intensive care services were able to cope with the number of cases that came through and the survival from intensive care was 80 percent compared to new york when they had their surge their survival was 40 that 's what a stressed hospital looks like so we were very fortunate to have actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to happen well this virus has decided that it actually likes humans and it 's made that move from animals to humans and it 's going to be staying here and we 're going to have to learn to live with that and so i will focus a lot on where that actually means but i want you to carry that on this virus is coming and it is going to actually stay here it 's going it 's it 's made the jump so what does it mean we are going to need to obviously continue looking at lockdown as a way of controlling its spread and many countries in the world are still using this measure measure to do that we 're going to need to keep tracking and tracing and quarantining and we 're also going to need to keep doing all of those hygiene measures we 've been told about and the issue of international travel is well we will need to keep our borders closed until we 're all protected okay so let 's talk about social distancing how does it work if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread the virus and that 's in fact actually been very very helpful uh in in fact curbing it and this latest outbreak in victoria has again demonstrated that once you close things down and social distance to a large degree you can actually bring a an infection um under control because people are actually in isolation and are not spreading it to large numbers of people so uncontrolled covert that 's the first version or variant of covert one person could infect two and a half the current delta variant is one to five so it 's much more infectious and uh one of those things is i often think about oh yes look at the whimmer i came back to the wimmera one because there 's less people here and less chance but who hasn 't been to melbourne over the last couple of months most of us how do you know where your neighbor 's been and many people go in and out of melbourne we have lots of transport routes and lots of travel routes coming through so we are not immune to the virus spreading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and new south wales rural communities are experiencing this now with the case that had actually gone through from melbourne to queensland we think about social distancing as putting pieces of swiss g 's in front of the virus so if we social distance we decrease the chance if we wear masks we decrease the chance more if we wash our hands we decrease it more and if we have rapid testing for positive cases and isolate them we decrease the spread more so if all of these things have to work not one of them together to decrease spreading it and we 've done so well in this country in doing this i always put this one up i i do get a lot of amusement out of the way that people wear their masks and uh certainly uh as it 's fairly self-explanatory a lot of people are not wearing them properly and uh and and certainly not actually getting the full benefit from wearing them the other thing that in fact helped us a lot here in australia is the wastewater testing as disgusting as it seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases may be emerging so the public health groups have been able to go in and identify those cases and this has actually stopped a lot of our outbreaks some or at least given us an alert to outbreak so we could control them the other thing that 's been absolutely disastrous is the travel industry particularly the international borders being closed has been costing our economy an exorbitant amount of money and is certainly limited in so many industries in the way that they 've actually done that and by capping our numbers coming back into the country we 've been able to also control the virus and how the virus may or may not impact uh just a little bit about what we 've been doing at csiro i have to say the last couple of years have been some of the busiest in my life we 've been looking at evaluating vaccines we 'll talk a bit more about that we 've been looking at understanding the virus and what it is i 'll talk a bit more about that we had to set up a facility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wastewater i just mentioned understanding the virus and how it spreads where other pieces and this is only a small part of the work i 've been involved in over the last uh 18 months or so so let 's think about what you can do for a virus you can develop a vaccine you can develop drugs and you can develop tests and the the the one here that you look at this slide was made before this pandemic you look at the development time normally takes 10 to 20 years for vaccines and drugs and it 's a little shorter for diagnostics so the question i get asked a lot is how did we do this so fast well the top part of this shows what we normally do when we develop a vaccine but i also want to tell you that we actually didn 't start this race at the beginning we 'd already been working over the last couple of decades and my team had certainly been working very closely on sars and mers and other of our research collaborators globally had been working on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are coronaviruses and covert 19 is a coronavirus so really we actually did have an understanding of things that did or didn 't work and also how we could study a particular virus like this and so really we were we were prepared to in fact actually do this so the other thing where the speed came from so none of the science was in fact shortened what uh what actually occurred was doing things more in more rapid succession and the particular areas that slow things down are the regulation and the making of the vaccines so what changed we started our studies and we specialize in what 's called pre-clinical studies so that 's studies in animal models now those models we actually as soon as we found candidates and we were testing three as soon as we found those candidates worked those results were in fact handed for those who started the human studies the so-called phase one and then two and then three trials also the regulators the tga in australia 's case or the fdi and us were actually getting results of what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and make sure that that actually wasn 't going to slow us down and even more so the manufacturers got involved to start making it and in australia were very fortunate to have csl they started making both the university of queensland and the uh now astrazeneca or the zen oxford candidate at an early stage and getting their factories ready to do it so obviously they they 're not making the uq vaccine at this stage because it has to go back to the drawing board but that gives you an idea that 's where the speed occurred a significant focus globally we were working with a multitude of global partners this was a true global effort of which i 'm very proud to say we were a significant part of in a number of these vaccines and this is the pretty picture of the facility down there at geelong very fortunate to have this is one of six in the world so let 's talk about the vaccines this first one the protein based which is what the university of queensland uh candidate is like and if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your body creates antibodies and an immune response to this the two parts of the immune response you hear about one 's the t cell that 's a particular white cell that 's the effective immunity against covert and the antibodies are also a part of that the viral vector which is really what the astrazeneca vaccine is is where a virus that is not harmful to humans is used to carry in the spike protein so that again your body produces immunity to the coronavirus spike protein and this virus dissipates and has no further use the third one is the mrna now this is a new technology and most people say well this is really new i don 't know what it does it 's been on the drawing board for the last 15 to 20 years and we 've been watching this as a therapy and it 's been used experimentally in some cancer therapies and i i can tell you one thing we are i 'm certainly in the medical research here are very excited about this technology because we may find cures to things like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this technology but where it 's worked here is that they found that by putting in the spiked protein codes into the mrna and then this getting injected into the body again produces our antibodies and immune response to uh to the virus there 's a couple of words that everyone 's been getting mixed up on and certainly the press has been making a lot of noise about efficacy is the one that you 've heard a lot about that 's actually a research measure it 's not really relevant to any sort of comparative performance of any of the vaccines that come through from a research level we look at efficacy to say does it work or doesn 't work if it 's actually a nice level of 80 plus it works great that 's all that we needed to know effectiveness i 'm going to talk a bit more about that in the next slide is really how does it work in the population and that 's the one you really need to understand efficiency is is whether the government 's going to pay for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've got an enormous cost so we need to do it the other one that 's creating a great degree of consternation certainly a greater degree of irritation with me is this high concept of herd immunity now herd immunity is a very very difficult state to actually achieve we haven 't sort of achieved that with polio and measles we have sometimes have outbreaks generally in areas in australia where immunization levels are low but polio we have achieved herd immunity in this country we 've achieved elimination with smallpox which is really rare now herd immunity in coronavirus is probably not achievable and it probably won 't be achievable if it is for a number of decades we haven 't achieved herd immunity with influenza we have outbreaks every year and they 're vary in size depending on the strain so that that in a sense is something that to me is actually not uh not on the table the reason we 're immunizing people is to decrease the chance of severe disease and death and that 's what they 're doing and that 's what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about effectiveness effectiveness relates to how the vaccine was distributed we know some of these need very cold temperatures some of these needs just cold temperatures if that temperature is not right the vaccine may be inactive and not work so that 's the problem not in australia our systems are very strong and monitored in delivering vaccines but we 've already seen this problem in some countries in the world where there 's their way of delivering vaccines has not been as effective there are many other white areas so sometimes what we call the host response that is sometimes if your immune system is not that strong you may not develop a strong immunity after having the vaccine and the other one is dense population so the vex the virus spreads very nicely in dense populations as opposed to in sparsely populated areas and the variance which we will talk about in a second that actually changes the effectiveness of the vaccines now this is what a map of the variance looks like very complex but my team has actually along with global collaborators have been following these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laboratory to see if um on cell line cultures whether the immune immunity is developed from uh the vaccines that we 've already got and we test this against stored serum that we 've got now what 's pleasing to say is that we 've found that the vaccines that we 're using here still develop an immune response to these particular variants and more importantly in the uk they have found that anybody who has had the two doses of either pfizer or astrazeneca are not going to get hospitalized or die from the delta variant so that 's actually really good news for us now that 's what effectiveness looks like what are actually happening in a country like the uk so these variants mean and whilst we still have the disease completely out of control in a number of countries in the world variants will continue to appear and it 's quite clear that we will need generation two and then generation three vaccines probably about six months apart until the world situation stabilizes so you get we 're in for a ride here and we need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one has immunity to this virus until they 've either had the disease or the vaccine and the second is you will need boosters of a new generation vaccine or gen 2 vaccine as we 're starting to call them in around about six months time so should i wait for the gen two no you shouldn 't because you don 't have any immunity until you 've actually had a vaccine so there there there are reasons there but that 's just pointing out where the future is heading now this is the other thing this is very hot off the press this is from public health england data that i really did want to share i 've launched a release two nights ago now the uk is very relevant to us one they have a health system that 's really strong like ours two they actually are using the same vaccines that we 're using and so we can see in real time and they 've given tens of millions of doses of these vaccines what they found is that the the vaccines irrespective astrazeneca or fisa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dying and 90 to 95 percent effective at stopping you being hospitalized with serious disease that is really exciting from the uk we 're finding that uh people with the current outbreak of delta that they 're suffering they 've got around about 2 000 or so new cases a day but no one who 's had two doses of vaccine is being hospitalized that is really exciting so we 're looking at an enormous number of savings of lives and also hospitalizations in the uk so that 's another reassurance that this vaccines the two vaccines we 've got here actually work very well with the current strains so let 's talk about why would i get vaccinated and here is obviously a selfie of me getting my first astrazeneca vaccine and i want to point out that not only i 've had it my partner my parents my brother sister sisters in laws cousins and in fact my two daughters 122 and 124 and i point out they 've had astrazeneca vaccine and uh and why because i 'm going to talk about side effects and the risks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it 's also readily available let 's talk about why did i have this vaccine now this is american data and this is very important to actually understand this is the most accurate mortality that is death data for this virus that we actually have globally one of the important numbers to remember if you are over 75 and catch covered you have a one in nine chance of dying i 'm not talking sick i 'm talking dying if you are over 50 and you catch covert you have a 1 in 90 chance of dying not getting sick actually dying if you are over 30 you have a 1 in 900 chance of dying so you can see this is actually a very serious disease american data is uh is very accurate and certainly can be trusted in regards to how it 's been collected so that 's the main reason i had this i 'm over 50 a 1 in 90 chance of dying from this virus knowing that it will come here and establish here i don 't want to catch it and uh we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one sense this um for this the most vulnerable in our community are the most likely to get seriously ill and die from this which is why we 've targeted them in the first instance and the supply of this um has been a problem one has been hesitancy so many people say i don 't want the blue one and all these things and as i said to you are both extremely effective and i will get to the rate of side effects so that you can understand why i 'm actually not as concerned about those side effects as you might think i should be because the question is how long do you want to wait because we 're already seeing this appears to be spreading in this community now what 's happened after this outbreak is long queues and you probably most of you who who wanted to get it or were vacillating saying i wish i 'd gone and got it earlier now some of the reasons and why there 's a challenge in getting supply to us is we have a global pandemic and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortunate to have one a manufacturer on shore to make the astrazeneca vaccine and two a reliable supply of pfizer now that that 's actually been attained and we 've got a number of other vaccines that will appear at the end of the year or in the new year and they will be really used for that gen 2 variant as i 'm talking about so the other thing the reason why we we 're having challenges here as well in the wimra for instance is we don 't have a ready-made workforce to give us vaccines so that 's all been developed around and has been developed over the last number of months to actually get to that speed and to actually deliver this vaccine to the community so that 's some of the reasons one is the workforce to give it and the second is the is the supply now one one question a lot of people have asked is haven 't they been sending all the vaccine to melbourne and we 're missing out the answer is no the federal government has actually released um a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being held for for booster doses for people because they 're guaranteed they 're going to actually replenish that stockpile when those boosters are needed so that uh many more victorians could get immunized at a greater rate so that 's actually the reason why the supply is increased in melbourne so it 's not actually taking it from us let 's talk about risk now the figures released today by the chief health officer actually are are very reassuring we have now actually a good understanding about the clot risk from astrazeneca the clot risk from astrazeneca is one in a hundred now that 's not dying to die from a clot from astrazeneca we 've had two sadly two deaths in australia at this stage but that 's half a person per million now i want you to understand what risk looks like we sadly lose around about five australians a year uh to car accidents per hundred thousand people so i said one clock a hundred thousand from zenica five people in australia die in a car accident per hundred thousand now the death from which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from astrazeneca half in a million that equates to 100 times being killed in a car accident this is really really rare now these figures that you 've seen here on the screen are from america of course america keeps better data than most other countries and i just point out the lightning to die of a lightning strike in america in 2019 was one in 114 000 so we 're really talking about something that is really really rare and it 's unfortunate that people are focusing so much on a side effect like that and just to point that out that you know you could actually get knocked over by a bus after you 've had the second dose was it caused by the vaccine or not i mean seriously uh we have had tens of millions of doses of these vaccines given and they 're already saving tens of thousands of lives and another way of looking at this clock if you catch covert you have a one in four to one in five chance of actually having a serious clot yourself that 's what this virus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually work this one out on the australian figures it 's in fact actually even far better than that we 're looking at a figure of around about point zero zero zero zero five it 's much less than the international experience now this has got a lot of words on it but this came out last night and this is from the college specialist college of obstetrician and gynecologist everyone says what about pregnancy what about breastfeeding they have come out last night stating that they recommend the vaccine be administered to pregnant women at any stage of pregnancy they are suggesting the fisa vaccine in this case and that certainly surveillance around the world has demonstrated from large numbers of pregnant women that there has not been any significant concerns whatsoever with giving this vaccine to pregnant women and certainly there is no problem whatsoever with breastfeeding now i would urge you if you 've got problems or issues with this is one talk about with your doctor or look at the college of omg 's website because this is written down in plain english for you now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and talk about some of this because one of the things that 's got probably probably spread far more wide than in fact actually the pandemic for instance is in fact the misinformation and i 'll just uh highlight two of my one of my favorite stories that came out in the early phase that covert 19 was found on toilet paper and i certainly threw my arms in in up in the air and thought well everyone 's bought all this toilet paper and stockpiled it at home i hope that this isn 't true of course it 's not true so two of my friends that they 're not really friends one 's a cook and the others are furniture salesmen and they and and i 'm actually a public health specialist with in fact actually expertise in pandemics now i do take a great degree of offence for people making commentaries on uh on social media that in fact actually are not experts in those areas i do cook well i make a lot of nice desserts and also very good on the barbecue but i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restore furniture as a hobby and i don 't put that on the internet either so why are they putting covert facts as they call them on the internet so there are many many mistruths that have been said through and i will answer some of those because some of those came through in the questions that people pre-sent in and this really is the frustration that as somebody who works in the area of evidence uh is is that people really are making it up and pitching it and social media has not necessarily been our friend as much in this area um or more likely put those of you can 't read the bottom of this so hey i know we 've dedicated our whole lives to this but this guy 's comment on facebook raises some interesting questions i mean really what you 're reading on social media you need to ask yourself really is that true how could it be true what 's in fact who should i listen to and who 's actually got the facts for you there are a lot of facts i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pandemics and the first one that i really enjoyed reading about was the black death of the medieval times there is a happy ending to this although it almost wiped out the whole human race uh at the end of this was the renaissance which was the uh the rebirth of human uh civilization in the sense of the amazing uh sort of arts and uh culture and sciences and other things that actually emerged in the renaissance so there is hope at the end of pandemics this one here is again the spanish influenza this is a great picture of ingenuity during the spanish influenza in japan which in fact actually uh wiped out a substantial slab of the population in australia wave three hit us very hard and wiped out tens of thousands of australians many australians took around about three to five years to actually re-engage with society because of the fear of actually contracting it and this is actually a really busy slide that talks about there is science behind pandemics and there is a lot of ideas about how we prevent and predict them how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are now and the recovery which i i do want to talk about as because everyone says where are we going where are we going what 's going to happen so let 's talk about the future this virus is coming to this country it 's going to establish itself and we are going to have to learn to live with it we cannot live in the state of having of isolation from the rest of the world and as we 've seen already it may have even established itself already but i do believe that we might be able to bring this current incursion under control but we 're not going to be able to do that forever so we have to get over the idea that we 're going to be covered free for very much longer which means you have no immunity you need to get that immunity and there 's only two ways to get it one is to cast the disease which is not recommended or the second is to get a vaccine so what 's going to happen the future we are going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical distancing and public gatherings are going to be curtailed think of what how life is in the uk at the moment that is a good way of looking at it they have about 2 000 new cases a day the only people going into hospital are those that haven 't had vaccines and uh they are still restricted in in the openness of their society but they are still functioning sadly we are going to move into a position like that or at least a hybrid of that into the future whether it occur in the next month or the next six months it is going to occur um and because as the virus enters this country isolation and quarantine will still persist and for those of you old enough we 'll remember that we used to do this with tuberculosis um that 's just again me being the carbon marshal covert marshals are going to be part of our life um and they are going to be in fact you know qr codes and we are going to in fact actually be drawn apart from each other when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a school kid at horsham high uh how the tb nurse would come in and do a test on us they 'd always find some kid positive and then we wouldn 't see that kid for a while and then that kid would come back to school and we 'd find out the whole family had been tested they 'd found out that someone in the family had tb they treated them and they 'd wait until everyone else was safe so they could go back to work and come back to school and we all got a vaccine against tuberculosis at that stage that type of modeling is going to continue over the next couple of years with covert so that will become part of our life the idea of going and getting tested when we get symptoms to find out if i 've got covered isolating um and uh and and working through that hopefully we will have some drugs in the future but there are certainly not many drugs that are actually showing any promise whatsoever in treating this virus now the other thing that 's actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change and i did mention after the spanish influenza that the society did change people actually avoided each other and people avoided large crowds and things like this for up to three to five years after the spanish influenza and so we are unfortunately going to be looking at how do we deal with crowds how do we deal with large groups how do we go shopping how do we in fact actually go and entertain and do a range of other things and the other problems we haven 't seen is that imported goods particularly those made in some of the countries that have been really solidly effective like india for instance we 're going to have challenges with the supply of a lot of essential items and we did see that through the worst of the pandemic but what 's been happening in india is a great concern for us so if we think about some of the risk activities now this is a very busy slide as well but i point to the far right part of this going to a nightclub is the worst thing you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this virus amongst populations and there 's a whole range of other things that we really like doing going to church and singing singing is a very dangerous thing to do in close quarters with people indoor sports sports stadiums hugging and shaking people and i guess in one sense uh going and doing anything that 's actually put you in close contact and certainly weddings and funerals unfortunately are high-risk activities there are many jobs that are high-risk activities as well we know that meat workers and certainly in the hospital settings any jobs where you 're in close proximity to other people and you 're also exerting itself is actually a high risk activity that you 're actually involved in so in those areas those people in one sense need to be and have been targeted as principal people to get vaccinated in the early stages so if we think about say the aged care setting for instance or if we think about say a supermarket setting or a setting where people are actually exposed to lots of people in close proximity for a greater than 15 or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the virus because you can still have it you don 't spread it as well when you 've been vaccinated but you can still have the virus and you can still spread it at a lower rate but if you haven 't had the vaccine you don 't know because they 're not sick and you 're actually at risk if you haven 't been vaccinated for actually catching this so you really can 't win by actually saying if i 'm not going to take the vaccine i 'll see how it goes the answer is once the virus arrives here it 's going to circulate and you will be exposed to it and certainly depending on your age will depend on how sick you actually get from this so i 've covered a lot of ground for us to actually move into there and i 'm going to actually move now into some of the questions that have that have come up for us thank you that was so so interesting um you have answered a few of the questions i 'm looking at so we 'll start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggest that having two doses of vaccine with different types of vaccine for example one dose of pfizer and one dose of astrazeneca is more effective than receiving two doses of the same vaccine so this um this story came out and i have checked this one out as to what 's the evidence this is a study of 600 people um in spain so at the moment that study is not very strong um it certainly suggests that you actually can do that but a study of 600 people is hardly a reason to change what we 're doing and the other thing is the tta our health regulator needs to be satisfied that it is actually worthy of doing and they will need to have evidence to suggest that they would change what 's going on so at the moment uh in australia the suggestion is if you start with one vaccine you you your booster dose is the same as the one you started with thank you a question from darren if you have had a severe ongoing reaction peripheral neuropathy episode from the first dose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given pfizer as a second dose i see there are international studies that support changing the types of vaccination taken in the second dose but this hasn 't been approved in australia so similar but slightly different to the previous one so in consultation with your doctor any side effects of vaccines are not notified through to the tga so they are watching and collecting all of these but in consultation with your doctor you certainly would qualify for getting the getting a change in the vaccine that 's actually given to you it 's always a question of symptoms that actually occur around the time you had a vaccine as to whether the vaccine actually caused them or not and really that 's for your doctor to determine whether or not that side effect was actually due to the vaccine or was coincidental it 's possible that people can get neuropathies from vaccination many of the vaccines we use in some people do cause neuropathy as a very rare complication so again i 'll leave that with your doctor to discuss but it is possible for you to actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why is ivamectin zinc and doxycycline as recommended by some professors for the treatment of covert 19 not prescribed by doctors is it being suppressed uh the answer is no no one 's suppressing any therapies for uh for the for the use um the the challenge that we 've actually had um uh is that the challenge that we 've actually had with uh with the um therapies around here is that none of them have really worked we 've been looking at repurposing and uh repurposing drugs to see if they do or don 't work uh there 's one antiviral that uh um that shows and decreases hospitalization for three days but that 's for a discrete number of people and one of the steroids that we commonly use is decreased start length of stain intensive care and the search is going on for medications that will work unfortunately those three medications mentioned actually don 't work and the the idea that some professors uh it 's questionable in fact actually as to the evidence that they 're using i must say my colleagues that were working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible during the melbourne outbreak were in indeed looking at and involved in global studies to try to see which medications do or don 't work and so many of those that were showing promises in small studies were absolutely ineffectual once they were used in larger groups of people thank you a question from martin how long will a vaccine provide protection will i need a booster shot next year now you covered that can you just one more time for clarity please sure uh you have no immunity to covert now you need to get uh immunity on that the only way you can get that is catching the virus which i don 't recommend in the second isn 't actually getting the vaccine now we have two vaccines that work very well against all the variants now they will um certainly uh give you an immunity uh from any of those variants from serious illness which is what we 're trying to achieve in about six months time we 'll be looking at uh looking at boosters and they 'll most likely be what we 're called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are actually already being sourced to be entering australia into the new year so my pick is uh and certainly many of my colleagues is that six months will be the time you 'll get a gen 2 vaccine and probably in the next six months after that you 'll get a gen 3 vaccine and that 's until we can control this virus globally okay thank you um a question from ian i have heard that the nrna vaccines contain lizard dna if i get the fisa vaccine will i turn into a lizard yeah look uh no is the answer there rna is not dna and that 's a very important thing to actually stress uh and the mrnas do not contain dna and they work at a level in your cells not in the center of the cell where the dna sits and after they 've done their job of generating um the immunity in your cell uh they 're gone and uh so there is no chance that you 'll turn into a lizard at all um but i always often think about the commonality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and uh robin just just sent it i 'll just uh i 'll just take this a little further we share 99.9 of our dna with chimpanzees and interestingly we share 90 of our dna with bananas so um the the answer there is is that there 's not a lot of difference across dna across the species on this planet but there are enough subtle differences to make us certainly a little different than a banana which is a good thing absolutely um we 've got a few other questions when will people under the age of 40 be able to get vaccinated uh david 's very keen to get the vaccine because he 's 36 so how soon will they be able to line up yeah look we 're seeing a number of states that are actually jumping the gun on this uh and starting to offer vaccines to younger ages and uh we understand that the tga will be approving the use of the fisa vaccine down to the age of 18 uh soon and uh opening up to there supply is an issue at the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got is we 've got to get those vulnerable populations the one most likely to die from this far is covered whilst we 've got the supplies we 've got as the supplies increase i 'm sure you 'll find that is as in a number of states that down to 30 will be opened up in the not too distant future and certainly if if they do not control this outbreak in melbourne which they look like they have i 'm sure that it was being considered by brett sutton that uh that he might have opened up to the um 30s and overs as well but i 'm sure it 's not far away and i 'm really uh um uh certainly applaud you for actually being keen to get off the mark and uh there are many people like you as well saying yeah i 'm ready i 'm ready please so keep watching great we 've got a question from leonie now i 've heard this one from other people is it all right to have the astrazeneca vaccine if you 've already had blood clots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what uh the risk factors are that actually mean that you 're going to have this blood clot and most certainly it 's not if you 've actually had blood clots before because it 's a different mechanism that uh that this is working it 's a really uh rare mechanism that develops to cause these vaccine generated blood clots so the uh advice from uh hematologist uh colleagues of mine and uh believe me i 've asked them i 've been working with them on a couple of other drugs that we 're trying to look at to use against covert and they have said that they 're recommending the vaccine either vaccine to all of their patients and that in fact actually depends again on what 's supplied to you and your age group so the over 50s astrazeneca is recommended and for the under 50s we 're talking pfizer and clots are not a contraindication thank you a question from denise will i get a reaction each time i have the needle if so what can i expect for side effect and how long will it last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh many of us uh have heard the accounts of people who didn 't feel too good after their first astrazeneca i was one of those i had three days of feeling a bit like crap but let 's face it it 's far worse than dying and i understand i certainly know that the second dose of uh of asteroids generally passes with absolutely no side effects if not just a sore arm and for pfizer it 's the other way around the first one you generally don 't have any side effects and the second one you um there are certainly a number of people that are actually having side effects from the second dose um so in answer to that all vaccines can have side effects but the vast majority of people have very minor side effects that are managed quite uh easily with taking advanced panadol or something like that thank you question from maxine dr grenfell i am concerned about having a covered vaccine as i have had an aneurysm in october last year also i have other health issues such as migraines vertigo vertigo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your own health issues and your health advice discuss this with your doctor but as a general rule uh someone with all those conditions is absolutely essential you get vaccinated um against covert because the asthma itself is not actually going you know lung disease is not is is not a problem uh is a is a is a problem but also the other conditions you certainly need to consider and they 're not a contra indication to getting the vaccine thank you um now i think this could this question 's a good one do i need to take the initial dose to get the booster or can i just get the booster alone yeah look one of the vaccines that 's not available in australia the johnson and johnson 's a single dose and it provides some pretty strong immunity with that so it 's not going to be supplied in australia what 's exciting from the uk is one dose of pfizer or astrazeneca will actually prevent you from having a serious disease and getting admitted to hospital in the in the high uh 70s to 80 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decreases your chance of spreading by up to 65 so it 's actually very good with one dose however the uh the lasting or the immunity or how long it will last is uh is is not going to be as long as if you don 't have the booster dose and so the booster dose itself gives you more longer and enduring and also stronger immunity so it is definitely suggested that you have both doses so once you have so you know i 've had my first and i 'll have my second in august um i assume at some point down the track i 'll have a boost like how often after the like how often will we need a boost every six months every 12 months after that what what 's your thoughts uh look the way the variants are going uh robin i i would say that uh in six months time you 'll be getting a gen two um vaccine booster so it won 't even be the same one that you 've had in this first time um it 's very unlikely that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would receive in that in that six months time but then after that i 'll need one in another six twelve months or we just don 't know at this point we don 't know at this point but the way it 's looking i would suggest that we probably will and it will be a gen 3 vaccine and thankfully the research goes on um and you know we 're working with with two candidates at the moment that uh i would call say gen 2 and gen 3 vaccines that would actually provide that effectiveness in fact we 're working on another one which is what 's called a polyvalent which um will work against a multitude of strains so you know we 're not resting but you will be receiving a a different formulation uh in the six months time and then in the six months times after that think again the flu that 's reformulated every year yeah now i 've got a question from susan what are your thoughts on allowing a vaccine passport for those that are fully vaccinated so that they can travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on is what i would say i uh um uh the the answer there is um uh at this stage that 's been debated quite vigorously internationally and nationally as to what it looks like once you 've been fully vaccinated we know that you 're unlikely to get severe disease you could still spread the disease but certainly at a much less state than someone who hasn 't been immunised and really the problem with uh travelling uh is who will let you in and who will let you out and the border closures around australia are more a political tool rather than in fact a public health tool so it 's a matter of when they will let us into other states so i hope some sanity comes into this that once i 'm fully immunized that i can actually travel around australia internationally will be a real problem um because yes we do have some vaccine requirements on particular diseases already and i used to manage the travel medicine clinic in melbourne when i went back to do my master 's degree and the yellow fever is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaccine and has to be an authorised certificate to demonstrate that you 're to come back to australia after visiting certain parts of africa or south america we used to have vaccine certificates for typhoid and cholera and we used to have vaccine certificates for smallpox for allowing international travel i 'm suspecting that we will have a passport now it was announced yesterday that we will have that on mygov and your my health record uh but that also means that you 'll actually have to get a my health record and uh get access to that um uh to have that electronic record so we have got time to work that one out but uh yeah i agree with you it 'd be nice to be able to travel around australia because that 's what i want to do and i 'm sure what many other people want to do as well great thank you and i 'd like to thank the public for sending in these great questions and your presentation was just fantastic i really enjoyed it very informative i 'd like to remind people that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page where it 's been live streamed we 're also going to put it up on the council 's website and council 's youtube channel so you 'll be able to watch it again or share it with your friend family friends and others and encourage them to watch it um so we 've got a couple more minutes before we finish up rob is there anything else you you think we should just uh reconfirm for people to allay any any lasting last fears yeah look we 're we 're fortunate in this country that we 've held the virus off so we 've actually been living um a fantastic fantastic time over the last number of months without actually being affected but those of us that have got friends colleagues and others overseas know that this is actually real and the figures i 've shown tonight show how dangerous this disease is and it is going to come here it is going to establish itself we don 't have immunity and as i said there 's only two ways you can get immunity to this virus is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is vaccination be patient about getting the vaccine because the supply of this is being made as readily available as possible and so the workforce and the supply are two things that are constraining that and they are being uh addressed and the reason we 're having an audit and structured program is to try to get to those that would be most seriously affected by the virus first and then moving through the rest of the population and we are ramping this up and that 's what 's exciting so robin i think in one sense i again would encourage people to um seek immunization as soon as it 's um available to their age group and age setting and uh and also maintain uh all of those other public health measures that we have been doing i agree and not only do i encourage people to have the vaccine but also to encourage their family friends neighbors and anyone else they speak to who are a little bit reticent and reluctant and direct them to the council um places i just said the website the facebook page and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informative um presentation and also hear the answers to some of these questions so thank you very much for your time we really value your knowledge and expertise and being a local boy it 's lovely to um to be able to have you share your your um thoughts and and experience and that with us so very much appreciate your time to those who watched um at home thank you for taking the time to join us tonight and as i said before thank you for your questions so um we might say good night so thank you everyone thanks rob thank you you,"(-36.7142554, 142.2016929)"

puppets",TWe9La3IORE,20210529,843.839,"Roberts Ave, Horsham VIC 3400, Australia",2017,let 's get started hi hello and how are you how are you how are you hi hello and how are you how are you today thanks for joining me today today we 've got a few songs and activities about one of our most favorite insects the butterfly now with our hands can you make a butterfly shape so give me two high fives bring them together and have a look if you link your thumbs together you can see the flappy wings and little antennas can you flap your butterflies with me we 'll sing a song flutter flatter butterfly floating in the winter sky flying by for all to see flying by so merrily flutter flutter butterfly floating in the winter sky it 's a nice easy puppet that you could use to make a shadow puppet if you had a light source and a blank wall you could make all sorts of puppets couldn 't you another way of making a puppet a shadow puppet you could use on the wall he 's using a couple of simple things at home anybody have tubes at home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got foam stickers floating around those foam stickers it gets at home and stick to everything today i 've got something a little bit different it 's a little wooden piece very similar to a foam sticker what we 're going to do if you were using a foam sticker you could put a bit of glad wrap over the top of your tube first but because i 've got this wooden token i 'll be able to stick it straight on so with a bit of sticky tape this is a nice quick and simple one and something really fun to do in the evenings before bedtime put our sticky tape on here 's our tube and we 're going to pop our butterfly over the end of the tube can you see that just like that now if you were to get a torch and shine that there through your tube you 're going to get a butterfly pattern on the wall behind you now unfortunately the room 's too well lit in here to uh give you a demonstration but we 'll pop a few things in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for yourself the wonderful thing is you could do anything so this one 's a butterfly [Music] i 've also got a little rainbow here but you could do anything and the foam stickers that you can find readily around have all sorts of different shapes rockets animals dinosaurs you name it so that is a really easy way save your tubes up stick it over the end use glad wrap first if you 're going to stick a sticker on and then shine a light in the other end pointed at the wall see what happens one other fantastic way to uh to play with butterflies and to make puppets is using some pipe cleaners and i 've made a little friend here just using some pipe cleaners some eyes and a little beady nose i thought i could show you how to do that one you can have a go at home here 's our caterpillar and you can also make a butterfly one so we 've got our caterpillar here and then the butterfly who 's got some lovely wings and antennas on the end so let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay so for this you 'll need pipe planners and a finger i 'm gonna pick two lovely colors for the body straighten them out and then wind them around your finger round and and round and round until it 's all wound up one up around your finger you can take that off for now we 're going to make the face now caterpillar 's face so get another pipe cleaner make a circle and then fill the circle in so you sort of want it filled in so it looks like a round disk you want to keep a little bit extra so that you can use it to tie it into your caterpillar 's body so it 'll end up looking something like that grab your body pop your head on top and that extra little bit of a tail just twist it around the back there twist it around the body so that it stays in place and once that 's done you may need to do just a little bit of adjusting to get it done now this is an optional for me i used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bubbly eyes on so i 've got some glue hot glue is awesome but pva glue does just fine so we 're going to make two dots one two and stick on some eyes again you can usually find these in your craft shops or your variety stores while you 're in there looking for your foam stickers i 'm gonna stick some eyes on and you can also stick on a little foam nose if you like so that there is your little wiggly caterpillar puppet but if you wanted to go further and make it into a wiggly butterfly puppet it 's really easy to modify so we 'll pop down our caterpillar and we want two more pipe cleaners which we 'll use as our wings and it 's really quite simple so we loop it over make one loop make two loops and then with your ends so you 've made two loops and you 've got two little bits sticking out here for one of them pull them up a little bit further and that will become your antenna and this other one you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in place so you end up with that shape two loops and one 's sticking up and then we repeat the same with the other one mums and dad this is a really quick and simple activity once you 've had a practice and if the children have a bit of a play and they end up a little bit out of shape it doesn 't really matter okay so again with our two bits here we 're going to pull the brown one up as the antenna and the blue one i 'm going to loop right around to hold the wings in shape now we have two sets of wings now to add this to our wonderful wonderful caterpillar puppet all we need to do is thread it up using the antenna thread it up behind the back there and just pull it up and you can see that that is sitting in there so we 're going to do the same again for the other side pop it up the back give it a bit of a wiggle and then it 's up the back and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butterfly with his antenna and his wings which is a wonderful quick and easy finger pop it to make all right before we go i thought i might use the finger puppets i 'd made earlier to tell a little story about a little caterpillar and a beautiful butterfly so here 's my little caterpillar and this caterpillar had spent all of his life on a leaf munching away much much much much much much much much much that 's what he did all day and he was really happy munching away much much much much much much until one day he saw the most beautiful creature land on his leaf most beautiful creature which was a lovely beautiful butterfly and he just sat and watched as she sat on his leaf and flapped her wings and had a rest and after a while she flew away wow now the caterpillar after seeing the beautiful butterfly was a little bit sad he thought she was wonderful and would have liked her to hung around so that they could play because he 's only got himself on the leaf but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ munching away on his leaf munch munch much much much much when he got to the part where the butterfly had been sitting he noticed that the butterfly had laid some eggs on his leaf and he was very very excited although after he was excited then he became worried i don 't know anything about butterflies i don 't know how to look after baby butterflies and what happens when they start to fly away and i won 't be able to go after them because i 'm a caterpillar and i can 't fly so then he began to worry but he thought the only thing he could do is sit and watch the eggs so he looked after them and he kept them warm and he kept them dry while he waited for the eggs to hatch and eventually one day they did he heard the eggs hatching and he went over to see what beautiful butterflies would have hatched out of the eggs and he came over and he came over oh and he was really surprised because the eggs have hatched but they weren 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were wriggly jiggly little caterpillars smaller than him ah well that 's sad you 're not going to be pretty and beautiful like your mother but i can teach you how to eat leaves that i know and so he taught the baby caterpillars how to munch away much much much much much and they all munched away together on the leaf and everything was fine for a little while and caterpillar taught all the babies what they needed to do how to enjoy their lives on the leaf and then one day he got really tired oh and he knew it would be okay to take a little nap because the caterpillars were doing fine munching away they knew what to do so off he went to take a little rest and he took a rest and he had a sleep for many many days day and night day and night he slept and the caterpillars munched away munched away one day caterpillar woke up he felt better different but better and he thought maybe it was time to get back up and see how the baby caterpillars were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was resting and he had a look around and it was while he was looking around that he felt the wind swishing differently and he realized as he turned his head he had grown amazing beautiful wings caterpillar had become a butterfly just like the beautiful butterfly he loved when he 'd seen a little while ago now that he knew that his caterpillar friends were happy and healthy on the leaf he decided it was his turn to take a beautiful fly away and he said goodbye caterpillar friends eat well and off he flew the most newest beautiful butterfly in the sky and there you go everybody that 's just a little little story that you can use with your puppets that you can make from pipe cleaners have a go see what you think next week we 'll be doing something a little bit differently we 'll be um delivering some packs out to you on monday with our gardening theme and then we 'll tune in on wednesday morning and do a few gardening activities together so really looking forward to uh getting to catch up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered break period thanks so much for joining me today and i will see you next week,"(-36.7142554, 142.2016929)"
AUS,VIC,Horsham Rural City Council,Horsham Rural City Council,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgT1yMLyuEix-Z8VvGlWOSg,Swimming Pool and Spa Registration _ Info session,GegSyBIb38Y,20210311,1087.12,"Roberts Ave, Horsham VIC 3400, Australia",2335,okay as i mentioned um conducting this presentation tonight on the new requirements for registering swimming pools and spas uh the new legislation has been brought in uh recently and it 's basically to improve safety around swimming pools and stars there 's some pretty damning statistics in regards to fatalities associated with drownings pools and spas and councils are now required to establish and maintain and register for pools and spas in their municipality and that in batting basically covers pools that are associated with houses apartment buildings and motels and hotels um swimming pools are the leading location for drowning deaths amongst young children in australia according to royal life saving victoria and they account for 52 of all drowning deaths as you can see there from the graph from 2002 to 2018 251 people or 259 children died in swimming pool related accidents and trainings i should say um which is as i said before is is a pretty scary stat um and it 's obviously something that government is able to control and guess police in a way hence the new requirements for registration owners are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and obtain a compliance certificate to show that they meet a minimum set of safety requirements now this is in line with setups in other states as you can see on the screen there there 's a compliance certificate that they use in new south wales as well as one that that he 's used in queensland so it 's certainly not um an unusual process that has been introduced and it 's again based on the statistics i think it 's probably something that 's uh well overdue um the the new requirements apply to swimming pools and spas that can hold more than 300 mil of water and so these can include permanent pools either above or below ground indoor pools hot tubs and i guess the contentious one is some type of some types of relocatable books so some real relocatable pools such as those which require no assembly other than inflation and not subject to the barrier requirements so the pull that we see in the picture there is a basic blow-up pull albeit a fairly big version of a blog pool but a blower pool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can see that pools which have multiple components such as this pool which has a filter and stands around it or require assembly are required to be provided with a full safety barrier now i guess the thinking behind this is that if i flick back to the other pool um the the water after a certain period of time in that pool will get feel fairly manky um so the inclination would be to pack it away whereas a pool such as the one on the screen now i think he 's under the legislation is considered more permanent because it has a filter which will clean the water which enables it to stay there long that has some fair substantial bracing there as well um so it 's considered more permanent as opposed to the to the inflatable one in the um in the previous photo so that in my experience thus far that seems to be the most contentious issue in regards to these new requirements as to whether a certain type of requires a fence or not and thus is included as part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graph of the process and i 'll run through each of these items individually so that you can sort of get an understanding of the process involved um i will make mention that we 're actually i 'm running a follow-up session at the same time next week um so it i guess it would be it would be good if you could take a bit of time to just digest the information that i provide you in this presentation and come back with any questions that you might have we 'd be happy to run through those with you um next wednesday so the first part in the process in this process is to register the pool of council so part of that process involves contacting council 's building department completing the registration form and paying the appropriate registration fee and i will say that um both council and vba are excellent excellent sources of additional information as well as my presentation as well as my seminar next week so do contact them i know the vba has a lot of in-depth information on this process as well so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next part in the process is uh getting someone to complete the barrier inspection now the barrier inspection can only be completed by a registered building surveyor or a registered building inspector now this is very important an important step in the process and it 's particularly important that the person completing the inspection is suitably registered i have heard of instances recently in various councils where people are passing themselves off as appropriately qualified inspectors to conduct these assessments but they 're not registered they don 't have the appropriate registration so i will reiterate that it 's it 's important i think that before you get someone to do this inspection um that you do check their qualifications and check their registration you can actually check building surveyors and building inspectors registration on the vba website so if you search if you go under i think it 's building search building practitioner and then search their name it will it will show you if they 're registered or not and if their registration is current so that 's i think a valuable step in this process because as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assessment um without being suitably qualified and it pretty much renders the inspection report useless and it 's also a waste of money because they 're not appropriately qualified so just something to keep in mind the next stages in this process is we 're going to assume that the inspection was compliant um and the inspector will assess that against the applicable standard um and it 's based on the date of construction or amendment of the um of the pool safety barrier um the intent of the pull regulations is to require compliance with law at the time the barrier was built or altered and it is necessary to determine the date before spa was constructed the regulations used the term applicable barrier standard as representing the set of technical requirements that were in force at the date of construction of the poor spa or later date on which building work was carried out to alter the barrier so it 's basically the last you take the date it 's the last um date of work that was that was completed as part of the pool safety barrier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next step in this process is that a certificate of barrier from clients will be issued by the person who conducts the inspection and this comes back to the barrier inspection point that i raised before if you have someone who is not registered as a building surveyor or building inspector the certificate of barrier compliance is pretty much useless so again i will just reiterate reiterate please be mindful and do your due diligence as to who you 're employing to conduct this uh but in this instance let 's assume that the person who conducted the assessment was super registered they will issue a certificate of barrier compliance which basically gives your safety barrier a tip you then lodge that with council now it 's required that the owner lodges this with council within 30 days of issue of the certificate and a fee is paid to council as part of that process and then once you 've done that the next step is um that you basically do the same process uh but in four years time uh so that certificate gives you four years uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional works that might happen over that time um to change the level of compliance of the barrier uh for example fences might get side boundary fences might get replaced walls on boundaries might get removed or things are added next to a fence that could be considered to assist someone to climb over that fence or fences just deteriorate over time so that 's the the thinking behind the four years um now if we move on and go back and assume that a barrier inspection took place and the barrier was considered non-compliant based on the relevant legislation the inspector will issue a statement listing the areas of non-compliance to be rectified the time frame in which the works would have been completed and that 's a maximum of 60 days and the date the free inspection so it basically gives you gives you a timeline and a list of requirements of what you need to do to ensure that that barrier is brought up to comply at a compliant level once the works have been completed in accordance with the assessment um and then the barrier is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barrier re-inspection i would imagine will incur another fee um so it 's probably within the it 's within the best interests of the owner to ensure that the required works are completed um that were listed on the on the layer of non-compliance um to reduce the number of inspections that need to take place because otherwise if you if you just do small bits then the inspector 's going to come back and reinspect but there 'll still be items outstanding so it 's a good idea financially even just to ensure that the works listed on the letter of non-compliance are completed all at once and then you just get one barrier re-inspection and then the process um thought that the process follows the compliant chain that i 've just spoken about in that that certificate of barrier compliance is issued it 's lodged with counsel and then um another one doesn 't need to happen for four years another point is that existing pools can be decommissioned obviously to the satisfaction of council which then means they can be removed from the council register uh so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crummy looking pool um let 's say for example that that was on the register but the owner for whatever reason didn 't want to maintain it didn 't want to maintain the fence they do have the option to then commission the pool um again to the satisfaction of council and decommissioner and in this instance they 've decided to just backfill it but if if that is some if that is a path that you are considering going down i 'd highly recommend speaking to the council prior to starting that process to ensure you understand what their requirements are to satisfy them but there will there will be different requirements i would imagine if in different situations for example you might have a spa on a deck that simply needs to be removed whereas in in the instance here you have a pool which obviously needs to be infilled and then the fence removed um it was fairly short chart presentation tonight but i was i was conscious not to overload people with information or highly technical information as i 've mentioned the [Music] building department and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit of further research would be required um as i mentioned the vba has a lot of practice notes and documentation in regards to the process and it goes into a lot more detail in regards to fines that you might receive if you don 't follow the process and even court appearances and that sort of thing should you decide not to follow that process so again i do encourage you to to contact council or the vba for a bit more information that completes session one uh in regards to this information series next week as i mentioned we are having a q a session at the same time next wednesday at seven o 'clock on the 17th of march and i 'd encourage you to submit any questions that you might have between now and then uh to counsel and my understanding is we 'll have a few different building surveyors attending that and we 'll be able to run through the questions and provide some answers in regards to it now i i think the main focus is the full and spa the new regulations for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you would like us to address as part of that information session feel free to send it through to us and we will do our best to answer uh having worked in council before i understand that there are a lot of general building questions um that people might have so yeah get those into us and as i said we 'll do our best to um to address those as part of the session two um well that 's all from me tonight thank you for attending uh we managed to get through without any children fighting or dogs barking so um i might go and give them a pat on the back now and have a good evening and i 'll hopefully see you next weekend sorry next wednesday thank you you,"(-36.7142554, 142.2016929)"

Playgroup,YOruVPLZON4,20200526,1065.619,"Roberts Ave, Horsham VIC 3400, Australia",3037,hi everybody thanks for joining me today as you can see I decided to get dressed up and look all fabulous for a national simultaneous storytime which will be coming tomorrow you 'll be reading this book Whitney and Brittany chicken divas and aren 't they fabulous and so I 'm getting into the spirit with a lovely feather boa bowtie and I 've also got a fantastic pencil skirt here so this will be the story that we reading tomorrow and we 'll be reading and joining in with other libraries virtually schools long day care services and other places all around Australia that we 'll all be reading the same story at the same time so in celebration and getting reneges for this fantastic event I thought something that we could do today used to make some egg cup chicken mass so although you may not have some fabulous props like this at home or you may who knows what 's in your dress-up box here 's something that we can make together today that you can join in where tomorrow for storytime so again looking for materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ egg carton would make a fantastic choice for that so what we 're going to do is we 'll need a pair of scissors and if you 've got younger children mums and dads you may need to have that so as you can see from the picture behind this is where your eyes will be and then your beep so we just need to do a little bit of cutting it out and in theory you would think that you would get if you cut very carefully up to three months out of a six egg carton I 'm not sure how realistic that is but you definitely get two and you get a few out of you twelve packs as well so if you very easily cut around the head and then as you can see you 've got your eyes and you 've got your big pot so the next part is making holes so that you can actually see this is where you got to be really really careful not to poke yourself nice big eye holes can see through our mosque cut lunch I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got they 're doing a little bit of a bit of an average job but that 's okay so it 's great getting to use materials they save them ending up in the recycle bin and you 'd be amazed at the things you can do again just jumping on some of the the common websites that we have can be quite handy all right so we 've now got our mosque it 's got place for two eyes and our beaky nose so what we need to do now is decorate it now there 's lots of things as you can see in this picture here they 've painted them added feathers I 'm gonna paint mine today but you can easily use textures pencils if you 've got some stickers so we might go let 's have sorry gosh I 'm a tenor as you can see we might have nice purple outline this would be a great way to if the weather 's nice get outside prove it a newspaper down pants I 'd enjoy that autumn breeze before it gets too cold so we 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the way in if you want my suppose just depends on what you 're looking for and there 's no right or wrong way just paint it as you like so we 've got purple I might have for him might and a pink beak for this mask so national simultaneous storytime has been going on for a few years now and it 's a really exciting way to get everybody exploring the same book and doing a few bits and pieces in relation to that better paint the cinder gifford is a writer and illustrator for this year 's book and it 's a lot of fun i 'm looking forward to sharing it with you tomorrow okay so we 've got purple eyes pink beak also got a little bit of pink glittery glue so if you 've got any glittery glue you can dab that on make it as fabulous as you like pink glitter and I do have fear as well a container of feathers it would have just come from a craft shop or something like that so I will add some feathers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said pipe cleaners buttons another great use for your catalog was cutting out pictures you could cut out the colors and add them as well so much orange feather and a green feather this is another one of these ways we were talking about following your child 's lead so if you 're working on a mask together having a chat about the feathers and your paint and using them as opportunities to discuss different colors alright so we 're going to go with two feathers it 's a fantastic one of Bernie 's fantastic rustic creations as we 've all enjoyed over the weeks and that 's okay and you 've sort of got two options with your masks from now you could either get a bit of the string tie your string around the edge or alternatively using one of the straw if you 've got a straw handy you 'd actually tape that to the side there I 'm just looking I 'm not sure if I 've got any tape er you do so you can tape a straw to the side and that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just going to stick that second feather on and that might be really handy for somebody young two children that really came to dress up but struggle a little bit with actually getting iron off without destroying it and again if you didn 't have a straw a stick would be perfect so I 'm gonna stick that to the side there tuck that in and then we have as you can see our fabulous birdie mask can hold it on the stick and use it like that so that is a lot of fun nice quick and easy one and would also be really handy for your older children who 'd be quite capable of having you go using the scissors tape and glue to put them all together so that 's a fantastic activity and as I said feel free join in get one ready and then you can wear it and read along as we read our story tomorrow okay so just in terms of if you 've got your younger children and they may not be into a lot of art and crafts or they may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is I 've just sort of a couple of ideas for basic feather play for babies and toddlers these types of feathers are a little bit fragile they do have the spine and the feather as you can see so if you were going to use these for sensory experiences with babies make sure you do stay close and supervised and one of the easiest and most simplest ways is just providing them with an opportunity to play with some feathers is really nothing else needed putting that down both bubs will have a look have a feel probably try and have a taste and that 's where I guess we need to be you know supervising closely there 's nothing wrong in terms of baby trying to Mau them but you do need to be mindful that these ones in particular have been artificially dyed making sure that you know bits aren 't breaking off and all that sort of stuff but it 's a feeling that you know babies and young toddlers wouldn 't come into contact with very often Hawley prefer this so it can be really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to extend it a little bit further using some of the items around the home something like a cardboard tube that 's from a paper towel obviously you toilet roll wounds providing opportunity with baby can export and other providing them to the baby to your child and don 't get me wrong even your preschools and things love playing with loose parts so it 's definitely not just for younger children but you could pop a Halle butt feathers into the tube and you 'll find that children are automatically drawn to pulling them out or if they 're a little bit older encouraging them to have a go popping them in as you can see as it gets fuller feather start pushing each other around so getting them to balance poke that in it 's really good for the hand-eye coordination just the sensory aspect again and problem-solving getting them to solve the problem or what if I keep pushing them in this side and they 're coming out that side what can we do what could we try another alternative or another option and that was using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's full and hasn 't been chopped up for our mice making it 's just making a few simple holes being really careful not to cut this out take yourself and again having the children either pull them out from the tube from the box or poking them in and this one you 'll often find children always you may have observed as they play anything where they can stick something in the top of they quite often consider that a birthday cake so you may find that you 'll end up seeing all sorts of songs and talking about all the different things and again you 're following their lead so if they 're singing start singing clapping who else could we sing the song for they may just like to look at the colors they might just like to play with the feathers use what your child 's interested in to build on further this one because it has been cut isn 't actually a really perfect opportunity have the children poke him in here so they might find this a little bit fiddly depending on the age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fill up the box or even if you didn 't poke the holes in it kick it again open it up and ask them to fill up the cut talking about the colors all the bits and pieces any boxes if you had any leftover bottles as well turn on what absolutely got one here you could fill your bottle up with feathers now just keeping in mind once they 're in they probably won 't come out and not only have you got an activity where the children are filling the bottle up you then actually end up with another type of sensory bottle that we were looking at yesterday with the label off and a few different colors that 's actually quite beautiful and if you had a child that was a little bit overwhelmed and wanted to take some time to themselves you 'd ask them have a look can you see the orange feather what about the yellow one Janet there 's the yellow one purple so that 's actually sort of serves two purposes the children can fill it up and then I can actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the lighter up to the Sun again that would be actually quite pretty so yeah don 't be afraid for younger children if arts and crafts or these more structure activities aren 't quite what they 're into providing them with similar items and just loose that they can explore and build with them as they want is just as fine all right okay and so for our third activity today which is again coming back to our wonderful Whitney and Brittany story from yesterday this one is making hay and Whitney and Brittany chicken diva hand cream so this one if you would like to be a little bit more structured than just your sensory feather plate but they 're not quite up to making a mask this one is a really great fun activity so essentially you start off with a handprint and this one can be really fun some children really love having their hands painted some of them really really detested and some of them sit somewhere in the middle so pick any color again I 've got purple handy so we 're gonna go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I always recommend if you 've got baby wipes on hand I 'll never go astray also a great opportunity though if the children are washing their hands to have a look and show them actually how hard it is to make sure your hands are clean because if there 's any paint left on their hands it shows that that bit hasn 't been cleaned up so there is a template here that I 've provided a link to of course you can use just a plain bit of paper as well I 'm going to use this one but whatever is up to you you could do a whole chicken family if you wanted if you had lots of children and yourself okay so I 've got my hand on there we 're gonna peel him off now looking into our picture here you can see that the thumb becomes the head and then they 've got some feathers up the top here now they 've actually attached a googly eye to the head so you can attach googly eyes and all those look at things I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more readily available and if you 've got little bubbies I 'd like to put things in their mouth pick them off well then a texture as a much safer idea so what we 're going to do is we 're going to add a beautiful big big beady eye and I 'm actually going to add a couple of feet to my chicken so you don 't have to follow any particular template just whatever it feels good or whatever your children would like to do is totally fine okay so the next step we might add some feathers on to our fantastic wings here bear with me just add some glue you can usually find the feathers that we 're using in places like your Kmart or some of your shops reject shop trips all those sorts of ones cheap as chips I 'm sure you can find them in other places as well anywhere that does craft I suppose so I 've applied some glue and I I 'm going to do a rainbow chicken so we 've got green but a lovely big young long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead let them choose the colors of the feathers because it really doesn 't matter in the end they 'll all come out looking fabulous and red just take it red one there so he 's looking at pretty pretty awesome I might even put some on the body perhaps so again it 's just all about it 's more about the fun the process the conversation it 's more about that than anything okay so I 'm going to stick one more yellow one on for the body and then in this example as well they 've also put glitter all over this main parts you can see that here that 's all glittery now although I 'm probably not going to do that on my fantastic feathery one I do have some glittery paint left over so I might just do a bit of a glittery headdress some glitter on the body we all love glitter but again if you don 't have to clear every paint you could use a glue stick and just put a little bit of loose glitter on so there 's one that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and easy craft idea that yeah would really work from baby 's up obviously a younger children might need a little bit of assistance but it 's always nice to create a bit of art capturing their handprints because as we know our children grow far too quickly and it 's always nice to look back on these things and even if you help apply the handprint put a bit of glue on pop some materials out on the tables and then let the children actually choose what they like to do what they 'd like to put on you can make one beside them so that although they may end up with the feathers pointing in a different direction or in a way that you know may not be overly aesthetically pleasing you can make one beside them and then both hang them up in the frig together but yes there 's a few craft activities as I said please join me tomorrow what we 're going to do is we will I will join you live tomorrow so that we can read the story at 00 a.m. which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I look forward to joining you then we 'll have another activity after our read and a couple of songs but yeah please feel free to join me and yeah I 'll see you then thank you,"(-36.7142554, 142.2016929)"
AUS,VIC,Horsham Rural City Council,Horsham Rural City Council,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgT1yMLyuEix-Z8VvGlWOSg,Cancer in the Wimmera - A discussion with Peter Mac’s Dr David Speakman,zhzMs05esnI,20210224,1874.559,"Roberts Ave, Horsham VIC 3400, Australia",5176,welcome to cancer and the wimmera live q and a session my name 's robin galen i 'm the mayor of horsham rural city tonight i am delighted to welcome dr david speakman from the peter mac cancer center he 's currently the chief medical officer down at peter mac and was intimately involved in the conception design and build of the new facility at parkville david is also a practicing clinician working in both the breast and melanoma and skin units both at peter mac and in private practice he has over 20 years of sub specialist experience in both of these areas david is the chair of breast green victoria 's quality and accreditation committee and has also sat on numerous government boards uh wimmera cancer center manager carmel o 'kane is also kindly joining us tonight so thank you both for your time um we 've got some questions to start off we um had some pre-submitted and i certainly welcome questions coming through the chat uh for us tonight too please so we 'll start with the first one from aisha what is the most common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robin so that we 're lucky the couch council of victoria have very good figures about what 's going on across our state and up in the wimmer and horsham there are about 140 new cancers diagnosed every year and the top of that list will be melanoma or certainly a large number of melanomas and then other skin cancers and then next down the next down the list would be breast cancer and prostate cancer the two most common cancers in men and women respectively and then as per the rest of victoria there are a significant number of bowel cancers which again across both men and women is probably one of the commonest type of cancers we see around the traps and pleasingly all of those things we can now see in fact the whole gamut of changes coming along in cancer care so for all of those cancers prevention there are good prevention strategies there are good early detection strategies there are good treatments for most people and even when the disease gets quite severe now we 've got some even more wonderful star trek type stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great and i think the other important thing i 'd say about that is that almost all of those cancers that we just talked about could be treated locally or either down in the likes of horsham at the cancer center at the wimmera cancer centre or with ballarat and there 's probably only a few of those people who really need to come to melbourne uh you 're only for very some specialized stuff i think that 's really important because what uh one of the things that pandemic has shown us is that we need to be providing care closer to home because especially when people are worried about leaving their local community we should as a health system be able to provide most or all these things you know in your own backyard and i 'm pleased to say that the centre down there is certainly pushing ahead with all that type of stuff that 's great correct carl would you like just to give a little overview before we get too far into you know how you you are working with the um the specialist from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center for even before the center was built has worked well with uh we have uh specialists from ballarat coming up every week or fortnight but we 've also done a lot of work with peter mark and our totality health project with them to facilitate people not having to travel for all of their appointments there 's some things people have to travel for and we support that we have volunteers and all sorts of support for them but the things they don 't have to travel for we certainly can provide um at a center so we 've we 've got a lot of really really good working relationships with all of those specialist centres terrific so are there certain types of occupations that see a higher rate of skin cancer in the wimmera craig asks for example farmers or are there other types of jobs so i think certainly anyone who is out in the sun the biggest uh preventable risk factor for skin cancer of any type so melanoma and scc 's obesity he 's those common cancers growing on your face and your arms are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt that anyone who is out working on the land all the time is going to be at more risk than someone who 's not i think we 've been fortunate in victoria to get rid of solariums probably not that big up in the winter but certainly an issue down here and you know an easily preventable cause of skin cancer but i think this really highlights this issue of prevention when most of us probably on this webinar were children no one told you to look after your skin in fact my father always used to tell me at the start of every summer to go out and get burnt so that i would be right for the rest of summer and as it turns out that 's the very worst thing you can do because that 's really skyrocketing skyrocketing your risk of getting melanoma so sunburn under 20 is the biggest single preventable factor and so the all the work done by government in schools especially primary schools to make sure there 's plenty of shade and to make sure that you don 't go out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in youngsters we 're now seeing actually having a major effect on the number of melanomas and other skin cancers in victoria particularly in men it 's already started to plummet it 's all going down in women as well but that 's solely down to a prevention campaign and in terms of dollars spent for lives saved it outweighs anything else that medicine does so much so that a lot of the programs developed in victoria and australia have been taken transplanted overseas to be used in their schools and so forth to to prevent skin cancers we 're unlucky that melanoma is so common in australia but it 's made us a world leader in how to not just treat it but how to prevent it and so i think as we see those lessons come up into the adults who are coming now will see less skin cancers and i think we 'll also find better ways for occupational exposure to be decreased but little doubt that being out on the land is an issue and an issue we need to try and address a quick plug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually running a program for some years in western australia try and increase awareness of skin cancer and provide ways for people to get checked out in regional rural communities where there is aren 't dermatologists everywhere and they 're bringing that program to victoria hopefully it 'll start later this year a bit like the breastscreen mobile van goes around it 'll be a mobile sort of van to highlight skin cancer awareness and skin checking with a team of people who 've got to help you learn and educate you a bit about around that so it 's a great uh a great community program and really designed for people in regional rural areas where those specialists just aren 't around but we 've been lucky to have a few of the people who are going to be doing this in doing some training at peter mac uh both in melbourne but also up in bendigo and so that 's creating a great work workforce if you like of the community to help look after the community oh terrific well following on maureen has asked is the wimmera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so why yeah i think we 've that that 's probably the same answer to the last question in the it 's all that exposure that time in the sun and time on the land and so we know that definitely a higher rate of melanoma up there than compared to other regions or certainly to the city and then the important step that disappears a lot is that non-melanoma skin cancers so that 's scc or squamous cell cancers or bccs basal cell cancers which are the most common type of cancer there is at all anywhere in the world so these are those sort of barnacles you get on the back of your hands up your arms on your face which generally don 't spread to other organs of your body but certainly can cause major problems where they are if it 's in the wrong place on your face or gets into a nerve as they like to do they can be very painful disfiguring and very very hard for people to live with and interestingly we don 't count stats on those cancers at all because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit of a hidden uh issue in australia that there are so many of these cancers and so many groups of people treat them that sometimes we don 't always get the best possible care we could for those people and that 's another challenge for the health system about how we improve that care because even though these things are a bit more basic they 're still very important if you 're the person who whose skin it 's on or his face it 's on yeah very very big issue up there well the next couple of questions are about about freckles and moles so the first one 's from hannah are there certain characteristics of freckles or moles that i should keep an eye out for and the second part of the question is how often should i get my skin checked great question hannah and really something where you can actually you know do a lot to help yourself so there 's an easy way to remember about moles that we 're looking where we 're worried and that 's called b c d so a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you just drew a line in the middle of it look different on both halves that 's something you should go to your gp about b is for border so if the edge of your mole looks like the coast of sweden you know finland with little crevices and cracks all over the place that 's something you should go and get checked rather than a nice smooth edge a the c is for color so if there are a lot of different colors in your mole or it 's changing color this is a sign that you should go and get it checked and the last one d is for diameter and that 's easy to remember because if it 's bigger than the end of your pen then pop along to your gp and get it checked because it 's one sign that it might be growing and caught and be potentially a problem now not all of those things mean you 've got a melanoma it just means they 're the type of mole that your gp your dermatologist or any skin specialist or surgeon would want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took it off or took a biopsy if we needed to and the last thing particularly given the questions we 're just having about what happens in the up locally in the wimmera is we added when we teach young doctors or gps or anyone who 's interested about this to our abcd we add e and e is for evolving or elevated so if you 've got a mole that 's growing and poking out of your skin and it seems to be changing get along and get it looked at one other big important plug around that to hannah 's question is that here 's a great statistic wives are seven times more likely to diagnose melanomas than husbands certainly but even more than gps and doctors and that 's because they 're often they 're very good at the devils in the detail at knowing when something 's changing and saying to their husband partner or kids or anyone else that doesn 't look right that didn 't look like that last month or two months ago and so there 's a built-in way where we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we able to treat it so i think we 've got great built-in systems where people can help themselves and you know i 've been married for 30 years just last week actually well done yeah well the main thing you learned to get to that is to listen to your wife and don 't ignore it so all you chaps out there take some good advice well done the next one 's from robbie if there is hair growing from a mole or skin spot doesn 't mean there is no risk of it being dangerous good great question so that 's a bit when you hear about rules of thumb so usually if a mole has a hair in it it 's probably benign but it 's not a universal rule so if you 've got a hair growing out of it but it is asymmetric or the border is irregular or the color is changing or it 's getting bigger you should still go get it checked but generally if it 's a nice round mole and it 's got a hair growing out of it it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don 't know how well it will show up here we 'll see if telehealth really works there 's a nice mole on my arm there yeah and every time i teach medical students they will i 'll just be sitting there and they 'll you know they 'll i 'll say you 're worried about that and they 'll say oh yes you should biopsy that and i say well that 's interesting because i 've had that mold for 40 years it 's never changed it 's not getting any bigger and guess what you don 't need to cut it off because it 's not a melanoma so should you pull the hair out no you shouldn 't touch it at all it 's just normal but it is a good as a rule of thumb it 's re relatively reassuring if that 's the case and it 's round and happy and all that sort of stuff okay very good um i 've got a question from susan now i would like to hear about new treatments for skin cancer such as immunotherapy that used by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publicized while he was um you know taking time out of football yep very great question and a great news story about how medicine is moving forward so we said prevention is the best thing you can do if you are unlucky enough to get melanoma that spreads to another part of your body to your lungs your liver your brain somewhere very important like that in the last 10 years there has literally been a revolution in the way we can treat that type of cancer and jared is a great example to i know i speak freely about his story as he was treated here and he 's very happy that we talk about it so jared had a melanoma that started on his lip but then in not in pretty rapid succession it spread elsewhere in his body uh where surgery was not an option uh nor was radiotherapy and so he was he got that cancer at a time when immunotherapy had just really started to take off and he was fortunate enough to be treated with a drug called pembroluzumab or a pd1 inhibitor pembro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this you 'll hear about pembro and nuvo and they 're the two main immunotherapy drugs around at the minute and that that drug what that drug does is release your own immune system to attack a melanoma so one of the tricky things about lots of cancers is they find ways to hide from the body 's normal defense mechanisms and that 's the case particularly with something like melanoma so it 's managed to build a defense against your normal immune response and the drugs take away that defense or release the break on your immune system if you like and so it lets your own immune system attack these cancers and hopefully destroy them as in jared 's case wipe them out completely and so what we 've seen in melanoma where when that situation would arise before not many people would make it past a couple of years of life now over half the people who wind up in that situation are pretty much cured or their melanoma is evaporated and kept at bay for years and years and years the first person we treated at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago now and pleased to say they 're going incredibly well still and we 're seeing so what we believe we 're seeing is that in a huge number of patients now long-term survivors touch wood it 's forever you know that 's the plan and so then the next sort of step in immunotherapy so that 's now a standard therapy for patients with advanced melanoma and even for patients from whom it 's just spread to your lymph nodes but nowhere else we now be using that type of therapy on the pbs so not at a trial but for routine care across the board it 's generally pretty well tolerated compared to chemo the side effects happen much less often and are much different to the sort of side effects we see with chemo so people 's quality of life is good and back to jared in his case he was able to go back to playing top level afl football after this type of treatment which you couldn 't say for a lot of people that had various types of chemotherapy along the way carmel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locally which is another great thing about it it doesn 't require high level uh you know plato mac type care every time you have it can easily be delivered close to home you know even in some cases at home but certainly at the wimmera cancer center without any trouble at all so a great advance very good i was just going to ask about the injections i 've seen um sort of something on tv about you know they put injections in and around the skin cancer is that a similar type thing to the immunotherapy or something completely different no i hope excellent relevant we planted these questions sir that 's a new it 's not that common so that 's something called t vec t v e c and that is using immunothera an immunotherapy approach but directly into the lesion so we don 't use that yet for primary melanomas you know for a mole that you 're just getting checked but if your disease is spreading and you 're getting nodules in your skin one way we can try and treat that is using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so to kill the cancer cells that are right there at that spot but also to induce that immune response or that immune reaction from your own immune system again but without having ongoing immuno neutrovenous infusion every four weeks which is the commonest way to get standard immunotherapy we were just talking about that 's still to be fair pretty experimental and that is the type of thing because t-vec uh you don 't want to have t-vec lying around it 's a bit it 's a live virus uh so that is the type of thing that that is uh in tertiary or you know centers like peter mac at the minute might come out in the future just want to touch on them while we 're talking about that the role of clinical trials and how um you know traditionally if we put you on a clinical trial a place like peter mack and you 're in horsham you know it meant many hours of travel and even though like the other way around we provide accommodation that type of thing up here it 's not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other tele trials so doing trials by telehealth that 's really starting to take off again another uh way another area where australia is leading the way is that unfortunately a medical oncologist in townsville who 's not well known enough his name 's sabay savasan but he has driven getting tele trials across australia out throughout the medical community and you know to be honest he won 't be saying this almost single-handedly has driven this change in practice which means that if you are in horsham there 's now a lot of trials you can get on without coming to melbourne and that means better relations with horsham or any regional centre as we 're talking about but that can be done you can utilize the types of things that have come about because of covert so using telehealth to have a consultation with a patient and sometimes on their own or with their family you know in in their home but i think also much more importantly is to have a consultation with your own gp in the room either their local practice or indeed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cancer center because we could do all this remotely or at least a lot of it and even if to get on a trial we cut you you know maybe had to visit melbourne once every six months instead of once every two weeks you know that 's an amazing thing both for patients to be able to access cutting edge stuff like tvek injections but also to be able to do it close to home because that i think the other thing about telehealth that i haven 't seen pushed nearly enough is telehealth 's a two-way street it 's not just about the city telling everyone down in the country this is how we do stuff and we can help there 's an amazing learning opportunity for physicians in the city to just really appreciate what local practitioners what local services have to offer and how we don 't have to do everything in the big smoke and that in fact there are a lot of great ideas and great programs that are that arise out in regional rural centers because your needs must and so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's really a lot for us to learn in in major centres major city centres about how things can be done differently i 'm sure carmel 's got examples of that i was just going to i was just going to ask carl if she 'd like to jump in there and and contribute yeah thank you and and thank you david yes that 's that 's a lot of the work we already do is shared care with people from wherever it is they need to go uh we can facilitate um the consultations and the care at horsham where but they can still get that specialist input from places wherever it may be whether it be peter mac or the austin or um or ballarat wherever it is it 's a it 's a work we do a lot and that we 're very proud of i think we did in one year we saved patients um four trips around australia simply by our telehealth work that we do here at horsham so we 've been doing it pre-covered um and and have clearly increased it since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're very proud of because it makes a difference to our people our community are there private facilities in within the center where where you can have those consultations you don 't want to be sitting out in the treatment room obviously so do you want to talk a little bit about the cancer centers i 'm sure you know unless you 've had need to be you won 't have been there yeah absolutely so we yes we have nine chemotherapy chairs and three private treating rooms but we also have two private consulting rooms and those consulting rooms have very large tv size screens on the walls for us to do our tele health with so you get a really good big tv like oprah-like picture of your doctors when you when you consult with them so you can really that can be a bit scary [Laughter] and but the patients love it they love seeing themselves on the screen as well and we always have a nurse sitting in with them when they have their consults so that we sit behind the scenes we can listen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever instructions they 've been given by their own their oncologist or their hematologist or or whatever whoever that console i think she 's frozen we understand what 's being said and help them oh no no you 're going again did you get all of that yes i think we did thank you carmel um i think that 's the most important thing for those watching that um the access to the specialist locally and the access to treatment locally is is just first first class and we 're certainly very very lucky to um to have that um i 've got a question from penny uh thanks for the presentation david you talked about the positive outcome of students being sun smart has there been a downside to reduce exposure to vitamin d in other areas of our health that 's a great question and and frequently comes up and i think the there 's two aspects to that one is that the downside of getting a melanoma is pretty significant so it 's a it is a cancer with a terrible reputation is still for a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means it 's chance the chance that it can spread elsewhere very rapidly is very high and so the vitamin d argument has got to be balanced up again what what is the downside of a low vitamin d and i think there 's a lot of a lot of people who are having a looking at the cause and effect of vitamin d and i think it 's not we not even in medicine we 're not quite sure about it so much so that if you 've actually had a vitamin d test with your gp lately you might notice that the reference range so what 's abnormal and normal has actually changed considerably and so levels that we previously considered low are now considered normal and so probably there 's a lot of people in vitamin d supplementation where it 's not necessary so think the message about that is if it only takes five or ten minutes of sunlight a day usually in a country like australia and certainly out in in a country region to let your body metabolize or convert enough vitamin d so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d deficient and the testing of that as i said is now much better and it 's much easier to address that you know with a bit of vitamin d supplementation than getting a sun you know then risking getting a sunburn so i think should we heed that relatively speaking preventing sunburn and and staying out of the sun in a sensible manner which is really what sunspot 's all about it 's not never go in the sun it 's about particularly in the heat of the day we have all sorts of ratings now for sun protection but we know in australia that between roughly between 10 a.m and 4 p.m 5 p.m that 's the worst time to be out but getting sun getting a bit of your daily dose of sunlight between 7 00 am and 9 p.m or later at night you 're much less likely to put yourself at risk of skin cancer but you 'll get plenty of sun to keep your vitamin d where we need it thank you we could sit here for another hour or so i reckon but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to thank you david and carmel for joining us tonight and providing this insight into to cancer and the options for treating that in the wimmera and i 'd also like to thank those who the participants the the community members who who 've sat and watched this and and um we 're getting thank yous from from people who are who have sat at home and watched and this will be recorded it has been recorded and will be placed up on the council facebook page very soon so thank you both very much and maybe we might do this another time on a slightly different topic so thank you very much my pleasure thank you and uh look after that wimmera cancer center please yeah yeah it 's a great place they do a great job though you 're very welcome thank you and if anyone wants to contact me with any other questions more than welcome at any time terrific thank you very much rydo we 'll talk again thank you bye,"(-36.7142554, 142.2016929)"

Playgroup",LfHKrFwpgJg,20200504,920.74,"Roberts Ave, Horsham VIC 3400, Australia",1857,hi everybody welcome to another week of virtual playgroup this week we 'll be looking at extending some of the things Sarah did last week with being active at home and also looking at some activities we can do based around rainbows so firstly what we 'll start off with is the warm-up song that we know from last week it 's a really good one particularly our weather gets cooler to get us moving around and [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] as we go along I think all right so following on this week we thought we would run through and I would like to each other you make at home which is on some Fitness dice and they 're really really simple and we 'll have some templates available but basically they just give you some ideas of activities little stretches movements you can do rolling over bar stretch jumping and then we 've made a second one as well which is just hopes I supposed to self-direct a bit more which has got some numbers on it and they 're easy accessible free and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way and it 's come up as jumping genic how many oh six okay so then that 's quite then you do what are on the dice one two three four five six what 's next let 's have a look Oh stretch how many to go stretch one stretch two and this is a great activity that kids can do by themselves or they can get you involved as well something quick and easy so we 'll do one more five jogging in place so that 's a nice easy one as well two three four five nice quick accessible ideas at least get you started get you warmed up if you 're not really keen on doing the full song this is a nice easy way to go through things as well alright so today we wanted to talk about so it 's going on to a healthy eating senior again is eating at a rainbow so a lot of our healthy foods and vegetables and fruits within your color rainbow so you have red things orange things yellow green and blue and so this little printable is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at things and vegetables that you know for a convention you know maybe someone you don 't know or would like to try and just do a bit of coloring and there 's a few different ways we could do it so that 's some of that we might do blue so you might decide to work on this by saying I 'm going to color in every blue food that I 've eaten and so I 've eaten blueberries so I 'll color them in what else is on the blue spectrum oh okay so got blue over here purple over there so I might say well I 've eaten grapes purple grapes so color that one in and eggplant now I haven 't eaten a clamp before but maybe it 's something I 'd like to try so maybe he said as you 've gone through and colored each one so what else have I eaten red apples red apples and I 've eaten orange carrots so once you 're done a bit of coloring you might work out that there 's actually a few of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eaten them before and it might be a great way to start your shop next week have a look at well is it one new fruit or veg that I can add in and then hopefully complete my rainbow of fruit and vege your other alternative is you could always start off with looking at the whole rainbow under siding I 'm going to color in the ones that I would like to try all the ones that I know so there 's a few different ways you can do this coloring of course you could just color it in because it is a fantastic little template with lots of healthy fruits and veggies on it but there 's many many ways you can use it to also get us thinking about oh whoa if I 'm a little bit more maybe we could look up a new recipe try a new recipe pull something out that you haven 't done before and have an experiment and you know what it 's okay to have a try and not be keen or it not work out so well it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use this little colorable it 's an awesome activity just to sit down and color in all the different fruit and veg but there 's also many many ways we can use it to see what else we might be interested in but I 'll keep working on that one later all right so following on from our rainbow theme and the fact that we do have been a little bit acting the last couple of weeks he 's making rainbows so the next slide coming up is actually a little another action song that 's a nice one to enjoy a little bit more and slower tempo and so to do that I wanted to make some rainbows to go along with that just make it a little bit more interesting a little bit more fun so I had a look in the cupboard and I found a couple of quick options the first one being literally just a few lengths of wool in different colors tied together in a knot and that makes a really wonderful flowy rainbow to flap around another option and something that we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's just using some streamers of different colors and again nice wavy resource a little bit of masking tape on the end nice and easy that 's a really fun one and also for those of you with younger children babies and toddler they often like to tear things up so yeah giving you trouble as little things like rolls of crepe paper that they can tear up and just play with and throw around you know harmless old catalogs for your supermarkets as well is another great one give that to Bubbe and let them have a bit of a rip in a tear or throw in and they can explore as well but for now we 're going to do some rainbow dancing it 's a nice couple minute nice long one so I 'll go through the actions and something that you can join in with too at home [Music] around [Music] I [Music] [Music] that 's a really fun one just a nice slow-paced one and we all love rainbows okay and one last activity that I 'd like to run through today very very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butterfly painting so this song will be one that mums and dads grandmas and grandpas have obviously done many many times before but it is always a fun one so if you remember rainbow paintings are where you fold your page in half pop it off the painting paint on fold it back over to smooth it out and then you get to see a beautiful called butterfly paintings but you can see the lovely lovely patterns and often make rainbows so this one was one that was done with different shades of golds and yellows and this one is more primary colors but I 'll do a quick one for you and I apologize that you can 't set the table so piece of paper fold it in half you can get any kind of paints just your regular paint it 's glitter paints now metallics any kind of paint you only need a little bit so we might do a couple of blobs I 'll show you in a minute I do apologize that the table is hidden and this one 's really good topless and help with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other thing you can do is pick your colors so you know do your red and blue yellow and blue and get them mixed together and get your secondary colors air which is really interesting bit of a science thing okay so got our paint blobs I 'm gonna pop it together and you want to give it a rug alright give it a bit of a rub smooth the paper out and then when you open it up see what you 've got and this one is a full blob butterfly and you can see that through colors have mixed together and sometimes if you think there might be more to do with it you can join it back together this is much easier on a table so pop it onto a table to smooth it down and you 'll have much better results that 's okay it 's all about having a go let 's see how we go now very nice these are fantastic and yet a good fun for making rainbows and Colour paintings for those of you again with younger children or younger toddlers an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly get a plastic pocket and pop a little bit of paint inside open it up just pop a little bit in there bare with me and then these can be long lasting activities through these ones in the plastic pockets so good for any age I suppose because they 're a little bit more durable keeps things protected do in my pocket I 'll put some paint and what you would do is seal that up you can either pop it on the table or pop it on and we know something vertical as well and let the children actually have a go and rubbing that and they get the sensation of feeling the paint and the cool texture there 's actually no touch so say for your little buddies that will allow have to touch everything and put it into their mouths and you still get the same color mixing actually feels quite nice in the pocket as I said that one you know if you leave that one taped up but you know sort of accessible or up against a window where the Sun can shine through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's a really nice mess free way of exploring colors rainbows and paint but anyway thank you for joining me today they 're today 's activities or you 'll see me again tomorrow and on Wednesday for some more activities then yeah we will go from there but thank you very much for joining me today,"(-36.7142554, 142.2016929)"

playgroup,h0VR_GjaEfw,20200907,801.8389999999999,"Roberts Ave, Horsham VIC 3400, Australia",1519,good morning hello everybody [Music] hi hello and how are you how are you how are you hi hello and how are you how are you today i hope you 're well for our very special baby bounce session about change table songs you know you don 't really have to do heaps of extra stuff with baby because your routine moments in the day are full of opportunities to stimulate babies mind and language and body all sorts of learning that goes on at baths and meal times and of course on the change table so let 's do some change table songs open shut them open shut them give a little clap open shut them open shut them lay them in your lap creep them creep them creep them creep them right up to your chin open wide your little mouth but do not let them in shake them shake them shake them shake them shake them just like this roll them roll them roll them roll them blow a little kiss [Music] classic classic and a goodie and guess what you know if let 's just say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day and you sang that song every time you changed bubby 's nappy that would be 10 times 365 days that 's 3650 times that you would sing that song and you say open and shut them four times now i 'm not good enough to do that number times four but that 's an awful lot of times to hear that this means open and this means shut so just singing that one song every time you change bubby 's nappy is huge for babies learning and in particular language development another one that 's a classic with babies is peekaboo [Music] i see you i see you i see your button nose i see your tiny toes i see you peek a boo let 's do it again peek a boo peek a boo i see you and i see you i see your butt and nose i see your tiny toes i see you peek a boo bubbies love the surprise and the excitement of peek-a-boo and it 's also teaching them about object constancy which is the idea that objects are still there when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @

Ave, Horsham VIC 3400, Australia",7922,"and so you can see me a little more clearly I just really want to acknowledge before we get into the speakers that many many of you I 'm sure that have come on here tonight have been involved in this project over the past year and you 've probably attended meetings and made submissions some of you I know are concerned about some of the aspects of this project others of you might be new to the project and simply coming along tonight to find out what 's happening what it 's all about so our aim our aim tonight is to provide you with information about what 's what 's just happening with this project so we 're going to with that we 're going to move into the speakers and I 'm going to invite Kevin Kevin Kevin to welcome us here on behalf of the council 's so we 'll just take a moment while Kevin unmutes and comes up you Kevin I know Kevin 's on here somewhere so I 'm just I just unmuted can you buddy hear me yeah loud and clear thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledgement of country statement we advise the five traditional owners group of this land the what to Bullock megara jabber Gulch Java and Java jolly people we recognize the important and ongoing place that all indigenous people hold in our community we pay our respects to the elders both past and present and commit to working together in the spirit of mutual understanding and respect for the benefit of the broader community and future generations and welcome to to everyone tonight coming on tonight 's fantastic to see such numbers attending this webinar the just to provide some context the council adopted the city to River master plan at the end of last year and since that particular point in time we have been working through looking at how we 're going to roll out the various sub precincts for the component so as we call them up the master plan the first sub precinct is the riverfront activation so we 've worked along now to identify who the key of those who need to be involved in this from a part of establishing the community reference group not just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a process of recruiting community members which we 'll hear a bit more about later on so we 've committed resources to roll out this first sub precinct planning also being mindful that we have got some funding available to deliver on this stage 1 both through the federal government and also counsels contribution so we 've got it gives us a very good start to look at the first time precinct but we 're very mindful also that we want to make sure we achieve a very good outcome around our planning for a sub precinct one so we 're excited that we 've been to progress that sub-freezing planning particularly in the context of carbon 19 and very respectfully engaged with the reference group who are keen to continue to to advance the planning and we we certainly appreciate the attendances tonight or any just in the project in the fact that we 've been able to to abroad have brought our information provided to the community in the current environment so we really appreciate that so that 's just a bit of a snapshot I hit up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Council I 've got the overall responsibility within my director of this particular project and I 've got a number of staff working with me on the project as well and we 're really looking forward to what the this project and the various sub precincts as we develop them over time will deliver for awesome okay thanks thanks Kevin for that introduction just a reminder to people if you want to turn your videos on please feel welcome to have your videos on I noticed some have them off it 's totally totally up to you and if you 've got questions I know questions will start to arise as you hear more speakers please put your questions into the chat room I 'm now going to introduce Carolyn handoff she 's the manager for arts culture and recreation and she 's going to give us some context for the project so thanks Carolyn just wait while Carolyn unmute you 're having trouble unmuting Keith you might need to help Carrick see if you can unmute Carolyn she 's nodding to say she 's having problems yep there we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see you all here and hallo to the community reference group members who I can see across the screen and I recognize quite a few names of people who have registered for tonight 's session and Kevin 's given a little bit of context and I just wanted to give you a little bit further detail particularly around the engagement component of the project going forward and soon you 'll will also speak more about the technical aspects of the project and then happy to answer any questions that people might have Devon mentioned before that the riverfront precinct is the first stage of the master plan that was endorsed by council late last year with some amendments I want to recognize that the master plan process has been you know challenging and it 's prompted lots of debate and lots of discussion and plenty of them commentary and feedback and it 's been some excellent ideas that have been generated from the community so through that master planning process there were some 700 plus formal submissions made and quite a lot of direct engagement with with community community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the of the council master plan proposition so I just do want to acknowledge that there were some groups there particularly three groups that were only not engaged enough or not enough and not broadly enough in that master planning process and and now with a croquet Club the Tennis Club and the miniature railway so council recognizes that and and we 've really looked at reflecting on how do we move from that master planning high-level long term concept ideas to the more detailed discussions and planning that is really the next part of the process and that 's where we are at the moment we 're moving to the first phase of of the project the riverfront being being that particular precinct so the way that we 've gone about that from council perspective and acknowledging and recognizing you know some of the tensions and anxieties that the master planning process has caused is to look at structuring the more detailed precinct planning in in a way that gives greater voice to the community so there are three key groups that have been established and so from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city to River will follow very much this similar model so there is an internal working group which is made up of whichever precinct we 're talking about so I 'm going to talk that in the context of of the riverfront and project the land owner and bridge gauge and land Council so dope is the landowner along the riverfront strip that we 're looking at for this particular precinct and there 's also council staff from various departments that 's it on that internal working group there 's an administrative group that looks at managing the administration and the running of the project in addition to the internal working group with Bridget gage and land council and built on that group there are two other groups that are responsible for components of the project one is a technical reference group or a technical working group and that 's the group that Sue references and gets feedback and information from any consultants that are subcontracted onto the project will sit within that technical group and groups like the CMA again Bridget gage and land counts or Dell and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we cover any legislative or any bureaucratic requirements within planning schemes and regulations so the technical component there 's an internal working group and the last part which is really critical and part of tonight 's conversation and introducing you to is the community reference group and the community reference group is made up of it 'll be different for every precinct but the model will still apply so in the case of the riverfront the riverfront area we 're looking at particularly groups that are located in the space so in in this case the representation on the on the community reference group includes a representative from the rowing club and also the angling club because they 're situated in the area that we 're actually talking booking with there are also some neighboring neighboring representation so caravan parks represented and also there are three community reps on on the community reference group and they were put through it will put forward an expression of interest to to be part of the community reference group is a weapon we have three members and they 'll introduce themselves tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the architecture of what we do in relation to delivering the first part of the city to River precinct plans is is really the intention for this particular group and we 've set a number of pretty clear terms of reference and we also have set up a draft engagement plan and the group will be primarily focused on looking at ways to there 's actually a statement that the group are actually working towards which is how how do we as a group and how do we as part of a project group really make the wimmer riverfront and even more inviting place for everyone now and for generations to come and that challenge is going to set the core of the work that we do in relation to looking to activate the riverfront in in this first precinct I 'm mindful the time that we have but I just really think it 's important that people who are here tonight understand that there is I suppose an attempt to look at creating some clear and transparent methods of actually working on advancing the riverfront drawing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I just would like to note that of the submissions that have been 700 plus submissions that have been made through the master planning process nearly 500 of them referenced the riverfront and that 's really really critical and valuable information that 's actually been collated shared with the community reference group i 'm shared with the Nicoll reference group and that and the internal working group and it informed the landscape architects that will actually take some of the broader concepts into some concept plans that can be costed those concept plans once they 're actually worked up will be the material it 's like the next step down that will be the material that is actually the basis for taking really detailed and transparent consultation processes which we led by the crg out to the public how long that takes and within the current context of Kovach is we 're not sure we 're not really sure how long that 's gonna take but we want to make sure that the design of that is informed by the crg community reference group and we actually do have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we actually have a really robust plan that is within budget within scope and actually reflects truly reflects the intent of our community so that we 're proud as a community of what is being proposed for that riverfront so there 's quite a lot of work to do the CR G has a primary role in guiding directing and designing the community engagement commitment that we have for the first Precinct for the riverfront precinct and we 're very committed to making sure that this works going forward okay thank you Thank You Carolyn we 'll just take a moment in case people want to put a question into the chat lines and while we set up the community reference group because the next thing we 're going to do is we 're going to introduce you to members of the community reference group and we 'll be needing to open their microphones as we go through this process so just just see if anyone 's typing madly into the chat line with a question okay we are going to go first Andrew sauce time Andrew if you we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the community reference group and we 'll finish with each chair who 's going to say a few more words on behalf of the committee but Johnny you 'll be going last we 'll start with we 're going to go alphabetically so we 'll go first Andrew sauce time so Andrew if you could just tell us say hi your name and whether you 're representing anyone on the committee you know various thanks Kimber you 're my name 's Andrew sauce time on my community rep I 'm also the event director whose women River Park runs so I 've got your great interesting in a river and how it goes so thank you thanks Andrew the second person is Bob ridden oh good evening everyone I 'm a member of the community reference group as a community member I 'm a member of the ocean Rotary Club and I have a keen interest in the Riverfront Development thank you Bob we 'll go to die bill thanks Kendra um most people know me I 'm president of the ratepayers

thanks.thanks right Steve I Steve Parrish on on the group representing the whole shebang glee club you 're looking forward to some good fishing obviously oh yeah there will we go well it 's well it 's nice that we 're able to these last couple of days sue Jones [Music] being for sued muted Keith 's just unmuting we just need to take this slowly sometimes but Susan I 'm just looking for us so because I 'm camping her name on here so right anywhere Susan I can see in it okay great thank you hi Sue hi my name is Susan Jones and I 'm here at the ocean Riverside caravan park so really looking forward to all the day yeah things that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kimbra I mean everyone I sit on the my name 's Zack Carey and I sit on the crg as a representative of the Horsham Youth Council thank you great thanks thanks Zack we only and we have only have one person missing tonight and that 's Michael Stewart he apologized he couldn 't get here tonight he 's representing the land Council on the crg and that leads us to be introduced to Johnny Gorton who is the chair of the crg so welcome Johnny thanks Kimbra evening everyone my name 's Johnny Gordon I represent the aboriginal Advisory Committee on this group and last week Dave I was lucky enough to be pictured thank the guys on the CEO g4 that I personally interested in the riverfront stems from being a kid growing up here and swimming in the river I also fish but also I 'm gonna watch a bike man so I have a keen interest in the river with the cultural heritage aspect and growing up and learning some of the traditional stories and you know the river is the life blood that runs through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ERG is that eventually we all get to sit in the same room because we haven 't had a chance to do that yet and you know meet each other in person we 're pretty diverse Bunch and there 's a few few younger guys like Zack who 's probably easily the youngest and you know it 's good to see that we 've got a yeah the youth always represented a challenge I suppose for the group is to not only make the riverfront more inviting and you know appealing for everyone now for everyone that comes after us but also to ensure that the community voice is heard you know everyone knows the the historic face the history of the Cedar River master plan and the potential lack of consultation so I hope you know us as a group can ensure that we can come up with some way to have good engagement with the community and make them feel like a part of it and they come along the journey rather than you know feeling like from the outside looking in so you know some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three meetings that we have we 've had sorry you know the terms of reference and make sure that we 're clear about our role and have how we function one of the next parts of our what we 're going to be doing is how we design an engagement process that is clear and transparent 6 feedback an input from the wide cross-section of community that want to have input into this you know from young people the users of the space groups located in space and the neighbors of the space and the Aboriginal people as well yeah we considered a bit we plan to consider the best way timing and methods to do genuine engagement within the Carib covert context so it may mean that it 'll take a little bit longer to do some of this work but that 's probably not a bad thing either because then we can hopefully we can you know we know we know we 're not going to please everyone with the space and I 've been saying that quite a lot because you know there 's such a diverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope that we can do some justice to the consultation that 's fed back over the over the journey that we as a committee and hopefully we can come up with a plan that people will be happy and satisfied with thank you okay thank you Thank You Johnny that 's a nice outline of what the CID is doing so thank you for talking on behalf of the group I 'm now going to go to sue Neil she 's the project manager for this precinct project and she 's going to tell us a bit more about the scope of the project what the boundaries are what 's in what 's out I yet I can see sue and just wait thank you Kimber um I think firstly what I 'd like to do is share my screen which is going to give you a bit of an outline of exactly what we talk about when we talk about stage one of the precinct the women with the precincts project can everyone see that now yes it 's come up now thanks so case so I wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of exactly what we 're talking about when we talk about stage one now stage one it runs from roughly the rowing club so it follows the line along as you 'll see on there there 's a rough outline there a shaded area right through until just going into the show grounds where the new fences that we 've just sort of constructed there so it runs right along that that closely along that river 's edge and I think it 's important that people just understand when we talk about the master plan and there we 're talking about stage one of the master plans we 're not talking about the whole master plan it 's just the first stage and and this is actually an overview of that first stage so I just wanted to see you 'll see these numbers there one through to five if I just quickly show you section one which is up near the rolling club and it just follows along I 'll keep scanning through as I 'm talking section two near the caravan park coming through it doesn 't actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it doesn 't encroach sort of into the miniature well well really it 's just some cuts off there that small stage to the section along following the track and then just over the river as I said it just goes to that newly constructed fence so I suppose just to give you I 'm just going to scan back up to the main one so we can we can just look at that so in looking at that first precinct kevin has obviously I work closely with Carolyn Carolyn and they have touched on the riverfront precinct and exactly what that entails and now we 've set up the reference group that actually have those key stakeholders in it as long long with community as well but there is linkages so whilst we understand that these are the key people involved in stage one there is others that would it be impacted so we 're not we 're not excluding those but those linkages at the moment whilst we acknowledge them we are absolutely focused on stage one so in order to get us to this point we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perry carried that out a month or two ago we 've also done the geotech report where David 's carried that out a local contractor we 've also done a public tender to get concept designer and consultant onboard which track consulting are now working with us to come up with that concept design so the feedback out of the community reference group and then the feedback we were safe in the master plan and I think Carolyn talked a little bit about how much the riverfront was featured in that so though all of that feedback as well as one-on-one meetings that we 've had with the rowing club angling club and also the horse of mutual railway have helped informed and shape some of those hopefully when we get our first concept plan back we 've also out to tender at the moment actually to get quotes is the cultural heritage and management plan which will form an important part as well of what we 're doing here that actually does look a lot as you would imagine there 's a lot of history in the actual site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that detail of looking exactly you know what the restraints are I guess of some of that site which we we understand some of them but it 'll be great to get it in more detail so the constraints I guess that I just wanted to touch on and briefly Carol end it as well is there is some planning and zoning issues around this particular part of the precinct there 's also some budgetary restraints we do have some funding at the moment however you know we can only do so much in that additional funding I think we can all recognize that 's our grand plan will come in a lot higher than our budget and it will be then up to the community and the reference group and broader community as well to actually decide maybe what are some of those priorities things that they said they wanted and maybe we do some of those things first [Music] the so I guess the the where to from here is is really getting that first look at the concept design and what the costumes that go along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community reference group and out of that we 're hoping to get a little bit more detail and a way forward so first stop sharing my screen now Kimbra okay and you 're finished yes I am thinking okay thank thank you sue I 'm going to weekend ago and we 've that 's the end of the presentation so it 's over to you for your questions and we 'll move through those questions so I 'm going to invite Jane who 's working with us to tell us what to start us off on what questions we might need to be answering sure Kim we 've got three questions so far the first one is from David McDonald and he 's asked what council contribution will be made given that 1.65 million has already been given by state government and how long will it take to pay that money back but okay that sounds to me like that a question for Kevin yes it was becoming thanks Kimber so we have this stage so one point six five million dollars from the Commonwealth Government there 's eight hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that 's funding towards the project at rate payer funding towards approach we 've also applied for funding the state government but this stage we hopefully will be able to hear from that from them shortly around that whether we 're successful for that funding so basically the the as far as paying back the amount obviously any grant we get from the Commonwealth we don 't pay back the council contribution of 850,000 is using rate payer funding so it 's part of our our annual budget process so as far as that 's concerned Council has a fifty plus million dollar budget each year and it decides well how it spends its money between operations initiatives and capital and it makes decisions around what it has some funding available for discretionary capital to go towards projects like this it 's also mindful of any new assets that it does develop it needs to think about the increase in its asset base and be mindful of that as well so that 's all part of the considerations that council goes through before deciding to commit to projects but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City River sub precinct one clearly understand what those what they see the benefits for that particular project okay thanks Kevin so I 'll go back to Jane a question just come through from and he said can we receive from the technical reference group a report on the location of historic rubbish pits along the river so that we can plan suitable locations for a cafe to meet popular demand and that 's a question that 's been posed to sue so Jane can I just be clear about that is that the location of historic tips he said he 's stoic rubbish piers I don 't know yes that 's fine that 's episode you know I know so yeah so Bobby 's right the site itself has a number of issues or estates if you like and those actually include like there was an old rubbish tip actually that site that was made mention to in the geotech report there was one of the four holes that are actually asked in a specific location and it 's clearly only could go down a certain distance because there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put into that the total Meredith management heritage plan will more in more detail go into the history of that particular site which as I said is actually out for tender at the moment and then will be carried out but the location specifically for bogs question in relation to the cafe that will be more around the location side of the cafe will be more planning and zoning issue than it will be about where a rubbish tip was so we won 't be limiting ourselves because that there was a previous tip there it was more about where we could push it that will meet their condition the planning and zoning conditions so that 's something that we 're looking at at the moment okay thanks sue and I think we had one more question on the chat line yeah this one 's for our camera line and from David again and he 's asked if the caravan park is represented as a neighboring group why was the limo of Our Lives steamed and model Engineering club not included as a neighboring group given that they 're right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look the there was some initial stakeholder mapping undertaken before the crg was formed and it is definitely theirs as we mentioned there 's lots of interplay here we 're talking about a very defined space and the model and the wimmer life scheme a model engineering I definitely on that border they will definitely be involved as allocated stakeholder in stage 2 and on project control community reference group I suppose the difference between the live steam and I think there has been some initial consultation carry through with both Susan and Mandy and and your group and that 's not just one meeting will be various meetings throughout the process but you 've certainly your club will certainly be included in that stage to see our GE and the Fargo Park is included because their exit actually pointlessly impacted by that particular area that we 're talking about so they most likely won 't be in stage two so ensuring that we have you know there is flexibility obviously in how we manage each stage and we want to make sure that those entities that are located within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that might be the end of the questions is it Jane from the chat line right so I just want to take a moment to see if anyone has any other questions you can do that by waving at me it will take me a moment in that you know you 'll spread across three screens for me and some of you have your videos off and so I won 't see you waving if your videos off but if someone just wants you know wants to ask another question before we close this meeting just wave weight at me and one of us will pick you up so I think we 've got Bob ribbon up yeah just give me a second Bob and Kim desert hands up function virtual hands of people if you can see that on the bottom of your screens people have a question if they put up that outcomes them all right I was wondering about that Keith as I couldn 't see it on my screen Bob 's on them oh thank you I 'd like to know the purpose of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angling clubs it seems to be unmarked and not in any particular use at all I miss what building you 're talking about Bob okay it 's it 's a kind of constructed like a log house rock house that 's what I call it and it 's really between the rowing club and the carpark leading to the angling club okay thanks thanks Bob so you the best person to answer them I 'm happy to jump in there to be honest Bob at the moment and with the community reference group it hasn 't actually been in fact for anything it 's a storage at the moment for council as you may know and at the moment it 's not been really earmarked for anything it 's up for discussion it 's a building obviously needs a lot of work it 's not even watertight I don 't think but um yeah there 's no plan for that at the minute um I think ray white might have some extra information about that log cabin you know just give me a second rail I 'll be with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is empty up until some months ago has a lot of storage in it and old canoe boats and things the biggest problem with it it is totally infested with possums and well when you go inside it it is unbearable it would need a tremendous amount of work to make it habitable at the moment but it certainly hasn 't any use at the moment okay thanks thanks right do we judge I 'm just going to Jane because I think there might be more questions in the chat lines we 've got one from Jill it 's just just asking about what the costings are for stage one I think that might be for Kevin is that um I 'm not quite sure so Jill do you want to ask that we unmute Jill yep Jill so can you tell us more about your question [Music] sounding like we might have connection problems with Jill so the question was what do we know about the costing so I think sue is actually it 's assumed that I can I can talk to that so with councils additional funding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we 've received council has actually budgeted for the actual infrastructure part of the project about two and a half million to carry out some works so in terms of the costumes for stage one I think I 've highlighted this to the community reference group and obviously to Kevin and Carolyn the amount of work that we are talking about is well exceeding the budget now that 's where it will be the community reference group and also the community to decide what they believe are the key things and maybe how we stage even stage one what we do in that stage and presumably information about costumes will come as you move through the design process and you know what different elements will cost that that is actually correct so it 's part of the getting the concept design we will actually have a quantity surveyor give some costumes and I believe that 's very important for the community reference group to understand exactly how much things will cost in order to make some informed decisions yep okay thanks so James got another question from Alastair yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the cafe mean that that is being decided that piece and what else has been decided or what has not mm-hmm I 'm happy to answer that if you like so in terms of the cafe and has it been decided one of the biggest pieces of feedback that we received out of the master plan was that we would have a cafe now cafe site is actually what we need to decide for Stage one we probably won 't be able to afford it folks we won 't but we will be able to set out a sights that they we believe that the cafe would go on so in terms of is it is there a an actual site no but we 'd like to actually decide exactly where it might go should we ever get funding in the future to actually carry it out and build it in order the next part of that question was what else has been decided and what is not the community reference group are working through that and that will actually be on the concept plan which we don 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some decisions out of that the the inputs that came through the first phase consultation through the master plan so that 500 plus responses that I talked about earlier we we can potentially share that as well on online I know ERG members have dude information it 's been mapped as well just referencing we 're on on the first precinct there 's comments made quite dense what what a lot of information that 's being collided and pulled together that 's actually informed architects so there 's no issue around sharing that information so that people can see the level and ideas that have been put forward and and those concepts as as mentioned earlier I mean the crg are going to be quite committed to ensuring that those ideas are road tested with with user groups with located groups within that precinct with the broader community with with groups that don 't often have opportunity to feedback so first those ideas and concepts will be road tested and that 's what 's going to drive the final plan so the question of what 's in and what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been received so that 's the starting point so we 're we 're kind of partway through the journey and where we 've we going to put together some of those kind of costed themes and ideas the CR G will actually design the engagement process to ensure that the community see what those concepts I see the costings slide and direct what what those options are then a final design will be drawn from that so that 's the general lei-lei of how how the project will roll for this particular thing ok thanks Carolyn we 've got a question from died and then we 'll be going to another one from the chat so died yes I just wanted to know with the cafe and we haven 't discussed this at the the reference group but I 'm just as a person that 's involved in business in town just wondering why we would be looking at the community building what would be a commercial enterprise I 'm just thought that might be interesting for the community to have the answer to that as well yeah so there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the you know would we be countably putting money into what 's a commercial enterprise I think that so part of the consideration about that cafe opportunity was to to look at look at private funding in that particular entity so there 's a couple of different models obviously you can actually build it and then lease it out and that 's probably more of a high-risk model for council or else you can get some private investment one of the issues is the land tenure as well as well so whether that can be achievable obviously if we if we put the investment in we need to get someone to run the cafe and then as I said there 's risks around that so there 's a couple of different ways of looking at it but at this stage that hasn 't been resolved because ideally we 'd want private investment but it 's just how we can do that along the river front considering that it 's crayon land and I know in the case of Mildura they developed it at the the rowing facility there and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public and then they leased it out so there are some we haven 't really confirmed what that model looks like I suppose we just opening up those discussions at the moment sparked over stage 1 planning but it still hasn 't been resolved on so something 's still to be discussed Jane I think we had another question yes I 'm least asking would adventure island to be thought about during stage the stage 1 process as it 's on the boundary surely that 's directed to yes I don 't know if that sue or Caroline I can speak Oh Kevin we 'll go to Kevin yeah so there has been some master planning done for Adventure Island and it 's obviously right on the adjacent to this precinct work so we 're mindful of the ideas of what Adventure Island looks like especially sort of been that the further to the west on the pumptrack and further developing that area we 're also mindful of some of the constraints of adventure island around car-parking ideally you 'd have towards the live located in between the two facilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some challenges around that as far as the environmental challenges so we also need to be thinking about what what is the role of Adventure Island considering what sort of play features water features we developments Palestine one so we 're very mindful that they are it 's all part of that connected riverfront and that the planning needs to inform each other and and also clearly understand what we 've also got part of our thinking a regional playground so is that just focusing on a beach or island or is it part of the some of the play features that we 're looking at sort of probably in some precinct one maybe also in so precinct two so the discussion needs to be considered the implications for the adventure park and also in fact it you know obviously we 've developed the pub track and we 're looking at potentially further infrastructure in that area to enhance that area as well so it 's silly that border connection along the river okay thank you we 've got just time I think for one more question that 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be one more question around the engagement about when the next opportunity is for people to be engaged so Jane what was the question on the chat line yeah the question from Jill was are our rates expected to increase in the near future to help fund the project and if so by how much so one for you Kevin so we so and then obviously the increasing but also obviously we need to thanks Kevin I think the next question this last question will be from Carolyn there 's some comments in the chat line that are asking around when will we be engaged next so when will when will the various groups that have an interest in this area when will there be meetings with them and when will the general public get involved we 've heard a lot about the community reference groups involvement but when will we when will be groups that are nearby expect to have a meeting or something to participate with some of the neighboring groups have and located groups have had some initial consultation that started has started the process but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C idea with introducer crg tonight C Audrey will drive that design so they 're in the process of there 's a kind of overarching framework that we 've agreed to of how we will engage we 're just working through that at the moment haven 't quite signed off on that and the next stage is to really look at the detail the who what when where as and wise of the engagement and that will be shaped up and worked up by the ERG members and the representatives in that group so again I think was mentioned by Johnny where were in a particular particularly unusual place from a community perspective being able to meet face-to-face obviously easing out a little bit will be very mindful of how much and how satisfying the engagement will be going forward and again as Jonny intimated that 's longer that needs to be longer because of some of the restrictions the social distancing restrictions or the social gatherings diction is have a bearing and that would just mean that we we need to push it back longer yes so basically what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just finalizing how the community will be engaged and as soon as that 's been done you will let you will make that public to people yeah okay it 's a minute to go and so we need to be getting towards wrapping this up i if you had we might have just had one or two questions we haven 't got to we will council will put together a list of answers to any questions that we haven 't got to tonight and make those available to you next week on the council website we will leave the chat line open for a few minutes so if you are wanting if you 've got any questions that you just thought oh I really wanted to ask please put them in the chat line we 'll get them answered by the council and council will provide that to you by mid next week this has been recorded so please if encourage anyone who wasn 't here tonight that might like to know more about the project they will be able to find this recording on the council website probably too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so we just want to go to a final thanks from Johnny who is the the chair of the CI G to do a final thanks for people tonight so over to you Johnny thanks Kimbra thanks to everyone for attended I hope we 've answered some of the questions that people might have had at the for fun of their minds and if you do have any make sure you submit them into the group chat and their guys from cancel will get back to your sushi again thanks everyone for attending okay thanks very much I normally would say safe journey home but you 're all at home so I hope you enjoy the rest of your evening good night","(-36.7142554, 142.2016929)"

Presentation,Udh6GbX1iIE,20200525,448.75,"Roberts Ave, Horsham VIC 3400, Australia",991,thank you for watching this presentation on the Horsham South emerging option plan this is a presentation for stakeholder engagement and we look forward to receiving your feedback the horseshoe south structure plan is part of a program of plans being prepared by Horsham Council the structure plan will coordinate future subdivision and development future zoning and future infrastructure issues and this emerging options plan identifies the general direction for planned growth and development in Horsham south and will be a key input to the preparation of the future structure plan awesome is structured around a network of highways bisected by the whim or a river the core part of Horsham has developed traditionally to the north of the river Horsham Sark has grown as a rural and low density area with two of the city 's key industrial areas unplanned and uncoordinated development has placed pressure on infrastructure and created land use complex particularly around the industrial areas structure plan project is being undertaken six phases we 've completed phase one background technical analysis and Phase two community consultation round one what we heard during that consultation was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community however there was an acknowledgment that there is a need for increased residential densities and to reduce language conflict with industrial uses there was also comment about a lack of connectivity with Horsham and a need to protect character and Aboriginal cultural history and develop more community infrastructure we 're now in our phase three community consultation round two where we are looking for feedback on the preferred development scenario that is contained within this presentation and the emerging options report on the website through this process we have identified a vision for Horsham South the vision is to develop in a holistic and coordinated way a previous history of adult development we want to ensure that growth protects the existing valued character of the area and leverages of the amenity and connectivity offered by the Wimmer and McKenzie River we want to ensure that Aboriginal heritage significance is respected and celebrated and so to the landscape and natural values we want to ensure that the future community will be well connected to Horsham by road and pedestrian links and will be well serviced by facilities we also want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the key employment areas in the region with industrial freight and other commercial users encouraged in key locations but where conflict with residential land juice can be minimized and managed we 're seeking your feedback on whether you share this vision and if there 's anything else you would add or remove we 've also identified five key strategic directions that will guide the structure plan the first is to provide coordinated growth that respects the existing character of the area this will be in the form of a diversity of housing opportunities different sizes and forms of homes whilst also protecting the valued rural character of the area a key action will be to encourage coordinated development around Haven and along the river or a river while also providing more guidance about the type of subdivision that will be proposed in low density and rural areas strategic direction to seeks appropriate interfaces between learner juices this includes investigating ways to better manage conflicts between residential and industrial hand through use of landscape buffers zonings and other measures number three seeks an interconnected transport network that is continuous safe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars but also connected networks for pedestrians and cyclists the Horsham urban transport plan also provides guidance on potential future river crossings and alternative truck routes number four deals with accessible social and community facilities with growth comes more need for community services it is proposed to consolidate services around existing facilities in Haven and to explore potential for local convenience on old Hamilton Road ensuring that development respects and acknowledges significant Aboriginal cultural heritage sites and stories will also be a key action of the structure plan and finally number five efficient use of existing and new services particularly water sewage and drainage servicing can be a challenge in low-density in rural areas such as Horsham south the structure plan will investigate alternative sewage treatment options for new subdivisions to ensure that they can be developed safely healthily and efficiently these directions will provide an overarching story and future direction for what the Horsham staff structure plans should achieve collectively these directions have gone into developing this emerging option plan this plan provides guidance on potential land uses in key areas and key linkages particularly Road and open space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residents to be accommodated in coordinated development that would be an increase of approximately 970 of residential allotments the plan also sees an increase in retail spaces and open spaces and better use of industrial land the key change areas are located here at a b c and d these areas will have some change in their land use and guidance will be provided on development forms for further detail about what these changes will look like please refer to the emerging directions paper on the council website the areas in red areas where land uses will generally remain the same but further guidance will be provided on the form of future development including guidance on preferred subdivision sizes we 're looking forward to hearing what you have to say about the strategic directions and the emerging option plan you can provide your feedback by sharing your thoughts online via the online forum submitting an online forum sending your hardcopy feedback to Council or by calling the strategic planning department and having a chat these are the website and provide your feedback by the 21st of July thank you for listening,"(-36.7142554, 142.2016929)"

everybody all right let 's start our day today with our favorite welcome song hi hello and how are you how are you how are you hi hello and how are you how are you today good morning everybody today i thought we might do some crafting with a few bits and pieces that i 've got here and then we 're going to tell a story so i 'm having a look around my bits and pieces i might make a couple of animals first i think so let 's have a look i 've got some spoons here oh i 've got some boggly eyes and i 've got some pipe cleaners let 's see what we can make today with some crafts all right so my spoons could take them together like this i really love having a box of crafts at home that i can go through and find little bits and pieces that i can make let 's see can anyone guess what we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right one set of legs two legs the best thing about crafting is that you can make whatever you want whatever comes to mind but i 'm going to share a story with you shortly so our little bits and pieces are going to be used in my story all right now do we know any animals anything that might have a big round head six legs can we see them let 's count them one two three four five six and a big bottom as well six legs might be an insect i 'm just going to help by sticking some eyes on their eyes are always fun now does that look like any creatures we know maybe an ant perhaps let 's see we 'll pop our ants down here and what can i build next oh i 've got a tube i 've got some green wool it kind of almost looks like a tree doesn 't it i wonder if i can make it match it doesn 't always need to be the right color or the right shape you can always use your imagination when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and we 've got oh we 've got a lovely tree let 's pop our tree aside what else am i going to make for my story i know i 've got some paper little scraps of paper i 'm gonna roll it up into a tube now this one we 're gonna use a little bit of our imagination with colors some tape so we 've made a tube now you might have tubes at home from your toilet rolls or your paper towel you could use i 'm going to make something out of my scrap paper a bit more tape all right i 'd love to see throughout the week if you guys are crafting with every bits and pieces what um what you make at home cut these a little bit shorter i 'm going to draw a face on this one now faces we have one eye two eyes and a smiley mouth like a little person perhaps what else could i add on i 've got a little bit of ribbon here i could definitely make some curly hair out of that let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks like hair we could take that off i might just stick that in there don 't have to get too fancy when we 're making our things perfect all right so we 've got our ants we have a tree little person here gonna have a try and make one more thing that will go with our story which will be a dove which is a type of bird the doves are usually white so i 've got some tissue paper here that i 'm just going to scrunch up a little bit always handy if you 've got scrap paper but that 's okay all right so i wonder what i can make just by scrunching this up bunching this up one wing over here one wing over here and then our body in the middle you use an elastic band to make a head it 's a very very big bird we can do what we like really can 't we use what paper you 've got use what things you 've got around the home we 're going to pinch a little beak in there i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our dove so we can see his little face so we 're going to use him in our story all righty so we 've got our little dove he might be little bit hard to see on the camera there he 's got one big wing two big wings his body and his little face okay i think we 're right so today i want to use the little creatures i 've crafted to make a story and it is called the ant and the dove and our story starts off with a lake and a tree and we have our ant and our dove so one day there was a dove sitting up in a tree by the lake watching the world go by watching the world go by and along came an ant and he was wandering along wandering along and he decided to have a drink from the lake but unfortunately he lent him a little bit too far and fell in to the pond and he started to cry help help i need some help i can 't get to the edge and i 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said here catch on to this and threw down a leaf for the ant the ant climbed aboard i was very very thankful because he could use the leaf to fly float over to the edge of the lake and he hopped out thank you so much dove if it wasn 't for your help i wouldn 't have been able to get out of the lake at all he said and off he went he was lucky the dover been there to save the day that day so a few days later the dove was still sitting up in a tree and a boy came along and my little friend from before he came along and he snuck up and in his hand he had a rock he was going to throw the rock at the dove and he was sneaking up sneaking up sneaking up sneaking up it 's at the bottom of the tree standing there very quietly with his rock now and from the other day was wandering past for another drink being very very careful of course and he saw the boy he 's going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so he very very quickly ran over snuck up behind the boy and bit him on the toe the boy was so upset that he ran away and went as he was running frightened the dub so dove saw the boy running and off she flew she was very scared and the boy kept running he didn 't want to get bitten again off he went so the ant was feeling pretty good he was sitting by the river when the dove came back she flew back to a tree and said thank you aunt you were able to help me today after i helped you the other day and and felt really really good that he was able to help his friend who had helped him the other day and isn 't it nice sometimes guys when you can help somebody that 's done something awesome for you so that was our little story i hope you enjoyed it it 's always fun uh to make things with craft and as i said i 'd love to see you guys crafting with some bits and pieces from home and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be awesome while we 've got this bowl of water here i wanted to do something a little bit sciencey today but simple too so what i 've got here is a little flower template now you can draw a flower you could get one of these templates as well you can find them online or we can pop them in the pack this week and it 's a really really simple science trick and it 's called a blooming flower activity so first we 've got our shape we 're going to color it in got some crayons here crayons are the best for this activity you can use textures and pencils but you might find that the colors will leak into the water which can be another cool experiment so we 'll have purple for the middle and this is a really really good one we 're using a flower today but you can do lots of different shapes so a star shape can work as well so it folds and opens up you can color in as much or as little as you like i 'm just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so it 's all colored in and now we 're going to pop it into the water so this tricky science trick shows you how the flower we 're going to fold it up and the flower will actually open up and bloom before our very eyes it 's a little bit of a cool trick so we 'll see how we go does take a little bit of time so once we pop it in the water we might sing a song and then come back see how we go all right so as you can see i 'm folding the leaves in to the center so fold it in fold it in fold it in so we want the flower all nice and closed up and you can fold it up beautifully we can be a little bit more a little bit more rustic all right and we 're going to pop it into our water bowl and let 's see what happens so this one can take a little bit of time so it 's really good to sit and watch and predict what you think might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pop it in and while we 're waiting to see what happens i thought we might sing one more song about our friend the ant that we made earlier all right and it 's one you might know it 's called the ants go marching ready the ants go marching one by one hurrah hurrah the ants go marching one by one hurrah hurrah the ants go marching one by one the little one stopped to look at the sun and they all went marching down to get out of the rain the ants go marching two by two hurrah hurrah the ants go marching two by two hurrah hurrah the ants go marching two by two the little one stopped to buckle his shoe and they all went marching down to get out of the rain can you see everybody what 's happening here with our flower one of the petals is starting to unfold let 's keep singing the ants go marching three by three hurrah hurrah the ants go marching three by three hurrah hurrah the ants go marching three by three the little one stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get out of the rain comes after three four comes next the ants go marching four by four hurrah hurrah the ants go marching four by four hurrah hurrah the ants go marching four by four the little one stopped to look at the floor and they all went marching down to get out of the rain wow can we see what 's happening here this petal is nearly all the way open and the next one 's starting fantastic it 's blooming all by itself first petal is down not sure whether you can see from that angle but it 's definitely starting to open up all right so number of the week this week was six we 're up to four what comes next how many ants are coming five ants the ants go marching five by five hurrah hurrah the ants go marching five by five hurrah hurrah the ants go marching five by five the little one stopped to do a drive and when they all go marching down to get out of the rain all right here comes our second petal everybody six the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go marching six by six hurrah hurrah the ants go marching six by six the little one stopped to pick up some sticks and they all went marching down to get out of the rain six was our number of the week this week wasn 't it which is fantastic i hope you joined in the other day i wonder if everybody can see how much our flower is blooming we 've got a second petal nearly open and we have some more that are starting to open as well so this science experiment is going really really well and i would love to see some of you guys having a go with this one at home and as i said if you don 't want to do flowers you might like to do a star shape with some um a secret hidden message inside rather than being a blooming flower i think that would be something really fantastic i 'd love to see thank you so much for joining me this week guys and i will see you monday morning for another number activity,"(-36.7142554, 142.2016929)"

Playgroup,HYl1WO-kTxc,20200513,1086.08,"Roberts Ave, Horsham VIC 3400, Australia",2847,hi everybody welcome back to wednesday 's play group uh we 're getting on and we 're going to do some more musical instruments today uh so yeah i thought we 'd start off first with a simple one which is a paper plate tambourine again the key aim to these activities is making sure that they 're things that you 'll have around the home or if you don 't have these exact things things that you 'll be able to substitute and going back to the topic we were talking about on monday about tuning in to your children these activities are relatively quick and easy to do and come into our first sort of main point of giving your child your full attention one of the articles i shared on the facebook page earlier this week spoke about of course as families we can 't spend all day every day interacting with our children in a one-on-one fashion particularly we 've got other children working from home family commitments but if you can set aside some time each day to do even if it 's just one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or just having a genuine one-on-one conversation where you 're really tuned in and listening and focusing on your child that 's going to do you know wonders the child 's gonna feel fantastic you 're gonna feel really good too so um keeping in mind that these activities are fantastic ways to tune into your child and your family okay so paper plate tambourine it 's a nice simple one obviously get your paper plate you 're going to want something that you can use as a shaking agent so i 've got just some weight here but again rice beans if you had little buttons or beads if you 've got little bells would be fantastic make it a little bit extra musical but so fold it in half before you put the things inside decorate it as you like so you can obviously use textures and draw some wonderful pictures so i might do mine in a fruit theme today i think so on this side i 'm going to draw some wonderful bananas and again it 's all about having a go rather than what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are fairly rustic and that 's okay it 's about having the fun with it another great idea texas you know you can use your texas pencils crayons another great idea and one that we 've revisited earlier is using the catalogs so again i don 't know about you but i end up with heaps catalogues each week i 'm always trying to think up ways that i can use them so going back to our healthy eating discussions and dental health from a few weeks ago i 'm going to cut out some apples and i 'm going to stick them onto the other side of my paper plate tambourine cutting is fantastic it 's one of those skills that can be quite tricky for your your toddlers to master um but the more practice the better and they always enjoy it obviously if you 've got babies and you 're making instruments for them you can still talk about the colors and the pictures and the different things that you 're doing but you 'll obviously help have to help do them for the child so apple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got my bag of wheat so i 'll put a couple of scoops in you can use the whole paper plate so i 've folded mine over you can use two um it 'll give you a bit more sort of shaking room but for this i 'll just use a half and that 'll be fine and when you 're using the half you only want to put a small amount of shaking material in but yes if you 've got bells or anything else that would also be fantastic so you can hear i suppose it 's similar to another shaker that we made the other day now i 've got tape and i 'll tape the edge together if you 've got bigger items such as buttons you can absolutely staple yours together and that might be easier a little bit of tape there again children are always happy to help you with the tape dispenser so it 's great to get him involved in creating something that 's just for them all right and now that we 've made our fantastic apple and banana and apple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nancy stewart songs so i 'm going to put that on next and again it 's another example would have come out on the cd last week for those of you that are receiving the home packs something together and then have a little dance have a bit of a musical time and then you can get on with your busy days all right let 's have a listen [Music] great for listening skills as well so you need to listen to the song and follow the actions and as you saw the other day i 'm not the best at that either but it 's always fun to play [Music] [Music] bananas [Music] it 's a really nice and easy one that the children can do and they can enjoy and again if you 've got um babies and you 've been going through making the other shakers from um tuesday from yesterday then this might be another one that you know is easy for them to hold for any babies that are particularly keen on mouthing things or chewing them i 'm not sure this will be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um options probably a little bit safer but yeah nice quick and easy one one of the other um instruments that i 'd like to make today is a it 's uh i suppose three instruments in one it 's a bongo shaker guerrero so bongo being drum shakers we 've been making and aguero is one of these so it 's able to make different tones with it and it 's got a scraping element so in making our homemade version we will be doing that using a tin which if you notice has the ridges as well this tin was just something that i 'd use at home so i think it was tinned tomatoes at the time but again going through the recycling and just having a think of the other ways that i can utilize this before it either goes out um for recycling or whatever else we do with them uh most one of the most important things though is of course if you 're going to use tins anything like this making sure that the edges inside are smooth so some can openers um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others so just double checking because you can get some nasty cuts from those um but yeah so essentially need a tin a bloom we 're going to use for our top again our filling to make our music and then for this one to get the scraping sound we 'll use a paddle pop stick so the hardest part of this will be cutting the end off of your balloon to stretch it over and as you can see in the picture behind me what they 've actually done is used a second balloon and cut some holes in it to make a pattern so that 's relatively simple again cut your end off and then just make small snips to make a a whole pattern come through and it doesn 't really matter where you cut just fold it over and just cut small little sections and then as you can see it 's got the holes in there so this one 's relatively simple as well you want to put your shaking materials in before you put the balloons on a couple of scoops will be fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around buttons beads rice beans whatever you 've got going on so you want to put the full balloon on first if you 're going to patent it and it will need a little bit of stretching but hopefully we can get it over so yeah because you are stretching a balloon over you 're probably going to want to go for a smaller tin rather than anything big i had had a look at um an old formula tin i had laying around but um i think you 'd have difficulty stretching a balloon that far i think i 'm going to have enough difficulty stretching a balloon over this one to be honest but we 'll have a look excuse me this probably doesn 't make for riveting live footage okay but it can be done bit of stretching it 's not perfect as you can see you 've now got the shaker effect that 's sealed relatively well but again if you 've got children that are likely to pull at that or try to take it off i 'd be either hot gluing it or taping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep that in there and if you 're going to be really ambitious and get this second one over i 'm not sure whether i 'll be able to achieve it but i 'll have a go and again it 's really just more about the patterning technique rather it 's quite effective with just the one balloon over okay so i got it over again not quite as beautiful as the picture behind me but you can see it 's given a bit of a patterning effect and if you took a little bit more time and planning probably look quite good now again this top part is um the aim of being a drum so the smoother you can get it the better but still makes a good sound and it 's about the experience not the outcome so again that 's on the top there and then our third element we 've got the shaker got the drum and the third element being the aguero or the similar washboard sound you show your child this it 's usually quite enchanting they 're really excited and interested to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them tap the top even have them tap the bottom so the two different sides make two different sounds as well as the edge again because i 'm showcasing some of nancy stewart 's fabulous songs that go along with some of these instruments we 'll um i 'll show you a song now called peel the potato which again has fantastic listening abilities you need to listen for the instructions and we who doesn 't love a bit of music in their day so this one is peel the potato you can hear it in the background [Music] excellent discussion on vegetables as well and potentially could be used as a bit of a segway to um getting together in this colder weather and cooking some soup perhaps [Music] so a nice quick and easy one and yeah great for um practicing rhythm skills all right and the uh final quick and easy instrument to make today is a straw pan flute so these would have been traditionally um made with plastic straws i guess but these days we 're all a lot more environmentally conscious and we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go at making a cardboard straw pan flute but why not try today so what i 'll do for this because the straws are quite long is cut them in half to start with so three straws then becomes a length of six and what you 'll do is you 'll start off with them all at the same length and then you want to vary them with the picture behind me so that they give different tones coming out of each straw hole but what i would recommend if you 're going to cut them in half first so you want to tape you want to have one end relatively straight which will be the top end and i 'd recommend taping it first before doing any further cuts and just help keep helps to keep them in place so again if you 're making this together with your child either have them hold and you put the tape on or you can hold and they can have a go at doing the tape whatever i suppose you know something like this let them lead the way really really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in if they want to have a go it 's probably really no harm in letting them have a try if you 're worried about the tape dispenser of course you can either take the tape off the roll or um or yeah depending on their skills assist them with dispensing the tape as well at the end of the day there 's really no right or wrong way if you guys are spending time together and you know being able to create something fantastic well you know it 's all the way so that 's now all taped together and then what i will do is angle my scissors so that i can create different length straws which will then hopefully create different pictures as it comes as you blow through the straws now of course with um hygiene suggestions and covert 19 this might be a great one to do if you have make sure that every child has their own um individual plant pan flute so that you 're not putting your mouth on toys other children have put their mouths on vice versa and that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well so now that i 've cut that as you can see they 're all sort of sloped you absolutely don 't need to make it this small so if you had enough straws you could actually just trim the ends and have quite long ones and they 'd create a different sound again but i 'll give you a demonstration of my fantastic pan flutes so you can see that the one at the end is is a higher pitch than the longer one and again if you had more straws and you had um varied pictures you 'd get different sounds as well but that 's a really um you know that 's a quick one relatively cost effective lots of fun and yeah also fantastic having those discussions and experimenting make a small set then make a longer set compare them those sort of things so it 's uh yeah just a handy little one again probably one more aimed to your preschoolers this one um bubs would be more likely to probably chew up the straws and and make a right mess with that but absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are fantastic and as i was saying um these are some examples there are absolutely lots more things you can make from things around the home and i guess it 's just getting into the habit of thinking about things i think i 've discussed over a couple of sessions now that i just have a craft box at home where you know anytime i get an interesting looking box or you know it 's a nice size or shape something different small cans milk bottle lids they all go into a tub that i have that 's just called the craft box and when it comes to you know keeping children entertained or um they 're looking for something to do i refer them onto the craft box either sit down and create something with them something as simple as a collage or a pasting or sometimes the children will actually lead it themselves have a look pull a few things out and create something from there which is always lots of fun so hopefully you found a few um ideas useful this week and yeah would absolutely love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've made we absolutely love getting feedback here at horsham supported playgroup we love to see you guys interacting with the materials and and yeah so please feel free to link anything to the facebook page if you 're comfortable doing so thank you very much guys,"(-36.7142554, 142.2016929)"

Playgroup,_LQatLKwkIQ,20200512,930.339,"Roberts Ave, Horsham VIC 3400, Australia",2153,hi everybody thanks for joining me yesterday for our conversation on routines and the rest of this week we will be looking at different ways to create musical instruments at home and we 'll be featuring some of our favorite songs from the nancy stewart website which have she has free accessible songs that you can download and then play anytime but yeah so today I thought I might start off with one that is always really popular with children of all ages and that is some egg shakers so these are your little plastic eggs that you often see around around Easter time keep your eyes out for the days of the week after Easter and your leftover stock is usually heavily reduced so it 's the best time to go around and have a look around there 's a couple of different ways you can use these eggs in making shakers and I 'll show you a couple today so we 'll start off with obviously um just your basic egg what you can use to fill them is anything you 've got around the home off with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could use rice because use buttons you could use beans if you 've got beans or you know old barley from the back in your pantry but it 's obviously keep it in for most children not just babies or toddlers as well you 're going to want to either glue that closed or use a thick amount of tape and a really good way to convince the children to leave the tape on is if you tape around the scene use masking tape if you can then decorate it with textures or stickers or something on there and then they don 't actually want to remove the tape but what we 'll do so that 's your basic edge and your shaker again it 's big enough that once it takes in security you can leave that with Bubba but we 'll be able to explore here the sounds for sensation either the weight of his range moving around so it 's really nice quick and easy ones to make it into a maraca what you can do is grab a couple of spoons you 've got your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up you can make yourself I 've actually got clear tape you masking takes probably the way to go but clear tape will be right and then you can see I 'm just taping along the actual seam of the egg as well so not only will it help hold a handle in place it will seal that edge as well so Bailey 's me nothing like a bit of early morning cry so once that 's all taped up that 's all stirred it 's really awesome again for younger children makes a little bit you know hold the bunny with little hands but they can hold it around the handle and give it a bit of a shake now these ones again you can decorate on the egg with texture and draw some shapes we might want some parents to this disease not working real well or all the sides draw some stickers here and these are just relatively cheap ones that I come across each I might come across to any of the resources that are relatively cost-effective pop them into the cupboard into the craft box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always the failsafe when your children come to you saying that they 're bored you are getting out the craft box and see what they can make so I 've got some letter and number stickers and you can pick them out and they can be relevant to your child so first that RNA how many years they are that sort of thing are you get to pick them at random that 's a basic nature you don 't even need your egg tweezer spoon so that 's you know it 's something that if you know you 're planning ahead you you 've saved them familiar in the years you might still have them even easier it 's just something like a plastic bottle same thing have the children wrap it with masking tape you can decorate the whole bottle or you might be able to put stickers on to it or you know you textures whatever you 've got Philip pensive theme you 're right see brain whatever [Music] fill it up button anything to disrupt meister not cost-effective a cup for younger babies that noise alone is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got you you toddlers in your older preschool children they can absolutely help you decorate that and really mean to that as well um but yet so and as you can see this almost line here these are a couple of examples so this and the child actually put some popcorn kernels in there and decorate it with streamers and tissue paper so whatever you 've got around will be fine the children are so creative and if you provider than the materials they 'll cut with something fantastic and again he just the egg shakers with some beans rice buttons little beads but he obviously making sure that in these are the hot glued or take really well Lucille just prevent any choking issues and um now I 'm going to play for you one of our Nancy Stewart songs which is fantastic really good so where the batteries imagine insane just known as the evening think imperative reasoning skills rhythm [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] okay so today this week I wanted to share with you a story that links back to our routine theme from yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents alike can have a few struggles with bedtime so today I 'm going to read for me read you the big book it 's bedtime William by Deborah Newland well actually doing some craft activities after this that Deborah 's provided herself which is fantastic and again free resources that can be found online with me googling spend time William William no more jumping said dad William it 's bedtime now said mum but I 'm not tired not one little bit it 's bedtime William it 's late but we 've told you umpteen times yes but we 've read you a long story and let you watch TV tonight one more kiss good night but and off you go quick sticks it 's bedtime William now not fair look I 'm going back to our conversational reading from earlier weeks have the children have a look look at the picture and let them predict what they think is going to happen next or what William has seen in bed sleeping lion mum dad there 's a lion in my bed night lines aloud in your bed William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mum but why did he eat me up asked William be brain said dad be friendly said mum he goes William tiptoed over to the bed um excuse me who 's that waking me up mumbled the line it 's me William and it 's my bed and you have to get out right now well I asked the line because my mum said so the line set up is your mum mad at me William padded up all don 't worry well where am I supposed to sleep ask the line William thought for a moment this trundle bed that 's where my friends sleep that might be okay such a lion guess what 's at the line I 'm not tired anymore let 's play wish thump dad voice boomed up the stairs Williams stop that racket then go to sleep anyone would think you 've had a wallet animal in your room I 'm sort of tired now said medium I 'm not said the line let 's play hide and seek van you found you none of these things are getting William to sleep are they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not tired not one little bit said the lion I 'll tell you a story then inside William William told a story about lions and jungles I want a funny story this time William told a story about lines in frilly pennants the lion and Rumble with laughter another story he asked no more stories it 's bedtime now oh look at those expression of winds face it certainly changed it 's happening here a little bit grumpy Danny I 'm Carlos at the line William gave him a blanket my bottom two feet are cold we put the line William wrapped his feet in woolly jumpers I was thirsty said the lion William gave him a glass of water do you want to see me goggle not really said William another drink the line how about these glass no more water it 's bedtime now I 'm hungry said the lion he have my Apple mmm tasty said the lion you 're eating so slowly said William hurry up nearly finished the Lions side what 's the matter asked William I have to go to the toilet quick stick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can 't clean your teeth yep show me said William rooms ugly some of you guys might recognize some of these sleep stalling strategies William might have done it for mum and now Williams having to do with the lion tuck me in okay can I have a teddy yeah will you sing me a song can we jump on the bed no let 's stay up all night Oh do you want to hear a joke no it 's really funny no wait there 's one more thing no what easy no goodnight William lines finally ready for sleep sleep at last said dad he 's warning self at this time that 's funny I never heard William snore before said mum hmm what 's down here it 's a tail picture and then we can see they 've gone to sleep together do you think mum and dad believe that there was a line in his room I 'm not so sure that 's a fantastic book and as I said one that some of those things would be quite familiar to mums and children alike so one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the author is provided is actually making a little mobile and it 's there 's a few templates that can be accessed online we 'll put the links up or for our families that receive the drop-off packs that will be included but yeah essentially what it is is making a mobile using a paper plate and your top path and then you 've got your two templates each so you 've got a lion and you had William and then you can color them in cut them out and stick them onto your mobile template decorate the template you can put some beads on there paper towel the mean draw a couple of pieces of string and then you can create your own mobile to hang from your bed so that 's just one of the suggestions and fan on lawn a little be included in this week 's pact as well but yeah a lot of things you know about being resourceful using what you have at home so again if you don 't have a paper plate you might go to find an old coat hanger or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hang some string from there and hang your bits and pieces so all these ideas you know we pulled out some reasons but please don 't think it 's the only way to even complete something as we saw with the shakers earlier as well use what you put on hand the children aren 't going to mind it 's more about the experience than you know what it looks like as such and yet get involved with them get involved get put the music on have a bit of a singing happy dance the shaker shaker and stop song is as I said harder than it looks have a go let me know how you go and want to be my terrible rhythm but hopefully I 've enjoyed those few suggestions we 'll be making a couple more instruments tomorrow and I look forward to catching up with you thank you,"(-36.7142554,

playgroup",aNjEK_8P_1Q,20200824,932.88,"Roberts Ave, Horsham VIC 3400, Australia",1991,hi hello and how are you how are you how are you hi hello and how are you how are you today good morning everybody thanks for joining me today we 're going to sing some songs about animals you might find in and around the farm and i 'm going to tell you a little story called the ugly duckling but to start off today i thought we might start with our first song which is called where is the dog and you can follow along with this book where is the dog where is the dog where is the dog he 's standing on a log great rhyming where is the bee where is the bee he 's sitting in the tree what 's next where is the duck where is the duck he 's riding in the truck riding in the truck where is the rat where is the rat he 's sitting with the cat it 's an interesting one isn 't it would we see a rat and a cat together the rat 's sitting with the cat so we had lots and lots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tree duck and truck and cat and rat can we think of any more even with your cat might be sitting on the mat wearing a hat playing with a ball and bat lots of rhyming words you could have a think about around the home all right so we saw some animals in that first little tune and here 's another one of my favorites called i went to visit a farm one day see if you can join in and join in with the sounds of the animals that we come across i went to visit a farm one day i saw uh what 's this one it 's a cow i saw a cow along the way and what do you think i heard it say what does a cow say i went to visit the farm one day i saw ah it 's got woolly fur [Music] it 's a sheep i saw a sheep along the way and what do you think i heard it say i went to visit a farm one day i saw a a horse along the way and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i went to visit the farm one day i saw a oh what 's this one a rooster i saw a rooster along the way and what do you think i heard him say cock-a-doodle-doo i went to visit a farm one day i saw a little one pinkies little trotters i saw a pig along the way and what do you think i heard him say oink oink oink i went to visit the farm one day i saw a oh this is an interesting one i saw a frog along the way and what do you think i heard him say ribbit ribbit ribbit now i know another song about frogs that you might like to hear but what we have to do first is get our clapping hands ready like this it goes like this [Music] went the little green frog one day girl went the little green frog galumph went the little green frog one day and they all went gloom gloom but we all know frogs go la de da de da de hello everybody today we 're going to read a story about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the pond maybe where our frogs from the la de da da song might live so let 's have a look and see the story named the ugly duckling here is a nest of eggs and here is mummy duck oh i can 't wait for my eggs to hatch i 've been waiting and waiting for so many days i can 't wait for my babies to hatch i 'm going to sit down on top of them and i 'm going to wait and wait so patiently can you hear that sound crack crack crack crack crack i think my eggs have hatched have a look look what hatched out of my eggs beautiful beautiful babies one fluffy duckling two fluffy ducklings three fluffy ducklings oh oh what are you oh you look a little bit different you 're very big and your feathers aren 't very fluffy at all let me see let me see you all must be my ducklings though let me teach you how to quack quack quack quack oh oh what is that sound that 's not a duckling sound at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funny you sound funny you 're very very big we don 't want to play with you and the ugly duckling felt very very sad because mum and his brothers and sisters didn 't want to play with him come on everybody it 's home time time to go home mama duck and the ducklings went home but the ugly duckling did not want to come he didn 't want to spend time with people that weren 't very nice to him so he decided to sit by the pond and wait to see if someone nicer would come along and it wasn 't too long before another family came to the pond another family of ducks oh this is good i might go over and say hello and maybe i 'll join their family hello hello ducky family can i join you ma who are you oh what are you oh my goodness you sure are ugly look at that beak look how big you are look at your prickly feathers oh no please leave us alone and the ugly duckling was sad again and he moved away he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't very nice to him and the ducks swam away look at ugly ducklings sitting there all by he 's lonesome waiting for someone else to come along he sat and he sat and soon some geese came to the pond now geese have a funny sound too they sort of go honk honk which isn 't quite the same as ugly ducklings but maybe this could be his new family so as the geese come in ugly duck thought i 'm going to come and say hi to the geese and see if they 'll let me join in hello hello how are you can i come and join your family my goodness what are you ah who are you you sure are funny looking but you can join us if you want and so although the ugly duckling felt sad that he didn 't have any brothers and sisters to play with he joined in and he joined the geese family and he stayed there for a while and he got bigger and bigger and bigger and he still didn 't look the same as the geese he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day a hunter and his dog came to the pond and they were looking around looking around and the dogs saw the geese and said and the geese flew away and the ugly ducklings stood there trying to not be noticed but the dog ran over and started sniffing him and said what are you you 're not a goose my goodness you 're ugly look at your beak and your prickly feathers no thank you and off he ran to chase the geese and scared away so the poor ugly duckling was back at the lake all alone and he thought the ducks didn 't want me the geese didn 't want me not even the dog tried to bite me my goodness i 'm so sad at being so ugly and different from everybody else and he 'd have enough of the lake and he decided that 's it i 'm going to explore the world and off he went and he went and he went and he went and he walked and he walked and he walked until he came to a farm and on the farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ugly duckling oh what is that that is the ugliest duck i have ever seen said the farmer 's wife yes said the farmer but winter is coming and he might it might last some eggs should we keep him for a while and see if we can get some eggs oh i like eggs she said i like my eggs on toast yes let 's keep him we 'll put him in the barn over winter and see if we can get some eggs so they chased the ugly duckling and he went inside the barn here you go in you go oh i 'm looking forward to some yummy yummy eggs yummy eggs in you go and they waited and they waited and they waited and they waited for eggs to come all winter i really like scrambled eggs i like my eggs poached should we go in and see whether the duck has laid us any eggs so they called him out how 'd you come ducky out you come you ugly bird have you laid us any eggs and the ugly duckling come out he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit shy and he stuck his head out and then he came out oh said the farmer 's wife you 're bigger and stranger than ever and with no eggs i think you should leave the farm off you go shoe big ugly duck shoe and so sadly off the ugly duckling went again he left the farm left the farm wandered off to see what he could find and as he was walking and walking and walking he came back to the pond from before winter he came back to the same pond and he was sitting by the pond feeling quite sad not even the people had wanted him not even the people had wanted him and he was running out of places to live and creatures to see and as he was sitting there feeling really really sorry for himself i 'm wishing he 'd been like the others some beautiful swans came and landed at the lake one two little swans they flew over to talk and before they could say anything the ugly duckling said i know i know

ugly duckling was so confused he wandered over to the water and then realized all that time that he wasn 't an ugly duckling at all he was a beautiful swan not only was he a beautiful swan he now had friends that appreciated him for who he was and he had somewhere to join in and have fun and spend time with every day and that is the story of the ugly duckling and how we should keep in mind that we always should find people in our lives that look after us and say nice things and make us feel really really good about ourselves we never listen to those bullies that say horrible things,"(-36.7142554, 142.2016929)"

Playgroup,7txxK3EjaH0,20200511,824.1,"Roberts Ave, Horsham VIC 3400, Australia",2951,routines can be for many things so they can just be a sleep routine or they can be routines throughout the day I 'm alone for so I 'm using some of these experiences and examples that I 've had over the years but so for one of my children I would find that they 'd be quite erratic as the evening wore on because they 're trying to get into their play and they wanted to do this and have a bath me never sort of knew what to expect or when and then when I find the chair and say okay it 's time for bed it 'd be a big major meltdown because they weren 't ready and what I learned over time as if I as I implemented a bit of a sleep routine as in we knew that okay we had dinner then we had played for half an hour roughly then we would have bath PJs book and into bed so as that time progressed even though my child obviously couldn 't tell the time and didn 't know okay bedtimes in an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was coming next and because you knew what was coming next he was able to regulate himself better and that 's where that first point behind me they 're predictable it was predictable for him because he knew what was coming next and a lot of the information that I 'm drawing from as well comes from the raising children Network but it 's a really great website for parents of children of all ages over a range of topics and they include information on routines I 've even got some great Coppa 19 resources as well so regular and this can be one that is a bit more tricky to stick to I suppose particularly for weekends but keep it regular do it everyday even on the weekends if you can so it 's something that again if if it 's predictable and it 's regular it 's happening all the time the children will know what to expect that will take time so if you implemented a routine today you 're probably not going to see results tomorrow or the next day it is something that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can so my bottom point in there about having pictures or photos basically the child puts a name at the top and then it provides a set of pictures that you can then use for and this in this example is a bed routine so for example I 've just arranged some random ones but this child is so hard on the sleep routine is going to the toilet then having a bath family brushes their teeth together reads a story and then it 's bedtime and there are different pictures and you can modify it as it suits you and if they are getting sort of anks you 're a little bit you know Unseld over the evening you say well look you know now we 've we 've been to the toilet and had our bath next we 're going to brush our teeth so then it encourages them because it 's not just you saying okay it 's time to brush your teeth say look it 's on our chart that we made together remember it 's got your name on it and this is what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so then we 're going to brush our teeth and have our story come on pick a book again get your child involved come and pick a story which one would you like if you 've got a lot of books you can something particularly for your toddlers and you 've really really strong minded children is actually give them a choice but keep the choice Limited yourself so give them a selection of two or three books twos nice and easy would you like this book or would you like that book the child is then still getting able to express themselves and make the final decision but you 're not there for an hour sitting in front of the bookcase while the child has a look through fifty titles to work out which one they 'd like today so it 's all about I suppose empowering the child getting them involved giving them choices but limiting that as well so that it 's manageable for you so of course you don 't need to use pictures like these you can have your children draw pictures in for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have a bath we brush our teeth let 's draw in our peach there of what we look like when we 're brushing our teeth and these can be things that you 're doing throughout your day if you 're looking for things you know to do together while you are at home a bit more get them in get them drawing and and doing things for a purpose they love doing things you 're like great when we finish this chart I 'm going to pop it up on the wall we 're going to look at this every day and alternatively or another option is take pictures of your children doing these things take pictures print them off and then put them in the chart and again it gives them that great sense of ownership that it is their individual routine chart that they can see with their own faces is really fantastic so my third point on top of having routines that are predictable and regular is sometimes the transitions so I found with my particular child that he be so busy playing that if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now you know we 're getting ready for bed that would be a bit of a trigger for him so I had to sort of work on making sure that he had a little bit of a verbal warning and it would just be for him it was enough to say look we 've got five more minutes of play and we 're having our bath time and what I would do is I 'd give the five minute five minute warning and then I 'd usually give a follow-up one and of course a parent five minutes and a child five minutes can vary a little bit that depends on you and your family and I 'd usually say okay buddy one more minute and then we 're going to go and have a bath and that was enough for him to wrap up what he was doing and then when I finally said okay it 's bath time he would be able to most the time put down what he was doing and come and do a bath I 'm not saying it 's a fail-safe but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transition a little bit better through that process and into bed we 've got a child who 's doing fantastic and we 'll go through the routines by himself and then sometimes that he won 't and as he 's getting a little bit bigger it 's getting harder you know when you 've got a toddler you can pick them up and sort of help direct them as they 're getting bigger it 's it can be quite Australia on our backs particularly if they don 't want to participate so I can absolutely feel that as well I think the ideas of getting involved in terms of like jumping in the bath with him is fantastic and is definitely going to get a great response for him although is obviously not practical if you need to be doing other things or you know you 've got other children that need to tend to as well my initial thought and again for more in-depth stuff having a check in Matera toward health nurse and your GP might be the way to go are there ways to limit the things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know birthing eating they 're things that they children need to do and we need to make them do are there other things that you know you 're having struggles over that potentially aren 't all that important and maybe if there are on reflection trying to limit the things that you 're sort of putting your foot down going look we actually do need to do these keep them limited as much as you can if it 's things like arguing over he doesn 't want to read a story or he doesn 't want to wear the blue pants he 's happy in his red pants they 're probably things that I guess we take a step back and go it was going to cause big issues I 'd probably left that slide and again every family is going to be individual in terms of what is acceptable and what isn 't and just in terms of whether that works for you or not some children really thrive on quite a structured routine and they need a lot of assistance to make decisions that they need other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so again I 'm only generalizing but crystal my thought would be other things that yeah you can sort of let go in terms of routines if you haven 't got a routine chart going or maybe having that discussion about you know it 's bath time and bath time is Jackson in the bath mummy watching you know maybe he might like to draw a picture up maybe again can you show me you in the bath and we 'll take a photo of the bathroom and you can add that to a picture routine it 's a few basic ones so it 'll have my routine if a little bit older they can actually write in their what their routine is and in their schooling times and all those sorts of things and there was no other one that was a morning routine which probably probably is still applicable but not as applicable as when you 've got families and you 're trying to get out the door for nine o 'clock for school for example but same thing and it comes with little bits and pieces like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're setting your children up some children need a little bit more guidance to be independent so maybe that you 've got a morning routine but your child needs a lot of assistance to get that done or they can 't remember what they need to do next when they get up what do they need to do so setting up something like this okay when you get up in the morning you need to brush your hair and you brush your teeth some people and some children really work well too knowing you know it 's an hour for this and half an hour for that I tend to be a little bit more flexible in that if the children are really agent busy busy playing and next stages lunch if they 're really really busy playing I probably let them go another 10 or 15 minutes until they sort of go look I 'm hungry or you know it 's at a point where you need to eat flowing into tuning into your children just watching and seeing how they 're going I guess if they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them as they are and then follow the routine a little bit further than the track if it 's not taught you know it 's not a big time structure but it 's obviously the same pattern every day it 's still in routine even if it isn 't oh it 's 10 o 'clock now it 's you know time to do the next thing on our schedule it doesn 't need to be that rigorous I suppose the other thing about routines is that it 's got to work for you there 's no point putting something in place that adds extra stress to your day you know we 're all really busy families are so busy at the moment that there 's no point adding extra pressure one of the other awesome things I did come across while I was having a look at a few tips for sleep in particular our sleep routines with something from the sleep health foundation got a few of these so this one is based for a three to four year old and it 's actually based on the amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs so 10 to 13 hours they recommend for a child 3 to 4 years there 's one one for children 5 to 11 I believe and there 's a teenager one but what I found really handy I 'm sure there are a heap of other ways to sort of use it is that it was just a bit of a ready reckoner so for example if I put my child 's going to bed at 7 p.m. it blocks that and actually shows me that window between 10 to 13 hours so if my child goes to bed at 7 I can expect them to wake up between 6 to 8 a.m. and that 'd be considered a full sleep for a child of that age so helping your child to one down so that might be providing things like you know a little bit of peaceful music the same lullaby every night every time so that eventually they 'll listen to the lullaby associated with peaceful warning down relaxing and actually contribute trigger your brain you know every time I hear it I 'll start feeling a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laying in bed they 're warm they 're cozy they 've had their drink and they eat whatever else they need to do making sure that the bedroom is suitable for sleep so you know dimly lit lots of children like night lights and things like that you know just a little little lamp nothing you know too bright so keep it dimly lit relatively quiet you know if you 're playing music keep it down low so they can hear it but that it 's not anything to you know nothing too loud and they 'll actually disturb or interrupt their sleep if they do ripped-off drift off avoiding stimulants in terms of you know cups of tea chocolate even some of your biscuits bits and pieces like that from the afternoon our soft drinks you know things like that wean them out from the afternoon if they 're things eat children having because it takes time to burn through this system and absolutely you know I wouldn 't recommend soft drinks and things for meals at dinnertime because it 's probably still gonna be in the system a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course and going back to the dental health stuff from a few weeks ago you know obviously promote water and even milk as much as you can having these drinks before they hop into bed and technology was another one that they were sort of saying minimum of hour an hour before sleep and this is one that you know some families use the tech as part of their wander and time so jump into bed hop on your table have a bit of a one down that can actually stimulate bits and pieces of the brain and actually get them sort of thinking and more wired up than you 'd think even though they 're quite passive and stationary routines are again things that work for you but and as part of a small talk thing it 's actually about tuning in so as I was saying earlier about if your child is it a particular part of the routine and they 're doing really well or they 're enjoying it don 't feel the need to push on because you 've set this routine for X amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routine and it 's tuning in again watching your child okay well they 're you know they 're really enjoying this lego play let 's push lunch at about ten minutes ten fifteen minutes does it really matter conversely if you 've got you 've decided okay we 're going to do arts and crafts this morning for half an hour and your child sat down ripped through the activity you know made some fantastic artwork and has then already decided that they finished fifteen minutes down the track don 't feel the need to go but I 'd set aside half an hour sit down for other fifteen minutes if they 're finished what have you got next in the routine can you move on early is it going to create an issue thanks for joining in and I will see you guys tomorrow with some musical instruments thanks guys,"(-36.7142554, 142.2016929)"

the community reference group and um tonight we 'll be talking about the concept plans for the precinct one oh activation one phase one of the precinct um that we 're dealing with along the river and i 'd like to hand over now to oh sorry before we get to the handover i 'd just like to remind people that we can ask questions tonight and feel free to put them in the um the chat box and there 'll be some you 'll you 'll get some live answers as the night goes on so i 'd like to hand over now to carolyn handoff and sue newell to do the presentation thank you um hello my name 's caroline hamdorf i 'm the manager for arts culture and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair of the community reference group for the riverfront activation project of which we 're going to show you some draft concept maps um sue newell is the project manager for this precinct and sue will spend the majority of the time sharing with you the draft concept maps that have gone out for public feedback i will just spend the first part of this meeting just giving a very quick summation of the project of where we 're at at the moment and then at the end providing an opportunity for people to um either ask questions through the chat line so if you 're unfamiliar with using the chat line on zoom down the bottom of your screen if you roll your cursor or your mouse along the bottom of the screen you 'll see that there are a number of um like icons there 's one icon that says chat it 's like a little speech bubble you can click on that and it 'll bring up a side panel that you can actually add to and ask questions as we go we would like this to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we go through the um through the discussion we 've got about seven people as attendees at the moment we are also recording this webinar and we will be putting it up onto the council 's website as well to be reviewed um after after this after this evening so there are three in total there 'll be three webinars in total which cover different aspects of the project this project will be actually outlining the primary purpose is to outline the um the public plans the public draft concept plans and to gather any questions the questions as i 've mentioned uh are going to be through the chat line so we will respond read the questions and respond to read out the question and respond to your question as as we go so hopefully that will work for you and from a viewing perspective hopefully it will also um support those people who re-watch this webinar so just to start off with um i um i 'm just going to very quickly just give you a bit of a a very quick summation of where we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is quite a lot of detail around how the project has evolved from the master plan many of you would have been uh involved and or aware of last year council undertaking a master plan for city to river this project is the first phase of looking at further developing plans around the city to river master plan all of the feedback that was provided by the community through 2019 has been gathered summarized and actually provided to the community reference group which is a really critical link between the project and council and the community to ensure that there is transparent and well-considered engagement through all stages of developing the concept plans um johnny chairs that meeting there are another um i think seven or eight not actually probably nine people involved in in that reference group which have met very frequently since its formation in april that group has been a really primary and important group for council staff and our senior council laws council executive to be able to gain an understanding of community feedback and interests in developing the concept plan the concept plan that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still very much a live item we 're looking for community feedback over the next two weeks until the 23rd of august and really really interested in further getting further getting getting further ideas and further input into what will end up developing into a final concept plan where we can take to the next stage over the next month or so to develop more detailed plans so at the moment we have a draft plan that 's out for public comment who 's going to share that with you tonight and um and and hopefully we 'll get some further feedback or input from you you can also um after tonight 's webinar go on to the council website and there are some simple links from the front page where you can quickly uh provide you know a review of the maps you can download the maps and you can provide some feedback and we 're very interested in in what the public has to say about the draft plans i 'm going to leave it there i 'm going to hand over to sue i 'll be watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any questions that might pop up thanks thank you carolyn um good evening everyone as carolyn mentioned i 'm the project manager for the first stage of the city to river which is the river front part of the project i 'm going to share my screen with you which is going to show you the maps that we 're now put out so what we 're looking at here is the whole of the river front stage one so it basically starts uh at the rowing club just over here uh and goes all the way through until the show grounds where that newly constructed fence has gone in there 's also some trees that have gone in just the other side of the bridge there so that 's the the riverfront stage one we 've tried to break it up um into sections the whole master plan is very big piece of work so that 's actually been broken up into seven uh stages and this is actually the first so if i just start over here this is a very small map so we 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i just wanted to give you the the total uh view first of exactly the area that that we 're talking about so i 'll move i 'll move on to um giving you a look at the first part which is area a area a is and encompasses the rowing club and the proposed water play area so if i start um over here the blue line indicates the existing path that 's there at the moment and it is proposed as part of this project to actually widen that path to make it a more standardized path for three metres so that it can be utilized by both cyclists and pedestrians so at the rowing club there isn 't some existing public toilets which need a bit of a facelift the plan is to actually make an all-accessible toilet and to fix up this car parking area so that when cars actually pull off uh there might be a all-accessible park here the gradient will be right so you can actually safely get to the toilet um which is on the side of the building here so it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is actually a blind corner coming around to the rowing club and this is quite a steep gradient at the moment which is all in um grass down to the down to the river now getting boats in and out of there and with bikes coming around this blind corner you know it is a bit dangerous so the the idea is to actually fix that up make the path out wider so you have a better view and also actually have this as a a more stable platform so you can wash boats and get them in and out as you need to do there is actually a separate grant gone into this project but it 's actually the linkage between apex island across to these toilets so that 's why that 's just shown like that because that that project um if we got the funding for that we would carry that out separately but but that 's another linkage point over here is the newly um proposed building for the rowing club the rowing club um you know need to extend their facilities in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keen to have additional co-location so that it can be utilized by other people may have a glass front on this you know just so that it can be maximize the usage of it the um points i 'll just point out they 'll see these all the way along the river um in the plan that that 's proposed and what they are i was just going to give you a quick look but they 're down a bit further so i 'll get to that in a minute they are actually access points out onto the river so it might be that there 's seating or a place where you can come and do some fishing or something like that this is the proposed water plane which is uh this is the caravan park over here so the water play is very much a natural water play facility um and what i mean by that is you know there 's no tipping buckets and mushrooms it 's very much around natural play um and to give you a better idea of that i 'm just going to zoom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here just to show you some images of the types of natural water play we 're talking about so it 's very much it 's hands-on it 's hand pumps it 's the ability to make water flow through an area and actually use it in a play environment so it might be creeks with little beds of water and trickling through it and things like that and so the amount of water usage is not anticipated to be great but very much in keeping with our environment along the river which is one of the biggest feedbacks that we got um when we were doing our master planning process a lot of the feedback um said that you know we wanted to preserve our natural environment and so that water play very much fits in with that theme so the uh toilets um to to be able to be utilized as part of this water play there 's a proposal there we 've worked very closely with the cma and delp to come up with you know the best design that we think that would happen along a flood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that work in that environment and bglc have also been involved in that as well so we 've got a cultural heritage management plan and we 're working to make sure that you know we consider all of those factors i 'll just scroll down to the next plan the next plan is uh and covers um the newly proposed cafe which is which is here now as part of this project it 's not to build a cafe it 's to actually have a cafe sighting and so that 's what this is it 's making sure that all of the permits all the planning permits and any other impediments are actually addressed and that it actually is a a site that someone could actually potentially build a cafe on in the future number two is actually the meeting place or what 's been defined as the meeting place and a meeting place can be can be anything can be artwork rocks a sign um and so it 's designed that actually it 's exactly that that there might be seating around it and you can actually meet there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points out onto the river the idea being that you would come in this is a two-way access into the into the car park here so the existing angling club rooms car park there is a couple of proposed new linkages which would mean that you can safely get from sawyer park through to the newly refurbished toilets which would need to fix up and make more accessible parking just along here so this path is really just so that you don 't have to walk through the car park or garden um you 've actually got a safe passage all the way through to the cafe if that 's what what you wanted to do so the two-way um in an entry then we 've got the proposed additional shelter at the front of the angling club rooms the idea being that it extends the veranda for future usage so when the angling club is booked out or booked by someone they can also use this outdoor area but when it 's not being used by that it 's available to the public there might be tables and chairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the existing barbecue area we already have some chairs and tables and we plan to expand that even further so perhaps make some better shade in that area and have yeah some more tables and chairs and and barbecues just to encourage more people to use the space and number 11 um is just some proposed seating that would go along in front of the already existing um there 's a barrier there and it 's just some proposed seating to go there um i 'm just going to see i just wanted to show you just some images of perhaps some meeting places um there is a cafe there in the background but just to give you a bit of a visual image of perhaps what it might look like and just over here is what i talked about before where you 're actually um interacting with the um the river and here 's a couple of different examples of of of what that might look like and how that might be set up so that 's about it on the plans um as you would understand the community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get to this point and in addressing all of the key stakeholders both adjacent and within the area all of their needs so the the the miniature railways still have access angling club rooms have maintained some parking and obviously that 's that 's very important for other users in that space as well um and trying to encourage more use of the barbecue area as well so that 's probably about it for me if there is any questions it can go back to you carolyn great um i 've just checked in with our it guru because we 've got quite a small group we actually will open up um the because we weren 't sure how many people will be logging on tonight and and webinars can get a little unruly if there 's heaps and heaps of people in the room but we 've only got a small number so we can actually open up the um the the forum for people to ask verbal questions and then sue johnny and or i can respond to those questions just a word of warning if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people 's cameras up so make sure you look pretty it 's just so if you 're in your pajamas that 's okay we 're only going to see obviously your head up um but just fair warning that um when we uh enable people 's microphones um your camera will also come on and um and if you prefer not to you can um you can knit yourself or shut your camera off i think from my understanding so we 'll uh will enable people to be able to ask verbal questions if you still want to just um put a question into the chat line you can certainly do that as well and we 'll respond to them as as as well while we 're getting that set up um i do just want to i 'm going to share my camera and my screen at the moment and just share with you the ways that you can provide feedback formally and then we 'll open up up to questions i 'm just going to share my screen i 'm going to share with you the council website @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're trying to encourage people is yes we want to share information about the the draft plan but we 're also very very interested in hearing from lots of different and diverse community reps so on the council web page or on the main page of the council website there is a banner which basically enables people to view the draft plans and provide feedback basically what you need to do is just click on the info page and it will take you to a landing page where there are a number of buttons one is the and we also with the feedback that we want from people is informed feedback so we really want to make sure that people have had a chance to view the maps if there are any questions that people have there are avenues of actually seeking answers to questions besides this web webinar tonight and then an opportunity to so you can download a copy of the plans and then you can also submit your feedback which is basically a series of five questions and an open question at the end in case there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to know more information so covering off on some of the information we 've shared tonight there 's a link underneath the feedback page which actually takes you to a broader page which houses all the information about the project including the webinars so here 's tonight 's webinar link tomorrow or the day after as soon as possible we 'll have that as a viewable webinar so you can re-watch like this one here the first webinar the second webinar and the third webinar will be listed will be shown tomorrow as well the um the web page also outlines a little bit about the project what 's being looked at you can look at the maps that sue has shown tonight the large format maps or a smaller printable a4 version of the maps talks a little bit about other avenues to provide feedback as well so we 're running a series of small group webinars like this just really quite um small sessions during the day and on weekends and you can register for those if you want further information we have the online feedback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page there 's also a series of fact sheets that people can view down here various topics there 's five currently up there at the moment about the water play area about themes that are informing the concept plan what engagement has taken has been undertaken so far who the crg is and what they 've done and also the ways that you can engage over the next few weeks and the final part on that page is basically a bit of information about the community reference group and i just wanted to let you know that the feedback that we 're encouraging people to undertake is not only online they 've been effort some efforts made in this particular period of covert who provide avenues for people to view the maps offline so at 45 fibro street and at the angling club rooms there are hard copy large posters of the maps that sue showed tonight and some paper copy feedback forms that people can lodge the other option that came out in the advertiser this week the weekly advertiser is a double page spread with the map the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people can provide their feedback some community reference members have nominated some times where they 're happy to take calls about the project and talk and talk to you about the project answer any questions and take feedback so there are five community reference group members their numbers are just in that drop down box so this is the point if you like of getting further information downloading the maps and seeing the more complex maps understanding where you can provide your feedback i just wanted to share that with you before we open up your questions i 'm just going to unshare my screen now carol i think the marks are on so if people want to just ask whenever they 're ready they 've got questions you can ask why and it 's okay if people don 't have any questions because there 's always there 's quite a lot of information that 's available on where the project has evolved to yeah um yes um thank you sue um i would suggest you additionally explain improvement to the pathway under the bridge and the um and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and flower beds and access to the adjacent parking area in the showgrounds because the people coming from the uh from the city side of the bridge they could park in the showgrounds and walk around to these um other riverfront places that is correct bob so the um the final part of um the plans that we were just looking at before and i 'm happy to share this this map again if that would make more sense and explain what bob is is is saying here so if i just go up to the large map which is this one here the area that bob is referring to is number 13. um down coming with the path coming down as it is at the moment the gradient is very steep coming around in underneath the bridge um part of that plan is to actually level out that that 's just to make it more user friendly for users and also perhaps upgrade the lighting in underneath there for safety reasons as well number 13 where it 's um indicated on the map here is where the existing um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now been cleared away and it 's now a irrigated land irrigated grassed space that has now just recently had all of the trees go in and that was part of it an ongoing council project that 's been going over the last couple of years but that 's actually this has been included in here because some of those accents links and the way that works um we want to make sure that that all is incorporated into them into the actual plan so the idea being that there would be some paths and some additional garden beds um go into this this area and the car park that bob was referring to is the one that is just on the other side of the fence here um in the showgrounds thank you if you have a question or a comment i was just making the comment before that sometimes when you view a plan it 's always good to reflect and have a look at it again so you certainly can at any time join any of those webinar sessions that are running during a morning or an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we 're certainly encouraging people to do that or again download the um plans to view your leisure so there are a number of options to revisit you don 't necessarily have to have all of your questions answered tonight and you might have other questions upon reflection of the plan so i 'm just going to open it up again to the um the attendees there 's someone with their hand up jenny would you like to answer ask a question i was wondering what is going to happen to the log shed near the rowing club bob asked about it the other day and i gather it 's occupied by possums um that that is actually the true jenny it is occupied blood possums at the moment um the plant there isn 't actually uh a plan at the moment to to do anything with that building um we 've we 've just tried to leave it there it is it is um obviously not really habitable at the moment however there is full services there so there 's you know power and water and you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know pop-up cafes or anything like that coming to that space so we at the moment there is no exact plan on what we will do with that building thank you are there any further questions from any of the people who have joined us the attendees do any of the members of the crg the community reference group who are present want to make any comments um caroline uh no real comment i i think sue explained it very well thank you mate and and we and the possum building is going it 's really funny how everyone actually um has an opinion on on the fossil building which is which is really encouraging it 's great but yes rob after 32 um you know face-to-face meetings i think carolyn and i know the plan quite well good intimate knowledge yeah phil here uh yeah congratulations ladies that covered everything there and the more feedback we get the better and clearer thank you phil um to you johnny i 'd like to ask sue in the meeting place um have they been discussing with the berengi land council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there has there has been some previous discussions bob um in regards to having some form of um whether it 's storytelling or native birds that are um you know to the area or something that actually tells a story along um the pathway so not so much at the meeting place but actually incorporated throughout the site so that you as you go along um you know you would you would um either see the story or um you know you might see indigenous names of of you know birds or fish or whatever the case may be so we 're just working through how that might be incorporated into the whole site um including the water play area as you know we 've talked about that um and yeah so it 's not really yeah in one location it 'd be great to have it incorporated through all of it um so not a question as such um a previous project i was involved in in the gardens in treasury place um one of the things that we did there which because it was similar had people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered you were able to download an app to your iphone and as you came to each um spot along the path you actually picked up the story of what was associated with that particular spot what a lovely idea um it needs a bit of it work to do it but it um it has it 's not actually activated as yet because i quit work before it finished don 't tell me that yeah no but that 's that 's a wonderful idea and in fact um you know bob has mentioned a few times about the history um in the in the site and all that also the war history and it sort of comes to mind too that something like that um as you go along and learn more about it would be fantastic as well it would work well for the um rsl memorial yeah and it would also work at the meeting place i think yeah yeah yep yep definitely and it will it all comes through on your phone yeah it links it 'll link directly to your phone i can get more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like yeah that 'd be good actually if you could right if it 's already been done and there 's a an app that yeah so yeah good now now i 'm going to enjoy my wine oh okay we 're not holding you up thanks open it up just for a little longer we don 't necessarily need to take the full hour that 's been scheduled certainly if people 's questions have been answered and um and there are no further questions we certainly can wrap this up a little earlier so we 'll just check through and make sure that there are no further questions that people may have or comments that the crg members may want to share again um can i just say that there are many and varied avenues for people to provide feedback we 'd be very interested in hearing any formal feedback that you have through the online versions or the paper format versions that are available at 43 fibre street or at the angling club rooms um i just like to thank people for attending tonight and i 'm going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sue it was actually a pretty good presentation i hope people you know get up get on and view it on you know later on if they can and um just like thank you guys for the content and thank those that attended tonight and um hopefully we can get people to get some you know feedback via the five methods that caroline outlined earlier and you know it 's we want feedback and we can 't make changes if you don 't put some in so encourage everyone out there who watches this to put your feedback in have you say and then hopefully we can um us as the crg can help put you know any extra plan or extra ideas and that into the current plan um just like thank everyone for attending again and good night,"(-36.7142554, 142.2016929)"

Horsham VIC 3400, Australia",12772,good evening ladies and gentlemen my name is councillor mark radford the mayor of the horsham rural city council the horsham rural city council acknowledges the five traditional owner groups of this land the watchabolic ogaya japokok jaguar and java jali people we recognise the important and ongoing place that all indigenous people hold in our community we pay our respects to the elders both past and present and commit to working together in the spirit of mutual understanding and respect for the benefit of the broader community and future generations well welcome to the horsham rural city council covert 19 information session and it really is a great opportunity a very timely opportunity to share some factual information about the covert 19 virus and its effect on our community with us this evening is a special guest and an old friend of this community is dr robert grenfell dr rob is a public health physician and is currently the director of csiro 's health and biosecurity unit also with us tonight we have miss katherine morley and miss mrs marie woodhouse and also jenny vague this is jenny vague @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little bit later on answering some of those more local questions particularly around their hospital and our local services how they are coping with things so to kick us off i 'll hand over to dr rob and uh in a way welcome back dr rob and uh i 'm it 's it 's great to see you you 're in a very you have a very important role by way of introduction i think it would be fair to say uh that the anxiety level has certainly kicked up in the last few weeks in our community about the covert 19 and so i think your presentation today is is very timely so on behalf of our community uh welcome dr rob uh look thank you so much mark uh and it 's an absolute pleasure to uh be given the chance to actually talk about this and hopefully uh for any of the questions that you have we can have a crack at trying to answer those with the best available evidence so i 'm going to share the screen which should come up now so probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to understand the experts uh and uh it 's it 's interesting to be given that title but um we uh don 't know a lot about this virus because it appeared suddenly on our place with you know around about uh december sometime last year and went through and what that often does is that when you hear from people like myself and others particularly our politicians is what they tell you today may change tomorrow because they 've actually learned something more and the facts have changed as well so that that to agree means that you 're going hold on i heard this the other day well yes we 're actually learning all the time and i 'm going to take you on a journey on some of the things we 've learned over this period of time so let 's get this to move now this is actually a picture of the virus this is a sample um from the first case that came through to melbourne we call it wuhan case one uh and it was isolated where um the first growth isolation out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down in melbourne which just happens to be the national reference laboratory and we were able to get samples of that to take down to my laboratory that i managed down in geelong at the animal reference laboratory and grow this up to areas now that 's very important because it allowed us to to start journey in in trying to solve it so let 's talk about coronaviruses uh it 's a family of viruses uh and as a virus uh we 've we 've met some of it some i guess probably ugly cousins which appeared um a number of years ago so sars um sudden acute respiratory syndrome appeared in singapore and spread to toronto and canada around the early stages of 2000 and mers was another one that came out of the middle east and then appeared also to spread into south korea around about five to seven years later now the issue with these two were had very high fatality rates now that 's actually not good for the viruses survival is not good for people who catch it but what it means is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually shut it down quite quickly which is what they did but i think you need to reference on a couple of serious points mossars itself cost toronto the canadian government about 40 billion dollars now that was really only a few cases to give you an idea about even then we knew what it was so which countries do you think were the quickest to respond to the covert 19 when it emerged singapore south korea taiwan was another one and canada because they 'd actually been there before and they hadn 't been investing in ways to actually approach these types of infections so on the bottom there 's a fancy word zoonotic infections now this is a this virus particularly is one like many uh actually we share with our animal brothers and sisters now we know that sars came from bats and went to uh an animal called the civic cat which is a an animal that 's farmed and eaten through a lot of southeast asia mers actually went to camels and then went to humans we know that the covert 19 came from bats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intermediary one but we do know that this this is certainly the path that it come from uh and my team actually had been doing a lot of work on sars and mers and and and also understanding it which was a good thing because it meant that um when the virus hit they actually had some uh tests to do and as i talked about where we are so what 's going on now this graph here is uh is one that i actually was using right at the start of this pandemic to explain um uh to certainly my own organization but many others that i 've been speaking to along the time the red line there is what you see if you do nothing now that red line uh we 've seen representations of that in wuhan northern italy spain uh and the us and the uk until they actually started to try to bring some control in the green is the so-called flattening of the curve now the reason you want to flatten the curve is so that the hospitals don 't get overwhelmed if your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try to save as many people as possible so in those countries that didn 't do a lot of the measures that we did early on they 've found that they 've had significantly high death rates because the hospitals have been overwhelmed and haven 't been able to help those people in need the problem with doing social distancing and flattening the curve is the blue one that is you actually get surges of disease coming through and we we 're actually living that at the moment here um and you know this was predictable what was going to happen okay the circumstances for how did this happen and all those we can conject make a lot of conjecture about but the point is this virus has not gone away it 's still here it never went away we just bought things under control which to a degree gave us a little bit of complacency in in a community and it 's important to understand that blue curve may repeat again until we in fact actually have much better control measures than uh social distancing and public health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex slide and you 'll notice on this it came from april um now it hasn 't changed that much which is actually quite good um but this is actually i 'll take you through this slowly because i know that there were questions about okay when am i infectious how does this spread what does this mean now the information that 's coming to us is uh that first came out of china was quite sketchy but um to the credit of the chinese specialists in there they were publishing a lot of their information as soon as they could um in international medical journals so it wasn 't hidden as much as people would like to say it was we were getting this information very very soon from early um january and and onward the american data has certainly assisted us and again the doctors in places like new york have been explaining and doing studies on where they are the spanish italian uh the english uh that are all publishing information so this has actually been global collaboration getting the information out so if you 're exposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about two to five days to get symptomatic that 's if you do it takes around about an average of 10 days to incubate now what that means is that through that period you may be infectious at the early stages and it 's touted that it could be two to three days and you 're not actually symptomatic that 's scary so that also means that if you 've been in contact with somebody else who 's got it you really do need to be isolated as well that 's the reason why this virus is so cunning and and can in fact actually take off now through that period um the figures that are alarming and these are increased with age and uh and certainly you know as i 've aged um a lot of the people at younger ages have become a lot younger now what it means is you 're not immune to this if you 're a baby right through to a to an adult the um hospitalization rates for anyone over the age of 45 or so on a world figure are somewhere around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly at lower ages it can in fact actually be lower so these are these are these are these are things that we actually need to look at we hear a lot of stories of young people globally that are thinking oh well it 's not going to be it 's going to be a mild disease and i 'm not going to be that sick well that could be true but you 're going to spread it and if you spread it to your elderly relatives and they get severely ill and hospitalized that 's a serious problem um is it you 'll notice on the side there 's this figure that talks about re-infection now this is this is incredibly um debated at the moment we do not suspect that people do get reinfected but we can 't tell you that categorically that people can get it again uh in that setting uh the other thing is that people are saying oh the bus is mutating now my team has been uh and has just submitted an article to uh the nature journal which is one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genetic code and i can tell you that the changes in the genetic code of the coronavirus are not that significant to render it different from previous versions of it which mean that vaccines that we 're trying to develop will will work for the targets and the drugs will still that 's actually good news carot viruses aren 't like influenza viruses which really change radically every year which means we have to change the vaccine this one seems to be pretty stable but we do know that it 's very persistent on surfaces it can survive for days on stainless steel on wood on fabrics on glass on all sorts of things this is a really cunning enemy that we 're actually fighting so this is the reason why when we talk about what you have to do as citizens um the idea of cleaning washing hands and washing surfaces is very important in australia at the moment recovery and intensive care is sitting around 80 best in the world that 's an absolute fantastic testament to our health services so um whilst we 've been seeing such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in countries where they have had overwhelmed health services so you know be encouraged by by the services that we 've got and be thankful you live in australia so what can you do for a virus there are only three things after you do public health interventions of which we have done an extremely good job in this country you can produce vaccines now vaccines are highly complex and they take up to 10 to 20 years to produce and you 're going oh my goodness that 's not good news all right but i do have good news i like to be an optimist and mark knows i 'm an optimist and even when things aren 't that good he knows that i 'll still be an optimist therapeutics that is drugs drugs are also difficult to make and they can take 10 to 20 years now for those of you that have been following some of these diseases as they 've come out hiv and hepatitis c are two diseases that came in hideous epidemics through the 1980s and onwards they haven 't got vaccines but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and controlling those epidemics so that 's fantastic diagnostics is the other one and now you 've probably heard so much information about tests and tests don 't work or these tests work or we should be doing that test um we 've had to invent the tests from january so that 's why there 's a lot of mixed messages getting there about tests at the moment the gold standard test is one that looks for genetic material of the virus now that 's fantastic it 's really accurate it has taken a bit of time to do this and some of that 's due to the availability of tests um and the way that the tests have been in fact actually processed but we really have done an incredible job in this country with the number of testing the testing rates again um borrowing the worlds of that great international orator the student world western world we are actually probably the best in the world for testing so this is actually really good tests for antibodies are um very questionable at the moment the accuracy of those tests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antibody tests is really for a research setting so [Music] in one sense we still need to understand what they mean because you 've probably read reports where the antibodies start to decrease as people get on so what 's the value of this test we may know about the value of this test over the next few months but it might be longer we may have other tests that we can do particularly what we call point of care test so you might be able to get a test result within 15 or 20 minutes and we 've got a number of prototypes that are being developed in australia and also globally that may help us with that they will be fantastic when we get those s through they 'll change the way that the healthcare services can actually do tests and get the results through fast so let 's talk about vaccines because everybody 's talking about vaccines this is a timeline of what it usually does to like to make a vaccine you 'll see here the basic research and i said that my team in geelong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ researchers in australia had been working uh similarly as had global ones um you know in hindsight we could say we should have invested more we didn 't but what we were doing allowed us to understand what 's the virus look like what animal models could we actually test it in to to understand it further and what some of the basic science that 's um occurring behind there we didn 't get far enough with vaccines for sars because we couldn 't actually develop those so that was an issue the preclinical development is where we actually understand the virus and do some pre-clinical tests in animals which is the work we 've been doing in geelong to see is it safe and do they work we proved that it was safe months ago which is why some of the vaccines that we were testing have now gone into human trials and we 're just about to complete the studies on uh the effectiveness in animals so there 's some exciting news that 'll be coming soon once we 've published and gone through the process you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do that we 've done it in three and a half months so you can imagine how exhausted messiahs are having worked around the clock to do something that was never been done before globally the two samples that we tested one was called oxford and that was recently in the press this week and the other one was the inovio vaccine from the us both of those are now in what 's called phase one human studies so what came out of the study from oxford that was published uh this week was that they have completed their phase one study now what a phase one is small group of people we give the vaccine to them and make sure it doesn 't hurt them and the other one is that it gives them an antibody immune response that 's the exciting news so oxford has definitely generated that in humans as is one of the chinese candidates we have a number of other phase one with other candidates the university of queensland there 's one in adelaide and there 's a couple coming out of monash and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phases um to see whether they work there 's around about 180 190 different vaccine candidates around but most of them are in the experimental or pre-clinical phase so that 's exciting news but this is the caveat we 've got to phase one success phase two success with vaccines before and then they bombed in phase three and that 's actually bringing it up into bigger study populations and and more rigorous study to see they work so whilst i 'm optimistic and excited about it by the by the progress occurring so rapidly if oxford works it could well be shown to work in phase three studies by the end of the year they still have the challenge of producing it to billions of doses because um and then back distributing globally so that 's going to be one of the biggest challenges we 've we 've we face we have never done anything like this in the history of humanity so that 's the challenges that we face to actually lift to this area um but it 's really exciting the fact that australia is um is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to be one proud of but let 's have our fingers crossed that it succeeds i always put this one in there just to show you that lab when i grew up as a young uh young fellow on long ag college i can remember them debating the merits of having this facility and people were saying i shouldn 't have it they should have it this was a massive investment back in the 1970s and commissioned in the early 80s you can see the yu yang 's over in the back over there and uh the alcoa ravana which i think is an md commission that 's sitting there on point henry um that laboratory is one of uh five in the world that has the highest containment that you can for biological agents which is extremely important because we 've been doing all sorts of uh work on all sorts of agents some to try to in fact actually cover those there 's a there 's a whole range of other nasty infections out there that we could catch if they get away so we need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slide but to take you stepping through um to understand where and how hard this work is we get the virus we grow the virus up we we grow it tomorrow so so this is across this top line here we grow it to a level where we understand what it is look at its dna and then develop models to test it in we 'd already done this with sars and we had to just test to set it to work with this virus it did and then we in fact actually start testing vaccines through there and involving that and then we step into the human studies down in the right hand side here which as you can see more and more people with different study designs phase two for the oxford has been conducted in brazil and south africa the reason being they make thousands of subjects but they need to be done in an area where the virus is rampant um and it 's actually out of control so that will test whether or not it stops people getting the virus so that 's why we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom there there 's just areas there where we were turning um so university of queensland had a mathematical model it didn 't actually exist as a real protein so our lab down in clayton made it into a protein so that itself is incredible science to turn a computer model into actually a real protein and then turn that into a vaccine which is now in early or late stage experimental testing so busy it 's a busy time the only other things just to point out rapidly some of the other areas of research that are going on across our agency we talk vaccines diagnostics is the test i mentioned those drugs we 're working with the doherty in particular on looking at which drugs may be able to work on various forms of the disease the analytics there is all of the stats that you see in the papers all of the stats the politicians do there 's a lot of science behind um putting all that together and i 'm proud to say that i 've got teams that have been working hard on that as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that we had a problem of supply uh as every country has and we only had one small manufacturing firm uh and i 'll get it right this time mark it was in shepparton um and uh because i know the mayor and the mayor from over that way directed me and i said i think it 's in vanilla they said quickly and smartly tell me it was in shepparton so um we 've been working with our manufacturing group down in geelong to look at poly wool blends to be about them being actually protective and we 're almost at the final stages of validating those and that means that we can then switch over some of our uh manufacturing factories here in you know clothing factories in here to do this with this particular blend of poly and you 've probably seen brett sutton tell you how you can make masks at home themselves they themselves on those three layers do have protection but you wouldn 't be using those in an operation with catherine 's team in the theater that 's not what that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spread of what you 're on the sterilization work and there 's a lot of this that 's been going on and we 're very lucky this virus does not like soap and water so your grandma was right this virus does not like alcohol solutions so the hand sanitizers work and it certainly doesn 't like bleach and i always point out do not drink the bleach or inject it it is not safe but you need to use bleach diluted to what it says on the packet and spray it on surfaces it 's as good as any other surface cleanser that 's fantastic news because they 're all cheap preventative health this is one thing that i i i do like to point out is because of the lockdown and because of the fear of going outside and catching this so many people have not been getting their usual diseases managed properly we 're seeing people not doing their diabetes checks not doing their heart checks and most definitely we 've seen a plummet in the diagnosis of cancers that that means that people are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact actually rectified the other part is mental health is the other part you know i don 't feel very good either at the moment because the second lockdown is really really a downer it 's a um and and and thinking about how people who are lonely who are alone or who have mental conditions going into this this is a seriously bad time for um preventive health strategies and how we deliver the health as to where it is the bottom line there is we 're already started work on what are we going to do next um and uh it 's um it 's going to be a phenomenal discussion as it goes on so i just thought i 'd finish um on on these the website address at the top there it 's pretty simple if you go to the federal health government site and look for coronavirus advice it 'll come up you don 't really need to copy that whole address there um i cannot stress this more and i know that the premier was doing this um and has done this inconsistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently when you 're outside and you 're in areas of not in your own house covering up your costs and cleaning around your workplace and communal areas and i 've just sort of mentioned what you can use to do that the physical distancing works and we saw that work in the first lockdown by physically distancing not only did we control coronavirus with controlled influenza uh con cold peru um okay and team would know that we haven 't seen it my daughter 's in final year medicine and she 's down at monash medical center and she said the crew board hasn 't had any crew cases and it 's one of the principal areas that receive um pediatric admission so so it 's been quite amazing that lockdown actually works very well it just wouldn 't work normally because we 're social beings we like to mix with each other public gatherings understanding that um even in your own home or with people coming into your own home that actually is a risk um and and and how it works and isolation now the isolation we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh if you 're waiting for it if you if you 've got symptoms you isolate and get a test if you 're waiting for a test you isolate until you get the result of the test and if you 're positive you isolate until you 're told you can 't you can stop isolating it 's pretty simple but people are not getting this and those figures that he uh presented yesterday were just frightening um and so again i i think in one sense that the one thing we have to keep urging is take this seriously this is a serious disease because what 's appearing now as to what this disease does to you in the long term there are a lot of people getting permanent fatigue lung damage kidney damage heart damage even also neurological damage strokes and also clotting problems is not a nice disease to catch and the important thing is don 't catch it and in fact start behaving yourself which is really really a message that i cannot stress too much and the quarantine as to who goes into quarantine and where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you 're living with it is all the advice you need that are on the government side and it certainly is um good common sense so i 'm going to stop there mark and open up for a series of questions as to where they stand yeah so rob just uh we 've got a few questions coming in we 've also got some pre questions um can you just give us an idea similar events like this did have happened 100 years ago um can you give us any lessons from over the over the time that we have learnt from these things yeah look i as a public health physician so a lot of people probably um didn 't know that whilst i was a gp here i was also a public health specialist and i was doing a lot of regional state and even national public health projects and when you study public health you study the history of pandemics and uh every time we have a pandemic we have social disruption um we have riots and uh and and community disharmony we 're seeing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behaviour from nation states but also uh protests for all sorts of reasons um and and and disquiet now during the pandemic of the flu the spanish flu which was a hundred years ago we actually had riots in brisbane and sydney where suburbs were obliged um so so we hope we don 't head into that sort of area but i i must say that what 's going on in the us is actually quite frightening with regards to um as the pandemic lifts up in where it is in the uk certainly as well with the disquiet that 's occurring in a country that 's been severely hit by this the other things that we learned was it took um it took around about three plus years for people 's behaviors to in fact start to move back to what they were doing beforehand reading accounts of mothers who just didn 't want their children to go mixing in crowds for up to three years after this because the fatality rate from the spanish flu was quite high and and i guess for us because we 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us don 't know someone who 's got the disease or affected by it most of us certainly don 't know someone who 's died from it it 's not as real as it is for say my friends and colleagues in new york or or those of who i 've also talking with across europe in settings in in the uk um so i think in one sense the complacency and denial are actually a reflection of what you see and what you don 't see the other the other thing is is that pandemics do affect our bottom line they do affect uh budgets they do affect the way we actually function as a society with work and everything else so um we we 're in for a rocky road mark and it 's um and and it 's something that we all need to take quite seriously and work towards okay thank you now we have got some questions uh coming in and so denise asks what cell culture is used to culture covert 19 on yeah well that 's um that 's a good question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serum which is what we used other people were using monkey kidney cell cultures and things like this uh if if you 're a devotee of pandemic films um contagion 's probably the closest one at least we had to find cells that the the virus wouldn 't kill um in the first since that 's one of the tests that 's one of the hardest parts and once that was done um a number of people have grown them in another so we have banks of uh cell cultures in our laboratory which we use for various diseases to to do that but the one that we 've been using is a calf serum at this stage okay good thank you and denise also asks is the number of positive tests from people totally symptomatic rather indicative of false positive i.e the sensitivity of the test is inadequate great question um so uh a lot of tests have what 's called a false positive and a false negative rate um the the good thing about uh the so-called pcr or the gene test is that they have very very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those mean they have low false positive and low false negative rates but yes when you 're doing thousands and thousands of a test even a point zero zero zero one false positive rate or they 're probably around about point zero one um we 'll still have many people that will actually have a false positive the answer there is is that if you 're actually still disputed your test was positive you have another one you know a couple of days later that 's the simplest way we resolve that situation clinically um and the most important thing is we don 't have too many high false negatives sorry uh yet false negatives because if you have too high false negatives that means people who have got it are actually out there and they think they haven 't got it so that 's the the issue about where it is now that 's been the problem with um a lot of the antibody tests because they 're just not accurate enough to actually use um in a clinical setting yet because uh there 's too many to too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you um here 's another one uh do the antibodies from the oxford phase vaccine study actually kill the covering 19 in culture great question so the oxford team can 't answer that question and my team can and i can 't tell you because um we actually still waiting to publish our results but i guess if you see the smile on the face you probably actually worked out that in in ferris i can probably tell you or at least you can assume the answer but i 'm not going to tell you yet it would be going to be a media scoop okay good thank you rob great presentation clear concise and comprehensive do you have any advice about effective messaging to boost understanding and compliance with behavioral interventions in the general public yeah um again it 's repeated messaging think about some of the great messages that we 've had on smoking control in this country it 's taken us from um you know the 1970s to about now to get our smoking rates down to about 11 across there but people still smoke where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've got to that and as a gp the hardest part was telling people you know you just need to do a bit of exercise and maybe you don 't need to eat as much as what you 're eating um you know we know as humans that uh we 'll take some of the advice and if i don 't want to if i don 't want to do it all i want to do it um now we we um as dan andrews was saying yesterday he doesn 't want to actually impound people who are not doing this but the public health act if people will continue to be mischievous when they aren 't is actually quite strong and they can impound you which of course is a last resort how do we get messages through continual messages across all the areas i think the media has been fantastic the reason i do talks like this is so people ask questions like that why should we do it i 'm saying you need to do it um this is for your grant and your parents and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a magic way of getting people to follow advice we 'd be doing it okay that 's good thank you um here 's another question for you so the role of uv light for sterilization purposes you comment on that yeah um there are a number of um uh it 's you 've got to get the right spectrum and that 's really only available and useful in industrial settings so there are a number of um uv uh sterilizing systems that are used uh by sort of a well some of the sort of the fancy ones that are actually using robotics going through and sterilizing say operating theaters and others at this moment it 's not really as cost effective in that manner but some other industries do you use this um because it can be actually quite dangerous with the wavelength of uv that you actually need so not those sort of purple lights they do nothing so don 't even bother with them it 's really the the commercial applications which a human cannot be in the room with okay good thank you um read the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ah yes well asking a question like this means how despondent do you get the answer is until we have an effective vaccine which certainly doesn 't look like it 'll be if everything goes well we certainly won 't find that starting to seep into general use in the early parts of the mid part of next year means that we will be getting surges in repeated basis and that means that this is going to become part of what we actually have to do um is that when we get surges in case tracking and others and that 's a pretty negative answer mark but the answer there is is that this is this is the reality at the moment until we can get this under control yeah and that ties in with chris 's question the next one what what 's the long-term aim how long are we expecting to deal with this thing yeah and like i said if we 're lucky and we get a vaccine through and it starts being administered across the world and particularly in australia we uh we may find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind there 's 25 plus million of us and there 's certainly a way of doing it to say oxford 's a two-step that means that 's a lot of vaccine doses we 've got to do and administering and immunizing a whole population is not an easy task so um that 's that 's sort of the mechanics of doing all this is the stuff that 's going to hold it back we will be social distancing and avoiding um trying to contaminate ourselves and our friends and families for a good time in through through next year um even in a positive scenario okay thank you and um just for the viewers we 'll be going to the hospital people shortly for katherine and their team i 'm keeping an eye on the time so we 'll keep doing the questions for a little bit longer and then we 'll then we 'll cross to catherine um hugh asked the question what is the pathophysiology of the virus and its effect on the human body sure the virus itself um those little spikes cute spikes you saw in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ace2 receptor which we actually have on our lungs and the ice2 receptors are actually found in many other organs as well so um by binding to those it then enters the cells and then enters the the the body it uh it doesn 't really hang around in the blood in the serum that long it actually really hangs around more in the tissues so it certainly binds into the lungs and at that point your immune system by around about day 10 recognizes that something is untoward is going on and what it starts doing then it starts attacking the cells that have got the virus in it which are your cells and therefore your lung damage gets worse that 's what they call the cytokine storm now also the ice twos are found in a number of other areas of parts of the brain the heart kidneys liver and also uh in a few other organs where where in fact it would do that so in a sense the virus infiltrates your body your immune system takes 10 plus days to recognize something 's going on and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of infection where your body is starting to cause harm to you and uh the lung damage is particularly the the one that leads people to need respiratory support in intensive care and others so and what you wait for at the end of that is for the body to slow down it 's over zealous attempt to get rid of the virus and then you settle down and get stable so you can come out of intensive care or hospital um so it 's really a wait and watch and support sort of episode with the with the virus okay great thank you um kevin asks how can we improve local contract contact tracing uh there are delays occur occurring which seems unreasonable do you have a comment about the tracing we 've never had um such a army of contact tracers that we 've uh we 've we 've mobilized at the moment um and at uh at this stage there are tens of thousands of contact tracers i 've been told and they 're recruiting more to uh to look and assist in chasing those cases down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is we 've never done this before and we 're actually training and mobilizing contract traces as we speak to try to take on the the effort to do this uh and i i would make a call out to all of the contact races out there that that unbelievable job that they 've been doing and no other country has done what we 've been doing with our contact races as to where we 're standing good thank you julie asks should we be all wearing face masks when you 're when we 're in town doing shopping in horsham yes um and and i 'm not going to be too derassive in this but every time i go into horsham which is as infrequent as possible um there 's a reason why the doctor who knows a lot about infectious diseases is hiding in nutty mark as i told you mark when you were putting in the heater for me it 's it 's uh there 's only 500 people here and the chance of actually running to anyone in the street is not very high um when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how close people are i 'm dismayed by how how close people are actually saying face to face talking with each other maybe we 've got a lot of deaf farmers in the community um and and everyone 's sort of moving in close to hear each other um the reason is um and and the answer here is yes i would be wearing a mask where i could not adequately social distance and that includes um when i 'm shopping if you saw me in the streets last friday i was wearing a mask okay good thank you um now the next one 's a good one i 'm taking you back to your gp days in horsham and uh and you 're also a dad so you 've got children as well so and and it 's important we get the right message to our young people um particularly who are worried about this thing so young liam has sent a question in um and um which i 'm going to ask you liam 's question a minute but i 'd also like you to comment on on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be telling them at this time and realizing that um um there is worry around so the question from liam he says could heaps of people who are asymptomatic good heaps of people who are asymptomatic be spreading the virus everywhere are you a great question lynn the answer is yes um and uh that 's what we call about these super spreaders so you know a group of young people go to a party um and they come back with the virus and they incubate it and then they can spread it to others and they they 're not actually sick they don 't know they 've got it so so that is actually how this virus is doing a lot of it spreading from the asymptomatic and that comes from people actually uh exposing themselves untowardly towards other people who may have the virus so that 's the reason why we 're going for lockdown the other thing that 's a call out to liam is um it 's it 's it 's times like this and you know for those of us that sort of live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pigs and all those other things with the cuban crisis and how fearful we were of a nuclear holocaust this itself is also going to pay out to children with regards to how stressed they are and so i certainly think that parents should be paying a lot of attention to their children as to how stressed or overwhelmed they may be to this because it 's extremely hard not to be obsessing about what are the latest figures who 's got it or what will it mean um you know children along their various development stages can um can certainly uh uh you know blame themselves even like 10 year olds will blame themselves for things happening around them it 's it 's a matter of actually again working working with your kids being honest with them but also assisting them through very very stressful times because you know they haven 't been able to cuddle grandma and grandpa i mean grandma and grandpa are hurting but the kids are hurting too but they didn 't have a proper school holiday or they 're not even at school um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not seeing their friends or playing with them so this is a serious change and we need to actually be honest and up front about that and we need to look out and obviously seek professional help if you need it because it 's available that 's that 's very good thank you perhaps on a more lighter note but just still important looking ahead with our community events and judith is asking the question um is august too early to start planning for a 2021 neddy muck show yeah judith um i i knew you 're going to come to this because you gave me the question and in fact i knew that you 're going to be on the call and i was only going to put up a couple of the pictures i had from the nude calendar behind me but i thought i better not um so so for those of you that don 't know dude at this uh is the famous uh is the famous j secretary that made us bear all for uh national show fundraiser um i 've never lived that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good sense of humor about it now would i be planning this um i i can 't give you a positive answer on that judith because we 're going to get surges continuing on will we have a show in march i don 't have an answer for that will we be actually opened up and having a show like we used to the answer is probably not if you 're a betting person but um let 's be positive about the show and show spirit how else could we have a show where we could actually be safe if if the virus is still in the community that 's one way of looking at it but the reality here is it 's unlikely that we will have things under control over the next 12 months that would allow us to have very large events and that 's not good news to hear is it okay good thank you i 'm gonna ask i 'm gonna ask you one more off the list and then we 'll go to catherine and the team fantastic so um how 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintaining the basics understand this but if no vaccine can we roll the dice yeah there 's a few things there yeah so so there 's an ethical question um is my life better than someone else 's which means that if we opened up society and allowed us to be infected like say brazil has done that means we will lose a lot of uh of our elder members of the community is that ethically acceptable in my opinion no it 's not um but it also means that people even over the age of 45 could could die as well so this virus in countries where it 's been allowed to go free has has in fact actually killed um productive active working people with young kids families and others um and this has been a global issue where people haven 't controlled it so there 's a very solid reason and i i do certainly applaud the way that our governments have come together to bring this under control to protect all australians equally which is in fact actually the best thing that we can do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think in that setting on the other side herd immunity you 've got to get to about 80 percent coverage now but the only place on the planet that i 've heard about where this is my tagatoo is the suburb of queens in new york and they 've sort of reached that magical figure of around about 80 immunity but at what cost tens of thousands of deaths so so in one sense no and the other thing is human behavior is once people start dying around you even countries like brazil they found that the economy slows down and goes sluggish and people stop and they stop going outside because they don 't want to catch it even if their government says you know keep the economy going people don 't do it because they don 't want to die so it doesn 't work in in that sort of setting so is heard immunity possible no it will take a long time before we have heard immunity of any consequence like we do say with influenza and things like that it 's not going to happen um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real problem because i 'm old enough to have lived through the last significant recession the so-called tech wreck of the 80s to the 90s had friends that lost jobs cars houses mortgages all sorts of things like this and this is worse than that and we are going to see a lot of stress here and as a society we are going to have to actually reappraise and balance what we do and you know from a council 's perspective your job we we we have you there as council to actually support all the citizens across the rural city so there 's going to be a lot of work we 're going to actually have to do to make sure that um we we protect and support and help the broader community big job ahead of us mark yeah yeah good thank you um so we 're going to do you know we 're going to cross to catherine and our team catherine if you can give us a bit of an update of what 's happening in your patch at the hospital um i 'm also aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's session which i 've got here so we 'll go back we 'll go to them a bit a little bit later on so um over to you catherine if you could just give us a little bit of update of how things are progressing at our hospital thank you our team at our hospital are working exceptionally hard and exceptionally well to support our community to keep well and to support them at this anxious time as rob 's spoken about quite eloquently in how to deal with covert or suspected covert and our job is to keep our team well because you need our team to be well you need us to have as many people on the front line as possible but also to keep you well as well and so we 've got a number of initiatives going i suppose the big one which is on one of the questions is about access to that testing and how do we go about getting that testing to be easier to access and to have it in a more timely manner and i 'm really pleased to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been working hard with us and we 've got the australian defence force arriving tomorrow to support us to expand the service so we 'll have a drive through service commencing on saturday um and the six uh defence force people will be here for at least three weeks but will be able to be extended so we 've spoken to them today they 're experienced people who have been involved in this process in melbourne and in shepparton and bendigo and they 're coming to help us make sure we can get the numbers through the council came to help us with traffic flow so we think we 've got it sorted um and people it will be advertised and people will be able to come and be tested we 're still doing symptomatic testing um not asymptomatic testing we work with the department to ensure that we follow their guidelines at all time and it 's symptomatic testing the other thing that people are worried about is our current cases um and unfortunately we have some and that 's okay um and what we 're doing is working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone who has been identified as a close contact will have been contacted by the department and there 's a process in place for them to be tested so if they 've got symptoms they come down straight away and get tested and go home and isolate if they haven 't got testing they isolate and then they come on day 11 and get tested um that that 's per the process that the department have said so we 'll have availability of people to follow that process if they 're a close contact um and we 'll keep working with our community to ensure that they have access to be tested and to follow the department guidelines but the process the information we really just want our community to do is just assume that covert 's in our community because it is and follow the rules that are very clear um wash your hands wash you clean your house and your everything you touch wear a mask when you 're out in the community and if you 're not well stay home get tested and then stay home because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be contributing to the spread um and that 's not what we need at this point in time as a health service okay good thank you catherine now you 've got with you there marie and jenny so perhaps marie could you just give us an idea what your responsibilities are at the hospital and any other comments you want to make and then i 'll ask jenny the same yep so my role i 'm the director of clinical services and i 'm responsible for the inpatient areas of the hospital and including the assessment clinic um so i guess you know one of our challenges is and and rob uh mentioned this as well we our numbers um in emergency have been down over the last few months and we are worried that people who are unwell or have chronic illness aren 't going to their regular appointments um and then when they do present to us they are sticker um and so i guess you know we want people who have any sort of symptoms to follow the rules from saturday the drive-through clinic will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're going to be tested uh we don 't want people turning up that need testing to our emergency department because it exposes um our team if you 're unwell and you need emergency care of course that 's what that department is for um but as catherine alluded to you know we 're trying very hard as well to keep our team members safe so that we can turn up to work good thank you marie jenny thanks mark um well i 'm one of four infection control nurses at the hospital and for years we 've been attending um conferences on pandemic planning and every time it comes up we roll our eyes and we 'd be like oh yeah and clearly that 's paid off because now we 're in the middle of it so our role has just been huge you know since march i work with three other amazing women who are doing a great job and our main goal is to keep our staff safe so there 's been lots of education lots of work on policies and procedures and slow and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspected so why are you normal now is everything we do has a covert layer on top of it and that 's what we as an organisation has worked really hard to do lots of education lots of liaising and coordinating i 'm really proud that as a hospital we 've worked really well together as a team and i think that 's probably what 's impressed me most um so we 've done we try to get the message out to staff and public and community about the best way to do things we 've done videos we put up posts you know we work well with pete miller he does a great job on communications and it 's just always trying to think of a way to communicate with everyone in the community because everyone takes in things at different levels and different ways so it 's it 's trying to saturate that message and sometimes we feel like that 's all we say but clearly that is all we can do and so that is you will hear us continually telling people to socially distance continually talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a party hat put it on properly and do it properly and test is unwell and that 's if i 'm well it 's really hard it can be the mildest of symptoms so we encourage anyone in the next few weeks with the mildest of simpsons to symptoms to turn up and get tested because that 's the only way we 're going to control it in our community at the moment and we need there is so much information on the department 's guidelines about what is quarantine and what is isolation there 's no way you can 't understand what to do you just gotta go and find it it 's easy to find and if anyone needs help with that then we can help them but it 's just so important we do it properly okay that 's very good thank you jenny okay so we 've got some questions which were we received in advance and there 's a couple of them are probably tied together in the fact that um information requesting information should the community be told more about when and where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got the virus here and i understand there are restrictions about how much information can be released to the public but i think you would agree that that can be frustrating did someone want to comment on that please it is frustrating but um we can 't breach privacy and confidentiality of any patients that have come to hear and if it was your loved one um you wouldn 't want us to be breaching privacy and confidentiality about that so we won 't compromise on not breaching that our suggestion is to the community is just be of the understanding that coverts out there and expect um to that someone you know may have it and you need to follow the guidelines to physically distance wear a mask wash your hands and and just assume that it 's in our community it doesn 't matter if they 're from melbourne or from horsham it 's in our community now okay good thank you um dr rob this could be a question for you as we are told cover 19 travels through the air um is it being drawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's uh that 's been a question uh that we 've been uh attempting and trying to answer from a whole way off i 've been party to seeing some of the studies done that the airlines did in the first instance anything that 's got a hepa or a fine mesh filter attached to it is generally going to filter those things straight out the other thing that you 've probably heard more and more about is the idea of heavy particles and fine particles and miss particles holding and this is the reason why in closed areas with people who are not not usually around and you can 't distance from you should wear a mask or you should get out of that situation um so so it 's really more the close contact and the prolonged close contact that 's actually the important part here um depending on the maintenance of the filters on the system there 's a whole lot of variables that answer that sort of question mark so it 's a lot of those fabric filters on there if they 're clean and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing a pretty good job but again it comes back to minimizing the time that you 're actually around people who could be carrying the virus particularly in confined spaces so if you want to have a chat with your neighbors and things like that you do that outside it 's far easier that way by standing there and you minimize the times that you could gather now that makes a problem for workplaces that 's why workplaces have a lot of strict rules about how to maintain distancing and staff density numbers and things in the worksite place so those are things to actually consider there rather than in fact actually thinking is my air conditioner i 'm actually filtering the air okay good thank you we received a number of questions from dr hooper in hall 's gap rob in advance i 'll just probably pick out one of them a prime consideration in the covert situation is the existence of factors that are associated with the severity especially in the elderly however there is no discussion of these factors yeah look you you sort of made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're deaf i 'm deaf and it means that i usually lean in to hear you so um that that 's one problem so the elderly are actually more likely to do that and get closer to you and you find yourself pushing people away um i i think that 's that 's that 's a one of the great uh factors that actually make this virus spread the other one is elderly will often have another disease so they might have diabetes or lung disease or heart disease and certainly they will do worse with the viral infection than others not necessarily more likely to catch it but they will do worse and also the reserves that you may have um fitness and and prime condition obviously helps but it 's not the actual be all and end all with regards to how the disease will affect you okay thank you i 'm just conscious of the time we 've got another another five minutes to go so i 'm just going to know going out to some of the questions which have come in as you 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quicker result would help greatly is anyone working on that the answer simple answer that is yes uh there are a number of companies in australia and globally that are working on rapid turnover tests uh there 's a there 's a regulatory process that they have to go through in a validation process to make sure that they are accurate and are doing what they 're doing and so a number of those are in the final stages of testing which i know about good thank you from the number of daily tests that we 've been mentioned at the daily news conferences example in the thousands does it mean that all those people have had some foolish symptoms i 'll probably ask my health team actually what their experience has been about uh you know what what on illnesses and what isn 't um we do know in the lockdown in melbourne that they were testing everybody but that was only in those tight spots at that particular time i don 't know jenny if you 've got a thought on that um we 've had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the department um but mainly we are still symptomatic testing that 's what we 've been thought at but as i said before it is the mildest of symptoms so you know if you 've got a bit of a runny nose or a tickle or a sore throat now 's the time to get tested so yeah um there certainly is but it 's kind of up until this point we sort of tucked through this a runny nose or a bit of a tickle in your throat but it just isn 't the time to do it we have to treat every time that happens we have to go and get tested so that 's good good thank you jenny um this probably relates to the similar thing so if someone is waiting for test results without having a known direct link to a positive case do the rest of the family have to isolate if they are asymptomatic who can answer that one for us the person who has been tested should isolate within their house okay they should isolate themselves away from the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't share bathrooms you don 't share cooking facilities and as rob said before you don 't sit in a room with people so if one of your family members has been tested their suggestion is unfortunately is that they go off to another area of the house and wait until their results come back and keep away from everyone yeah okay that 's good thank you um this probably touches on what you 've said before rob about the uh um about the vaccine so which vaccine work is most promising in its timely development i think you did touch on that but you might want to just mention that again please yeah so so the vaccines that we tested in the first one were once the world health organization um and uh sepi which is a a global organization that 's been supporting the vaccine development that they selected so the oxford vaccine and the inobio vaccine are certainly two front runners and there 's another one called moderna which is in the u.s which is another front runner um and uh are certainly showing some promising signs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward but the question is getting all the studies and other things together this is um uh incredible but those those three are um showing the most promise at the moment but i can 't guarantee they 'll get through okay good and the follow-up to that dennis denise asks when the vaccine becomes available how long will it be for the 20 plus millions of australians to be immunized considering that other billions of people are in line absolutely that 's um that 's a very difficult question to ask so um there are seven different types of platforms for vaccines and they all need their own particular factories we 've got one manufacturer in australia called csl and they make only two types of vaccines so uh if the vaccine that actually works isn 't or can 't be fitted into that process it won 't be made in australia so uh it 'll have to be we 'll have to be purchasing off a international um manufacturer what is exciting is i have never seen this sort of level of collaboration between research organizations governments and and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already the large companies are working out how are they going to in fact actually manufacture which vaccine if they 're successful but again it 's like trying to back the winner in the melbourne cup you know you you don 't know which one 's going to win and uh you could lose all your money if you threw it all down at the wrong time so you know we do need to know which ones are actually going to do that before we make significantly big investments on on switching on factories to make these okay good thank you a final question from alicia if you have had if you 've had a negative test result and a week or two has passed and still have some symptoms such as a mild sore throat or a cough should you be retested probably that 's a um catherine and one of your team like to answer that please we all said yes well said yeah uniform yes um and um andrew has just asked uh an extra little question uh dr rob what are the chances of football season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're actually making me weep i know how important the footy is to all of our small towns and communities around here and i unfortunately can 't um i can 't give you a positive answer i 'd like to make it as negative possible mark but i can 't um i can 't give any guarantees we 're just going to have to wait and see what happens with this viruses so it 's still going to be around at that time we 're seeing the afl do an amazing job at keeping us amused with uh watching our teams makes fools of themselves all in other states but you know community football community sport is vital for the strength and well-being of our communities but we 're going to have to keep working out how we might do it so it 's safe and at this stage i don 't see a way of doing that right okay all right so rob before we wrap up is there any final comments or statements you 'd like to make to our community well i think the four of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your elbow clean your surfaces uh and and maintain your distance from everyone else and wear a mask when you cannot in public so i think in one sense uh you know i 'm getting the nods from the hospital and they didn 't pay me to do this all right rob thank you so much for your time and catherine and marie and jenny we appreciate that also acknowledge the work of the council staff which have helped make this happen today and cameron 's uh is is out there making this all pulling it all together so acknowledge the work of those other people and i thankfully uh particularly the people who 've joined in with us today launched their questions we got through most of the questions but not quite all of them and so we will make an opportunity perhaps to answer some of those other questions via the council facebook site if we can so thank you very much for joining us and stay safe thank you,"(-36.7142554, 142.2016929)"

Graham Harrison the director of communities in place mr. Kevin O 'Brien and the director of infrastructure mr. John Martin we 've received some questions in advance of tonight 's session and we 'll start with working on the questions that we 've received but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lodge your question why are we going there is a chec facility and you 're welcome to use that and the session is geared to run for about half plus 6 and if we don 't get for all the questions well we 'll click the ones that we 've missed and we 'll be answered after the session I suppose the key thing to science out of the station is that one of the most important things that the council produces every year is the annual budget and work on the budget for the coming financial year started last November and about as you can imagine once we came along and the coronavirus impact it 's really being almost taken a lot of quite a few steps backward and have to really look at the whole thing in response to the Coburg 19 emergency so councils produce their budget which is now out for public comment and one of the purposes of tonight is to try to provide some information to help people understand what is proposed in the budget and also to encourage you to submission it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budget don 't agree with or it also meant maybe a submission of saying well we agree what you 're doing and that will help guide the council 's when it comes to making the final decision about adoption of the gun of the budget but before we get it even there there is an opportunity for those submissions to make an influence on the budget as it should be and some submitters have the opportunity because they 'd like to be so all that will happen in the lead-up to the adoption so the I suppose the key date at the moment is to keep in mind is that the budget submissions are open until the 7th of July and so we 'd encourage you to take the take that opportunity and and share your thoughts on this year 's budget as every year there 's a lot of initiatives and plans to do things there 's some infrastructure projects of quite quite lengthy in their list and I 'll touch on those a few of those a little bit later on so as we go through the night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be answering the questions but also providing some general information about what is in the draft budget for the Washington we 're all sitting this year some they 're going to commence with the question answer process if you like and I will read the question that we 've received and the question is first name and then I 'll invite the appropriate director to respond so the first question received is from Fletcher while the farmers get the biggest rate rise again I have council but it even for the farmers how come 4.5% increase be justified during a pandemic farmers spend money every week in ocean and local businesses they are the ones will help them recover not council increasing our rates and giving it back to businesses please explain how this will work great I 'm mute yourself Graham so we can hear you that 's it what no that 's it I had to happen didn 't it and why the farms get the biggest rate rise essentially because they 've had the largest increase in property values so property values for farms have increased on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five percent increase for residential so to put that in into context you know a thousand hectare farmer sort of average value would have increased last year by three hundred and thirty thousand dollars whereas a residential property will have increased by about ten thousand dollars so that contributes to the rate rise being more for the farm properties than the residential in terms of have council got it in for farmers well no certainly not it 's basically it 's the prices that are being paid for land out there in the community that 's driving up the values and the values are then in turn impacting on the rates so it 's the tax system at work and council did provide a further discount or a differential to farmers of 13 percent last year which was passed on through the rating system to the other sectors in relation to spending in the community and of course any spending in the community benefits the local community and certainly farmers and councillor light contribute to that especially during times of economic downturn such as been experienced with covered 19 but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates are just one of many taxes that most of us pay you know there 's there 's income taxes capital gains tax consumption tax land tax stamp duty and you know we all know them there 's a host of many more they all raise revenue from in different ways they apply to different sources of income and capital value and the like to to generate in taxes for all level of government not just it 's not just local and I suppose they varied in nature so that across the board each sector of the community pays their fair share some sectors get exemptions and concessions in varying ways but hopefully what one person or one sector avoids or doesn 't pay in one area they perhaps don 't in another that as a whole creates a fair tax system across our nation and ensures that everybody contributes to the society that they live in it just so happens that the local government has been left with the tax that is a tax on wealth as measured by land values so we 're the ones that have that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way that we can raise our rate so hence if farm values are increasing significantly more than residential values so the level of wealth increasing and therefore so does the tax contribution the next question from nivel a four point eighty percent rate increase for farmers under a two percent rate cap is not on I 'm sure councils remember in 2018 under a two point five percent rate cap Council gave farmers a 14 percent rate rise above residential this council expects farmers to pay rate rate increase almost two percent higher than residential 2018 was never to happen again in March mr. Harrison admitted that in 2019 even with a sixty three percent differential at least seven percent of farmers still paid more than in 2019 I would I would suggest that with this year 's revaluation and rate increase that figure will now be closer to 30 percent thus the need for a further differential increase will you give a 60 sixty percent farm differential the vff sent a pre budget submission to all councils asking for a nil rate increase was this presented to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting so in relation to the first question question part of the rate review process that was conducted in 2018 was the adoption of a rating policy that that basically put in place a trigger so that when farm differentials would be reviewed or any differential for that matter and that trigger said that if the difference between the increasing values in one sector compared back to the residential sector was more than 3.5 percent then we then council would instantly look at the differential so in terms of what I mentioned just before the actual the farm values rose by 4.4 percent and the residential rose by 2.95 so the difference between the two there was only a one point four five percent more increase for the farm value so that didn 't trigger that that policy in relation to the the question around the vff letter I 'm not sure the exact situation with respect to the letter I believe it was sent to the mayor but having said that the the budget has been only made available to the community for comment as of the 1st of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of July and the VFS letter will certainly be considered with all other submissions received the vff is is one of many groups out in the community and it 's a representative of some farmers not all farmers and it doesn 't necessarily get treated in a different way and it 's it 's um its position will certainly be considered in the submissions that we receive thank you grow move along now we have a question from Heather are we looking the Information Center I 'll add an extra word it 's the Visitor Information Center why we 're looking at moving the Visitor Information Center you may think that animal is the right place but it sounds like you are not gray no means we traveled to rockhampton and there were too many Caribbeans and a narrow Main Street so we just moved on from that place and spent no money there the same will happen here people talk and we keep going through town without stopping Kevin could you respond to that place you mr. mayor council has decided that the visitor services should be integrated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visitors and ensure that that is the connection happens with the central activity district as far as long parking is concerned we have got additional long-long parking for for gray nomads and the like in close proximity on to the Horsham town hall and also we 're looking at obviously bringing that online and reviewing that further so we 're ensuring that we 're providing for those needs to enable people from outside Horsham to connects with our visitors services and also they also activity district as well through providing adequate parking thank you Kevin okay the next question is from cats I 'd like to know how many consultants were employed or contracted by Hormel City Council in the 2019 2020 year and how much did we pay for their services so no thanks mark and thanks for your question cat so we engage a huge range of contractors and consultants to deliver various services where we do not have the internal resources or staff or this necessarily the skills to do the work and it could mean a new range of areas like you know where this design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rental services oven planning and so on there 's a long list of things in our way we don 't have in-house expertise but it is about finding the right balance in a so that we can be most efficient and effective as a council in doing all the things we expected to do so to answer your question in terms of how many consultants we engaged during the last 12 months so we had 39 different consultants at a total cost of over 700,000 747 thousand to be precise and yeah so there were sort of for instance you know 14 one in engineering design there were 80 in environment in West area as you would know we 're on a major landfill in the region then use planning you know that we had six consultants doing all sorts of projects ranging from this Bush himself structure Brando City to River master planning you know planning scheme amendments we had the transport planning consultants for five projects and also for land valuations and IT projects um so all up as a Cydonia seven hundred forty seven thousand dollars but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million dollars you know so that sort of is 1.2 1.3 percent you know so that 's the that 's the sort of the overall spin on consultants thanks fun ok thank you so our next question is from Pamela counsel is spending one point three four million dollars on the river precinct why not put that one point four million into any investment fund sorry why not put that one point four million dollars into an investment fund until everybody is happy to proceed with the river project later on we can then use the interest gain for the riverfront activation Kevin please thanks mark thanks Pamela for the question Council received feedback from the community on the Cedar River master plan and as a result adopted the plan late last year with some modifications it has now secured just over 2 million dollars of through federal and state government to advance the first Precinct you 'll never get total agreement from the whole community on any on such a major project there is however significant community support to proceed as white Council has adopted the master plan and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit update so currently you 're working on the the river precinct and we knew when we look at the other precincts so the first precinct is the riverfront activation we also starting to plan for precinct 2 which is the city able soya Park precinct so we expect that similar design works will be developed with the community over the next some of the remainder of this calendar year as far as developing up the the plans for that city able soya Park precinct and also understand in the budget there 's some money set aside for the feasibility study for the outdoor precinct oh yes and that 's is to look at whether the indoor outdoor regional sports facility is located at the show grounds or alternatively in Horsham west there is funds allocated the budget but it 's subject to matching funding from the state government and if that funding is secured that we go ahead and carry out a feasibility study to assess where that the need for that facility and where it should be like at it why do we have the Divis right here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates are half the amount of ours great yeah this is often a statement we do hear and it tends to be when people are comparing particularly Melbourne areas urban areas with Horsham and if that comparisons made with the city where the council 's perhaps got five to ten times of their our population and in which to share the service costs and where they maintain only around 50 kilometres of roads as compared to our 2900 then yes the difference can be quite large however Horseshoe Council is a is a regional city for the western region of the state and and it provides a wide range of services to residents not just from a municipality but also from outside things like the Aquatic Centre and the Performing Arts and even the large CBD area that we maintain and so when council rates are compared with other regional cities such as the likes of Jalan Bendigo Ballarat Wangaratta were dongha they 're the regional cities around around the state we are slightly higher than the average of those groups and that 's about 3.5% but those those include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well but when you compare us to the smaller regional cities like the likes of Wangaratta were donger and Warrnambool then we 're pretty much in the middle of that group II what I did what I 'd encourage is the state government it 's got a website called know your council if you google that you 'll find that what you can do is you can go and actually have a look at a whole range of measures for our our council and you can compare it up to with up to three other councils in our regional cities grouping and you can have a look and see where we do stack up with those like councils Thank You Graham Road construction in the current budget there 's plans for 1.8 million dollars worth of urban road expenditure 3.8 million dollars for rural roads and also 429 thousand dollars for footpaths and cycleways probably a question fit for join if you wouldn 't mind answering how this council decide which roads they 're going to upgrade you have to unmute yourself John of course I am sorry thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one is we do regular condition assessments for all of our roads to monitor the condition and we score them on a scale of one to five where one 's quite new and then condition fives reaching into their useful life so we do that across the whole musicality streets in town and rural roads as well gravel and sealed roads alike so we have a ranking of those and basically the the roads that are in the poorest condition based on that assessment generally come to the the top of the list for reconstruction but it 's also based on maintenance history as well to get a lot of requests for repairs to pass the system or we get a lot of around our more regular inspections or indicating that we 've got a lot of maintenance problems that also influences which streets or roads get upgraded thank you John now when you have a question from Sonia regarding the code 19 budget allocation we are struggling enough as it is now without the added stress of paying more on our rates you 're only going to make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of kovin so shouldn 't we all spare the added stress of paying extra what happened to all council actually decreasing rates or stopping them altogether so funky and thanks for your question Sonia covered 19 has impacted on us all in many different ways but certainly financially it has not impacted everyone nor is it impacted everyone even me so council the response is to try and help those who are most in need and that 's what we 're doing through this budget process there are effectively almost 1.2 million dollars earmarked for new initiatives and programs to help the businesses who have been affected and also the community we have been impacted to the through corporate 19 thanks for thank you so it 's important to emphasize it 's the business and also in community groups we support it with that fight sorry so the programs are targeted that both unite the community groups and also the businesses and that 's in addition to the Community Grants program we have so we part of the budget includes close to 400,000 in different community grants so all so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what we already have done in the previous years thank you that probably ties in with the next question also from any it regarding the cowbird 19 budget allocation he 'll residents benefit this one and thanks for your question and it I mentioned earlier you know the record 19 has obviously impacted us all in different ways again financially you know the fact is but the benefits to the community are that council is continuing to deliver the ad or services except you know where we had to suspend some services at the direction of the chief health officer and you know there 's a cost associated with delivering those services we have also suspended paid parking as you may know and we have deferred the payment of rights you know if people have any issues around or difficulty paying the rights of other that matter or any other you know amounts due to the council we have different their payment and we are not charging any interest on those payments and and all these things come at a cost so you know all these things to amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next question is from Pamela what happens to that 2% COBIT increase the following year are the rates reducing back down Brian did you answer that close by me yourself please got it so in terms of the 2% council only sets a budget for a 12-month period so so what will happen next year will be up to the decision of the council at the time so I can 't tell you what will be the decision thank you I know Natalie asks please spend some money on roads in footpaths people in wheelchairs find the very harmful and painful to travel on John could you answer that place for Natalie well Matthew started to answer that question before yourself when you commented on the fact that we 've got about 1.8 million dollars planed in the budget for urban road reconstruction a further 3.8 million dollars on rural roads also about point 4 million on footpaths and cycleways and just in particular mark this current year and next financial year that we talk about the budget has been an extra allocation for for fans to address backlog we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apportions very mobile soils we have these raises in the the footpath so we 're focusing on catching up with getting rid of all those two peasants Matt so you have a similar similar formula formula for grading the condition of the person working out where the money needs to be spent in that area realizing that also there are some streets is math first off we have an inspection program and one of our staff members gozerian often on a gopher but one of the staff members likes to do it on foot just checking every section a footpath and and where there is a bit of a gap measuring it and recording it in our system so we have a map which shows the location of all of these defects that need to be addressed in terms of the section the comment you made mark about which footpath some in some areas there 's no footpath on either side of the road there are some locations where there was a footpath and in the 1950s also and Sebastopol powers and some of the move deteriorated and disappeared and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ footpath on both sides of the road so we 've got a program to catch up on some of those gaps in the footpath Network and progressively replacing those footpaths disappeared and adding a footpath in streets where there is no footpath and those main roads are busy roads making sure that this continuous will pass on both sides for those as well so we 're doing a little bit of a tissue on top of the repair of some of these ones where there are cracks and gaps and and trip hazards in the footpath probably leads to another question John with members of the public do come across sections of footpath which they consider dangerous what 's the process to tell the council about that place there 's a couple of easy ways one mark a phone call to our reception for the customer services and the staff they can directly enter that into our customer request system or people can do it themselves on our web page it 's not on the very first page you get at the moment because of this a lot of coded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tab there that says online tools and there 's a simple data entry form where people can say this is the address this is the nature of the the hazard or the issue and then gets fed into the same customer request system as if you pull up on the phone so a couple of easy ways to do that map thank you okay a question now from Neville as a community representative on the Horsham Aquatic Centre advisory committee I 'm constantly asked when is the pool and June going to reopen the pools require there 's a community service I personally need the heated pool from my geriatric workout especially in this cold weather and my fellow easy workout group members want to start up again and allowance in the budget should be set aside to subsidize the opening of this much-needed exercise venue when will the Aquatic Center reopen Kevin x mark and thank you ever for your question at this stage on balance when considering utilization affordability and cost there 's not viable for council to reopen the pool council has already increased its contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19 to maintain the facility whilst closed once all parts of the facility can be reopened that is when restrictions and further ease this will enable more users to access the venue and therefore be more viable for the facility to that particular place and that particular point in time to be reopened I think you can simply do you want to add anything to the conversation with the pool it is certainly we are receiving quite a few questions from people in the community witness witness that the pool guy who opened realizing that that the around the place some people 's are heading did you want to Kevin mentioned mark we absolutely came to to open the pool sooner rather than later or for that matter all the services at that facility including the gym and we have been working very closely with the YMCA which operated through a facility under contract to see how it can actually be done in a safe manner but also how we can actually then balance it you know with the unaffordability so it 's just a bit and nothing will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement on a proposal which will enable another not only the pool the gym as well as I mentioned yeah probably Kevin that might lead to another question cell wall the pools being closed and we 're probably coming up to three months pretty soon if not already assuming that the pools been maintained for that time nobody 's been coming into it it has been maintained so there 's obviously pumps and so forth that are in there and we have got some Pompeii got some staffing resources to actually ensure that all the maintenance requirements are kept in place and the pools ticking over and so forth so it 's in hibernation mode but it just does still take some work just to ensure that it continues to function whilst it 's not being used thank you how we now have a question from Leo who is employing these people who are sanitizing all the seats beans handrails etc are they local people if not why not local they never changed the rag they use and wipe one item then on to the next half-dozen with the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had a poor week cleaning motion which finished last Friday and it was undertaken by a contractor who 's working for the state government under they 're working for Victoria program the primary objective of the program is to create local employment opportunities for people impacted by Corbett 19 and my understanding is that most of the staff the contractor engaged were local and I know we did have any show early on in relation to reusing of the rags but that was addressed very promptly by the contractor once it was picked up thanks mom I spoke to a couple of the cleaning team and one lady was from Japan and that 'll I use from Horsham and I gotta say our most appreciative of the opportunity to be out there doing something and so I 'm sure all those people who were doing Network water in the state got their own story and I think it 's been a good opportunity as some of the other things but you 've been put in place to assist people affected by these conditions yeah it is also add mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work which the contractor was doing to our own team so we have picked up the cleaning program and you 're very conscious of the need for us to make sure that we total maintain as much you know hygiene in public places and equipment playgrounds you know the gym equipment and non gym equipment exercise equipment so so that 's been picked up so it 's our staff now who be going around and regularly doing the cleaning of in the public big space and they 're all tile also ties in with the we 're getting some workers is it working for Victoria I think that 's the name of the scheme yes I mentioned the working for Victoria program which is a five hundred million dollar program the state government announced early on when nineteen struck and they can primarily for the you know it with the objective of creating employment opportunities for people who had actually lost the jobs and Toto engage people locally and we have signed up with the state government under that program to take on twenty eight staff for next six months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully funded by the state government and we will very soon be starting to advertise those positions there in the range of skills you know whether it 's in waste management area and environmental works infrastructure Works facility maintenance that sort of stuff so those positions they can diem would be to try to engage and local people who have been impacted in their employment new to the recent issues thank you so we now have a question from Kirsty why should we bother with sorting recycling into the right bin when you guys put it all in the tip together anyway John thanks mark I can confirm that Horseman 's recycling throughout this year has continued to be sent to and processed by a recycling processor it 's all been recycled there were a few short months earlier on that some of the unbagging councils were unable to send their material to be recycled and that material did end up a doin landfill our landfill for a few months but more recently all of those councils have secured new contracts with recycling processes there are no recycled materials being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us all the material is being recycled side I certainly encourage people to continue recycling it 's a looking to be doing a job now I notice in the budget on the larger projects there 's 3.2 million dollars for waste management did you want to comment about about that at all and what 's happening up at the landfill primarily market relates the fact that the over a period of years eventual fills up and we have to build a new home when we do that it needs to be constructed a certain standards to ensure that there 's no contamination of the environment particularly in relation to any potential contamination of groundwater so it 's a costly process to excavate a whole them in put the appropriate linings on it and our current cell is nearing completion unfortunately aided by the fact we did receive some excellent recycled material there for a little while so we advancing their plans to get a new cell constructed so we can continue operation of to a landfill thank you John we received a question from Sandra why put rates up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parking meters that were made free during the worst period of koban 19 you have got no money from parking anyway due to the fact people were not allowed to go to the supermarkets so could you play climate close thanks mark and thanks for your question Sandra rates are not being put up to cover the cost of last lost parking revenue those costs are being met by savings we had to find in our operations across the board as a matter of fact we had to find around 2.4 million dollars in next year 's budget to cover they for the drop in our revenue and additional costs you know for the new programs we want to implement you know to assist a the businesses and the community groups garbage costs are only being put out by the amount required to deliver the specific services there are some significant increases happening in the EPA levies which we pay to the state government so they will kick in as of first of January 2021 and that 's sort of you know why is reflected in the proposed carpet charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major component of the increase is to do with the EPA levy increase so we just touched on the parking meters in the bed there 's no bag what 's the future of the banking the paid parking has been suspended and was suspended way back and imagine thing already a problem and that will continue to be the case until until the end of this year until December so that 's councils position at which time it will be reviewed further to determine if it 's appropriate to then commence the paid parking and it also includes some of the fees for the shop owners that 's also been why did suspended for some for certain that so the again in assisting the local businesses so we did suspended suspending for any permit for footpath trading and also and that will continue to be the case in the new budget in 2021 and there also apply to health registrations they will be waving off of fees for certain businesses we who have been impacted by carbon 19 from those phase so that at the end to them so those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay we have a question from rod we know payment tennis club 's courts to be repaired also is the money in this budget for lighting up Haven tennis club courts it 's hard to grow our sport we were held back on both of these items Kevin could you answer that question from Ryan close I think John 's gonna respond to the first component around the tennis courts repairs thank you thanks Kevin thanks mark yeah we 're looking at repairs to a number of tennis courts around the region and this current year 's budget is proposing will repair the three at Sunnyside and two of the courts of quantum because they 've been assessed as being those in greatest need of repair will more urgent need of repair Haven is planned to be done the following year so it 's not getting reflected in the budget thank you you want to anything that camera a mic just regarding the tennis the lighting for the Tennis Club cords that 's certainly project we 're working closely with Haven on and we 're looking at a future funding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project so that we can secure some funding in addition to what funds have been provided likely by the Tennis Club thank you now we may have a question from Pat who is responsible for the upkeep of the safety rail on the overpass some boards are about to drop off John thanks back the overpass is on Cathy Road it 's a big roads Road or they 're now known as regional rows Victoria I 've been in touch with him this afternoon also had one of my team inspected as well after we got the question are are the original rows Victoria is aware of the status of this and they are monitoring it to ensure that it doesn 't become a safety problem now Wilson Street and Dallas Street intersection it 's a nightmare trying to get through and traffic is banked right back to fiber a street especially for the tracks they if the 20 minutes trying to get through also nanny macro is a disgrace with cars trucks and school buses on it with an uneven surface of humps and hollows Jones yes thanks mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been on our our wish list our advocacy list that we 've been pushing to regional roads Victoria now for a number of years fifteen come up is one of the key items identified in community feedback in our recently completed urban transport plan and we pass on that feedback to them as well about this but as I say it 's a regional Rose Victoria intersection and we came to work within to try and get some improved access through there during those peak times in relation to the unevenness of Merrimack Road it is yes it is a regional road Victoria Road but so they are planning to do some upgrade works on that potentially within the next year so subject to their budget as well to map which is what I was going through a review process of prison so they recognize that it is a priority and I 'm planning to do something about it quite soon I soon as you mentioned nearly my approach often our thoughts go to the bin and Road intersection did you want to come in comment on that at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of our near the top of our list for advocacy trying to get some improvement there potentially around Babel some other treatment to make it segment through there so we do have a bit of a list of traffic priorities that we share with regional roads Victoria and and what with the same government to try and get bundles but I suppose the challenge is mark that there 's a lot of competing priorities around the state for those limited funds just a general question would they give it the road anymore Priory saying it is actually classed as a highway does that make any difference for for their thinking the fact there is such a variety as has been highlighted for yeah by Jeff there is a variety of traffic which uses that right look yes baby would the traffic along that section of their back road is is actually relatively hard but looking at the network of highways around the state regional rotatory only deals with arterial roads the highways and and the like so they have a lot of roads with a lot of traffic on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also safety levels as well too and crash histories is one of the things that goes into it and quite understandably where there 's sections of roads which have higher crash history histories for whatever reason that 's something that draws the attention for them in terms of their inquiries for reconstruction or upgrade works yeah can I also just add put in a bid for the cyclists so if you 're if you 're pedaling a bike down any mug road that then intersection in Wilson and Darla is quite hairy for both cyclists and pedestrians and I think during the transport discussions we had last year of saints and drawings about what that intersection could look like to make it safer to the vehicles and people yeah look it 's it 's a consistent thing we 're working on these days mark trying to improve intersections to make them bark friendly pedestrian friendly as well as car friendly roundabouts so great for cars so we had certainly focusing now more on making it that we can improve the flow of foot pedal and vehicle traffic okay thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asks what else what assets in land do the council own can some of it be sold to use for other projects for example can the old tip site on Golf Course Road you saw the cinema thanks mark and thanks for your question rod Council effectively owns two types of vacant land assets and firstly the industrial land you know in the enterprise and Creek Estates and we 're also currently developing industrial land in the intermodal fed recently in doing the industrial land is primarily to attract investments in our region and and in the proceeds of the sale homicide the Bailey cover the cost of development the second one is they do also have a few parcels of land which previously have been used for community purposes but are now surplus we recently developed a process to determine which of these parcels are no longer needed for community use in the future so that they can be sold off the tip side on Golf Course Road will be considered as part of this process and you 're absolutely correct money collected from the sale of these simplest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that matter buying other land assets Thanks so that 's one to talk back a little bit there was a plane that was sort of at one stage that that Lane the Golf Course Road would make a great BMX track on the recycle an amateur you if you ever cost your dis John it hasn 't come up since last night night when we had a median their bicycle Advisory Committee so it has come up from time to time it 's something we 're gonna have a bit more of a look at we need to be sure that there 's no potential hazards in what 's buried there at the site and we also need to ensure that any very material wouldn 't be exposed through any activities on that site but we 're prepared to have a little bit of and just see what possibilities there might be yeah there 's not many steep hills around the place but I reckon that 's one of them okay we have a question from clear the garbage collection is not a problem but we will ratepayers get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Claire 's in our rural areas based on the question because we certainly don 't have recycling across all their rural areas of presently we weren 't working with a community steering committee until only a month or so ago looking at expanding our services and we were doing that in conjunction with the regional waste group as well to where we 're going to get some more cost-effective contracts for extended services through them that process was put on hold so as the state government was preparing a new waste policy that was released in February of this year mark and you may recall the government announced there was going to have a four bin policy whether it be a separate bin for regular waste one for most of their recyclables and into new bins one for glass and one for organics so we 're working with the waste group to develop up have plans on how we 'll roll those out and I expect their bees and further consultation about exactly how we 'll do that and when we 'll do it as well mark early in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved in introducing the news services and fortunately the government policies announced some funding for councils to assist that we 're just trying to firm up the details of when that funding will become available so that we can get the funding at the right time to introduce those services so very keen to get an expansion of resources services into our rural areas but also those two new services as well and one of the questions that springs to mind is is having all those extra beans so do you foresee that people will be have the opportunity to have a say in the size have been they received what they do now certainly mark and often people might say that well a to fully loaded bean curry soft it 's too heavy can I have a small beam will be able to accommodate that but did scale be part of the consultation exactly how we do it and they 'll come up north the next few months yeah and you mentioned the waste groups I can just paint a quick picture about the waste group who is part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resource recovery group quite a mouthful or name includes twelve councils from the outskirts of Melbourne Mirabal I think is at the eastern end of that group through Melton Ballarat Pyrenees more than grampians Horsham and through to the South Australian border so a lot of efficiencies and better more effective apples by working with our neighboring councils in that sort of a partnership Thank You Jon okay I 've got a couple more on the page and we 've got some coming through on the chat so we 'll pick up them shortly we have a question from Brian this budget contains funds to complete works on the wisly Performing Arts Centre but in May 2009 tea the council only committed to providing in-kind management expertise so why is this item being added to the budget Kevin it 's marking thanks bribery question the Weslie performing arts project is being delivered by council funds for the project provided by the Wesley committees Wesley committee is funding the project it 's being delivered by council council is providing in-kind funds for project management expertise and that 's to a value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far as the council resolution in motion to carrying out the works on Wesley as the requirements around safety and so forth to open the facility and the funds being provided for these works are funds provided by that Wesley community and so on Wesley the buildings being closed for the wall down and can you give us a rough idea that when the building woke up and again do you think Oh mark I 'd I 'd be saying to sort of that tune period next year I 'd optimistically hopefully it might be a bit earlier but there 's a few steps to go we 've got to get all the assessments done at the building and then get some designs developed up and then go to market for the works that are required and obviously that that particular problem a what the costs are so there 's a few steps in the process and obviously it 's been some of the planning has been held held up if the kovat situation as well so I 'm certainly hoping that you know by the next financial we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the funds to do the works required we have a question from Riley are there any funds earmarked for the public toilets in the more CBD John thanks man the only sorry the only tax proposal is for some new toilet facilities in the skate park area which is on the edge of the CBD back behind the plaza area off path drive so angly peps not quite in the CBD area but to it the exact details that that 's going to be subject to some planning of how the overall area that little precinct should be best used so that will occur this financial your better hundred and sixty thousand dollars allocated for those toilets thank you John okay we 've got some questions which have been sent in since we started so the first question I 'll go to the top of the page in front of me died asked where can we find the finer details of the packages budgeted to recover from code that have been attributed to the increase in the rates cinahl do you want to have a crack at intervals oh great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from toys yeah certainly in terms of in terms of the detail around them so the detail and it 's a very high level was reported in the in the report that went to council and there was an attachment to that which actually just expanded on some of those programs and Kevin 's economic development team are now ever have a group working together to sort of put all the detail around each of those programs and we can 't commence any of them until the draft budget is is adopted so the intention is that that economic development team will be working together with the likes of business awesome and and other local organizations to actually work through the detail of those programs some will be there a mix of grant programs and promotional things and yes so the detail is being worked on now good thank you now just doing this I believe the next one that 's also from died so the draft states that the expenditure cuts were made in February which is pre covered surely these need to be reinvestigated and the details released @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um in terms of obviously the budget document itself is a large document and the council budget is a is a large undertaking over well over fifty million dollars so there 's lots of funders and lots of things going up and going down in terms of the specific items that had been been cut in their earlier versions of the budget they were reported in the open council meeting in the when the draft budget was it was attached so I 'd sort of refer back to to that report where it did actually spell out some of the some of the cuts that were made and some of the also extra costs that we had as well that were picked up in that area in the overall budget but it is difficult to put everything into the one final document thank you the Community Grants and I was going to mention that tonight this year 391 thousand dollars has been allocated to community grants to help a variety of groups and organizations so the question which has been received from die read the community grants some events on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Community Grants approved for events if they 've been cancelled so that might be you again great I think yeah and I can again point back to the report that went up to council which actually in that report we we said that for event funding should the event be canceled for 2021 then the ground allocation will be withdrawn and the organization will be encouraged to apply for it in the next round for the next year reasons all that is obviously we don 't know whether the event is going to be rescheduled or not and certainly we 've had one contact us already and our grants team have responded to them and we 've sort of keeping obviously a list of those and we 'll make sure that they 're well informed and and don 't miss out on the next round of events of the next round of the grants in terms of other programs if there 's a program that might be impacted we 're not.we we 've said in going back in that report that went to council that we would in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivered in a different time frame where 's an event may or may not occur okay that 's good thank you and also in the business and Community Support Package the recent grants of our proposed to have some grants available there as well yes there are yeah okay thank you all right so there are all the questions we 've got in front of me that we 've gone through the page of questions the time is 629 so similar to anything else you want to say before we wrap up and I think we 've covered pretty much all the questions we had but look come in this this is an ongoing dialogue you know study and I know you will touch on the you know the process for the submissions and the closing date so clearly Navy people have other questions or queries you know by all means you know send us through you know email us them to us or give us a ring and they 'd be very happy to have a chat yeah and Rob asked me to also mention that we have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is on councils website and so once again there 's an opportunity there to engage obviously it 'll be different to previous series when we round about a little bit more with the budget but certainly we 're trying to mute you ways to get people engaged and so I 'd encourage people to check out councils online forum on on the HRC see dr. big go they got a you our website so thank you very much for tuning in tonight groans put his hand up just one other thing that we do we will be having a a drop-in location somewhere in the CBD which we 're still working on getting that location finalized obviously we need to work through covert 19 restrictions in terms of doing that but the intention was to have a place where people can can drop in at their leisure over a period of you know three three days or so so that down in the CBD where where when they come in for other business and they can come and see us and talk to an officer or perhaps counselors as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know exactly where it 's going to be sure certainly it 's very encouraging to see a few more shops acting now in the CBD it was quite busy yesterday in town which is which is very encouraging for all concerned so we 'll leave it there folks thank you very much to the people for listening and joining in with us tonight encourage you to be part of the budget process and so we 'll say good night and thank you very much","(-36.7142554, 142.2016929)"
AUS,VIC,Horsham Rural City Council,Horsham Rural City Council,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgT1yMLyuEix-Z8VvGlWOSg,Online Playgroup - Words are everywhere Final week,_6c9JJn2dPc,20200624,764.8389999999999,"Roberts Ave, Horsham VIC 3400, Australia",2519,hi everybody and welcome to the last video in our series of the virtual playgroup series that we 've been running this term so this week is the final week and because we have been so flat out organizing the content packs for you this week will be just a very short clip I 'll provide the links to a couple of quick resources that actually won 't be a pack going out this week just as we are getting ready and ramped up to preparing ourselves for our face-to-face content coming in term 3 and we 'll have some bits and pieces over the holidays too so this is a bit quick chat and going over one of the last topics in our and small talk information series as well as as I said a couple of quick activities I 've just popped up some details here so a lot of the activities that I know I come up with and Sarah as well is having a look on Pinterest so Peters is great you can either look things I 've been general so it might be games for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes I 'll just look at something to go where but a stack of paper plates and I 'll say paper plate activities for toddlers and they will then come up with all sorts of ideas takes a bit of time to filter through but if you 've got a bit of quiet time you know in the evenings or you know you want to get organized a couple of days in advance can be fun to have a look through and have a look at all those activity ideas and then messy little monsters and fun with Mama are just a couple of websites that actually used this week for our activities so this week 's small talk topics these words are everywhere and it 's a relatively self-explanatory card it says words are everywhere inside and outside and the flip side of the card as you can see has a few examples of words being everywhere and so stop signs and other signs you know letters and words that the children will become familiar with to the point where they will know that that red sign means stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those later stages as they get older magazines as well so again any time that you 're doing reading reading doesn 't just have to be books it can be catalogues toy catalogues any kind of catalogues the children 's reading supermarket ones magazines newspapers if you 've got any around the family that still reads newspapers comics you know anything it doesn 't need to be mainly word based to be considered something worth reading another one down the blondie is the mid-season sales so again when you 're out and about in the supermarket and the shopping centers you 'll see signs around these are children things that the children will see and absorb words without even sort of realizing and then the bottom line is the post box there so that a has words on it and be also enables us to send and receive letters there also include words so I think the main point in terms of this is just keeping in mind that words and letters and all the things that children use to sort of build up their knowledge base before they go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their everyday environment so another few examples that I thought of around the home is they 've got a point real well and things like your cereal boxes or any sort of boxes so packaging at home again the children will know there 's Coco Pops in that box before you know they can read the letters or sound the words out so it 's getting used to recognizing the letters or symbols recognizing the same sort of patterns and they get to know them shopping list is another fantastic one and that 's something that while you 're out doing the grocery shopping if you 've got all this have a chat with them I 'm not sure about recommending them to hold the shopping list because you might end up with a bit of a struggle and getting all torn up but even write out two lists and list them to hold and at least view and talk about it as you 're going around okay we 've got the bread in the milk what 's next on the list oh I can see next we need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's down beside you know the beef or whatever it is so again just that conversation or you know discussion and building on what you 're doing and what comes next that helps them understand and learn more words the more words you use with them the more chance they 'll have of learning them for themselves down the bottom here as well yes so I had the supermarket so going around the supermarket using your shopping list but yet this is in general are awesome and then actually playground as well so while you are at the playground describing that you know the names of the different things would you like to go on to the swing or shall we go on to the seesaw you know the one that goes up and down well look there 's a fantastic little climbing gym here what color those slides on that oh wow then you can you know have discussion about your colors shapes oh wow you know is this like smooth or is it bumpy what about you know what you 're laying into and having those conversations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even in a group sometimes if you 've got older children as well they love to sort of take on that teaching role and check to your little ones in the same sort of same sort of way okay so a couple of basic activities again keeping in mind than being simple home IDs and good ones for your bums so this one is literally peeling tape so find a service if you 've got lino you know on the floor that 's great if you 've got a coffee table down nice and low where bubs can reach also good put it in their watch if they 've got a high chair with a tray another fantastic one lay a couple of you know a few strips of tape different colors if you 've got them if not like masking tape is perfect sticky tape could be a little bit more difficult be at masking tape or washi tapes that you can get something else you 'll use them as well you get from Kmart and things decorative tapes all good peel and put them down in lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child could actually sort of pick at it lift it up and then start pulling and that 's that 's it for that activity in terms of setup so you have a go obviously depending on the art age of the child you 'd want to supervise to make sure the tapes not getting peeled off and pop straight into their mouth but just in terms of you know if they 're struggling with a longer bit of tape because it 's sort of heavier and more stuck down start with little shorter bits and then they can peel them off for their ease go to longer as you can see in the picture here they 've actually got some overlap so I 'd say that Charles you know again a bit more familiar with feeling and tape off but that 's a fantastic activity and up some with concentration and while they focus on that they you know apply themselves and not doing other things that probably aren 't as desirable but you find motor skills that is practicing that really fine pinching and pulling tactic the neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fantastic for other plane and goes on to leading to school readiness and things down the track but yeah peeling tape basic easy and I guarantee she 'll you know they may not get it the first time but they will come back and enjoy that one now the nice easy one is painting on foil so instead of using paper pop some foil down sometimes it 's easy if you sort of wrap the foil around a surface I 've got you know book or something just to help sort of sturdy now but if not it 's quite font on the table as it is cotton bugs are great for this one as well so that it doesn 't tear the foil and yeah let the children go for it because it 's a different therefore smoother it 's a different medium it feels a little bit different for them to be painting on than paper so it 's exploring their senses and that sense of touch as well as the fact that it changes the way the colors look sort of blues as you can see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue when you spread it onto the foil that 's what it does it down a little bit but yeah and you can go with themes so you can have a light blue dark blue a white and a yellow if you want or you can just go your primary colors you know red blue yellow you can never go wrong with all as I said you know and as we 've discussed let the children choose give them a selection of give them a selection of three or four paints as they look you know choose to you know choose your three favorite colors from up on the shelf it doesn 't really matter what colors are used it 's more about the process and exploring that so that 's a nice and a simple and easy one the last one and I will provide a link to this one is this one was actually from the fun with Mama Paige and it 's just a basic puzzle so shadow matching puzzle just show it to you here so what you 've got here are your animals that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the child needs to do is have a look at the picture and compare it essentially to the shadows to then try and work out based on size shape you know recognizable features which shadow goes where so once you cut it on so a cup of page and half cut these animals out you end up with your board here and then your little pieces so obviously these activities more geared at your preschool children so your threes and fours but it 's always handy to have a nice little thing to print out and these are free to print out and then obviously the child matches which one it is if they 're a little bit older they can absolutely help you with the cutting as well if they 're not all that confident or you 're not all that keen have them just cut around this part the straight lines a little bit easier so again you know change it up as based on your child sort of needs your child might not be able to cut or you know isn 't ready to do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get them involved even if it is just cutting on the little edges and you do the more tricky stuff some of these do have some interesting little shapes but they 're absolutely gorgeous and again you can then start talking about what other and noise do we know in the ocean or talking about the names and the colors there are all different things that you can extend on on top of the fact that it 's you know a matching puzzle so but yeah so they 're my three quick activities that I 'll share with you this week I didn 't want to keep you all too long and I know that we 've had a massive term together so but yeah I 'll pop the links up to them on the Facebook page so if you want to print out this activity you can or there 's also links to the other two if you wanted to read up more about it coming up in the next couple of weeks we 've got the school holiday period and we 'll be hoping or aiming to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monday just to sort of ease us back into face-to-face activities which is awesome we will be so last time we had planned and had to cancel unfortunately our teddy bears picnic and we 're going on a leaf pumped theme to a nature play themed activities will be returning to those they 're going to look a little bit different social distancing requires us obviously to limit the numbers that we can have in our room here at the hub and just in terms of our activities will be planning them out so that we 're able to encourage a bit more space I know with young children it 's often quite difficult because they don 't understand why all of a sudden more a little bit more cautious and and staying apart but we will do our best to make sure that the activities are set up in a way that we can practice social distancing on top of the fact that we will will have capped numbers so keep your eye out for information more information relating to these couple of events and then following that item @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will look a little bit different I don 't think the number capping should affect us too much but then we will obviously be following guidelines immolation to cleaning activities and making sure that you know we have the correct number of people for the space we are so keen to get back to playgroup we want to make sure we do everything we can to keep everyone healthier well so that we can make sure that we can continue the rest of the year with face to face play groups but that said I will leave you all to look for this week and yeah and look forward to seeing you all very very soon thank you,"(-36.7142554, 142.2016929)"

process of making those puppets of course you get to practice the skills of warm and gentle so we stay calm while we do the craft make sure it 's filled with lots of language and following the child 's lead and when we do fear work we 're getting a bit frustrated please just stop and think these cards are great little memory joggers so this is a good one to stick on the fridge you can download this song and this little printable book at nancymusic.com for free jump on and have a look and make yourself a little finger puppet to go along with it and teddy can hide behind all the objects in the book great for building vocabulary as well as making a book and words come to life [Music] teddy i see you there [Music] i see [Music] i see you hiding behind the bed [Music] [Music] i see you hiding behind the chair pika brew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where is play is obviously to encourage the child 's imagination and creativity it also exercises kids fine motor skills which is the small actions like picking up and holding objects the child has to work out which fingers they need to wriggle to make the puppet 's arms and legs move in group settings like amongst siblings puppets can encourage kids to work together to take turns and they let everybody get involved puppets can be an easy way to explore manners with kids because it 's done in a fun unusual way and not in kind of a disciplinarian way when kids make up stories with puppets they improve their language skills skills in sentence building and finding words for their stories and even in in narrative and constructing stories beginnings middles ends all that sort of stuff and this is perhaps the most important in terms of warm and gentle sometimes kids can be a bit shy and withdrawn and have a hard time expressing their feelings and puppets can kind of be the surrogate that they can talk through to share their feelings either with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has suggested that kids lose a little bit of their inhibition when they 're speaking through a puppet and you can read about all this uh in more detail on the openschoolbag.com blog about benefits of puppet playing mama 's gonna rock you in her arms pretty baby you 're surrounded in love you can download this book at freekidsbooks.org i can make things like the chef 's hats we made on monday and the puppets they 'll be in your kits a lot of these templates or you can download the either templates or instructions in the description and look at all the things that the character is making in this picture there 's a bird mask and a beautiful feathered headband and there 's a party blower and a fishing rod with a fish and paper planes and paper boats there 's lots of really easy templates for those on the internet but you know you could probably even have a go with a piece of paper and try and figure it out for yourselves it 's a bit of a science project that one to see if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at all these beautiful craft projects down here too butterflies and bugs i am a big boy now i can draw and i can make things there 's the butterfly and the boat we saw and a telescope is peeping through his telescope i think perhaps he 's pretending to be a pirate on a pirate ship what do you think and a paper plane that looks like it 's a really easy one to fold i think the paper is just folding in folded in half up to a point and then two sides are folded back down on the outside in kind of a diagonal i draw my mother she sits still you do have to sit very still when you 're posing for a drawing don 't you so the artist can copy you just the way you are without changes in light or without you sitting in different positions i draw my sister but she does not sit still what 's she doing here she 's rolling around she 's got a wok on her head and she 's hitting it with a wooden spoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cuddling her teddy and she 's even in a blue bucket i draw many things there 's a house and a sunrise over some mountains and there 's that bug again i think he really likes drawing that bug and a tree i wonder what this one 's going to be i 'm guessing that it might be a kite why don 't you download it at freekidsbooks.org or otherwise it 'll be in your kids for those of you getting the take-home packs maybe you can have a look close-up in the picture and see what you think he 's drawing but i 'm told not to draw on the wall i can make things not just art things and craft things but all sorts of life things as well like making food to cook we did that in our earlier videos this week didn 't we we made a muesli bar i think he 's rolling out some dough here maybe for some cookies or some bread he 's made a crown and a moustache i make a drawing of a cat she is crap pussycat i make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make paper boats here 's the paper boat birds there 's the bird beak and i think this blue sheet is his wings and of course paper planes i make houses and trains this is a clever way to make a train isn 't it it 's a long scarf and on it is tied all sorts of interesting objects that are following along in a big train behind him and you know i think he 's using his party blower as a train whistle what do you think and there 's his flag my sister makes a mess i can make many things but my sister can 't she 's only little and she hasn 't learned to make a lot of things yet but she 's going to get lots of practice as she gets older when she sits with mom or dad or grandma or grandpa and big brother even and when he 's very warm and gentle and patient with her she will be really keen to give it a go and keep practicing until she gets better at her craft activities it 's a gorgeous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freekidsbooks.com you 're surrounded in love pretty baby you 're surrounded

Playgroup",HVH6-0mJPxE,20200616,1218.489,"Roberts Ave, Horsham VIC 3400, Australia",2461,everyone doesn 't burn into being that look amazing very talented artists that one and I certainly can 't wait to see photos you 've all been at with the paint 's that we set home last week for those of you who 've got the painting the take home packs and even if you 're not one of our old families at the moment remember that the counselors running that isolation inspiration initiative and you can all paint your bins and beautify your street we 'd love to see your handiwork and of course there 's prizes to be won as well you talk about teachable moments and what better to explore teachable moments then loose parts play these are some of the things that are going to be in your kit this week but others who are enrolled feel free to make fun kids like this for yourself at home because the play opportunities that these sorts of things are endless absolutely endless I dare say they 'd have little things like this and have them be the only toys that you had and your child would get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run out of things to do so first I 've got some ribbon and then what have I got that 's disappearing you look at what it is very sort of foamy squishy colorful stuff I 've actually cut up a porno would you believe so we 've got some red and some green and some orange and some blue and some yellow pool noodle and then in my little bag of goodies here we have listen to those wonderful rattling sounds as I drop all my treasures on the table we have an assortment of fabulous multicolored loose parts I bet you kids can already imagine amazing stuff that you could do with these toys just picking them up and looking at them and admiring them and appreciating them and feeling them these ones these pom-poms are very soft these are very hard and rough and the buttons a hug but smooth so already this lot some words that we 're using to talk about these items here and that 's just the beginning I 'm gonna have a go and see how many different ways I can play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can add to that at home when you receive your take home packs I wonder if you can have a go at all these different types of play and sorting and matching and learning activities that I 'm gonna try and then see if you can outdo me see if you can think of even more ways to play with these exciting colorful loose parts I have a little box it 's not very big it 's filled with things I 'll take a look inside and see if I can find something that you loved do you love elephants do you love doggies do you love kitty cats if you love dinosaurs tell me that you do I [Music] have a little box it 's not very big it 's filled with things I love I 'll take a look inside and see if I can find something that you love do you love apples do you love bananas do you love ice cream if you love pickles tell me that you do I have a little box it 's not very big it 's filled with things I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find someone that you love I think I see someone ooh [Music] circle round circle round circle fast and slow circle up circle down circle high though circle round circle round circle fast and slow Circle Circle down circle hum though my wheelbarrow has one wheel my wheelbarrow one wheel one wheel and that one wheel goes around my needle [Music] of sturdy canvas I will cover [Music] for me [Music] so thread a needle pull it tight and stitching shape time around you see them everywhere rectangles tribal circles and squares now close your and when I count to three open them and find a square point adaptively one two three sheeps are you see them everywhere rectangles triangles circles and squares bozer when I come to three sir pointed up to me one two three sheeps are you see them everywhere rectangles triangles circles and squares close your three open them and find a time three shapes are you see them everywhere rectangles friendly circles and squares ABCD efg hijk [Music] Oh p q r s t u v w x y and z now i my ABC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let 's sing a song about opposites to things as different as they can be and sing a song about opposites you can sing along with me arrangements different games to play with them and I bet you you can think of even more creative things because you kids are the best at imagining and inventing things you can make all sorts of things with those wheels on a train you can use your pedal pop sticks for the axle and roll the wheels around it a million different uses and there 's a bit great if I could just talk to the grown-ups just pratik before me to a book and a song to finish off they 're really great for teachable moments basically we want to notice what our child 's interested in well there 's a million things to be interested in they 're posting and sorting and putting them in bottles making sensory bottles like Bernie did a few weeks ago so we want to notice what they 're doing first of all and then we engage with what they 're doing they call it joint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then we teach by showing so don 't you sit there and watch and point and give instructions do some yourself grants so much fun to sort in fact if you 've ever heard of occupational therapy part of that is around how good it is for our well-being to do things that occupy us like I don 't colouring-in or a girlfriend of mine used to have a big button of jars that she used to sort out whenever she felt stressed and then put all the buttons back in the jar again you 'll have so much fun sorting and playing and creating and experimenting and even if it doesn 't go anywhere even if it 's just for the for the sorting task itself without actually producing a brace or a necklace or some sort of outcome you 'll have all of these benefits for your well-being as well as teaching by showing teach by naming and describing so what are you doing it talk about what you 're doing talk about what your child is doing give them words for all the experiences all the objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our left right top bottom all those relationship words relational words and the final point is teach by giving feedback wow that didn 't seem to work to do it maybe if we balanced it this way what do you think might happen if we tried this stick instead of this stick or looks like that one 's not going to fit and giving little bits of feedback little tips there 's another approach with the abecedarian approach who basically is based on all the same sciences the small talk approach they 've just used slightly different words for it and I really like this because it helps you to remember with just one letter three times three ends notice nudge narrator we 're going to notice what the child is doing we 're going to narrate that means give it words tell the story of what they 're doing and nudge is a great word I think don 't you think just the tiniest little nudge of their ideas so the example in the booklet for language priority that you can download at this University of Melbourne which website @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their coach and so he notices that they 're trying to have a go and do it themselves which is great it 's showing independence and a willing listening readiness to learn this new step and growing up but they might be able to get rid of trouble so you notice and then lunch by giving a little tip what would happen if you held this side with this hand and zipped with this hand thank you for grown-ups to get the zip to go up and then as they 're doing that he said how well done soups going up making a sipping sound and you 're nearly at the top well done and you 're narrating you should don 't notice nitrogen erase these goodies that are going home and your take-home packs tomorrow opportunities to notice an urge to write full of teachable moments and if you 're not part of our umbrella program at the moment make yourself one of these kids hit down to the local bargain store where all the craft supplies up and just keep and I have some goodies and buttons and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this is what I 'd like to call active literacy that means we 're doing words and books but we 're getting up and getting involved too the wonderful thing about this book is that it 's a coloring book at the same time so those of you getting the cat kits will get one of these but otherwise you can download it at free kids books org and you can have your very own three-in-one book it 's a book it 's a coloring book and it 's an exercise workout let 's have a go and it 's called my body is my body and there 's a little boy 's body what 's he doing with his body do you think he 's got his leg out like this and there 's a soccer ball here I think he 's just kicked it what can you do with your body [Music] this boy what 's he doing with his body he 's really rememory run run as fast as you can run run run can you do this with me okay you write that like very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's gonna do he 's by next jump what sorts of animals you jump with their bodies rabbits and kangaroos and tiny little fleas and grasshoppers there 's lots of jumpy animals wonder if you can think of any office I can dance with it I can do the hula like this and I can do the Macarena there 's all sorts of dances I can do something better what other dances are there tap-dancing you 've got to make lots of tapping sounds on the ground when you do that one I can swim with my body can you swim with your body you might not have led to swim confidently yet gives your only little but that will come in time especially if you 're having swimming lessons if you go to the pool the beach your life and try all the different strokes you usually start with like this with your little paws in front of you paddling at the water and then there 's breaststroke like this and there 's freestyle over the top and then it 's back get away backstroke over the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stroke might look like two arms at the same time like both fly wings I can skip with my buddy can you skip along with me skip skip skip she 's actually using a skipping right to skip this time which goes around to some bees and when the Rope passes underneath we jump it very good I can kick with it that 's the picture from the frame of the book isn 't the front cover what do you think he 's doing in this picture it 's bouncing up on one leg this one 's bent I think he might be Oh pabu you hope with your body but I can 't never fly with it we can pretend though can 't we we can pretend pretend that our arms are wings but as much as I try I just can 't lift myself up into the sky it 's not what my body 's built to do but it is beauty and of course give be cuddles we 're gonna do one more activity that involves a bit of dancing and this one is great mums and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so in a musical context understanding the idea of rests and beats restraint you got to listen very carefully to the lyrics instructions the same time is getting up we 're getting fit and active by shaking different parts in our body you can download this one for free as always at Nancy music.com [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] example dads were teachable moment in the song very carefully to Nancy 's instructions well having fun to music at the same time thanks for joining me this week I 've had so much fun this tune doing digital play groups however I do miss you and would much rather see you in person and I can announce that we have been given the go-ahead to start play groups you know reduce the capacity next room so smaller group numbers than usual I have to wash our hands a lot we 'll have to all have separate food rather than share them want to be share plate that sort of thing we 'll send out more information on Facebook in the next few weeks we 're also going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ families if we don 't get enough numbers a little let that out to the public but we 're going to start with the enroll families so check out for a little video from Bernie next week but otherwise your last kit is coming tomorrow thank you so much and I 'll see you in the holidays and next time bye,"(-36.7142554, 142.2016929)"

Playgroup,vTnlm4e1xEg,20200519,1101.72,"Roberts Ave, Horsham VIC 3400, Australia",3488,activities like this a great way to be warm and gentle and to show them how much you love them to show a bit of patience and we 're going to look at that a little bit more in the process of cooking because I certainly remember from when my son was young and now we have different challenges in being a teenager know that it 's the kind of activity to see sit down together and think great let 's make some cupcakes and you end up getting a little bit frustrated so the first thing I would say is embrace the mess you 're just going to embrace the mess it 's going to be a messy business aprons are great you don 't have to spend a lot of money neither you can just be an old shirt something you picked up at the up shop or something you 're about to send into the up shop just something that you know removes another one of the barriers another one of the reasons that you might have your patience tested and lose your Brazilian suit being warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books got some great advice this will be a new kit or otherwise you can download it about cooking with different age groups and sort of stepping up the level of complexity so with two to three year-olds it does mention of course the fact that they 'll want to be tactile so if you 're not being the headspace where you 're in the mood for a toddler covered with flour probably that 's not the right time to do it because it 's going to be really hard to be warm and gentle when you already feel like that 's going to test your patience but otherwise you know let them get in there and touch and taste and sense and feel and smell well you 're cooking they don 't actually have to be even the cooking process with you they can be in the high chair just having a play with lots of things so you 'd start basic you put some food items in a bottle you have a pretty shot so if you 're making a stir fry there 's you chopped up capsicum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can get them to tip that in so this is a really early way that they can start participating they 're already starting to learn about the process and what cooks for longer and cooks for shorter as you 're doing it so there 's all that language going on you 're bonding you being warm and gentle or you 're having a giggle you 're having a laugh oops I 'll be hugging split on the bench oh well never mind put that in the compost bin that sort of thing of course you can help them find ingredients so they can help you rather find ingredients in the fridge or cupboard and that 's great for identification of things my house is very sloppy of me that 's great for identifying things you know can you find the cauliflower and they can help you wash fruit and vegetables in the sink and one that they haven 't listed but I think it 's really worth mentioning is that there 's a reason why banging on pots and pans there 's an age-old activity for little kids is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you don 't have to spend a thing for this is a toy so why would you go and buy heaps of expensive toys well they 're just happy banging on some pots and pans there 's all sorts of really interesting utensils in the kitchen for example these sorts of things quite often we buy stacking cups for kids don 't we you know expensive toys in a toy shop but they 're put in the bath and they crack the scooping and pouring and measuring and get to learn about volume and liquids and all that sort of stuff and sand and soil in the garden but your kitchen measuring cups will do the job just fine then when the kids start getting a bit older they can start to pour from a small picture or measuring cup they can help with making simple things like sandwiches and pizzas I think outside the box there 's lots of activities in the process of cooking a wide a meal that are great for a little kid once you 've boiled your potatoes mashing them that 's something that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fun and mashing potatoes as if you know being able to get all the lumps out and that sort of thing it 's an activity where you can be quite aggressive or rigorous you know it 's not like pour in for example will we tend to get a bit more stressed because you might spill everywhere you know you can really have a good go at mashing and they can of course stir ingredients to you with muffins and pancake mix and all that sort of stuff sources and once the kids are getting onto four to six you can really start getting them involved in things really quite actively they can have a friend and come over for a cooking playdate so they can set the table for meals and they can even do things like grate cheese with supervision this has got some great recipes and it 's got them in groups of age so the ones that suggests for you to start with little kids and then working your way through I thought this one it 'd be great for our little setup here because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one to having your tool kit not only is it easy for you to do with your kids but it 's the kind of thing that would be great for kinder lunchboxes and school lunch boxes although you probably will need to swipe at a sports bar excuse me SWAT out swap out the nut butter you could always use something like tahini or other seed posts instead of peanut butter but I 've never made this before this is happening right here so if it 's a disaster you know we 're all in it together instruction number one is line a baking tray with parchment paper now I have done that but I also was googling about this recipe in preparation for today and discovered a woman who 'd made another similar recipe but she used a muffin tray but I think these might pop out very nicely after it 's been frozen for a little bit so I thought we 'll have a got both as an experiment try and see which we liked better if we make a bleed slice in this one of course that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they suggest you freeze it in this parchment paper so we do love a bit of reduce reuse recycle let us save the planet now this is the sort of thing I never measure all that accurately when I 'm cooking for myself at home because you know what it 's like it 's a nightmare sticks to everything Sonne near enough is good enough especially when you 're cooking with kids you have to be a little looks a little about that sort of thing that 's the kind of thing that if we have trouble letting go about and getting it just right that 's going to be the time when we 're not warm and gentle isn 't it oh no you don 't you watch it what are you doing can 't believe you did that well who 's going to want to cook with you again if you 're snapping at them like that even as grown-ups we know we wouldn 't like people talking looks like that so we just have to remember of course that kids you know a limited in their experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaps of times before whereas they haven 't and of course this is a great one to be tasting and feeling as you 're cooking in this process with kids everybody loves peanut butter it 's the kind of thing you can just lick right off your finger now here 's a tip for cooking with kids and remaining warm and gentle you can see here that these measuring cups are designed to measure all the way to the top for a quarter cup so if you 're trying to measure exactly and they are they 're poor and while they 're folding either way holding the measuring cup that 's just a recipe if you 'll pardon the pun for disaster isn 't it and that 's the kind of time when we won 't be warm and gentle because I make my spirits up syrups spill all over the table so the tip that I would say is use the bigger measuring cup and just do it by sight not in a cautionary way is in a cautionary layer of you better not that 's not warm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's very thick it comes out very thickly thickly and slowly oh it 's going bit faster now or the faster it comes out the quicker we 're going to reach the line so be careful we don 't want to pour too much or magenta or making it fun making them a part of the process and maybe for a bit more a bit less doesn 't really matter because you 're not going to spill you use the full cup measure to measure a quarter of a cup or a half a cup so the next step in this process I believe is to microwave this you see how the peanut butter is quite thick up there and we 've got the runny maple syrup so it wants me to microwave it and here 's one I here in a large bowl well done thank you so much that 's a great bowl ask questions give them choices so say things like now we need a bowl for this and we 're going to put you know roughly this much of this or this much is how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this bowl do you think this balls big enough or what about that one which of those bowls over there do you think that 's going to be the right size and keep it a going let there you know hypothesis be tested if we were to use science words let 's test it let 's see if your prediction that that bowl is going to be big enough is correct and don 't be worried about the fact that it might not be I 've done it a million times myself kids aside going to group leftovers in the fridge and choosing the wrong size Tupperware seems to always happen so you know case there are sir are it 's just a dish and we can wash it you know it 's a way of making cooking warm and gentle and fun by letting them have some ownership whoopsies yeah I thought that one was going to be big enough to oh well next time so this is exactly the kind of activity that can be challenging can be warm and gentle about so remember it 's okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time that you can include your child it 's a bit like Bernie was talking about when she talked about routines last week I 'm he was doing the wrong Bowl she 's talking too much and she said give them choices that you 're happy with you know you can sit in a stroller or you can hold my hands but you can 't you know run off by yourself when we 're out in the street and then I hope I 've heard people call it the illusion of choice which i think is quite cute I think they get introduced we kind of are getting to choose but they 're not getting to choose from everything possible in the whole universe just two choices that you 've decided are safe and acceptable and within appropriate boundaries and this is the same thing you could say to them would you like to hold the measuring cup or would you like to pour the thing and if you 're going to pour the thing I need you to do it this way and you let them have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and little bits into the cup if you 're worried about them tipping because you know it 's up and coming quite a big bag so you can see of course not just words that we 're learning when we 're doing cooking but numbers as well I mean how amazing is the whole concept of all these measuring cups and one nesting inside the other other infractions and all that sort of stuff and as kids get older too and then you know I 'm talking sort of primary school this is obviously way beyond a lot of your little ease but you know when keep up with challenges my maths because the recipe will say something in cups but I am going to do it in by weight or you know vice versa and I 'm always googling you know how many how many grams of cheese is two cups for example alright so we 've got two dry ingredients in there now and you know one of the ways in which we might struggle to be warm and gentle with kids is if we 're really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an adult way and that would be to just get the job done wouldn 't it now we 're under this now we 're going to add the next ingredient stop and enjoy it a little bit great sound that makes speaking of all the beautiful work Bernie did last week with musical instruments and shakers at home I mean this is a musical activity in a way it 's the sense we 're using here is their ears and the jobs they 're doing don 't have to always be achieving something like steering these we probably don 't need to stir it at this stage we know we wait until we put all the dry ingredients in instead that 's a way to get a toddler can you give vanilla stir of that completely make sure it 's mixed in really well while you 're getting something else organized I mean thereabouts is good enough I 've gone with a third of a cup most of the way Luke I mean how good coconut smell stop and smell the roses as they say or in this case coconut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great with the mixing because it looks like snow fill the things you could talk about with that looking like snow and the different textures and all the colors dispersing and which ones which one stays at the top and which one seeks to the bottom as your kids get older all those sorts of observations up to the prescience kind of thoughts have a cup that 's handy and then dried cranberries and quite often I 'm gonna put some of these in a bowl but there are stuck together can you kind of poke them and mesh them and see if you could separate all those sultanas they 're always come out in a big clump that 's right and I think that 's all they can 't forget the chia seeds so again you can use the same principle that I was talking about before with kids and pouring with the measuring spoons as well as the measuring cups so if it 's a little bit of something a bit messy and you need a quarter of a cup we 'll use one of the quarter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones and I 'm sorry you know if it goes a bit more a bit less it doesn 't matter and when you get up to the tablespoon and haven 't got one video you could actually use the quarter cup I think there 's about three tablespoons ever so slightly bigger the quarter cup then to three tablespoons that 's the sort of maths I was talking about because I actually thought about that last night and did the calculations in my head we 've got 2 teaspoon of essence and not a great one for stopping and smelling the roses or in this instance vanilla and in goes all the rest of our wet ingredients and you can see that 's all runny now so that peanut butter instead of sticking to the bottle has mostly just slid right out mix mix mix mix mix and this is the way we mix the bars mixes and this is the perfect kind of job for a child to do something that I noticed a lot about myself when Noah was little that I really had to catch myself and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do a job like this and then I agree do it like it really matters you know I mean sometimes yes sure the job does genuinely need to be redone a good might be inedible otherwise but oftentimes it was just me being really fussy unnecessarily and probably be motivating him I think that if your mother snatched something out of your hands every time you did and made it better um we 'd stop to think why my mother she 's always gonna redo it alright and now we can stop putting that into a container and I think quite frankly this is a really clever idea if it doesn 't work I 'm going to be really disappointed so press that in now you see it would be really easy to not be warm and gentle right now because it 's going everywhere but I 'm a grown-up it 's making a right mess they seem to do is your award kids and just talk about it Oh some of the oats are falling out oh well more for mommy to eat oh I 'm gonna have that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're gonna put some in here see there we go and we have to press it down really hard press press press is that language repetition again press down as hard as you can press press because we want to solidify it sit until a little bar like a muesli bar and we 're going to put them in the freezer to help that happen and then we 're going to put them in the freezer and we 're gonna do a bit of science and see which one we like better whether it worked better is a great big rocket or whether it work better as muffins I 'm gonna go and pop these in the freezer well yeah I think we can say that it 's been a success the final test will be of course whether these pop particularly well baking trays look at that can you just see that that is lifting up perfectly out of the silicon in one kind of piece look at that and now the final thing to do yeah look I think them I think the muffin tray ones have worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Sandra its crumble nice tomorrow thanks very much for hanging out with me this morning I really enjoyed our session it was delicious and I hope to hear that you 've had a go at making that slice at home maybe post your pics I 'm at HRC see playgroups all we 'd love to see them and tomorrow we 're going to be talking about warm and gentle again but this time with puppets more fun and games with playgroup I 'll see you tomorrow bye,"(-36.7142554, 142.2016929)"

McGregor 's garden which one do you think is old mrs. rabbit I think it 's probably the very tall buying here because she 's the mom and she 's the grown-up and then this must be klutzy multi-cut and home and Peter what 's the difference between proxy Mopsy Cottontail and Peter here they 're both in red and they all the three of them are in red Peters in blue music Oh Matthew sees mums she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't mrs. rabbit and don 't get into any mischief don 't get into any trouble or do anything cheeky I am going in what do you think this is how about doing in that picture I think you 're right I think she 's doing up Peter rabbit 's little button at the top of his coat to keep him warm while he goes out and about then old mrs. rabbit took a basket and her umbrella and went through the wood to the Baker 's she bought a loaf of brown bread mmm and five current buttons a balance beg your pardon there 's her beet green umbrella there 's a shopping basket now she goes through the woods Flopsy Mopsy and Cottontail who were good little bunnies went down the lane together but Peter who was being naughty ran straight away to mr. McGregor 's garden and squeezed under the gate cheeky Peter first he ate some lettuces and some fresh beans and then ate some radishes that he is eating the radishes there mm-my had a crisp peppery sort of taste radishes look there 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and red on the outside just like Peter zinging with some big bushy leaves here but you know radishes can look all sorts of different ways here are some round radishes they 're a bit different to the long ones Pete is eating and here are some black radishes I said what and even some green mmm they great to grow in the garden on top they 're very easy perhaps you could plant some radishes and you walk out and then eat them when you 're allowed to not like me someone else 's radishes no feeling rather sick from eating too much Peter went to look for some parsley he 's rubbing his tummy like is because I think it 's feeling a bit sore poor Peter and I think he 's hoping that the parsley which is a little heard my mind is a tiny field there but round the end of the cucumber frame whom should he meet but mrs. Stuber Gregor the farmer he was on his hands and knees planting out young packages mr. McGregor chopped up and calling out stop wasn 't he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way back to the gate he lost one of his shoes amongst the cabbages and he lost the other shoe amongst the potatoes after losing his shoes he ran on all four legs and went faster so I think that he might have got away altogether if he had not unfortunately right into a gooseberry net and got caught by the large buttons on his jet it was a blue jacket with brass buttons quite room he gave himself up for lost but his sobs were overheard by some friendly sparrows who flew him Oh in great excitement and implored him to exert himself thank you we believe in you we implore you try I know you can do it mr. McGregor came up with a series here 's a suit there you see it 's got the crisscross lines and holes in it so that things can drain out like when you 're draining the pasture at home mr. McGregor came up with a sieve which he intended to pop upon the top of Peter and catch him in it but picked out just in time leaving his jacket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other shoe what well this is Brad let 's say I think she might be a bit cross but he rushed into the toolshed and jumped into him it would have been a beautiful thing to hide him if it had not had so much water in it splash poor little Peter it 's got all wet and cold in the watery water again [Music] little Peter Rabbit all the water out poor little Peter Rabbit mr. McGregor was quite sure that Peter was somewhere in the toolshed perhaps hidden underneath a flowerpot he began to turn each one over carefully looking under each four little Peter Rabbit oh he might be about to sneeze he 's got a cold upon his chest for being in the cold water [Music] [Music] and he went oh but the a things going to happen next mr. McGregor are you because he 's after you no time he tried to put his foot on Peter that 's not very nice who chucked out of the window upsetting three plants one two three plants though a road was too small for mr. McGregor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his work down to this least idea which way to go it was also very dead from sitting in that watering can after a time he began to wonder about going and looking all around not very fast not knowing which way to go he found a door and there was no room for a fat little rabbit who had eaten all those vegetables of mr. McGregor 's to squeeze underneath an old maps was running in and out over the doorstep carrying peas and bee to her family in the woman this little math thing Peter asked her the way to the gate but she had such a large pea in her mouth that she couldn 't answer she only shook him as soon as he tried to find his way straight across the garden but he became more and more puzzled it just doesn 't know the way out presently he came to a pond where mr. mcgregor filled up he 's offering hands a white cat he 's the white cat was staring at some goldfish she sat very still but now and then the tip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be best he had heard about cats from his cousin little Benjamin bunny things I thought about all the animals he had met on mr. McGregor 's farm he met some sparrows we helped him out of the gooseberry net and he met the Newton mouse with the pea in her mouth and he met the white rabbit and he met the goldfish Oh McGregor sure has a lot of animals on his farm which one would you like to see about first what you reckon all right I heard someone say Pussycats let 's sing about the Oh [Music] [Music] what animal would you like to sing about next all right that 's a good idea how about these sparrows next [Music] [Music] [Music] and what is that lady we 've sung about the Pussycat we 've sung about the mess and we 're sign about the sparrows that leaves the goldfish but what sound to go fish maybe but I love if they make a sound I know that they 're in a fishy phases like this the hats will say splash splash I bet their fins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around [Music] [Music] [Music] beautiful singing everybody picture white back towards the toolshed but suddenly quite close to him he heard the noise of a hoe MacGregor in the garden with his gun home digging into the soil Peterson one didn 't hit the bushes but presently as nothing happened he came out and climbed upon a wheelbarrow and peeped over the first thing he saw was mr. McGregor hoeing these onions his back was turned towards Peter and Beyond him behind him past mr. McGregor is the gate that Peter needs to take to get back home he squeezed under that gate in the beginning remember can you pretend you 're digging and hoeing the garden with me how windows Arletta top like this as you hack away into the dirt and digging goes underneath like that as we leave the dirt up from underneath this is the way we dig and hope [Music] [Music] [Music] get away from my certainly seems to be the life of mr. McGregor doesn 't it he spent his whole daddy trying to get behind some blackcurrant bushes Oh mr. McGregor caught sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was last in the wood outside the gang what a relief such an ordeal today me mention he 's been on Peter never stopped running or looked behind him till he got home to the big fir-tree the he lives underneath we saw that at the very beginning the big fir tree like a Christmas tree mr. McGregor hung up the little jacket and the shoes that Peter lost in the gun for a deal navel scarecrow to frighten the Blackbirds mr. McGregor the black birds the bunnies everybody wants to eat his gun Peter was so nice on the floor of the rabbit-hole and shut his eyes his mother was busy cooking and she wondered what he had done with his clothes it was the second little jacket and shoes that Peter had lost in a fortnight I think Peter gets up to lots of mr. don 't you sounds like he 's a pretty cheeky rabbit I am sorry to say that Peter was not very well during the evening oh poor Peter his mother put him to bed and make him some chamomile tea and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel better one spoonful to be taken at bedtime but Flopsy Mopsy and Cottontail had bread and milk and blackberries for supper [Music] there 's just like just like me when you hear this sound when you hear this sound [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] fletching locket buzzer find my falling down well the slide whistle didn 't guard up again the last time do it I 'm going to be reading some more Patrick what a books this week so I hope you join me tomorrow and Wednesday thanks again has to be tomorrow,"(-36.7142554, 142.2016929)"
AUS,VIC,Horsham Rural City Council,Horsham Rural City Council,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgT1yMLyuEix-Z8VvGlWOSg,SmallTalk Screen Time Tips - Watch TV TOGETHER! - Online Playgroup,jWTW4o7JrwE,20200616,556.8,"Roberts Ave, Horsham VIC 3400, Australia",1932,hi there i just wanted to have a really quick chat just for grown-ups today just for the mums and dads and carers about uh watching tv together because i think it 'll tie nicely into tomorrow 's playgroup video all of our videos are designed for you to be able to watch them together with your child but in particular tomorrow 's video is just going to have such great ideas about ways to play with the supplies we 're sending home and the take home kits they 're all readily available stuff that for those of you who aren 't enrolled can can grab yourself and make up your own little kit of open-ended play ideas and while the video itself obviously is aimed at the kids being able to get inspired and enjoy it hidden in there there 's all this really great info for you grown-ups as well so i just wanted to talk a little bit about the small talk principle of watching tv together really really quickly um you 've obviously heard it 's impossible to escape hearing about kind of guidance against too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know a little bit about the background of that it 's not so much that screens themselves have any sort of inherent dangers in them uh the issue with screens remember we 've talked in previous weeks about serve and return brain architecture the way brains are built is through serve and return interactions like this game of pong here where the ball is being sent back and forth between two players all those little neurons all those tendrils and connections that are built in little kids brains are built through back and forth interactions with adults as they interact with the world and other people they then get confirmation from us about what they 're seeing and the words they 're using and it also provides them with comfort and attachment and safety uh from which they can then go out and explore the world and feel like you know their grown-ups have got their back so it opens them up to learning because they 're feeling all safe and secure and that 's what tv doesn 't give kids that 's that 's essentially the issue with tv @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it but it doesn 't listen to you back and so kids are having this really sort of passive experience when they 're watching telly so you know when you watch play school and sesame street all those shows are wonderful they 're made by people who 've put a lot of thought into the science of early childhood and they 're full of wonderful ideas but in actual fact the learning that kids are going to get from that is not like the kind of learning they get about the same things in a real life context so the best way to get the most out of those programs is for you to watch it with them because then you interrupt and you talk about it just like you would reading a book when we talked about conversational reading how it 's not really so much about reading the words in the book but about all the things you talk about with your child as you 're reading it so it 's exactly the same principle with tv so um of course the first point from small talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to be watching tv all day especially because you 're not getting that crucial interaction back uh the second and that 's of course how language is developed too through those exchanges and you 're needing it to get it sort of confirmed because it 's a shared thing language the only reason the word means something is because we both agree that it means something and so children need to be a part of that process with other grown-ups and other people and of course that leads into talk about the show as well the the more you talk about it and the more you interact the more those programs will actually have some benefit for you and the kids themselves and of course it 's a time to relax i know uh you know i 'm guilty of myself as a mum we put the telly on so that we can go and do a load of washing all the things we have to get done but you know in the small talk um sessions we really do encourage you to take care of yourselves as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a great time to kill a whole bunch of birds with one stone including having those serve and return interactions and it 's a great time to snuggle out you 'll be getting all that boost of oxytocin which is the lovey-dovey chemical that we get from things like breastfeeding um because you 're all snuggled up on the couch together um and of course the final point here is no ads um i think you know things like abc for kids occasionally have little ads in them about some of their other programming that 's not so bad it 's more um all the commercial stuff and you know it 's designed to make children beg you to buy toys and most of those toys actually don 't have any educational value they 're just taking your money for no good reason essentially because we know this is how children learn through interaction so you better off as we 'll see tomorrow with a jar full of beads and buttons and pom poms and paddle pop sticks and all sorts of fun stuff there 's a million things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you 're experimenting and it 's open-ended and you 're talking as you do it um you know tickle me elmo is a lot of fun but it 's not going to teach your child anything if it were going to be a really rich tool for their learning you 'd have to be involved in it there 'd have to be some sort of play and whatever going on around that so we can 't just sort of stick kids in a corner with the tv or a toy and expect much to be happening for them developmentally so i 've got some extra tips happening oh i should also mention shoes age-appropriate programs obviously it 's important to check the ratings and make sure that um the program is not you know containing content that 's going to frighten them in particular um but also that maybe is going to raise questions that they 're perhaps not ready to sort of under understand the consequences of or the context of um and you know as much as we know screens are going to be a part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you no tv but you know think occasionally about what you can use to replace tv the cds we 've been sending home and the take home packs are great put some music on perhaps um and it doesn 't always have to be children 's music you know put on some of your own favorite songs that you love dancing to and dance around the kitchen um you know kids love love music and love having your dance and especially love when mom and dad and grandma and grandpa and all their favorite grown-ups get involved and have a bit of fun with them and i just got some extra tips on here from me that i wanted to point out one is that um if you watch playful really carefully you can see that it 's been made by people who have spent 30 40 years how long it 's been running basing what they do on really good educational theory and child development theory so for example when the play school people read the books it 's great it 's very entertaining for kids but what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also teaching you stuff all of that stuff they 're doing with pointing out the pictures and naming and describing and often they ask the viewer questions don 't they what do you think is going to happen next whatever they 're actually teaching you as a parent all the kinds of tips and tricks about reading books with kids so that 's another great reason to watch shows with kids like our playgroup videos even when we are kind of being a bit goofy and talking to the kids we 're the reason we 're doing what we 're doing is because it 's based on you know what we know about child development and and how to sort of engage with kids for the best benefits so there 's stuff for you guys to learn in there as well the other thing i think is an interesting point to note is that a lot of quality children 's programming anyway um often helps us uh discuss tricky topics with kids sexuality or um race and culture and things that we often feel like you know we want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really important but you know sometimes it 's hard to know the right thing to say a lot of these programs address some of these topics beautifully and can then be a gateway to you having those conversations with your kids themselves but if they 're up in a different room watching you i mean you don 't even know that they 're seeing it and you 're not a part of it so that that conversation can 't happen uh and of course the final thing i will say about no ads a bit of a plug here a bit of a hint hint is that our youtube videos on the council 's youtube channel uh have no ads so it 's a great way to avoid ads watching the playgroup videos together as a family and snuggling up and having lots of conversations as you do it so please i 'd love for you to watch tomorrow 's video with your child and then tuck into that kit when it comes home on thursday it will be our last one there will be a little follow-up video next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up this week for the most part and we 'd love for you also to maybe go back through the weeks if there 's some videos your kids watched but you didn 't maybe maybe go back and have a watch with them and you might find that there was stuff in you take home packs that you were like i don 't really know how i 'd do this with my cuter maybe they 're not old enough well i don 't really understand the video content will probably explain lot of that for you and give you ideas and inspiration for how to make that work with little kids thank you so much for joining me today and i will see you tomorrow for lots of play group fun bye,"(-36.7142554, 142.2016929)"

poster to get their theme this week is in this together we 're going to be in this play group together this morning to talk about Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and culture today we give a big play grief wave to acknowledge the five traditional owners of this land the watcher Ballack where gaya yep a cup Jaguar and Jaya jolly people 's the traditional owners of this land must acknowledge mean it does mean we see you we give you a wave we give you a nod we say g 'day and what does traditional mean it 's a bit of a tricky word to do you know that way way way long ago way back that word comes from give across so your great-great-great-great great grandmas and grandpas ieave across their knowledge to their kids and they gave it across to their kids who took it from their grandmas and grandpas and mums and dads and gave it to their kids and that 's what a tradition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our values and our ideas over a long long long long time and watching Ballack well Gaia yeah forgot Jaguar and Jarboe jelly people have been giving across their traditions for tens of thousands of years that 's a number but you get that I can even imagine and that 's why we give them away to do to say we acknowledge you and here 's the area here there 's the lag island and there 's a job with jolly land right about any year somewhere that 's where the washing is that 's where I have today at the khaki Road home we pay our respects to elders both past and present why don 't you mean you reckon when we say respect well we respect someone we we use them and we admire them don 't we we respect our elders our mums out dads out grandma 's out grandpa 's when we say we pay our respects to elder 's past and present we mean we 're sending our respects away back through all of those years through all of those traditions to elders from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those traditions today and most of all today we celebrate friendship both present and future one of the most important things to do in friendship is to listen this thing now what do we listen with which parts of our body do we use to listen yeah you 're right we 'll use areas but what happens when maybe puppies don 't give us information that we know how to understand what if someone speaks a different language and we can 't use your ears for listening can we assume the other things yes I think we can we can listen to our eyes we can listen with our hands when we touch this and feel the way we 're listening in a way out we to how it feels you can listen with our noses we can listen with our hearts when we see someone crying we don 't need them to tell us that they 're sad do we we can see so sometimes when we don 't speak a language you have to listen really carefully to hear what our friends are trying to tell us here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different communities up and down the east coast of Australia singing a song in five different Aboriginal languages but I don 't speak any of those languages so I 'm going to have to listen really carefully to see if I can work out what they 're singing about you can watch this video at either of those websites at home if you 'd like to see it it might be a bit harder to see on here so I recommend you do have a watch after this video and then the source so if you can listen with me and we can work out what this song is about you [Music] [Music] yes [Music] Oh joining the clapping as a universal language [Music] [Music] we do like this long how well did we listen to you thinking did you work out what that song is about I think you 're right I think there might have been some eyes and some ears and some other body parts in there should we give it a go she was to give it a go and see if we listened well enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oh very good try one more time [Music] [Music] hey fairly well done what do you think this lady 's got in her belly do you think it 's a watermelon something very big isn 't it but I don 't think it 's a melon I think she 's got a little baby in there beautiful baby belly remember the little boy the video said there are hundreds of Aboriginal languages even hundreds is a number that 's hard to imagine isn 't it and that 's what all of these little dots represent this is a beautiful map that you follow the website down there you can interact with this map you can click on the dots some links will come up on the side you can listen to samples of languages it 's a really beautiful tool what a diverse place Australia has always been look at all the different language groups that have been on this land for thousands of years and now there 's even more cultures and peoples from all over the world living here as well I brought with me today my very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some flags so that we can raise some flags in celebration of reconciliation week you can make this at home this is a really simple machine it is silence for you it 's called a pulley and as you pull on one side of the string if you pull down the other side goes up and if you pull your side up yeah the one goes down and we 're going to raise first the Aboriginal flag and at the top of the flag you can see there 's black and that represents Aboriginal Australians and then in the middle you can right see the something which represents giving life because we all need this sign every creature on earth needs the Sun to survive my streams gotten stuck there we go all the way to the top then the red represents beautiful okay red earth of Australia and on the other side we have the Torres Strait Islander flag and as I raise this one up my strengths keep getting stuck we have the green at the top and the bottom which represents two land masses the Australian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue which is the Torres Strait Islander waters that go between the two main lands and then we have the white headdress of Torres Strait Islander people and white also represents a piece and of course again the black the black lines which represents the people we 've raised our Flags in celebration of reconciliation week and in fact we 've got some beautiful flags out for you in the hive as well so that we always are thinking about and remembering our friendship with the first Australians and the custodians of this land we are so lucky I 'm gonna bring a little training up to help it 's an Australian what animal I have yet crazy the category face that 's a rabbit you 're clearly wrong kangaroo I can clearly see that that 's a duck that 's not very nice thing to say kangaroo I think you 're wrong I think that 's a rabbit I duck the

Playgroup",eUxLqjNCUUU,20200609,1638.83,"Roberts Ave, Horsham VIC 3400, Australia",4773,hello everybody welcome back to another Wednesday virtual playgroup session this week we 're going to do something a little bit different in that we 'll be having our regular indoor session so we 'll be covering off making some homemade paints and then experimenting with colors with those we 'll also be making a homemade bird feeder that you can pop out into the garden for your birds we 'll be having a quick chat about a small talk topic of loosening and talking more which is always important and not just for your children to be talking and listening to you but we 're also teaming up with another section of Horsham rural city council which is doing a promotion called isolation inspiration where you actually get to paint your bins and recycling bins make them as fabulous and colorful as you can and then our garbage collection team are actually coming around and voting on the best designs where you can win prizes for local local businesses so I thought as part of that and to get on board we will actually be painting one of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show you that in time-lapse to show you how you go and how much fun it can be but starting off this week 's topic is listening and talking more which as I said is really crucial for both sides of not just only yourself but use a child as well and there 's four main points in relation to that so this thing in talking more can happen anywhere any time any time that you 're having a chat or even if you 're not it 's a good time to strike up a conversation the more children are exposed to words the more that they 'll learn and use and then build their own vocabularies give choices start conversations and take turns so like some of the other topics in the other weeks sometimes it can be really helpful to limit your choices so would you like to wear your blue pants or your green pants today so at the end of the day it doesn 't matter which pair of pants they choose they 're happy you 're happy they 've got pants on but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of control start conversation so if your child is playing you know solo and is relatively quad you can ask them what are you doing or wow you know how many wheels are on that car or Oh what 's happening outside today get those conversations started and take turns so make sure that when you are a.cian question and your child answers take the time to listen and then respond back teaching them that language and conversation is a turn taking exercise try and make sure that your language is clear exaggerated if you have to so really exaggerate particularly you 've got children that you know still learning their words and learning their sounds so you know you might need to slow it down and so instead of saying potato it 'll be potato or baby off and you know oh look at the baby look at the puppy that 's obviously more for younger children but that still carries over to your older children if they 're really really busy they may not hear you because they just simply can 't compute what you 're saying and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time and you get the hug what pardon if you you know quite fortunate repeating it 's not a bad thing making sure that you know your child can 't carry out what you 're asking them or what you 're talking to them about if they 're not sure what you 've said so it 's never a bad thing to repeat yourself take a deep breath practice being warm and gentle as you continue yeah having conversations and your last point is describe label and ask so again that goes back to you know you things like oh can you pass me the cup and extending that on to can you pass me the green cup or can you pass me the big green cup so describing things so that they again children am more exposed to language and the more they know the more they can use so that 's the basic tips for listening and talking more and you 'll see that as we go into our paint experiments as well something that I came across from a speech pathology Australia was just some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can expect to see in terms of speech so for two years old they can normally follow simple two-part instructions give me the ball and the car they should be able to point to severy several body parts when you ask them to and understand when an object is in something or on something so starting to really learn those you know words that support the sentence structure and in terms of speaking they should have you know up to 50 words or more than 50 single words that 's mum dad up ball baby you know you fifty words might seem like a lot but once you actually stop and think about it yeah you can usually pick 50 relatively easily two-year-olds should be able to say no when they don 't want something so that 's why we 're normally well on top of and children often develop that a bit earlier and start to use words such as mine and mine now I 'm just pulling off a couple of tips out of these I 'll actually pop the link up and you can have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect if you want a printed copy please just get in touch with support a play group on our Facebook page and of course I can organize that for you as well so three years of AIDS we 're looking at more complex conversations at this stage so in terms of instructions give me the teddy and throw the ball so they have to think about sort of two separate things they should be able to start doing that understand simple questions such as what where and who so you 're asking a question and they 're able to respond in a manner may not be you know exactly the answer you 're after but they should be able to respond to that using four or five words in a sentence by three roughly and be able to talk about something in the past as well five years of old to five years of age sorry children are obviously either finishing kiemce they were approaching prep so they should be able to follow three part instructions get your jacket and your shoes and stand at the door three separate instructions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and clear you may need to repeat it a second time but once they 've understood what you 've said they should be able to carry out a three step instruction understand time related words so before after later soon roughly get a rough gauge on those and they should be using well form sentences that are understood by most people so obviously children do still have the only way that they like to pronounce things but most of the time most people should be able to understand what they are say that said obviously children develop and a wide wide range and I guess the other takeaway message its speech pathology Australia popped up was that it 's a matter of sometimes don 't wait and see so if you 're not sure or whether your child is at a range they should be or you do have concerns it 's one of those things like as always we say check to internal health nurse chat tgp in this case they 've actually given a phone number you can give speech pathology Australia abuzz and just have a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having that conversation and then you can realise you know what it 's okay you know it 's a little bit more time or they 're well within their range or it may be that look they might benefit for some speech therapy and of course you know here at playgroup we 're here to support you we 're not experts in terms of the medical ground but we can always give you information about who to refer on to now for the fun stuff okay so pinecone bird feeders when pinecones hit the ground I normally end up in the park with my children rummaging around digging up as many pinecones as I can find for little crafts and bits and pieces like this and you just never know when you 're gonna need them that said you can do this just as well with like your toilet roll tubes or you can board herbs they work just as fine so this is something that you can make at home hang up in the tree hang it relatively close to your house and you 'll be able to sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic things pinecone some twine what we 're going to do to hold the birdseed into the pinecone is we 're going to apply a layer of peanut butter now for anybody that 's got peanut allergies you can use like a sunflower spread something like that it 's still tacky but obviously allergy free not free so there are a few options and your sunflower spreads and things you can find them in health food or these days are sort of really readily in supermarkets as well so that 's handy so what I 'm going to do before we apply the peanut butter it 's just Thai but it 's one on the other thing about this activity and it 's probably doesn 't need to be an outdoor activity but just someone you can wipe down it does get sticky and it does get messy and it 's lots of fun of course which is the main criteria so either keep some baby wipes handy or be nearby where they children can wash their hands and they 've done so just a little bit of rudimentary Thai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway is fun and yet any string Tuan anything that you 've got there alright so we 've got our pine cane and have some peanut butter this is also a great thing if you 're looking at the back of your cupboard and you found a peanut butter that 's been started and there 's being sort of left to its own devices and it 's gone to sort of not real great in the back of the pantry always really good to you know use these use them up one more time before you finish up so knife and pine cone and this is where it 's going to get really messy but what we 're trying to do is obviously get the peanut butter in among the rows so that it will have plenty of space to hold all of the birdseed there 's no particular art to it because you can apply it with a butter knife it 's fantastic that children can really have a go as I said it 's going to get messy but that 's okay because lots of lots of fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it it 's not so bad but yeah and the same principle would be for your toilet roll tube obviously it wouldn 't have sort of the layers but you could apply your spread all the way around the outside because then we 're going to plunk it into you you contain our birdseed all right so that 's looking pretty good lots of peanut butter you could obviously put more in if you wanted the more peanut butter the sticky that 's going to be so the more seed you 'll hold the other good thing about these is that once it sort of kept off dry there 's a good chance you can probably reapply it and you again okay so I 've got my tub of birdseed here from the supermarket this one is actually a small parrot and wild bird see so you can get smaller seeds you can get stuff that 's the bigger wild birds and they figure I just sort of went middle of the range because at this stage I don 't know what birds I 'm going to attract into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sea give it a good roll and as I said mine wasn 't perfect but the more peanut butter on it the more it sticks and so when you 're done we have our awesome bird feeder so all of the all of the sort of prongs here are all covered up now I 'm covered in birdseed so then you just hang that from a branch and see who you can bring into the garden so that 's really quite a fun one and preschoolers will absolutely adore this and toddlers will have a fantastic go as well alright the other activity that I wanted to share with you today which is perfect from babies right up until preschool this is homemade paints so again the older your children are the more likely they will be to be able to assist and get involved if you 've got babies this is a taste safe one so it does have salt in it it won 't be nice to taste but it is completely taste safe so if they are exploring as they do with their mouths and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingredients so I 'll pop a link up to this resource as well but essentially it 's a basic combination of flour salt water and then some food coloring now up in the the one behind me he had saying two cups of flour two cups of salt and then two cups of water so the best thing about that is that you don 't need any fancy measuring containers whatever you do whatever container you use it 's just to each of everything so I 'm just going to use this plastic tub which I 'll end up use the paint so I 'm just got a bowl here I 'm only gonna make a small quantity look but you can double it up I 'm pouring flour everywhere it 's a part of the fun I get to be messy too all right so again if you wanted to double the quantity make more you can have four of everything because I 'm only making a small amount I 'll make one of everything so one cup of flour that 's all right to be a little bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salt and it does recommend using warm water and just I think it helps dissolve the salt a little bit more so just keep that in mind but if you do have the little ones helping you here but the water isn 't too hot so I 'm just gonna mix up the flour and salt even that small amount is going to make a huge quantity of paint so this would be something if you 've got containers you can pop the containers leads on pop it into the fridge and you could keep it for next time if they don 't use it all so two cups of you know flour salt and then the same amount of water and now I 'm pouring water everywhere I 'm so much more messier than the children most times all right and then before we tip our water in you have got two options if you 're making one color you can add your food dye to your water and then keep it in and then that will create one color what we 're going to do is actually separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in just plain so that we make a plain batch of paint before we then divide it up and make some of the others so I 'm just giving it a stare and I apologize the camera 's not at a great angle and it is going to be a bit gloopy so this is where again if you 've got a tablecloth you can pop down something to protect your table or what I often do is we do what we do and then make sure you have the children help you out even if it 's just giving them a baby wipe help you wipe the table at the end I find even toddlers really a joy enjoy helping out so I 'm just gonna give that a bit of a stir mix it all in these a little bit gloopy obviously flour water and salt can be transformed into many things it 's a good base for playdough salt dough it 's just sort of different amounts so jumping onto your website sometimes and having a look around you can make lots of different things from just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restocked so that 's quite thick still so if it 's a bit thick add a little bit more water you 're firm if you 've added a bit much water and it 's too runny well then you add a little bit more flour again the best things about these basic recipes is that no matter what no matter what you prefer your consistency it 's relatively easy to get what you want so I 'm pretty happy with that again you can probably go thinner again but that 'll do and then what we would do from there here because I 'm making several colours is I 've got my little tubs here and I 'm going to dispense them into the tubs and for these because we 're going on to do some work with colour mixing I 'm going to pick our primary colors so red blue and yellow it 's also handy that they 're sort of the base colors that come in your food dyes that you get from a supermarket so that 's really handy as well ah so split that up into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then we mix again so bear with me and I 'm sorry that I can 't not quite take enough to get the camera down so what about the table and back up again so we 'll just wing it a little bit so yellow red and blue so I would even recommend based on the small amount that I made if you were going to do the two top so that 's recommended you 're going to end up with a lot of paint but share it with a friend share it with a neighbor so put the food dye in there and I 'm just giving it a quick mix and you can see how well that grabs the color early it 's even more vibrant in front of me absolutely looks fantastic so that 's a yellow I 've got blue in here and again the children can help with this worst case scenario you have blue fingers for a couple of days which I 've done many times before but that 's okay so that 's our blue looks fantastic and red and as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so it might be sort of another half so if you need one cup of everything I 'll probably do a cup and a half of water but it depends this is a really good sort of nearly paste consistency so if you 've got younger children helps with the spillage if it 's not so runny okay so that 's that red again it 's sort of more red in person but I think they 've come up looking fantastic and if you pop them in your containers with your lids you can come back to that anyway all righty so that 's a nice and easy one what I wanted to do or to run through quickly when we are extending on it for your preschoolers is doing some color mixing with your rainbow so what some paper here obviously and then it 's just a matter of exploring and obviously because we 're adults we often know you know what the results are but children sometimes don 't so ask them say alright put something right onto the page we want them to get involved and really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of like a little chart going where they could write down what they think is happening so we 've got red here again they might choose what color they want to do or if they 're not sure you can suggest a couple of options they 've read okay well which one are you going to mix it up with blue or yellow and it 's going back to that listening and talking or keeping the conversation going and for this example we might use some blue you say wow I wonder what color it 's going to be what do you think what do you think is going to happen having them chatting and experimenting so we 've got some blue and we 're gonna add some blue and then encourage them to rub it together and as they mix you can see that we 've gone from our red painting here now blue here and then Wow what 's happening here have a look the colors changing what does it look like this is going to like a really pale sort of quality again a little bit tricky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then you go oh fantastic because we 're still listening and we 're talking so what colors will we do next this is more even we 're toddlers if you 're having a chat with your times leaving your babies have a chat about what they 're doing well I have a look you 've put two colors together and now it 's made a third once made a purple how fantastic is that giving them the words to what they 're doing is that they can really you know understand as well what 's happening which is fantastic which is lots and lots of fun now what I do want to do finally today is just quickly run through touch on the horse and Royal City Council 's promotion for the isolation be inspiration so it is something that we are doing now as you might have seen over isolation periods Australians we 're getting involved in taking the Bennett in some fantastic ways and this is our way to Eastern art in a way that is yes lots of fun and just to enjoy getting out there doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so there will be prizes there are weekly prizes and there is a prize at the end of June so you 've still got time to jump on get involved and have some fun the judging team so there will be a judging team which does include the way stack drivers so if you see them jump out there and have a look have a look say hi sorry I just lost our screen here there so make sure you say hi give them a wave we 're are do so they 'll be there 's two price categories there 's best individual bin and there 's best cluster of beans so if you 've got neighbors that you wanted to get to know or do you know have a chat obviously in a coab of nineteen Safeway and you might be able to set up a plan and do a theme or you know a set of beans all together you can paint both your recycle and your rubbish bins prizes will include vouchers to local businesses and eateries worm farms compost kits and other bits and pieces so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously more about they 're obviously functional bins so there are a few things that we need to remember not to paint the lids because the garbage collection teams students be able to identify whether it is recycling or rubbish so please don 't pay at the top of your lid also there 's a number a serial number on the side of your bins usually printed in white it 'll be on one side please don 't paint over that as well they need to be able to see that clearly as well they recommend using an exterior water-based paint I 'll be using for our example I went down to Bunnings and collected some sample port paints so they 're probably not as hard-wearing as your exterior paint obviously if you 've got paint at home use that stuff up first if not using the little sample pots are a cost-effective way to do it or because the council has been fantastic and thought of everything you can actually make contact with the council there 's a number down here five three eight to nine triple seven or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they will actually organize for you a paint kit they are limited numbers so get in touch as soon as you can but that will include four paint colors and some brushes so that 's a really great initiative and again you know if you 're being provided with the materials there 's no reason not to jump on board and have a good go and if you are creating our wonderful masterpiece use the hashtag isolation be inspiration to show you work on social media so we can really share a bit some pieces I 'll actually be going out and showing you shortly one of our bins that we 've painted up as usual it 's all about the fun so I 've never been much of an artist but I 'm looking forward to showing you yeah our isolation and inspiration other than that I will yes sign off now and we will see you all next week thank you hi guys thanks for joining me outside to do our isolation of inspiration just wanted to run through a couple of quick things as we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're not painting over the lid and behind me here you can see the serial number of the bin so we don 't want to paint over that one either but pop down and I 'll show you how we went [Music] ready me ready that 's the way the covers go whoo make so many pretty colors it 's true and it only takes two to make another pretty color for you [Music] make [Music] that 's the way the colors go [Music] and make so many pretty colors it 's true and it only takes two to make another pretty color for you every color about to see is made by mixing just these three red and yellow and blue red yellow and blue [Music] Bumi [Music] me that 's the way the colors go who make so many great colors it 's true and it only takes two to make another pretty color for you and it only takes two to make another pretty color for you [Music] you,"(-36.7142554, 142.2016929)"

Playgroup",ydJ7ewHX028,20200506,921.72,"Roberts Ave, Horsham VIC 3400, Australia",2035,good morning guys happy Tuesday coming into our second week around munch and move activities again and thought we would start with another which would have come out on the music last week let 's get into it [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] these are really children [Music] [Music] so that one is on your DVD we see there from last week okay um what I want to do is well moving on from last week is some of the Becky vintage cards there we go that used for memory last week well another game you can play with them which you 'll be able to have a go at this week is what called celebrity heads so this game is all about guessing what vegetable you might be so for example and obviously as you taking part in this you wouldn 't know which card you pick up so to be a mystery card and you normally either put in a headband or you can just hold it up above your head so you won 't know what vegetable fruit or vegetable you have and then you need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green vegetable ideally you would have a few people in line so I said am i agreeing vegetable and the answer is no then the next person will get a turn and they 'd also have a turn and asking a question and guessing what base layout if you get the answer correct so perhaps I might 've asked do I grow underground and for the time that 's a yes so I 'd get to ask another question okay do I have green on me and then again that 's a yes so you continue every time you get a guess you get to ask another question if you ask a question to know the next person gets to have a turn and eventually you 'll ask enough questions that we able to work out what your vegetable is so this one was obviously the carrot what I might do is I 'll pick a different one and I would say am i a green vegetable which is a No okay do I grow under the ground that 's also a note so I 'd wait for my next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lots of little pots on me and that would be a yes and we already know that I 'm not green so am i orange that 's a no so you 'd have to stop and think and what other vegetables might I be if I 'm not green and I 'm not orange I 'd say am i a round vegetable it 's again for this one would be a no but you could ask am i a long vegetable or do I am I spicy there are lots of different ways thinking of descripting you know colors shapes sizes where they grow you know uses so would you use me you know stir-fry would you put me in a salad so I guess you know role-modeling those questions as well the more we think about vegetables and the different ways it can be used so the more they become part of our daily routine and the good part about this is so once you 've asked a question then you 've got okay so am i corn and for this pond the answer is yes excellent so then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I would get to be able to pick a vegetable for someone to have a turn but these are handy little carts if only thought last week you can use them for memory with abuse for celebrity heads if you had a couple of sets you could use them like cards and to play snack or you could play go fish if you had you know a few more so again getting the children to be looking at them and thinking colors States all those sorts of things they 're really fantastic and they 're lots of fun you know your lilies Margot to learn a few more vessels that they 're not overly familiar with and the biggie kids are fantastic at learning the rules to games and making sure you stick to them so they will have the link available for those cards they 're just off one of the UM free flashcard sites which we had the link up earlier I can provide the link today so I 'm yeah that 's a nice quick easy one that you can sort of getting across going across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting pregnant another said tuck them out and make a little book at home where the children can either you know match them up maybe they might like to pair up all the yellow and vegetables and put them on one page and do all the red ones all the green ones they might like to pick a few out and write a story about the vegetables or you know you get to pick out the ones they like and pop them in there and color around them and decorate them so lots of options you can use it with the vegetable cards today 's I suppose physical activity or something that 's a little bit more exciting is we 're gonna do some scarf games so scarves don 't have to be purchase bought beautiful scarves they 're always lovely if they are but if you 've got old fabric you know an old pillowcase an old stick the amount of Linda 's last legs or in our case we 've got some hankies and nice plain handkerchief nice and big man size that is perfect size for de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice easy books that have very few words which are really really fantastic because you can get together with each hole and make the story up together follow your child 's lead if they 're a bit older or if not you become the running narrative so you direct them to where they want to look at and what that might mean so today 's book it 's called bear well now and I 'll go through and again give another example what conversational reading might look like or you know how it looks like to me and you can see direct the children 's oh wow so let 's have a look at this picture one know what 's going on what can we see it 's a paint brush they don 't want a couple of tiles Lee some paw prints on wonder what 's gonna be in this book first pennies dog 13 how 's it feeling how do you think he 's feeling looks pretty happy doesn 't mean I can tell you smiling he 's got his tail out he 's a bit cute wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don 't have a dog what might we name a dog so just having all those conversations so anyway alright don 't expect bad dogs barking the team oh and now he 's knocked it over what 's coming out of the team yellow yellow paint maybe let 's have a look old deal it 's gonna happen next oh my goodness have a look please knock to the chin area and he 's sliding and running through the paint let 's have a look how 's he feeling his tongue and he 's Tyler I think he 's still pretty happy he seems pretty happy with this oh and he 's got a big smile and look who he 's come across he 's come across a sleepy cat he was sleeping on some more tents by the looks oh yeah oh oh thank you cat meow she 's jumped up she 's not some Wharton 's red paint this time yellow dog I think there 's a better be a red cat oh dear let 's have a look how is that cat feeling doesn 't know any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit angry and has a dog feeling so happy no he looks a little bit nervous with yellow paint red paint oh oh dear the cat was angry look he 's attacked the dog and they 're fighting they 're rolling around and then we 've got the yellow paint and the red paint all mixing together kind of like our butterfly paintings from last week yesterday we did our butterfly paintings we mix the colors together well that 's what 's happening here oh oh and they 're still going in they 're mixing in their journey and the colors changing hasn 't it was lots of yellow and red and now they 're rolling around more be a third color in here it 's a great opportunity to talk about color mixing what happens when you mix colors what color do you think this is going to turn out to be let 's see what happens next oh wow so now the dog is chasing the cat and they don 't yellow and red anymore they Orion so yellow and red together must make orange the dogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can we see lovely lady here getting ready I think she he actually owns the crank he 's getting ready to do a painting and do you think she 's noticed he 's in the background oh oh oh dear don 't shaking CAD is nothing to the lady we 've never Laurie 's pee pee but black paint is going everywhere oh no how is she feeling well done run it again spinning around in circles I think the lady 's feeling she looks at me awesome what happened where did this come from it paints over the back there ah what has happens now have a look at the colors again the black paint from over here it was being knocked and they 've changed color again flattened top poor ladies very colorful to you she 's topped the share as well and some for the board Wow she says have a look at that fantastic swirly hot work from recanting dog running around not a captain duck filled tail is up big smile I think they 're very proud of they would make a fantastic I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give you the words or the narration being younger children it 's all about you sitting with them and you 're helping them out if the children if your little buddies are pointing to the cat or a dog or pointing to the lady I only talk about those bits talk about what your child is interested in it doesn 't need to be prescriptive it doesn 't need to be anything huge or massive or long but if they 're enjoying if they 're interested it 's all about that early literacy is about getting interested in books how books work opening closing words turning from left to right all of those things it doesn 't need to be a massive thing they might not even go through the whole book come on to me a few pages this time they might come back again in an hour and have another couple of pages follow your child 's lead on that one and it 's always fantastic but bail me out where will be included in our links and our packs so yeah absolutely get your copy if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they say you come back to it and revisit again next time exactly so thanks for joining me today and I will see you tomorrow for a few more fun home activities thank you,"(-36.7142554, 142.2016929)"

simultaneous storytime week so on Wednesday at 11 a.m. we will be releasing a story that is read all over the country at the same time so I live in a clock on the 27th of May and this week this year will be Whitney and Brittany chicken Devers you can see it up the top there so I 'm will be doing a few activities based around the story will be reading the story at Wednesday on Wednesday at 11 o 'clock but this week will also be covering a few different topics as well which again falls in line with our a small talk programming as normal and we 've been we 'll be featuring some activities from the story box library parenting Research Center and the raising children Network website as well so today what we 're looking at is I guess supporting the idea the fantastic idea that you guys do in terms of resourcing play with things you 've got at home so today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do with plastic bottles easy to resource you 'll always so have them around and yeah just a few tips and tricks to go over that we 'll also have a look over the basics of toilet training as well I know a few families or asking for some tips and tricks so I 've got a few pointers that I 'll have on the slideshow and as always you 've got any further questions or the get in contact with myself or your maternal child health nurse and ugp um and then you will also have some content on following your child 's lead which will be today 's or this week 's small talk topic so following your child 's lead has your three main points which is focusing on the activity your child 's interested in so that means that you don 't need to come up to a child and go okay now we 're going to focus on your lead that 's going to be a thing let 's go and do that it really is about observing the child in their natural state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that cute so if your child is there driving cars along the map well that 's what you use as following your child 's lead they 're obviously interested in the cars so what can you do to join in and let them be the leader of that play you can do things such as point to say and do something about what your child is doing so if you have your child and they 're running cars along the map you can say wow I can see you driving your cars they have a look look at the wheels turn or you might say oh look there 's one I can see you 're going to learn the second one up so really giving a voice and narrating what you can observe them doing and then your third point is encourage your child to do more so if you 've seen your child driving the car along the map and you say wow look I can see you 're wheeling your car along they look at the wheels how they turn Wow I can see them there you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third one let 's see how big we can make the line well they might not be lining them up it may be that they 're just driving them around in circles and you say wow look at the track that you 're making can we make it bigger can your car go around the table lit so what you 're really building on is you 're building on something that they 're already doing they 're interested in it and you know that they are because they 're doing it children in general obviously only engage the things that sort of capture their interest so if they 're doing something it 's about us taking what they 're doing and see if we can extend it further another one would be you know coloring they might be covering oh wow look I can see during that lovely picture there look at that you 're drawing with the red pencil so you 're extending on what they 're doing by introducing colors and oh wow I wonder what color you 're going to pick next oh look I can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on but following your child 's lead is fantastic because you can do it in the here and now it doesn 't matter what your child is doing and it doesn 't actually take any you don 't need any special tools to follow your child 's lead it 's literally just observing them and then thinking about how you can take that a little bit further so having those discussions something that you know as families we do a lot anyway and it 's just tweaking it that little further to to get the most out of out of your interactions so on the back everybody in the packs this week will receive one of these cards and on the back it will have either of the two background so this first one is about babies and you can see that the child is sitting in the bath and notices the toy duck in parents parents hand and says oh I 'm making baby noises and in this instance the mother has responded by saying you 're looking at the duck so again making sure that they 're saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've knows that the child is looking at the duck the child in response has then reached from the duck and the parent says it 's a yellow duck do you want the duck so again adding those extra words the colors naming the object of the child 's reaching for and then going on and saying splash splash in the water so again building on or in the bathroom with the duck splash splash that 's what you do in water just extending that and all mom had to do in that instance was just be there offer words to what is already happening and similarly to on the second example which is for more your toddlers so the child has picked up a stone and given it to dad and dad says you gave dad a stone the child picks up another stone and drops it into the bucket the parent says there it goes in the bucket so again adding words to what is already happening giving words what the child is doing and the parent picks up a stone and says we 're putting stones in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hand and drops it into the bucket and dad says there are lots of stones in the bucket so again all that he needs he was already there supervising the child interacting with the child it 's just adding that narration letting the child lead the play dad picked up the stones and worried the child ooh took the stones and put it into the bucket because that that 's what he was doing at that time that 's what the child was focused on so there is a couple of examples but following a child sleeved is easy to do and generally it 's received really quite well because you 're supporting the child in doing what they already want to do and and as we know they really enjoy leading plank so that that 's sort of this week 's topic and we 'll keep that in mind as we go over the rest of our activities this week but the main activities for today were based around plastic bottle play so as I was saying earlier we all generally have classic bottles laying around or if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us the other week when we did musical instruments that was an easy placing bottle one which was just our shaker nice and easy good one for your toddler 's babies anyone really as long as that leads on nice and tight another one that you would have seen that was something that was sort of all more of a rage for your older children but can be utilized for your toddlers as well is your bottle toss so just filling it up feeling your bottle up with sort of no more than a quarter of water in it and literally he 's just throwing and flipping throwing and flipping and it 's trying to get it so when you flip it up that it lands on its base on the bottle if I had a bit more space I 'd show you but I can guarantee that I 'm not the best at it if you know a teenager in your life ask them about the bottle flip they 'll be able to give you a great example but again there 's a great one for your hand-eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would encourage as well is get some chalk draw a circle outside and see if once you 've got the knack of actually flipping it and getting it to land see if you can flip it into a target so whether it be you know a paper cutout inside that you 're using or throw it onto a blanket chalk outside make that battery and create a bit of a physical challenge to throw it in there and get it to land there as the children start perfecting that of course then you make the type of smaller and smaller great one for competitions you 've got many siblings get them or even joining yourself something nice and easy but again that 's literally just a bottle of water so you can 't go wrong with that the third one in the background he is sent three bottles and this is another fantastic relatively cost-effective one that is really really good and it 's often used for children that need a bit of help you know downtime or time regulating their emotions so a lot of the time children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little bit of time time and space for themselves and a sensory bottle can be a great way of adding to that to the wall they 're having their downtime they can sit and have a look and a bit of a focus on this fantastic sensory bottle will make a few different types today but so one of the first ones is relatively easy and its uses oil water some food dye and some inclusions as well so bear with me so roughly that you mix about two-thirds to water and this space here then we 're going to fill with oil scrubbing my little craft above matrix for these I use regular cooking oil but you can also if you 've got access to glycerine which is like a clear oil and makes it look even better but for today and what I normally use there 's just some cooking oil and as you can see I 'm not sure that you can see the oil will bubble and sit on top because oil and water don 't mix so you can sort of see the difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important for the effects that we 're going for on this one put the lid on there so do that what I will also some food dye and a little bit of glitter glitter is always fantastically messy today we 're going to add a little bit of gold if you 've got sequins buttons anything like that they 'd also go in there as well or can go in the other ones that we 're making I 'll just grab the food dye if you have any looking some with your cheaper shops they quite often have bleach and a lot of these resources of relatively cheap if you don 't have them on hand but the most important thing to remember is that you don 't need to go out and buy a special stuff these are some ideas we can absolutely resource play with what you 've got at home so we 've got some food dye here we 're going to go yellow to match our gold and a few drops should be fine sensory bottles like the shakers into the other week need to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you can only imagine what kind of mess you have so we 've got in there Alyssa water and oil give it a shake and a bit of food dye and what you 'll find little bit a good good shake what you 'll find is you can see the swirling effect as the oil and the water combined now as you shake it and this probably isn 't showing it the best it will actually really separate so that you 'll have blobs that include the glittery it 's almost like a lava lamp I suppose the glittery gloopy movement as the glittery oil moves back to the top and as it reset it so this one takes a bit of time to sort of resettle and you 'll end up with sort of two distinct layers your water and your oil and then actually give it a shake again it 'll swirl up inside so that can be really quite captivating for children as they 're sitting relaxing and watching the insides news and move and you could use any color for that rather say to seal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more water a little less oil vice versa and different colors you 'll see some amazing outcomes in that one and that 's relatively easy to do another one that 's even simpler is just getting your bottle of water so almost filled to the top you need enough room that the water will flow through and then I 've just got a container here or little sequins bits and pieces that have been collected we could probably add glitter to this one as well and it 's just a matter of popping a few in the top so again water moves faster than oil so if you had access to a glycerin oil that would anything you popped inside any inclusions would move slower and drift slower than if you had it in water but again if you hadn 't you know a selection of these it 's fun to experiment with both so these have a tendency to float on the top but if you give them a shake you can see in that have the sequins float through the water you could also add a pretty glitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does have a tendency to sort of float and stick a lot of it is about experimentation the good thing about this is if you 've got toddlers or older children they 'll help you with the experimentation so you can see the glitter there on top sit down with some stuff some bottles and some water and work through it together so here we go that 's that one with glitter and the sequins which i think looks really really cool and because there 's water missing in the top there you can see as you 're tipper they move and flow so yeah these are generally named under what they 're broadly called is sensory bottles but you can absolutely make some fantastic combinations jump onto your Pinterest and things like that but if you 're not as I said experiment get some water oil buttons beads I 've seen colored rubber bands popped in water and that also looks fantastic and it 's just about getting that flow what baby wouldn 't love to lay there and have a look at that through the sunlight as bits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get involved in helping making those as well so um but yeah so for relatively cost-effective items and these are last summer 's it you know careful with them make sure the lids on they come up really really well alright the other bottle activity I thought which is probably a little bit more extravagant a little bit more out there but if you 've got the time and the resources you can have somebody make this is a hanging plant planter so again we 've got a bottle sort of cut it around this would be a really good weekend activity and again probably for your older children but your lilies might like to help as well so you want to keep the top cone part and your lead on and in the background what they 've done is I 've actually painted the base before I paint mine now you don 't need to paint you can add stickers you could add textures I 'm just punching the holes in the sides for the string to go through on either side so you so don 't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both sides you could have two holes you could have four if you wanted to make it really even this is something that you 'd obviously really want to do yourself not let the children enjoy this make it now let 's give it a bit of a twist hole punches if you 've got one probably a little bit safer so we 've got our cup we 've put our holes as I seen so you can paint it if you had stickers good any of your Sharpie permanent textures they 'd also be fantastic for drawing designs on it I put a little bit of purple paint here so I thought I might copy what was in the picture in the background there and I 'll pop make sure I pop the link up as well so you can follow the posts that I used behind now the paint that I 'm using isn 't quite as sold this is just like at a children 's paint if you had any leftover house paint or you know paint from projects around the house your other alternative it uses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pops of house paint so they can be a really cheap effective way if you 're looking for a particular color or you want to make a color scheme grab a little sample pot and that would be more solid like in the picture this one will draw a little bit clearer but that 's okay again it 's about the fun rather than the the overall effect sometimes and you can always layer it so you I could put some stickers around here or I could put a second layer of color but for today I 'm happy with just the purple just come up really nicely and then I 've just got some string you could use any of you know ribbons wine anything you 've got around at home it 'll be outside but it would be hanging up undercover so it won 't be too bad so I just cut a length here and then it 's just a matter of looping it through the holes the good thing about using the lead is that you can it 's an easy drainage so you can have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a succulent in there that doesn 't need a lot of water and that 'd be fine if it was something that needed more fast draining or then you could unscrew the lid a little bit so that some more of the drain water drains out you take the whole lid off I suppose really depending on what sort of media you had in there what type of soil um you probably have punched a hole in the lid at the bottom if you were worried about drainage but being able to sort of screw it off and release release it would be just as easy so tied the string on and then what you would do is wait for that to dry as you can see pop your soil in there and then you 're ready to plant so that 's a nice little project that the children would really love to do hang a few of them around the back of your round of different colors different sizes different styles and yeah I think it 'd be a really quick and easy activity that you would love to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use the bottom remove the label have a section like this have them paint them and they could actually be sitting as plant crops around the place as well maybe for children over their own little special part in the yard or a cubby that might be the perfect place to hang any of these creations where they can enjoy them every day all right and the final part from today which was based on some parental I suppose inquiries about things that we could help support with a bit in flavor was toilet training now these are I suppose basic tips and tricks every child is different I 've got four children of my own and every a particular child has been different in the way they approach toilet training so they 're by no means prescriptive or you know the way to do it but they 're just a few ideas for you might be something that you haven 't tried before as I said you know part of play we are here to support families but we 're absolutely not experts you guys the experts on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any further support absolutely speak to GP speak to maternal child health nurse or if you 've got you know extra other professionals speak to allied health professionals as well they know you and your child individually much better than we do at this stage so yeah but a few tips and tricks anyway so this first slide of title toilet training is my child ready so some of the signs that you may see which can indicate that they are ready or coming close to being ready for toilet training can be things such as your child starting to undress themselves so your child being able to undress themselves is a really important part of toilet training even if they 're physically ready their body 's ready if they 're tangled up you know in overalls or in pants that they can 't undo a lot of people that they 're going to have an accident is hired because they can 't meet their needs because they can 't get their pants up and down for example so it 's frustrating it can be as you 're told like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really great sign to see them saying to remove their pants I 'm trying to remove their nappies they 've got the skills in their hands the muscles to be able to complete that task another key indicator is if your child has drawn a piece for up to two hours it 's so at least so that two-hour we know that 's an indication that they 're able to hold on to their bodily fluids and can be another indicator that they might be getting ready to toilet trained if your child is telling you hoo-wee they 're actually telling you when they 're doing it or after they 're doing it and now the great indicator they 're starting to recognize what 's happening with their body another key indicator could be that your child is interested with you on the toilet is following you to the toilet is watching is really quite interested this is probably some that you know you can found the households it 's probably been going on for a long time so we 'll often follow mom or daddy into the toilet to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning so considerate that and again like when we were talking about tuning into your child following their interest if your child is interested in watching you on the toilet giving them the steps okay I 've been to the toilet now I 'm going to grab the toilet paper two squares and and wipe myself then we put it in the toilet then we flush the button it doesn 't need to be overly descriptive but giving words to the steps that you 're going through that they 'll be able to then take and build on as they learn and these are just a tip in general that toilet training often begins during the day so it is alright if your toilet training your child during the day and their and underwear but they go back into navy or a pull-up for nighttime you don 't need to hit it all and you know at once you can be quite comfortable at toilet training during the day and then still be wearing a night nappy for quite some time that 's normal and that 's okay break it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big deal out of it if you then can 't manage because it 's such such a big task and it is the reality is accidents will happen you 're learning they 're learning so it 's totally fine to break it down into day or night once we 've got day under control then you might look at Dana do we need a nappy for Dana we might go to take that away and then building on into your evenings so these are just another couple of tips as I was saying earlier dress your children in clothes that are easy to take off and this is often why you 'll hear the advice about toilet training in summer because there are there in shorts or skirts lighter clothing that 's easier to remove but yeah even that even if it you know sometimes you won 't wait for summer it depends on you know your child 's readiness and your availability but even you know track pants over jeans things with less buttons and zippers and buckles they 're going to be things are going to help the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for signals if they 're jiggling around Wrigley might be holding themselves or pulling out their nappies asking them do you need to go to the toilet or look we have invented the toilet for a while let 's go together so trying to encourage it and helping them to recognize the cues of their body as well and these final tips said that see each other on the toilet when it 's like that they 're going to need to go so one of our human bodily function is that we eat and then we obviously need to expel it as well so this example from the racing shield Network was saying about half an hour after meals is a prime timer city child on the toilet and quite often has positive results and also advises at about 3 to 5 minutes is long enough for your child to see so if you 've sat your child and and they don 't look into us at all you know they don 't look like anything 's going to happen three minutes is okay I suppose in my experience I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for five minutes we might have a little bit of a chat we might read a story on the toilet if I 'm trying to promote feeling comfortable on the toilet so that might take 10 minutes we 'll sit read the story but again don 't apply pressure there 's no point a child 's not going to respond if you are holding them on the toilet saying you need to do a wee now and unfortunately they 've been more worried about other things and and the body just won 't respond in that way so it doesn 't need to be a long time on the toilet it 's about making it positive and making it frequent as well so if you know we 've been to the toilet and nothing 's acting this time perhaps look at maybe be 15 minutes 20 minutes the next time before you go again you know or if it 's going to be another 30 minutes just staying right on top of that so there is it takes time that takes commitment from both you know your child and yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so this slide was toilet training some tips on how to toilet train so you 've had a look over and you think yep you know what we 're gonna give it a go again you might give it a try for a few days and you might not just be there you might just be all for it 's not working for you that 's okay you 're better off to stop and read again in a couple of months when your mall ready and making it a stressful thing for you so I guess take a deep breath it is it 's a big thing as a parent it 's exciting but it 's okay it 's okay to make tiny steps out of it too I never had a child that was one of those wonderful ones that taught its rate in the space of three days it was something that we worked at progressively over a period of months you know gradually improving but it 's definitely something that that for me was never a quick fix but yeah it 's a learning it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you just need to take a deep breath and if he 's gonna be alright in the end so some tips on how to toilet train as I was saying earlier think of toilet training as a series of small goals so instead of looking at it as toilet training is you know okay we 're going to take that booze off today we 're going to go into undies and we 're never going to go back we 're going to work towards it and it 'll be done in a few days there are children that operate like that and that is awesome for others including my own children it was definitely a series of steps and and small wins so in those examples it was start by getting a child familiar with the toilet what 's it what it 's for and how to use it so just looking and watching and making sure that your child has seen you flushed at all and has not didn 't some children find the toilet quite daunting he 's noisy a big splashy noisy thing it 's quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step or a set of ladder you know a little step I know that they can climb up on making them comfortable again your child 's not going to use the toilet if they 're scared of it so breaking it down to having them approach the toilet watching you flush showing them this is the button that we flush this is how we sit on it and put the seat down all those little steps getting them familiar and feeling comfortable and yeah keep in mind that going to the toilet is a complex task so break it down into small touch tasks and taste and a step by step so there 's the actual getting onto the toilet path there 's the sitting on the toilet part there 's the hopping off pulling your pants up flushing moving you step over to wash your hands how to wash your hands all those little they 're all individual skills that need to come together to make toilet training successful so even if your child 's not ready or you 're not quite ready yet to go through the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child helping you at dressing time pulling up their pants and pulling them down again to put their pajamas on at night practice hand washing so have them get their step bring it up show them how to turn on your taps or however your system is with your hand soap so that when it comes time to actually toilet trained I already know how to pull their pants down they can already wash their hands they 're comfortable with knowing that the lead goes down before you flush all those in-between steps so the toilet training part is really the only new skill set so this was considered skipping the potty stage if your child has difficulty with change parties versus toilets is is a very individual decision some families swear by having a potty and using a potty first because they can have it in the room at their in and then therefore when they 're first starting off and sometimes then rely less in between I need to go to the toilet and I 'm going to the toilet it 's quite small because they 're still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potty nearby means that you can sit them on there and you 've got more chance of catching it while they 're still learning their body cues others feel that by doing that then you 're learning to transition from nappy to potty then you have until getting trained from potty to how to use the toilet so some families prefer to go straight into using a toilet that 's a very individual thing and it 's worth considering either way there 's pros and cons for both as your child learns each step of using the toilet encourage with Rewards or just in general anything and anytime that you child does something fantastic have you been able to yeah clip my 18 month old child now takes things to the bend and when he does he 'll open it up put it in shut the door and they clap his hands to himself if I 'm not quick enough to praise him because he knows generally we 're not trying to you know show him how well he 's doing great job I want to encourage those behaviors yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around and applauds himself from random things so rewards doesn 't necessarily have to be something he doesn 't have to be a toy it doesn 't have to be a sticker it is enough that he 'd use some praise well done that was fantastic okay well you did that you did that all by yourself that 's something that again builds up those good emotions they feel good they feel fantastic they love seeing you happy and they 're likely to do it again if they 've seen a great response from you one of the other things and I will provide links for is a using a visual schedule so these are really handy in that they have pictures and it will be pants down show a picture of the toilet then it 'll show a picture of flushing washing hands so it gives those visual cues to children that what comes next again as I said toileting is a daunting thing in that there 's many many steps to it if you 've got something stuck up on the wall where they can jog their memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to follow it and again if you 're having that bit of resistance where they 're not keen today or they don 't want to go through you can say look look at the chart it says you know flush and then the next step is to wash our hand so we 've got what 's the next step washing our hands we need to do that so instead of it becoming that bit of a battle about you want them to wash their hands and they 're not interested going well look this is what the chart says so taking away that battle I suppose between parent and child it 's actually the chart that shows us what we do next and then what comes after that so shooting it 's one of those skills that you know if you 're tuning in following the lead of your child and they 're interested that 's fantastic if they 're not using a visual schedule can be a really great handy little tool to try and help keep your child on track and the final tip was back going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take some photos at home of your own toilet and your own sink make a little story book out of it if your child 's happy to be a part of it say can you wash it I 'm gonna take a photo we 're gonna make a story go through it you know at bedtime or quiet time sit down and do your you know this is our story of how we go to the toilet first we take our pants down have them draw pictures have them help you out or use the generic pictures and make these little books have them help you but go through them again it 's about learning the steps for them so that once they 're comfortable with that it 's just about you know actually getting in and having it go again these tips won 't work for everybody but there 's some little things that I 've sort of found useful over these in my experience as a parent and as an educator but yeah every child is absolutely different and yeah it 's just a matter of sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're ready a few of the other government resources it can be quite handy in general but do have some great information on toilet training was better have a card are you raising children net dot are you just what I use a lot of the the pictures from today they were fantastic and they have a lot of printables as well which is handy and I 've also found some handy information on starting blocks gov 280 which is governed by a secret who is one of our accreditation bodies for our long day care organizations there 's absolutely more resources out there there 's plenty but these were three that were you know governed by our government here in Australia and I thought were absolutely worth a mention now tomorrow so it sort of sums up for today tomorrow we 'll be getting into some art and crafts getting ready for our fantastic national simultaneous story time story of Whitney and Brittany chicken Devers so there 'll be a little bit of art and crafts based around chickens as you can see one of the things we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chicken masks so egg cartons are another readily available resource if you eat eggs at home of course and if not there 's usually someone your family that likes to stockpile them so we 'll be starting off tomorrow morning with an egg carton chicken mask and we will absolutely go from there but thank you so much for joining me today and I will see you tomorrow thank you,"(-36.7142554, 142.2016929)"

can you guess where what do i look like with a very specific sort of hat on and i 'm wearing an apron and i 've got all these ingredients and supplies here for cooking daddy 's gonna rock you in his arms pretty baby you 're surrounded in love i 'm already wearing this one up here and i made this one before we started so i could show you the finished product and what you have here is a piece of white cardboard cut into a strip two pieces actually attached together to fit around the head but don 't tape them up around your head yet you want them out in a nice long strip a bit like this one but we 'll come back to this one we want the big long strip like this some a4 paper like this and you want to make a big fold in from the end i 'm just going to do it roughly but you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small fold back the other way so that we have one little pleat they 're called those folds pleats and then we do it again big fold and then a little fold now i have to tell you that i really struggle with this and i stupidly stuck four pieces of paper together end to end because it takes a good four or five pieces of paper and then the longer this got i was flipping the whole thing over back and forth because i was having to do all the folds so i don 't recommend that i recommend doing one piece of paper at a time and i 've actually done it up the wrong way it should be long ways like that if you want a really tall hat like mine that is so just keep chanting yourself like i did big fold little fog pin fold little fold it takes a while to get into the swing of it you might have to study the pictures and when you 've done one sheet tape it to the next or perhaps when you folded them all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can take your strip and take the big long strip of pleated parts this tool bit up here along your cardboard and then when it 's finally ready you can measure it around your head and tape up the finished product this is a really easy template if you don 't have much time or many supplies at home or your kids are a bit littler and perhaps don 't have the patience for a bigger project this one you just cut out and you 've just got the sort of crown bit or the headband bit at the front as your chef 's hat i 'll put the link in the description this one is a bit clever i think someone 's gotten very creative to make this one what you do with this one is you take a piece of paper i used um two pieces of a3 paper so that my bumps were really tall but if you don 't have it at home you could use a4 or in fact take a4 together when you put them together like that that 's the same size as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glue and you run just one little strip of glue along there and you glue this down like that but you can see there 's still an opening in there we 're not gluing down the whole piece and then you just very carefully cut your strips into it roughly up until about where you 've glued try not to fold them too much but a little bit of folding is going to happen as you snip and then that will give you a wonderful wobbly chef 's hat like the one i 'm wearing here and you wrap that one around your head to measure it and tape it off and then the very last one so i started with the same again a strip of cardboard it 's actually two strips taped together in the middle and then the internet website listed up here suggests using tissue paper often just scrap tissue paper like that tissue paper that 's come around your shoes in a shoe box is great crepe paper would also do but i 've just used some of my stash of leftover take away napkins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you start at one end and you tape down the edge of the tissue paper or napkin and then you make a little fold and take that down and make another little fold you can do a few at a time if you want to add a good decent strip of tape but i tended to just do a pleat stick and do a pleat stick it whatever works for you and you start making your way along there so it 's all pleated i 'll bring that up nice and close so you can see see it 's just been bunched up a little bit in little folds and i saved this one to do with you so i could show you then you measure it around your head except i think i 've forgotten to bring in the sticky tape so and you 're going to have this big floppy bit up here so the final step after that is to grab an elastic band which i 've got here and put the elastic band and see if i can put this in my armpit in blue of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could do this with tape also but i 've decided to use an elastic band here we go and we don 't want to see that bit so once you 've done that you just tuck that bit inside like that and you 're going to have the big puffy chef 's part at the top and i think that one looks pretty fabulous as well the thing about doing activities like this together as no me no doubt many of you who 've been receiving the kits the last few weeks will know is that it 's really easy to sit down with an activity like this meaning to have a great time with your child and for it to end in tears either for you or for them um because um kids are at different stages and sometimes we might plan an activity that 's a little bit beyond them or maybe they 've you know just had a sweet treat and they 're on a bit of a sugar high maybe they 're a bit tired you never know the reasons but maybe they 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your instructions um and it 's really easy to get snappy and i 've been there a million times as a mum myself my son 's 13 now and the older he gets it just seems the more there 's a sort of string of regrets when i think back to times when i just lost my patience a little bit it happens to the best of us but an activity like this is a perfect way to practice being warm and gentle what is important what 's really important at the end of the day is the relationship you 're building as you 're doing it and it 's the satisfaction that people get from working together that serve and return interaction where i do something and you respond and reflect back to me what i was expressing and how i was feeling in a way that makes me feel seen and heard and like i 'm understood and appreciated and then you return that serve to me and i do the same it 's like catching a ball i catch the ball of your communication your curiosities your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so it goes on so that 's what these activities are really about you know we don 't really expecting that um if your child spends a lot of time doing great craft and engineering activities but it 's you know paving the way for a great career in science although it may um you know at the end of the day it 's about the little micro skills that are developed through children um having really good behaviour and relationships modeled to them by the grown-ups around them grandpa 's gonna rock you in his arms pretty baby you 're surrounded in love she 's going to sing a beautiful nancy stewart song that we can download at nancymusic.com about being warm and gentle in the car and the kitchen and the park and on a bike and when we sing and play together but first we need to learn one auslan sign like the ladies doing in the background and forgive me because online computer that 's a beautiful smooth motion and the video plays nicely and for some reason in this room uh the video is all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together like this but like scouts on her so that they 're hidden away and just got two fingers pointing out and then she 's pointing her fingers towards her lips and going like this like this singing coming out of her mouth and we 're going to do that action when we sing the verse about how i love to sing a song with you and it goes a little something like this i like to ride in the car with you i like to ride in the car with you i like to ride in the car with you that 's what i like to do [Music] i like to go to the park with you i like to go to the park with you i like to go to the park with you that 's what i 'd like to do i 'd like to cook in the kitchen with you i like to cook in a kitchen with you i like to cook in the kitchen with you that 's what i like to do i like to ride my bike with you i like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bike with you that 's what i like to do i 'd like to sing a song with you i 'd like to sing a song with you i 'd like to sing a song with you that 's what i like to do beautiful song of beautiful songs you have in your repertoire if you look it up on your phone you can just click on the um song file where nancy 's written download um and save it straight to your phone and then it can play immediately if you 've got bluetooth in your car you can do it that way or just playing your phone on loudspeaker play it anywhere anytime i like to build with blocks with you i like to build with blocks with you and it 's a beautiful way especially if you 're someone who maybe is not great with saying those sorts of words filled with all those meanings and not all of us are putting it in songs a really great way to do it mama 's gonna rock you in her arms in her arms in her arms mama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're surrounded in love for those of you receiving the take-home kits uh you would have received the enriched caregiving booklet and it 's all really small everyday stuff you know like rooney and i are always telling you using everyday objects everyday routine moments that 's the stuff of childhood that 's the stuff of brain growth and emotional development you don 't actually have to do a lot of fancy stuff you know fancy stuff is fun and fancy toys are fun but in actual fact the science tells us quite clearly that you know there 's no toy fancy enough for the toy itself to really be able to teach a child much it 's the experience they have with it and that crucially crucially includes the people around them i love the concept of enriched caregiving it 's a really super simple model and super easy to remember and i wish i knew it when my son was little um because even though i mean it 's stuff we all know i think we all know that we need to do routine tasks like change their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that while we do that we show them emotion we laugh we giggle them we love them and we cuddle and we know that while that 's going on they 're usually learning you know they 're learning about that 's my left foot and my right foot and my toes and my fingers and you know all sort of stuff oh that feels cold there 's all these things they 're learning experiences language um but sometimes i think it just helps to have little quick memory joggers to remind you in those times when you 're stressed because it 's when you 're stressed that you forget to be warm and gentle every second of the day is an opportunity to be warm and gentle just like it 's an opportunity to learn and just like it 's an opportunity for language development if when you get up in the morning and then you get dressed or undressed and you diaper or toilet and wash hands and face for all the times you sit down to eat going to the supermarket taking a nap doing the laundry cleaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night if those moments are warm and gentle and full of language and full of servant return interactions remember i said like the game of catch before your child throws the ball to you don 't just whack it back at them catch it first which means show them that you 've heard it oh it sounds like you 're feeling really frustrated you know even if they say horrible things right what if our you know our son says my sister 's a awful word well our first response is to not catch that ball is it it 's to not be warm and gentle it 's to say how dare you speak like that go to your room well how revolutionary is it when you try a different approach when someone says look i hear your frustrations i know it could be really frustrating to have a little sister really frustrating when she doesn 't understand about your toys and can 't keep up with you in games and then you go on to the part where it 's just that we can 't quite allow you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the behavior you want to see but you 've caught the ball you said i hear you i hear your feelings mate um if you just whack that ball back without trying to catch it without showing them you 've heard them and they 're not going to be interested in complying with you are they these things we tell you about in the small talk approach uh the small talk um sessions really has distilled into a few tiny sort of tiny key or dot points what the essence of um valid childhood is in terms of development and learning and relationships and as much as it 's fun to make chef 's hats see i wouldn 't fix it as much as it 's fun to do all that the most important thing is warm and gentle serve and return relationships [Music] you 're surrounded in love,"(-36.7142554, 142.2016929)"

Jeremy Fisher also by Beatrix Potter once upon a time there was a frog here is called mr. Jeremy Fisher and there he is in the picture reading in the door of his house and there 's a dragonfly on the door the water was all slippy sloppy in his little damp house but mr. Jeremy Fisher liked getting his feet wet because he 's a frog frogs live in the water there 's all the water at the bottom of his house he was quite pleased when he looked out and saw large drops of rain splashing in the pond this Andrew you can make rain at home if you 've got a spray bottle like this it 's raining when mr. Jeremy Fisher I will get some words here he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its tail sticking out if I catch more than five fish I will invite my friends for dinner one two three four five once I caught a fish alive six seven eight nine ten then I let it go again why did you let it go because it bit my finger so which finger did it bite this little finger on the right he took his rod and his basket and set off with enormous hops hop hop to the place where he kept his boat did you ever see a froggy froggy froggy did you ever see a froggy hop this way and that hop this way and that way and this way and that way did you ever see a froggy hop this way and that the boat was round and green and very like the other lily leaves this is Lily leave boat right there and he 's got his bag full of all his fishing supplies it was tied to a water plant in the middle of the pond mr. Jeremy took a reed Pole he 's taken one of these Reed 's from the creek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out into open water there is mr. Jeremy Fisher in the open water [Music] row row row your boat gently down the stream merrily merrily merrily merrily life is but a dream row row row your boat gently down the stream if you see a crocodile don 't forget to scream I hope mr. Jeremy Fisher doesn 't see any crocodiles today then he settled himself cross-legged and arranged his fishing tackle cross over mr. Jeremy fishes legs there the rain trickled down his back for nearly an hour this is getting tiresome hmm I think I should like some lunch said Mr Jeremy Fisher I will eat a butterfly sandwich I don 't think so but that 's what frogs like to eat and wait until the shower is over said Mr Jeremy Fisher a great big water beetle there it is came up underneath the lily leaf and tweet his toe one two three four five once I caught a bug alive six seven eight nine ten then I let it go again why did you let it go because it bit my little toe which toe did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice something moved about with a rustle and a splash I think I 'd better get away from here said Mr Jeremy Fisher what is rustling and splashing in the water I think it 's some rats Oh some big rats they look just about as big as mr. Jeremy Fisher himself mr. jeremy shoved the boat out again a little way and dropped in the bait and there was a bite almost directly but by a fish I wonder if he 's caught some fish fatty so he can have his friends around a minnow a minnow cried mr. Jeremy Fisher jerking up his rod look mr. fish is caught right there but what a horrible surprise mr. Jeremy had landed little Jack sharp the stickleback covered with spines spiky spiky spines the stickleback flounder the bat flip flop flip flop flip flop about the boat and then jumped back in the water thank heavens a little show of other little fishies put their heads out and laughed but mr. Jeremy Fisher you caught a stickleback [Music] have you ever seen a fishy fishy fishy have you ever seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that way and this way and that way did you ever see a fishy swim this way and that and while mr. jeremy sat disconsolately he just can 't be consoled he can 't be made to feel better he said disconsolate Leon the edge of his boat a much worse thing happened a great big enormous trout came up and seized mr. Jeremy with a snap Oh No then it turned and dive down to the bottom of the pond but the chat was so displeased with the taste there if he doesn 't like the taste of mr. Jeremy Fisher very much bear that in less than half a minute its spat him out again mr. jeremy best up to the surface of the water and he swam with all his might to the edge at the pond oh he scrambled it oh onto the first bank he came to and he hopped across the meadow did you ever see a froggy hop this way and that I have lost my rod and my basket but it does not much matter for I am sure I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Puddleduck yesterday and little Peter Rabbit on Monday he 's had quite an ordeal and I think he 's a bit tired of adventures for today his friends both came to dinner he could not offer them fish because he didn 't touch any but he had something else in his Lada there are his friends there Sir Isaac Newton because he 's a mute wore his black and gold waistcoat and mr. alderman Ptolemy tortoise is the tortoise there with his shell in his back brought a salad with him in a string bag well that 's good they can have some salad for dinner and there 's the salary an instead of a nice dish of minnows which is the fish that Jeremy had hoped to catch they had a roasted grasshopper with ladybird sauce which frogs consider a beautiful treat but I think it must have been nasty I don 't think I 'd like roasted grass burger but it helped with ladybugs so it 's very much but I think mr. Jeremy and his friends probably liked it because they eat insects thanks for joining us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget to tune in next week on Monday Tuesday and Wednesday for more fun playgroup videos with Bernie thanks see ya [Music],"(-36.7142554, 142.2016929)"

Playgroup,ab9QvXjpQLg,20200506,895.819,"Roberts Ave, Horsham VIC 3400, Australia",1255,hello welcome to today 's online playgroup today we 're reading the tale of Jemima Puddleduck to follow up from our Peter Rabbit story yesterday listen to the story of Jemima Puddleduck who was annoyed because the farmers would not let her hatch own eggs here 's one of the farmers my wonder which duck is Jemima there 's lots of little ducklings here and some hands as well picking at the ground to find some worms and grains to eat I wish to hatch my own eggs I will hatch them by myself quite Jemima Puddleduck there 's Jemima there I think that must be her she 's talking to all the other animals what did duck say when they get up in the morning [Music] they say what about hens what do they say get up in the morning today they say [Music] what about these animals here in the background which ones do you think I got I reckon you 're right I reckon they 're cows one cows get up in the morning they say good day we cows get up in the morning Oh today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy my paddle back but they were always found and carried off this little boy on the farm has found her eggs where do you think she might have hidden them in that picture I think she 's hidden them under the leaves there look I think I can see another one but I think the boys probably about to pick that one up too Jemima determined to make a nest right away from the farm where nobody could find and take her eggs she set off on a fine spring afternoon along the cat road that leads over the hill the wind over the mountain [Music] to see what she could see technology can see to go she can see words the other side of the mountain together started a mountain to the other side of a mountain to see when she reached the top of that mountain she saw upward in the distance she thought it looked a safe quiet spot jananam Jemima Puddleduck was not much in the habit of flying she spent most of her time on the farm doesn 't need to fly very far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try and take off and then she jumped up into the air she flew beautifully when she had a good start now that she 's awkwardly got off the ground she soaring gently through the sky on the wind she skimmed along over the treetops until she saw an open place in the middle of a wood down below that might be a good place for her to stop one puddle dirt wet [Music] a Jemima alighted oh rather heavily that means she landed or got down she rather heavily and began to wonder what that in search of a convenient dry nesting place seated upon the system she was startled to find an elegantly dressed gentleman reading a newspaper madam have you lost your way Sydney Jemima thought him mighty civil and handsome she explained that she had not lost her way but that she was trying to find a convenient dry nesting place ah is that so indeed said the gentleman with Sandy whiskers looking curiously at Jemima why is he looking furiously what is he up to as to a nest there is no difficulty I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my woodshed beg your pardon you may sit there as long as you like said the bushy long-tailed gentleman what is suspicious about this gentleman who has long bushy tails the gentleman opens the door I showed Jemima in now that you see his face do you know who this gentleman is he 's a sly old Fox and foxes like to eat ducks the was almost quite full of feathers it was comfortable and very soft oh when she made a nest and settled him without any trouble at all when she came out the sandy whiskered gentleman promised to take great care of her nest until she came back the next day I bet he did he wants to eat those eggs he said he loved eggs and ducklings yet eat he should be proud to see a fine mist full in his woodshed Jemima Puddleduck came every afternoon she laid nine eggs in the nest one two three four five six seven eight nine at last Jemima told him that she intended to begin to sit the next day and wait for them to hatch madam before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a treat let us have a dinner party all to ourselves what might be on the menu at this dinner party do you think may I ask you to bring up some hooves and two onions from the farm garden Jemima Puddleduck went round the farm garden nibbling up snippets of all the different sorts of herbs that are used for stuffing roast duck Oh Jemima we will you work it out you 're in terrible danger she waddled into the kitchen and got two onions that 's it the collie dog kept coming out what are you doing with those onions where do you go every afternoon by yourself Jemima told him the whole story thank goodness maybe he will be able to work it out and save Jemima then cap went out and trotted down the village he went to look for two Foxhound puppies Foxhound I wonder what they do do you think maybe they track foxes who are out with the butcher what did dogs safe when they get up in the morning when dogs [Music] what what what that she 's what they say they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puddle duck wet up the cart road for the last time she was red burdened with batches of herbs and two onions in a bag she 's going up the hill for the last time taking them back to someone who wants to eat the gentleman sitting on their eggs she felt surprised she was inside she around the back and someone with a black nose she surprised it was the most Howl 's squealing and groans and nothing more was ever seen of that foxy whiskered gentleman again oh thank goodness for kicks and the fox hounds presently kept opened the front door of the shed and let out Jemima Puddleduck unfortunately the puppies rushed in and gobbled up the eggs before he could stop them oh no all that work Jemima did and her eggs to be gobbled up for lunch Jemima Puddleduck was at home she laid some more in June and she was permitted to keep them herself this time but only four of them hatched Jemima Puddleduck said it was because of her nerves she had such a fright didn 't she such a close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doggies and she got to lay her eggs in the end and I hope she would be a little bit wiser from now on and not straight into the first alone where there 's boxes lurking in the shadows thanks for

Playgroup",1024xY5bxbo,20200506,710.1,"Roberts Ave, Horsham VIC 3400, Australia",2117,hi everybody welcome back to Wednesday I would like to run through just a quick video today because some of my videos are getting quite long and I know it can be challenging for families trying to find 10 to 15 minutes to sit down and watch a video but today I wanted to revisit a nascar play from yesterday go through one more really fun physical activity game that requires no props which is awesome and then just a little threading activity for something another ID you can do at home that 's a relatively cheap and accessible so starting off with the skies or is that a hankie scarf as we 're going I just wanted to run through a couple of songs that not only were used for these on use for lots of you know different stories around the home it 's just you know that little ditty that it gets yeah according it yeah so the first one is everybody dues and a lot of people will be familiar with you song from your own childhood and it 's really easy to use across all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have it would go everybody shaking shaking shaking everybody shaking just like this everybody swirly swirly swirly everybody swirling just like this and free body cat Jinxy cat king cat team everybody catching just like this and that can be used with any movement you can think of and any scenario wash your dishes getting dressed whatever you can think of it 's a really great easy Duty that you can ease yeah and the other one again can sort of be adapted a few times but scabs are falling down and it 's all that throwing and catching again and just having a little bit of summer to work with this way so skies are falling down scoffs I 'm falling down flipped up left to flip the flattest calves are falling down and if you really open up your stuff it will slow down differently so if you have it bunched up so it 's a really great one for experiment in the difference between having it bunched up having it open a little bit well having it right open and trying to catch it but it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see nothing wrong with a bit seeing in the morning all right but moving on the next thing I 've for you today is a game called into the jungle and it can be into the jungle that could be on the farm it could be along the beach whatever thing is thinking of and essentially it 's another movement when we 've been working on this week and the week before so those fundamental movement skills thinking about our body having it then moving how we can get us moving and what it wouldn 't usually be you have your carer mum dad now pop whoever it is it 's something after you and they 're going to give you some movement so we 're going into the jungle and as we 're going along into the jungle you might have to jump over some logs so you 'd have someone say okay read the jungle oh look this would be blogs we 're gonna have to jump over the logs and ready here we go jump jump jump and then we keep walking and we 're in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to run from the tailor that 's got it ready from the time you can run on the spot or if you 've got room you can run around the room or in your backyard you can run wherever you like and then we run from the tiger so they take the mess and we 're still worried we 're in the jungle and then we 've come to some quick sense first we 're gonna stop freeze how we 're going to get through the creeks in we 're going to take the pool and legs up really high because the quicksand is sticky so and we go through so lift your knees are really high through the quicksand pull through through through and through so we 're walking into the job and we 're still going oh stop we 've come to expect me to tiptoe very very carefully past the side and start one and so forth so that is an example of how we would play into the jungle you might go along the farm you might go for a walk along the beach and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lots of lots of different ideas that you could do there and again as a parent or as a carer if you 're giving them the IDS the children can work together to come up with how they 're going to do those actions in the activity that you 've said great ones to the backyard you sitting down having a cup of tea inside use it wherever you want to yeah nice quick easy activity and finishing up this was one of my personal favorites that I like to do at home just a basic and threading activity and this is I suppose an idea that I 've put out there because it 's something you need to build up over time so a nice store of different bits and pieces that you can have and use to when you need to so at my place I actually have a little box and it 's called the craft box anytime I get any interesting looking boxes leads from any kind of containers soft drink bottles milk bottles you know bits of fabric wrapping paper a pair of scissors glue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box and then when the children are getting a little bit unsettled and and my older guys are a bit older we get the craft box out and we come up with some things to do and threading has been one of the ones we 've been working on a touch time to build up your bits and pieces but but yeah if you 're sort of thinking about before you get on throw something away could that be reuse for something else look at the children France them using it often we don 't see the value and they do yeah goes into the crafts box we looked at later so what we 're doing today or my example and what sort of come out of my craft box at home I 've been a stream and we 'll just do some threading obviously this works better for your children sort of two years and above that are able to see and thread but even children and a lot younger if you sit there with arms with bigger holes they 'll be able to have a go to so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box today for some threading ideas penny bands nice easy run leads so I was saying that I think that was off the gravy milkweeds and all I 've done is just sit there with the pair of scissors and just poke some holes in them if you had two older children they could help you do it but it is a little bit tricky so I sort of pre prepare that bits of old wrapping paper with holes in them fan some shows that already had holes in them okay perfect some beads as well and these are obviously small so you want to use them for your older children and you know they were something little bought ages ago and for the leftovers definite don 't leave that and my other would find with some packing peanuts so thanks for staying home and social isolating I 've been doing some shopping online and getting lots and lots of packing peanuts so keeps things you can do with these but a nice easy one again I just poked holes in those he 'd be siffredi and this was like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it and you 've been broken so I said throwing it in the bin I actually pulled it apart and kept the flowers in the condition threading with those so really easy again this is just a bit of wool which would you know but it could be a bit of string bit of twine whatever you 've got going it doesn 't have to be anything in particular I mean the children love to sit down and have the experience it 's more rarely experienced than than what it looks like and as soon as you say oh you can make a bracelet or necklace or if they you don 't particularly want it for them there 's usually someone they can think of maybe they can make it and post it off to someone that they haven 't been able to see at the moment yeah usually they 're involved and then it is just a matter of obviously turning it on so we 've got our flower leads of all different sizes leads I love what they do they take a while to collect you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are fantastic and you can do all sorts of stuff you can sort with them cap them leads what else if we done how do you pan now then if the children are older they can make the holes and so if not it 's easy enough to just pre prepare all this and have accepted ready pans wrapping paper so again you know the offcuts of when you 're making or you know wrapping a gift and you get those bits left over keep them or if you get some of the nice wrapping paper gifted to keep that as well I know it 's a pain sometimes keeping all the bits and pieces but every once in a while that comes in handy and you so thankful packing peanuts but yeah so I suppose a little a take-home activity in terms of having you think about you know what things you use what things you can actually start keeping get the children involved as well you know I 've been thinking about you know if they have the job of taking their recycling out before they do go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later Pinterest is another great resource or if you 've got something Holly the paper plates for example if you type in paper-plate product that 'll bring up more IDs you could ever possibly think of so sometimes it 's a matter of you 've actually got some stuff and you 're not sure what to do with it there are plenty of websites that can come up with ideas for you you just really can be as well so as you can see quite quickly you 've got a nice little threading going on but we can then turn into whatever we like I mean you don 't have to keep it the children might not want to thread it and then keep it as a necklace or send it off they might just want to actually go through the process of threading it and pulling a bit off back off and that 's okay too but yeah I 'm not sure whether I 've succeeded in keeping my video a little bit shorter but they 're just a couple of quick ideas that you can use this week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some photos of the videos from you guys using some of the material that we 've popped up or material from the packs that we sent out so I 'm please feel free to engage with the Facebook page sending us some pictures of this letting us know how you 're finding the content are you finding

Playgroup",keyf2QemK24,20200504,570.019,"Roberts Ave, Horsham VIC 3400, Australia",1265,good morning welcome to today 's playgroup it 's the last video for this week on how much and move thing well we 've been talking about getting fit and healthy doing exercise and eating really good healthy food and then next week Bernie will be taking over and she 'll do the three playgroup days Monday Tuesday and Wednesday with some more fun luncheon moves songs and games remember you can download all these resources at Healthy Kids new south wales girl today here Nancy music calm and today we 're going to do a book from free kids books org and if you 're in our supported play groups who are currently getting deliveries I 'll be seeing you tomorrow Thursday you 're free activity we 're gonna do some dancing let 's move [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] right balancing it 's beautiful dancing and now we should all be a little bit puffed in breathing like we 've just done some excellent exercise buddies we 'll be growing strong and our muscles a little bit getting really tough from all the exercise we 've got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deliver me some balloons and we can practice another fundamental movement skill which is striking the ball these balloons will be in your pack if you 're getting a take-home kit but otherwise mums and dads and grandmas and carers you can make this activity at home with balloons and string and you can use a paper roll or even just to roll that newspaper to your practice and striking the ball here I go I 'm going to strike the red one and the orange one and the yellow and the green one and the blue one I 'm going to heat them up I 'm gonna eat them to the right I 'm gonna hit them to the left you can hit them with your head you can hit them with your elbows you can hit them with you 're me you can use lots of language in an activity like this up-down left-right colours body parts so it 's a really rich of a language engagement not immense and building up the body and developing some fundamental movement skills thank you secret helper I appreciate your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dads and grownups so this is really great for conversational reading that means that when you read a book together you don 't have to read all the words you can skip pages you can go back you can repeat you don 't even have to read any other words the book doesn 't have to have words the idea is that you are using language by communicating with each other following each other 's lead so it should be like a conversation your child does something you do something your child does something you do something so it 's a great idea to start from where they 're looking sit baby I 'll show where you can see their eyes and see what they 're looking at not with their backs facing you and then you can name and discuss the things they 're looking at and it 's like three steps you can see babies can see but they can 't really show and say yet and then you can show what does the kangaroo do and your toddler can show you that they understand and then you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grown-up can say to you what 's the grass what 's the cow Eddie and the child much like grass so he is a worthless picture book that you can download for free and free kids books got org and it 's about toast which we know is a nice healthy everyday food it 's in the cereals or grains group and especially if you have whole grain or whole wheat bread it 's really good for you for that slow brown energy and a really important staple part of that diet rich in fiber and look at all the opportunities we have to discuss these pictures what do you think 's going up here kids I think this gives us a clue I think the picnic basket tells us they 've gone to the park for a picnic do you think it 's gonna rain today I don 't think so this time clouds as a couple but it 's mostly sunny there we go we were right there having a picnic and there 's two grown-ups and one child and we can talk about all the things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at these healthy foods we 've got some healthy fruit here and some healthy smoothies and then we have here some sometimes food like we talked about in our take-home packs last week in terms of dental health things like cupcakes and sweets okay sometimes but they 're not really good for your teeth they 're our bodies if we have them all the time this is where the story gets a bit interesting what do you think is happening yeah ah can you predict what you think he 's about to happen in the story how many foods are here perhaps when you read this at home you can count them how do you think these characters are feeling surprised who 's peeking over that Hill that cheeky birdy it 's stolen our very healthy piece of toast and I wonder what 's gonna happen next that 's all I 'm gonna give you because you can download the rest of the book at home at free kids bought books org slash toast a wordless

the ball runs down to the feet passes it down again well you can line up with your feet next to one another and weave the balls through my legs and through your legs all the way down we can make a throw in gold with that basket or we can draw a target yeah I 've got some chalk here and I 'm gonna draw a big cross on the wall there and then I can grab my bowl and I can try and throw the ball at the target and I fur do all sorts of things with out of control things on the ground on the wall so I can make compete I could make them small the median chalk is that it just washes up again or you can use some masking tape I can make an obstacle course with household objects and kick the ball around it usually in a sport class you 'd use comments with you but you don 't need to understand ads you can get creative you could put a truck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then you get your kids to use their feet and get the ball all around the obstacles gratefully practicing fashion ombudsmen skills one day that could turn into a love art shocker we could fill up empty bottles you can use sand you could even just use soil from the backyard or water and then use them as skittles which is like when you 're going bowling knock them over with the balls and with small balls like this tennis ball they 're actually great for baby master age if you 've got really little kids as well rolling the ball over bubbies skin is a nice gentle massage it 's great for sensory stimulation so that all these ideas and more on the New South Wales government health care Kids website just google the munch and root

Playgroup,YLp_mVodDRA,20200504,683.059,"Roberts Ave, Horsham VIC 3400, Australia",1561,hi everyone today I thought I would do a bit of my own version of a Goldilocks and the three bears renditions keeping in line with our dental health theme that we 've had this week so sometimes it is fun to acting it out rather than have to read the book so we 're going to go with that for this week and we 're going to start off with our character Goldilocks so essentially what I 've done is how to look around and utilize what toys I 've got around to try and act it out hey it 's really fun to do be it 's cost-effective because you 're using materials you 've already got around your home and see it 's okay if everything isn 't exactly as it would be in the story I guess my recommendation would be channel a little bit of the old playschool styling and just use what you 've got and the enthusiasm and fun that you bring with it will engage his children as much as anything else okay so as a story starts we 've got our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house well there 's nobody home and she 's looking around hello hello she can 't find anybody and then she notices a wonderful platter of gorgeous gorgeous foods and again being very conscious of her dental needs Goldilocks approaches the plate and has a look she had to make with the cake first and she had a taste but it is too sweet and hurt so to eat so she doesn 't want that one then she has a look oh it 's a limit that 's not usual thing to have and she has a little context apart oh that is too sour and the accent actually hurts her teeth as well so she puts that one back as well then she spots the third plate which is a cheese sandwich and she has a taste and that you just feet good healthy food it 's also got cheese it 's calcium for her teeth and she eats it all up after that she 's still wandering around having a look no one 's around then she comes up into the bathroom and she finds a selection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Danny 's toothbrush and that is too big so she puts that one down then she comes across baby these little green toothbrush but it is too little for her so she pops that one back finally she tries mother 's medium sized toothbrush and it is just perfect so she starts to brush her teeth which is not a great idea because we should all have our own toothbrushes and not use other people 's and how does she brushes her teeth she pops them away again she goes for a wander and she finds a little blanket and she 's really a little bit tired so she tucks herself into the blanket and has a little nap while she 's doing that our family comes home now her family is a little bit ugly today as well so we not have dad we have mum and we have a baby so we do have a bear in there somewhere so anyway as good luck to pop steady and she 's having a sleep our family come home day comes own mum comes home and baby and dad says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be eating my lemon and baby businesses someone 's been eating my sandwich and it 's all gone then the kids through the side looking around then wondering they 're trying to work it out what has gone home or they 've been away so then they come into the bathroom so they wonder up come up to the next room and they come into the bathroom and they 're having a look at their toothbrushes and she do their thinking looks a bit strange that picks up his toothbrush he 's not sure he 's okay he takes his and then baby Ben comes along he picks up his toothbrush he 's looks okay so he lost the sandwich his toothbrush looks okay then mom comes in and she 's picked up her toothbrush and she 's like I think someone 's been using this great that you 're brushing your teeth but not Brendan used my toothbrush but she holds it you guys tell the others guys someone 's been using my stuff so all the chatting and they 're working at trying to work out what on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away shh shh don 't say guys can 't hear that I was like I think that 's coming from the bedroom baby they said well let 's go find out and say off they won that they won huh and they come across a girl sleeping in the bed excuse me excuse me excuse me what are you doing and she jumps out of bed runs away and disappears and put mum and dad and baby I left wondering what on earth has happened and why and it 's been a strange girl lifting their house and that 's in a story so as you can see um yeah using some items around the home you can adjust stories as you like you know it 's a little bit of fun get the children involved get them to be one character while you 're another character change things up get them to guess what comes next in the story and that can be the benefit of using stories that the children are already familiar with because they 're already pre-empting and they 're thinking and using those prediction skills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um you know children that are younger than preschool age they 're not you know overly great with their verbal skills or they may not yet have those story recognitions but again just talking through the story using their time using your teddies to come in and do little bits and pieces can be a really fun way to bond and even if it is just sitting them on your lap and saying oh look Teddy 's got a tone and then grabbing your child 's total then look Teddy 's got a hand in grabbing your child 's hand and look to each handle Teddy 's touching his head can you touch your head and why are you doing it you 're you know teaching them heads hands feet names of things you can do the same with colours different objects so although you know sometimes you may feel a little bit silly it is a really cheap and easy fantastic way to spend that bit of extra value-added time with your children the end of the day we 're all spending a bit more time at home anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rewarding as we can so yeah thank you for joining me for that one other or the last thing that I 'd like to cover off this week you know we are have been home a bit children would be hearing a lot about washing your hands and taking care of your personal hygiene so I thought I might just run through a quick tutorial on hand-washing this is what has I suppose is what he 's recommended making sure that you are at least seconds washing your hands and they 're just ah so six steps that you go through to make sure that every steps of your hands are washed thoroughly so I thought I might do just a basic little example for you today now I 've got straining so you can just use a regular block of soup as well it 's just what we 've had around and then yeah some paper towel just making sure that you 're able to draw your hands tightly while I and washing I 'm going to pop on another song that it 's just about hygiene in general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can have the link to these songs you know you know I 'm not so you need to play it while you 're washing your hands but they 're just little songs you can have you can compile and have playing around the home just for something for a bit different and they 're a little bit educational so that 's always good too but I will give you the quick demonstrate I 'll give you the demonstration and then yeah it 's a good way to practice and make sure that the children are getting all the centres on their hands to be completely clean jewelry launches on first [Music] together [Music] [Music] they drive power so if you do it nice and slow and using your six actions that you might like to only take you over half the 20 seconds to make sure that the side is able to dissolve any gems and marks as much [Music],"(-36.7142554, 142.2016929)"

Playgroup,wAwM432Y0-0,20200504,466.789,"Roberts Ave, Horsham VIC 3400, Australia",1288,hi everyone thank you for joining me again for our virtual playgroups today we 're going to do just a couple of simple activities that you can do at home with the children or the children if they 're little bit older might be able to do themselves what we 'll be doing as well is popping and the links up on the page so for anything like this we 'll be able to provide a link to it so you 'll be able to print it off at home and do it at home or of course something like this a little face you might be able to draw the outline feature in and they can fill the rest in so this activity is in line with the dental health information that I delivered yesterday and it 's just a simple one which is basically you know asking the children to draw them is small so draw a self-portrait but sometimes they might struggle a little bit if you said draw a picture of yourself but they may not know what to do you might end up with lovely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the challenge that you 've said so I found one of the really good ways is that you ask them okay goddess draw me some eyes now this is laminated you could have printed off and laminated if you have those abilities or of course just give them some pencils and they 'll be able to draw it as you go but the beauty of it being on a whiteboard is that you can wipe it out and they can continue to use the same one over and over again so it 's a nice simple activity where draw me some eyes okay great draw me a nose threw me your beautiful smile et 's Mary and then you can the tunic or draw whatever they like but it 's just an ability to be able to I suppose picture themselves and again promoting that you know look at your lovely look at your lovely smile how could we make it better let 's go brush your teeth when should be brushing so happy those conversations about you know we really really like it when you smile the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you brush your teeth and having those conversations where you 're not telling the children what to do you 're just saying oh you know and getting them to think about things you know please colors do some ears we could do some hair I feel like on my days off my hair looks a little bit all over the place but yeah but you don 't really like this one and it 's one of you can pop up on the fridge or you know you gather to do multiple ones I 'm going to do a sleeping face I could do all sorts of different face maybe they can draw you know how to park or some of them everything they could do a whole range of family faces so that 's a nice little simple activity as I said we 'll pop the link up for that one but it 's a nicer one to easily those discussions about talking about a dental health another nice easy one that we 've got it 's called create a monster and again a handy little printable and it comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be cut out and again glue stick cut them out and glue them down um for us with obviously they don 't eliminate this one so that we can reuse them but yeah the children could absolutely make their individual ones if they 're a little bit younger you might need to help them with the cutting out if they are oh they 'll be able to do it themselves you know which builds up on their fine motor skills and a little bit of time spent concentrating on that and hopefully letting you guys get out what you need to do as parents so yeah there 's a few different different templates but we use the pepper once we create a monster and then you 've got your little pieces so this one he 's got a mouth and the beauty fat from being monsters is that again they 're not representative of something in real life then children aren 't thinking it has to be perfect or struggling to make sure that they 've got the eyes the nose and the mouth the monster can be anything you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can have four eyes you can have a mouth on its hand you can have all eyes on its feet and once they can be whatever the child wants it to be there 's no right or wrong answer so that is really fantastic particularly in these times when children are feeling you know they might be a little bit out of sorts feeling a little bit under pressure or worried about what 's going on in the world these are the nice activity that can keep them occupied at the same time there 's no right or wrong answer so they can do as they like so he 's a happy little fellow and we 'll be able to provide links in this activity so it 's a nice little easy one as well my final quick activity that I 've put together for this week is it 's a story and a song so it 's a song and with it comes a little book so the songs really catchy which is awesome so you can compile some of those

Playgroup,43rxmpw_Bgk,20200504,537.23,"Roberts Ave, Horsham VIC 3400, Australia",1547,hi everybody thanks for tuning to our first virtual playgroup session as part of these services will be delivering while we 're practicing our social distancing over the next few months what we 're hoping to do each week is deliver a little bit of information so some content for families parents children some songs or some activities a book just a different few bits and pieces that you can tune in and engage with while we are spending some extra time with our families so this week 's theme is dental health and I thought I 'd start with running through a bit of information about how looking after children 's baby teeth can be just as important and set the good habits for looking after the adult teeth that come next so different health Victoria has given us some information on how baby teeth count to and how there 's some easy ways that we can work on looking after our baby teeth so first point baby teeth are important as I was saying the habits that the true we help the children build to look after their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set of teeth and another tip that even I didn 't know as first-time parent was take care of baby see as soon as they appear so that can mean once your first couple of teeth come through just rubbing them with a wet face washer over the tooth can help and obviously as they get older building up to using a toothbrush up until 18 months of age they only need water on the toothbrush and it 's more about getting them used to the sensation of everything their mouths getting in there you know helping them brush all their teeth and just that feeling and sensation but yes absolutely it 's never too early to start so we 're getting used to teeth brushing and looking after them else this is a classic tip so brushing your teeth twice a day after breakfast and before bed and I guess those points are obviously once you 've eaten you 're trying to brush your teeth so that any residue from your meals and drink have been washed away before you spending a long time you know either having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's one that we already familiar with no doubt so how to brush the sort of four simple steps of this and to give you a bit of a demonstration I 've got my wonderful friends here he is a wonderful wonderful have fun and it 's really really good at opening up wide and listening to my instructions so he 's a little diver my friend and there are four steps so the guide says tiny circles around every tooth then you go back and forth over the tops of your teeth do the outside of your teeth and then the inside so and the fourth step is that when you 're finished spit out the toothpaste but don 't rinse and the tip behind that is that any leftover toothpaste in your mouth with the fluoride will actually help protect your teeth a little bit but we will do a little demonstration with my friend here okay so tiny circles along every tooth so starting at the back and it literally is just doing the circular motion from the top gun down to the bottom go and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the front watches come there and then around to the other side okay and they can be nice and slow there 's no rush you know in the slow the better you 're trying to contact every service as much as you can back and forth so once your open your mouths back it 's on the tops of your teeth back and forth on your bottom teeth and also on the tops and again for your children particularly young guys it 's gonna take a little bit of time for them to get used to it but it 's all about getting them used to it and doing it often dental health Victoria also advised that children up to about the age of 7 probably need how brushing their teeth so even once they into primary school just taking that time to make sure that they 're practicing the right techniques which will save you less time of the dancers hopefully and then step three so you 've done your outside now you need to do the inside which is not as easy obviously getting right here opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth going in and then after that obviously spitting out the toothpaste and then yeah you 're pretty much done so it is a process that is yeah it 's not going to be a quick one and again it 's all about familiarizing your children with the process and the more they 're familiar and the more comfortable that they are hopefully they will begin to enjoy it and obviously be more excited about doing it themselves as they get around um couple of final tips obviously so limiting fruit juice and sugary drinks we often think fruit juice arts fruit it 's good for you you know good for you have unfortunately fruit has natural sugar and it 's sort of naturally acidic as well so well it 's a better option than say a soft drink that acidity and the natural sugar can actually wear into tooth is well so obviously where possible plain milk and water and I suppose these are things that if they are going to have sugary drinks or they are going to have a juice they 're also things to consider well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brushing your teeth after dinner so it 's not remaining on the teeth to tap into the enamel and again combine with that is reducing your sugary snacks so sort of thing again you know the sugar seating their gums it sits in there may have been attacks your enamel and I mean just for general health obviously that 's one of one of our aims oh yes so yeah again highlighting that water a milk as much as possible if you can get your children onto you know drinking though she 's doing pretty well and one of the final tips which is for more families with younger children is that dentists recommend not putting baby to bed with our bottle and again that 's more because when they 're laying down with a bottle there the milk remains in their mouth so overnight where their mouth is still sort of filled with this milk residue it 's attacking the baby teeth so recommendations are teaching bug to use a cup from about six months of age I 've heard but yes so or you know even sitting up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know once they hit that 's five months of age considering you know water as an alternative again if it 's all you know transitioning on two different comforters that one is something that can be a little bit more tricky and probably something that your maternal health Nexus would have a little bit more advice on but yes so just in general trying to avoid laying down and spending lots of time with fluids in the mouth so yeah and again that 's something that I suppose while we 're at home it would a bit more time perhaps we can take it up for any of our families with younger children babies are really really keen to have a go and obviously mimikatz so if they 've been watching us using pups that are usually pretty excited where potentially not as excited about the water going in with but little bits of water in the bottom of the cup and building up and that can be you know a good way to start off and then yeah obviously choosing foods that are calcium rich and just good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrot sticks and salary ' really good anthe teeth and then you know you 've got your fruit sandwiches and dairy products not only good for your body but also help to you know build strong teeth so dairy is always yeah a really good way to go but yes there are main tips on dental health for younger children but yeah obviously getting them involved give them a toothbrush early let them have a go with their little bit younger let them have a tried without toothpaste bit of water and getting in there and having it go they might be able to have a TV that they might like to practice on again it 's all about normalizing you know these things and if they get used to it from an early age it makes it easier for us to continue with it as adults,"(-36.7142554, 142.2016929)"

project the youth can project is part of the Vic health alcohol cultural change initiative we 're one of nine projects in Victoria that received funding from Vic health to participate in the initiative young people aren 't all receiving the same messaging with regards to alcohol education so to to schools in Horsham have actually implemented a new curriculum which is the same in both schools just to sort of try and rectify this issue that young people aren 't getting the same message in another issue we found during stage one was that most young people told us that the alcohol is being supplied by their parents or older siblings I think a lot of parents think that they 're doing the right thing by giving their child alcohol so they know how much they 're drinking but there 's been a lot of research done about this and all of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents are actually more at risk of harm and dependents later in life so the purpose of the students working with full-on theater is to actually create a video to inform parents about how they see the culture and how they feel about drinking alcohol the theme of this activity is that it 's okay to say no and this applies to young people saying no to drinking alcohol as well as parents banding together and actually saying to each other it 's actually okay for us to say no to our children and we don 't have to supply them with alcohol my name 's Dave Weston and I work with film theatre any Minturn invited us to come up to ocean to work with a group of young people primarily through theatrical mean so we did some workshops bunch of you nines Andy rates quite large numbers we explored alcohol content good things very dangerous things the embarrassing things that come from drinking and drinking underage but also reflecting on on parents and parents behavior and the culture of alcohol in awesome capital consumption I guess we got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long-term relationship with the city of portion and we got a bankful saying ìlook we 're really interested to explore the nature of alcohol use in our region so we did a bit of research in the early days and we found that there were some significantly alarming findings in terms of the population in general and that alcohol use was really very much higher than on the metropolitan norm we made the decision in consultation with a group of agencies and with the real city portion to explore what were the issues from the perspective of young people so we undertook a research study speaking to the young people and seeking just get their perspective and what they found we found was that not only were they aware that it was an issue they also found made it very clear it was an issue they wanted a voice in they wanted to actually explore what can we do so we spent a number of months trying getting their voices heard hearing their narrative and the story they told us was that there wasn 't a lot to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one small proportion of whatever component of the issue but the big issue for them was that they felt that the message wasn 't getting out that someone needed to give the message that it was okay to say no they had great ideas about let 's get the message out let 's actually be the ones that spread the voice and say it 's okay to say no and we understand that there 's an issue we want parents to know what the message is for us and the message that we 're getting and we want parents to know for us from where we stand and how would like things to be done differently and it 's really hard sometimes to talk about parents about what we 're experiencing and we 'd like to use CHR to do that we 'd like to you have games to do that we 'd like to tell a story in different ways and so I guess that was the birth of the whole project this your marijuana joke a joke I reckon I go to the country in a minute look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunroom we drinking woody oh yeah but they wouldn 't exits pipes you can fall out anyway what types of wax the back you know like a log truck Jeremy might be are not yes [Music] like crystal missing head up yeah [Music] [Music] again my drug to more beer sponsored by beer if you want to be arrested at a young age drink alcohol alcohol leads to bad decisions yes I have felt peer pressure to drink and yeah a lot of the times I probably do fall for that peer pressure but now when I 'm a bit older I 've kind of settled down a bit and realized that you don 't have to drink to have a good times I have felt pressure to drink I feel like it 's just a thing we do is just society these days you just you have to drink give it 's a potty you have to hop to have a drink like it 's just part of the culture I guess some people find and get alcohol from their parents I think the main source of alcohol for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know my parents supply most of it so they know what I 'm drinking probably from the shops or from their parents I think teenagers must to get alcohol from the pair it 's June you just get alcohol from their parents I feel like teenagers drink nowadays from peer pressure from friends that drink they drink to fit in they feel like they have to to enjoy themselves but yeah I feel like a lot of it nowadays is because they 're made to doing it so it 's a lot of peer pressure sort of so I think teenagers drink for a lot of different reasons some are just going through a lot on a break there 's a lot of peer that goes on I think teenagers drink because they want to experience what else do just having fun and going out having a drink again you know if they 're having a rough time they 're most likely you know just go to alcohol because it just makes them feel better or I can 't say no to the streets like get their mind off things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you don 't need alcohol to have a good time so if you 're honest I think it 's getting worse the alcohol culture in Horsham yeah it 's and it is sad to say that but I think that kids are getting younger and younger that are starting to drink and drinking a lot like not just a couple of drinks alcohol culture in Horsham is it 's pretty bad I know there 's a lot of really young kids that are going out like every weekend you see it all over social media it 's not hidden right they just put it out there and it can get pretty out of hand sometimes and it 's just stupid really bad whole culture and Horsham is it 's pretty bad you know kids just even in me a seven they just they start drinking they start having gathers and it 's just it 's really bad and this hopefully doesn 't get worse and it gets better the culture needs to be improved it 's turning really bad kids are starting to drink at a younger age so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's the best way to party and everything yes I I feel if someone 's like really in your face drunk that yeah I feel a bit uncomfortable and really get a bit agitated and trying to get a bit angry with them but I guess yeah they 're drunk you just got I can 't understand that sometimes they 're not thinking straight so I think I can control myself sir um around people drinking alcohol I do feel comfortable it 's just at the point where they 're really off their face and they start to get like I 've been around abusive drunks and that and yeah that 's not a fun experience to be but yeah everyone just people drinking in general it 's okay just it 's when that pushes that limit and you do get smashed that it can feel pretty uncomfortable that I feel like you could change the alcohol culture in Ocean probably by promoting the I know we already promoted a lot but promoting this series serious dangers of drinking at a young age and what it can do to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be 16 and drinking you probably think oh it 's only two years it could make the difference but even I know some people that don 't drink till they 're 18 and you just think of the amount of times that they 've still enjoyed themselves and yeah I think promoting that you can still go out and have a good time and you don 't have to be absolutely smashed and all that sort of stuff like you don 't have to drink to have a good time so I think we need to promote that more in maybe having events like yeah like freezers that don 't you don 't have any alcohol at all no yeah so stuff like that and having more events in town like that instead of having bus parties like we always have and you just go a little pilot can get smash like yeah I think we need to have more events that are alcohol-free to show kids that you can have a good time without drinking so yeah I think we could change their culture in portion is just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letting all the kids know that you don 't have to drink to have fun spreading the word and saying you don 't have to drink alcohol all the time it 's you can just have fun without alcohol it 's starting to turn ridiculous that everyone 's starting to drink engage [Music] you,"(-36.7142554, 142.2016929)"

Harrison and our CEO and I could think you can see you know pencil Clark it 's a it 's a difficult one that gives register and how delicate it is and that 's what in the policy it picks up that you know you go along to a meeting or the guest of a mediator an employment service club or a group and they presented with a crochet bookmark and someone 's done we pose you flowers and they picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their meeting and it is really difficult to say no to those sort of personal needs they 're smaller things and I 've got two cups at home that I bring to the soap bunch of retirees and if their energy and they paid 20 but all these things that out when we need to do there 's a perception to the community and the male notice that goes out between this function to say what because you 're quieter than their I know that I 'm talked about now it 's an American policy and that might say well signor amazing and for anyone who is stepping up in the best position to understand it know it 's possible you need to refuse to let them know that they 're not accepting its anymore so I think that 's really important it also acknowledges in the policy that for example when a Chinese delegation come here but out of here to visit us is part of their culture to give a gift and it recognizes that but it also recognized so close gives me to be handed over they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a recognition in the era that it 's not an easy easy thing to bring out the delicate parts of gift-giving and how important that is to some groups and some ecologist so I think the policy is very broad and understands and what we can encounter as catalyst and thank you cancel clock are there any speakers against the motion any other speakers councillor Robinson thank you Thank You mr. mayor support exactly what 's been said in haven 't having worked in an area where these sort of subjects come up the having clear policy is what protects us a clear set of rules which I think we 've got with councillor grimble 's addition the death doesn 't make you matter the value really so omits the circumstances of the receipt or the giving recorded thing they can be never send them that 's another story for that one Thank You councillor almost any other speakers um can I also add I 'll see my line there is sometimes a line you 've got a walk between accepting people 's gracious gift and not wanting to offend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of people doing the wrong thing and so it 's important that we do follow the rules and what 's proposed it seems fair enough and I 'm happy with the addition as well for from a given point of view I 'll put the motion who was in favor against that scary thank you nine point three is council resolutions the purpose of this report is to provide an update on outstanding and completed council resolutions with a recommendation their counselors moved by Councillor clock thank you seconded by Councillor Koenig canceled Paige okay Thank You Chancellor Koenig no thank you mister man are there any speakers against the motion any other speakers counsel 's office like to pick up one of the items mentioned was dates back to the 5th of February this year 10 5 2 and it talks about the city gardens estate and the reason I just wanted to mention is that we were working here this week and was very encouraging to see the water birds the water was there full up water birds including a couple of pelicans there and it did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so there and it 's an example of a petition people in our community highlight an issue and council working with the community to solve it and certainly seen the city gardens the state this week was reencountering I 'll put the motion all those in favor against that 's carried thank you item nine point four is request for inclusion on councils street name lists for the name ace but the purpose of this report is to request that the name AIDS would be added to the council 's street naming lists the recommendation there has been moved by councillor Galvin and seconded by Councillor Koenig council Galvan it was just to do with the recognition that we have within our community people wanting to put their names and recognize people in their families and having their names come forth it 's just showing that our community is one that people wanna be a part of and I think that 's a great thing thank you Quetzal Koenig Thank You Samantha I just lost the stories behind all of these requested comic strips and he 's another good one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I don 't know Manik any speakers against the motion and you have a speaker 's council clock [Music] these have oceans developed and wonderful characters and that wonderful history of how they developed from having you know more strong to our first little truck them and gradually building up to earning so many vehicles and bus lines and so yeah already having to miss to go through interesting it 's wonderful to hear these stories and to see them and each time I 'm really impressed by the history of this town thank you cancel clock Hannibal what 's on next economies that he said he 's waiting walk but economic cited at some I thank you across the Hudson River School Bus [Music] cinnamon big kind of that seemed possible and that relationship with the ice the guys and continued on so far as we know so that be serious emotion appreciated he said possibly know the homeless of these really advise particular individual actually had worked on doing successful walk one was on we 're also supposed to read that from mistaken of doing welcome to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You counselor girl any other speakers also it also acknowledged the life of mr. eyes but and it did prompt me to go into the Lambs room last night and dig out the Horsham street name book we have one and it dates from the 1840s through to 1998 and sadly the lady who put it together actually passed away before it was published and the Horsham Historical Society picked up the book and published it two years later but it was about twenty years out-of-date mr. Bhalla so it might be something that counselor might consider doing it is a fascinating read about you know every street you can look around barnes boulevard Roberts Avenue they 're all there including little street names a couple of which is spelt wrong and interesting little quirks in history so there might be something we might look at but I 'm happy to support the motion tonight I 'll put that motion always in favor against that 's carried thank you we move now to item nine point five which is the revocation of the instrument of delegation for the Horseman college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to revoke the issue of delegation for the Horsham college community Havel and community management and transition the community of management into a user 's group forum okay recommendation there councillors she 's been moved by councillor Clark and seconded well I cancel the power that 's what Clark excuse me because responsibility is so huge so counsel they 've gone through all of these we 've found those that do need to be a section 86 let 's not make happen where to actually break them in management or yeah like this takes away that owner 's responsibility and makes a lot easier than those communities Thank You councillor cancel the power thank you are there any speakers against the motion any other speakers cancel Grimble clarification just particular in the wording of the second dot point where it says transition of the committee management to and out shows required user group I 'm assuming that they animate regular as all would expect that would be the wording actually just is a little bit some in different the other one says that we do new continue making sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part of that group in that community they 're doing as best they can and just need to make sure that we are still there 's more than which I 'm sure it is it yeah yeah this figures I just wanted to comment on this actual project it you know seemed to want to do a timeline of how that that block of land has changed in the last ten years the the greening of it we were able to get some water to water it the plumbing of it the lights and then the addition of the former restaurant has made it a fantastic facility for our community and it 's greener but it 's been a great partnership of between the school involving that the state government at a higher level but also council from all those days back to when it was it was just a dry patch of dirt effectively with very ordinary rooms and so I think it 's a great story and this is that this is all part of it so I 'm happy to support tonight 's motion I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thank You mr. Harrison yes mr. mayor I believe we 've currently got for section 86 committees we don 't have to change them it 's entirely up to us whether we maintain those committees this stage this was for free yep okay thank you mr. Sheehan Thank You councilmember I 'll put the motion was in favor against that scary thank you we move now to item 9.6 the 2017 21 health and well-being plan and your update for 2018 the purpose of this report is to provide an update on the annual review of the 2017 to 21 health and well-being plan and also to seek approval to notify Department of Health and Human Services of the review completion its recommendation their councils which has been moved by Councillor Galvan and seconded by Councillor Koenig council Golan thank you mister is happy to support the recommendation of these the work that 's being done to get this help me Plan Update is greatly appreciated and it 's a benefit to a society thank you take your counselor counselor kidding thank you mister man just done it 's worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of work went into that used to show the GPA a lot of people including these which is the most exciting bit about it so that 's exciting but also into into the next year this and really good projects and there 's some really good focus points that everyone can read at their own leisure but it 's exciting to see how this develops and put it to the team that 's behind it and Michelle Rekluse is back on board too I 'm just happy to see it at this point thank you who do you think you can slip any any speakers against the motion any other speakers councillor Roberts Thank You mr. mayor I certainly agree with the previous speakers I just want to note I think the significant challenge was revolves around the cultural and behavioral change particularly when we 're talking about alcohol and well healthy eating as well as nation that seems significant challenges there and if anyone comes up with some great ideas well the rest of the world will be working on us but for the solution they say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's very easy task but certainly commend everyone for their efforts I counsel group the terminology of the recommendation provided captain I notice that we 've got a sexy requirement to to conduct an enemy review I just wonder why we 're not actually endorsing in your view and improving the letter so again I 'm not really sure around the terminology of noting some of these documents that come from counsel rather than dorsum so that 's weird question that some question in my interpretation around um what probably would be a stronger wording in the recommendation so okay thank you cancel Grimm okay mr. burrowing through basically counselors time to take the in review process so in this case the review has been undertaken then we want to cancel tonight that reviews been undertaken and communicate that through DHHS okay and so what we 're doing tonight is approving the later to DHS insect yes thank you mr. brownie through the questions guess again different when endorsing native to my way of thinking this is a surgical event and endorsing something actually gives councils brothers with stamp of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contents and then approving a letter to DHHS so it 's really around my interpretation of the recommendation of what it means somebody firstly I just mr. Bell hasn 't come in yet for you mr. mayor and the there 's no we 're not actually seeking any direction from Council only on this plan because the plans only been implemented so there 's no action there are a lot of the recommendation and hence the reason and are we saying council just needs to Norton and then the second one is of course the action you know that 's where Council is specifically approving it [Music] okay thank you yeah no that 's fine okay thank you any other speakers councillor Clark engaging a community [Music] Sylvie 's up-to-date information but Kohinoor children 's house so that was off you went through two kindred children staying shoot alcohol to change project so you will be yet from birth today and all in between the services to their well-being is very important new true yes Thank You councillor Clark any other speakers counselor okay Thank You cathegory mr. O @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director was first launched probably got 12 months ago we actually did high level information through maybe relational say there was a small cards developed and which would basically have been through a range of recreation community groups we provide them through that aspect also as part of the field days it 's on display as well and save also the community groups that are on my committee directory getting constant quote regular emails as well to remind them update their information to make their services not only what they Levani their clubs in organized I explore any offense that running as well so these is all my information and might be directories on the front page of the council website as well so but basically we have targeted through nice particularly business cards to all those organizations because it 's something that a lot of people are interested in when they actually know about it but mr. Berlin mr. yes certainly in case officers to be super nice and to that Michael newsletter or through the London a pictorial regular document sure that kids coming through that Miss O @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it a viable in a high copy if someone wants one yes the hard copy is available and they 're hard copies updated each night on PDF so if you update your club information there we can produce a hard copy or not which just gives us the ones information so it 's available at the Civic Center thank you thank you okay any yeah I think it rivers had a turn I 'll put the motion all those in favor against that 's carry thank you we move now to the nine point seven which is the 2013 216 disability access and action plan review the purpose of this report is to provide an update on the review of the disability access and action plan 2013 16 the recommendation here to note the review moved by Councillor Clark thank you and seconded by councillor Robinson thank you council clock this is a very important because mystery for me I 'm quite passionate it 's really important that we constantly review how we 're doing as a council in supporting people disabilities there because they can happen to anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability and to line fault someone and send them up the street to say that cut was quite interesting put someone in a wheelchair and see how they get around it 's really interesting so any one of us would have a car accident so this is not for someone else this is for the whole community because this can happen to anyone at any time so we must make sure that we are providing proper services a community that is accessible and I think one of the big things that we achieved this last year is the changing places toilet which was a really huge outcome to this community for people passing through you need the opportunity to travel where before this is something people could not travel each other away from the lady so I think this is a very great pick against the clock Chelsea Robertson Thank You mr. mayor I certainly endorse the comments of a councillor Clark but just like to add just just a couple of points we 've seen with increased mobility of people who are disabled increased use of Gophers and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking beyond just one go for the two as they go past and big roads already turned them on to that the second point is footpaths and just like to make it possible for where mr. Martin mr. O 'Brien that comment we 've had a couple of fairly serious injuries of people who have tripped on footpaths I know we don 't have enough money to do everything we want to do with footpaths I think we currently highlight with yellow paint the problems but I do know work is occurring to to minimize these issues and one of the two directors might like to comment on where we represent which i think is very very important particularly when you get someone who is a bit frail they might be old but they fryer and don 't trip on one of their footpath raised sections and it 's difficult because of air moving soils and ultimately end up in an ambulance in intensive care thank you thank you listen mr. Martin toxically yes thanks mr. mee as indicated and we had a public questions some months ago we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposing for PCs budget process and we will advance now with the dystopian out of that project and the size of it and the challenge will be whether we can afford to do all the works in one year or in two but the intent is to do a catch up on all the tremendous I could do that reading this question to a better stand and so that even with washing soils hopefully we get this moving in the future but will suddenly come for cancellous in this year 's budget process Thank You mr. Martin thank you any other sorry any council speaking against the motion there any other speakers that 's the case I 'll put the motion all those in favor against that 's carried thank you part of knowing point eight the Evans way with land petition the purpose of this report is to consider a petition received in relation to a wetland adjacent to the southern end of evidence way in brackets in South Bank the recommendation that counsel note the action is proposed in response to the residents petition in relation to wetland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing do it quick um do you can start I 've thank you councils we have a recommendation there to note the actions proposed someone wants to move that okay so we 'll take there 's a question first mr.

Martin on script me from wrong here so basically the thing I learned on the weekend that for one kilometer of road to be constructed it costs two hundred ninety one thousand dollars and I think that 's a lot of money but it makes you realize is I so my question was is this road unique in any way or what is that is that pretty much a good rule of thumb mystery I suppose the key thing about this money to serve as you line construction we do build some lane roads to assume the land construction so it does depend to some extent on the standard of construction that it 's relatively routine sitting the road I 'd say yeah Thank You mr. language it just highlights when we talk about road construction and the budget time and it makes you realize that 300 green doesn 't go far but so anyway that 's what it is thank you I 'll move the certainly can scramble the questions is surround the process of having our maiden council also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a young it 's a useful boundary and they 've got some symmetries in this tender as well that 's just a comment from the director mr. mayor listen you 've had the report in effect Washington area effect take turns and doing upgrades and absolutey thing worth noting from this one is that the OEM gap was out retract the funding on this occasion a ratio of 2 to 1 whereas hoarse from being original city was eligible for 1.1 so it 's a the in some good a good collaboration to get the finest the situation Thank You Christian thank you I 'll put the motion all those in favor against that 's Karen thank you we move now to item 10 which is counselor reports and acknowledgments don 't have someone employees move that we suspend the Standing Orders section which is council Clark and second of all council of power all those in favor it 's Carrie so reports in acknowledgment its we 've got a little bit of time so I 'm happy to trick around the table they create an opportunity for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an opportunity Fenny one else wants to say anything as well so councillor golden did you want to say anything [Music] appreciation on from you for attending the 7th December the Holy Trinity Lutheran College and coming to speak to the students within my class about leadership and the importance of being a good leader and serving others so [Music] just congratulations guys they 're actually doing it 's a community think you cancel power councillor Robinson okay Elsa clinic no shell so good not by their respective treaty since it 's at last council meeting just to express more yet Christmas wishes to everyone the municipality and them which they 've done that 's travel nano-sized travel but very clearly that Christmas song for a lot of people is to Tom to your syllabi we 're family in France but that 's always a tie straight run so we should just look like something with a not became force and circumstances and as you know there 's old fellow a big size two persons on a lot of people doing Christmas farm so I think that 's it you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single or line of your don 't have the level of family support that many was to share I think it 's important we could reflect that it 's not something he said he could talk but not further on come on the final thing I wanted to acknowledge that was talking to dollars history letters the Buffalo fan who live Butler was I when we thought that 's when the spirit was too violent nothing would be appropriate council actually acknowledged CC 'ing service in the usual way but he 's family still farm at a drum and he served the women shot between the a one turn between 1988 to 1990 so it 's again that condolence to the mother for me and technologies the city leadership and service highlighted to the council but through his food time through his public life in the end the district Warriors brought up soda in a motor port okay Thank You council members it 's two things I wanted to mention just picking a couple things out of my report it was really important for the original means to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week and it was a regret sharing time and we have a a real breadth of experience so certainly councilor Carolyn from Bulldog shires our first years of mayor and a counselor Kevin from the northern Grampian Shaw is his fifth term as mayor and so there was a great opportunity for the share of different ideas about what 's happening in our patch but also lessons we can learn from each other and one of the things to come out of it was they came for us us when I say us Horsham perhaps organize and counselor training so we 're going to contact the MA vo or someone similar to do some they were just a conflict of interest training that would feel find that a value and so that was a worthwhile thing and I did note it 's not in here but also our original CEOs get together in a similar way on a regular basis so I think that 's good to just sort of have that relationship nothing I wanted to mention was the very last point on my report was about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the South Australian government pulled their funding which was just over 300,000 if their share of the funding if you like currently prior to that happening our own state government sponsors the Overland and it 's done for a while to the tune of over three million dollars and so what happened last week the state government agreed to kick in another 200 and the balance which 130 was actually kicked in by Great Southern rail themselves and the reason I know that is because I rang them up during the week and and the lady explained to me what had happened the reason I rang them you might be interested to know that they and I are going to do some signs we 're going to catch the Overland to Adelaide as part of our holidays and just see what it 's like and so we went up to them and spoke to Roger the master up here and to talk about some tickets and what it might cost this stuff it was interesting that he has has no timetables or no brochures about the Overland and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston said what have you got to be the Overland you know we don 't have anything and I thought hang on a sec the Overland creates an opportunity it creates the opportunity for people in the wimmer are to go to a delayed or to Melbourne okay come back and also creates people in Melbourne to come to the Wimmer and also in Adelaide to come for the Wimmer so I rang up the the GSA and ladies Tiffany was very helpful but she said and I want to get it quite wrong but I 'm pretty sure interpreted that the way they view the Overland is a commuter train from Melbourne to Adelaide and so we had this discussion about well I might be a little bit more opportunity there to explore about how ways we can help each other out and so we 're getting too excited we 're going to catch the train and see what it 's like so I 'll keep you informed on how that goes but we did we did send a note to the premier acknowledging if their ongoing support for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do give me some statistics we have to have local residents who catch the train both ways most of the time they 'll go to Melbourne but there are quite a few people who do catch it the other way it 's all in it okay and also pick up a councillor grimble 's comment we certainly want to wish the community all the best for the Christmas season and encourage people to take it easy on those busy roads okay can I have someone move is pleased that we resume standing orders which is being removed moved by Councillor power and seconded by councillor Clark all those in favor against that 's carried thank you and we also have to move that we receive those reports so that 's about once again move my counselor power and signal council Clark or as in favor that 's Carrie thank you item 11 is urgent business has done listed item 12 is petitioners and joint letters before so there was not listed we move now to item 13 which is the procedural business item 13 one is the assembly of councillors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to receive and note the Assembly of Council of minutes for the council briefings meetings held on the 3rd of December and the 10th of December I don 't know 13.2 is the sealing of documents and the purpose of that is to receive a note the sealing of the following document which is the elite license with the cafe by the river and there 's a recommendation there counselors that council receives and notes the following agenda items 31 an assembly of counselors and 13 to sealing the documents someone wants to move that for council o 'clock and someone wants a

today we 're focusing on stretching we 're going to be starting with the upper body uh one thing that we need to stretch a lot let 's see that the desk is the neck and shoulders so we 're going to start in the next stretch where we place one hand underneath your chair you take the other hand overhead pull the head to the side and hold so this is holding that shoulder down stopping it from following your after 10 seconds of that what we 're going to do is we 're going to let the chin gently drop towards the chest and you 'll feel that a little bit higher up in the neck and 10 seconds after that we lift and now i 'm going to turn my head and look over that set shoulder so i 'm rotating you couldn 't even see that tension through there and that 's the muscle one stretching it 's important with your neck stretching my ears out of the jacket so i don 't just straighten up i just return back now ease myself out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down hold for 10 seconds you can hold for up to 20 or 30 seconds each of these after 10 seconds and gently drop the chin down so i 'm feeling a little higher up in the neck then i lift the chin rotate so i 'm looking over that set shoulder up towards the ceiling gentle release and then we 're going to just have a total back stretch in top of the fingers we can turn them out if you can 't do that we can come up overhead but we turn up and we stretch and reach bring one hand down to the side lock that in under the chair and we bend and reach across from curving through my torso straighten back up transition through the middle grab the other side bend and reach now we 're going to do a bit of a thoracic or upper back open i 'm going to bring the hands up and i 'm going to lean and reach back the more i activate that stretch so it 's too much from here we 're going to go into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to place one arm on my desk and i 'm going to grab the elbow and i 'm going to turn it around as far as it goes and hold this one can be done in two directions you can rotate the other way as well and hold that position and then i can transition to the other arm so first one i 'm doing an external twist follow my internal twist and just release relax shake it over you need to and from here we 're going to move into the lower body i 'm going to go back to the seat for this and our glute medius piriformis those hips stabilize stabilizer muscles you put one foot across the opposite knee if you can 't bring that foot across just stretch the leg out if you can bring it back up so first up i 'm just going to lean forward i 'm using this hand to just gently hold that knee down then i straighten up i turn towards that knee so i 'm taking the opposite shoulder now towards that knee and you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you need to bring that knee down and then draw it up feel free to do that first i 'm going to lean forward then i 'm going to reset and rotate the box shoulder towards that knee and move on to a hip flexor stretch so if you need the wall for balance you can do that from here one foot forward another foot back and i 'm just going to lunge forward and i may need to feel the stretch up here so if i need to what i can do is i can drop that back knee so this knee is still coming behind the body and i 'm pressing forward from here and then just add a little to that stretch after about 10-15 seconds raise the opposite arm overhead you 're gonna add a little twist if you 're comfortable with that and then reset to the other side you don 't need the wall for balance you can just go into that stretch if you 're happy to self-support or you can take the knee all the way to the ground now for about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little twist if you 're ready for it following from there a cart stretch the one you see all the runners do help the park up against the fence the the key to this is that that back foot points straight forward that back heel doesn 't ground and i just drop the hip forward as far as it can go and i use the hands to take a bit of weight to take the pressure off the other leg switch sides it 's really important to be specific with our foot placement so you can make the most of the stretch and finally adductors so these internal thigh muscles we take the stance about one and a half to two shoulder widths apart this leg will remain straight i 'm going to lunge over this one push that knee out over the toes i feel that stretch down the inside of this guy here if you 're flexible you can get really low and really deep you could even get practically down to the ground if you 're not flexible just follow my lead and then we just rotate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where i 'm getting the stretch again i can go lower and i can go deeper if i choose to and that 's the longer these stretches,"(-37.9662196, 145.0574374)"

Cheltenham VIC 3192, Australia",1511,[Music] [Applause] [Music] hi my name 's veronica and i 'm part of the supporter play group team here at the city of kingston and today we 're going to be making play-doh at home play-doh can be a really fun experience to do with your child and there 's lots of different learning opportunities along the way while you 're making it there 's some maths involved when you 're counting and measuring ingredients there 's it 's a great tactile experience for children when they 're touching the play-doh and the sensory part of it there 's also a great opportunity for you to use lots of language with your child in terms of talking about the ingredients tipping and pouring and mixing all the ingredients together it 's a fantastic way for your child to use lots of small muscles in their hands while they 're kneading and poking and playing with the play-doh and it 's a great opportunity for your child to use their imagination in any way that they want to while they 're playing with the play-doh at the end after you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a lot of the ingredients in your pantry at home so it 's just some cooking salt some oil and some plain flour some cream of tartar but if you don 't have cream of tartar you can use three tablespoons of lemon juice instead some food coloring and some water i 've used the recipe that 's on the cream of tartar container with a little bit of a difference it says to cook it on the stove in a pot but i 'm just using some water from the kettle that 's been boiled so that 's the only difference there so let 's get started so we 're going to have two cups of plain flour and as i said before you can be talking to your child about measuring out the flour get them to help you to do it so we 're just going to pour some flour there and they can be tipping it in and then pop another one in there so it 's great for you to be counting along with your child so that 's number two and then we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that into there like that and they can even maybe taste some of the different ingredients they can taste what the salt is like and what the flour might be like it 's different tastes to it or feel the texture of it so that 's one cup of salt and then we have i 'm using the cream of tartar so we have four tablespoons of the cream of tartar so that 's one two three coming to the end of the container and four so that 's that 's a great little activity for them to be scooping that out and putting it in as well so now we 're just putting in two tablespoons of oil any type of cooking oil that you 've got is fine and we pop that over there and then we add our water from the kettle that 's just been boiled so this part you 'll have to do that with your child because it could be a little bit too hot i 'm going to make green play-doh today so i like to add it to the water some people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gonna pop a few drops in there to make it quite green you can make any color you like give it a bit of a bit of a stir [Music] and then we add it in and this is when you can be talking about all the the mixing and the stirring [Applause] i can see the color coming out like that mix mix mix [Applause] and this is something that you can have in in the um in a container for a couple of weeks um some people like to put it in their fridge wrapped up in clad wrap and it can keep up to three or four weeks in the fridge so once i can see that it 's coming into a bit of a a bit of a lump i can see that i don 't need to add much more of the water so i 'm going to just pop that straight onto a chopping board you can put it on the bench either way i 'm going to get my hand in there now this is the fun part this is where your child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nice and warm and gooey so we 'll stick that you know i might just add a little bit more flour it 's a little bit wet so you 'll know the consistency of it if it 's a bit wet you can just add some more flour to it there we go and just pop it out on the board like that and then we start to knead it just might add a little bit more flour to that one and the good thing is with plato too it 's all non-toxic so if little ones do end up eating it it doesn 't matter it 's not going to have any nasties in it that 's going to hurt them at all so we just keep kneading and mixing and it starts to go into the play-doh which is the fun bit so this is when your child can get right into it and have a good time mixing it around and there we go [Music] and now we can talk about some things that you can add to the play-doh well they might probably just have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play-doh cutters at home already got there 's one of a rabbit and a heart you can usually find sometimes you can get them at kmart or just the supermarket but if you don 't have any play-doh cutters you might just have like a little cookie cutter you could use or just a plastic cup that you could make some different shapes with you don 't have to have proper cutters i 've just got a potato masher that they could use to make some different shapes on the play-doh like that or some patty pans kids love to have patty pans and make little cupcakes out of the play-doh or you might even like to add just some simple straws to the play-doh and they can just use their imagination any way they want to so you can always add other things to play-doh although this is fun just using this the way it is but you might like to maybe if you 're out on a walk with your child you might find some natural materials to use so for example there 's some leaves and i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be a really interesting addition to playing with the play-doh or you might be lucky enough to live near the beach and you might find some shelves that have been washed up on the beach and that can be a lot of fun for children to add some shells to play play-doh for their to extend their play or some children might like to have um some plastic animals like some farm animals that they could use their imagination and use the play-doh with that um awesome dinosaurs is always really fun you could add some dinosaurs to the play or maybe even some some people some little people some wooden people to it or some little lego people you might have around the house that you can add to the play-doh so that 's just another way that you can extend the play-doh and the experience for your child so i was talking before about play-doh being a great sensory and tactile experience i 've just made some plain play-doh before and i 've added some rosemary to it so it gives off a really nice smell and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your child but you could add something like sage or thyme or oregano or even something like lavender because that can be quite a calming experience for your child if they 're a little bit stressed you could have lavender and they could be playing with the play-doh and it 's releasing the smells and kind of calming them down as well so that 's another way that you

3192, Australia",1589,[Music] welcome to kids yoga good morning everybody so today we are going to do some kids yoga adults feel free to join in um we 're going to do a few poses and we 're also going to do a little bit of breath work basically with the yoga practice it 's really just about moving your body in any way that you can and in any way that your body will allow you it 's really important in yoga that we honor our body and know what our body can do and what it can 't do and it 's okay if you can 't do a pose or if you feel silly doing a pose or if you fall over that 's okay too so we 're embracing all of the wobbles and that 's part of the yoga practice so we 're going to start off with a breathing exercise this is one of my favorites it 's called the bumble bee breath so i actually have a breath chart here and it works through all different types of breaths that we can do with children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or just to make us feel good so the breath that we 're going to be doing today is called the bumble bee breath so what we 're going to do is we 're going to sit in a comfortable position to start off with that might be bent on your knees or you might prefer to sit on your bottom with your legs crossed or with your legs out in front of you what we 're going to do is we 're going to take a big breath in and then what we 're going to do when we release the breath is we 're going to hum the breath out and we 're going to put our fingers very gently into our ears and i want you to see what noise you can hear all right are we ready so we 're gonna take a big deep breath in put your hands in your ears [Music] should we do it one more time big breath in hands in [Music] i don 't know what you heard but i heard lots of little buzzy bees buzzing around in between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bumblebee breath it 's pretty cool isn 't it all right let 's start off by bringing our hands into our heart space in front of our heart here and our hands are in prayer and this is called anjali mudra and we 're going to start to move our bodies together now so if you 're feeling like you want to move come along with us if not you 're welcome to stay cited in this position and then if you feel that you would like to join in please feel free to join in at any time okay so if you have a yoga mat you might like to jump on that mat now or you might just want to do it on the carpet or you might just do it on on a towel or something like that so the first position that we 're going to do is called downward facing dog so this is how we get into downward dog we 're on all fours like a doggie and we 're going to lift up on our tippy toes and push our hips right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet and your hands are very tight onto the floor nice and plugged in this position is also telling our body that i am friendly i am friendly with my body and my body is very capable of doing lots of different things but it also needs its rest so this is downward facing dog then what we 're going to do is we 're going to turn into a bit of a frog and we 're going to bend our knees as much as you can and we 're going to leap to the front of the mat are you ready one two three link like a frog very good well done now we 're going to go down on our hips like this so this is called malasana squat and you 're down in your hips like this with your arms like what we had at the very beginning in anjali mudra and you 're just going to sway your hips from side to side a bit like a windscreen wiper if you like wishing and washing to the side very good well done now we 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we 're going to leave our left foot at the back and then we 're going to reach our arms up into the sky this is warrior 1 pose and this says our body is brave and then we 're gonna move into warrior two so our arms go out to either side the front leg is nice and bent and the back leg is very strong and very straight if it can be we 're going to look to the front and this is telling us i am strong now we 're going to flip our front hand and we 're going to reverse the pose all the way over you might feel a beautiful stretch just along here on the right side of your body and this is peaceful warrior this tells us that our body is peaceful well done now we 're going to windmill our arms to the front big windmill and we 're going to turn to look to where our front foot is and then what we 're going to do is we 're going to go and try and fly like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this position is warrior 3. this position is also a big position for wobbles so are we ready to wobble we 're going to bounce up on this front leg and this leg from behind is going to go up straight up in the air now if you 're wobbling you can put your hands on the ground but if you want a bit of a challenge you can put your hands in another mudra like we had at the beginning or if you want to really try you can put your hands out in front ah it 's very tricky all right moving to tree pose now so standing up nice and straight in mountain pose tadasana nice and straight with everything nice and still and while we 're standing here nice and still i want you to try and feel your breath in your body can you feel your heart beating you might like to bring your hands to your heart 's face and feel your heart beating it 's pretty amazing how just that little bit of movement your your body is telling you that they feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is another good wobbly one so you might want to put your foot right down low here or you might bring it up to your knee or you might want to bring it all the way up to the top again just depends on what your body can do but you can also have a challenge for yourself and see if you can do it again your hands might come to anjali mudra or they might do piece fingers or they might go up in the air whichever one you feel comfortable and whichever one your body can do this is telling us that we are kind we are kind to our bodies all right are we ready now from here we 're going to put our foot down to the ground and we 're going to sweep our arms above our head and our knees are bent like we 're sitting in a chair because this position is called chair pose and this tells us that we are brave well done now for our second last pose we 're going to be superheroes so everything is going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right hand on the floor and we 're going to lift our leg left leg and our left arm up into the air this is called half moon pose also known as i 'm a superhero i feel like a superhero doing this do you well done slowly coming back all the way to your knees onto the ground well done oh we made it this is our last pose sitting on our knees again like we did at the beginning this is i am wise so we 're going to put our hands together at the heart space we 're going to take a deep breath to seal our practice together breathing in breathing out then we bow into each other to honor each other for joining in for this beautiful practice together for celebrating the traditional owners of the land who came before us and all of the teachers that came before them and before them and before them so that we could learn all of the amazing things about this practice and we bow into each other thank you for joining me today namaste [Music] you,"(-37.9662196, 145.0574374)"

conserve water within the home thanks Leah okay let 's get into this presentation I 'm going to do a quick intro before we look at growing food and buying locally acknowledge the traditional owners of this land there were unsure people of the Kulin nation and pay my respects to their elders past present and emerging I acknowledge the relationship between people and country and I acknowledge country itself our so knowledge that we 're facing the ongoing climate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working to project our health earth in the future we will succeed the presentation of design today is around four chaplains local food less waste energy and transport choices in precious water and how our individual decisions and the collective actions can lessen our impact on the environment while also building our own skills and resilience this is an image of the stunning Modula Creek to Cara Maria today we 're going to look at ways to predict such precious land and marine environments and take individual action to help reduce pollution and global heating during the health crisis Australians have done well to quickly change their behaviors and adapt to staying at home we 're protected our most vulnerable health workers and the health systems this has helped to flatten the curve in Australia one of the many positive opportunities emerging from this crisis is holding on to behaviors such as driving this flying this remote meetings growing food and having more time to do things as a result of our reduced activity there has been a drop in global carbon emissions but as we returned to our new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been increases we rebuild our economies our governments and Industry have a responsibility to choose sustainable development in rebuilding and have a better chance to flatten the global emissions curve so we can all have a safe planet as individuals we can also have an impact and we 'll talk about the rains free to do this throughout our presentation the health crisis and our fourth shutdown is being seen by many as an opportunity to rebuild with sustainable development that lessens the pollution and lasting impacts of greenhouse gases an example of this is increasing the use of renewable energy and electric vehicles whilst creating jobs in these sectors and that 's where we come in we 're here to share our knowledge about Ceres and share the tips and tricks we have learned along the way to have this minimal impact on the earth as possible let me tell you a little bit about series we 're based in France per case on a 4 hectare site reclaimed from landfill we began in 1982 and today we are thriving community organization with an organic farm many social enterprises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [Music] we hope you 've enjoyed the introduction to this presentation now I 'm going to share some tips with you I want back out through growing composting and ways to shop locally but even if you don 't grow your own food going to a farmers market or ordering a fresh food box full of local and regional produce both excellent ways to make a connection to where your food comes from and in the process you 're supporting local farmers and local businesses so let 's get into it at Ektron local food kicks off with some tips on growing food in this slider emphasize composting because if you consider compost as a multivitamin for your soil it is a foundational to healthy plant alongside the requirements of Sun and water nutrients in healthy soil are required to successfully grow food compost can help to adjust pH levels at beneficial bacteria and retain plant moisture Jersey plants suited to your local climate is another key way to have success in growing plants Australia 's climate zones from the north to the south are further differentiated at the local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help you choose plants suited to your area growing plants a certain season is important now you can purchase good quality compost but making your own from food scraps and garden clippings is free and fun here are some examples of compost and worm farm systems there are a few tips to be successful all of these systems one is adding small amounts of food scraps to start with the second is always add some shredded or toilet paper dried leaves or straw when you add food this is known as a nitrogen to carbon ratio if you add one part food the nitrogen to four parts of dried material like paper the carbon this is a wonderful ratio and will help keep your compost or worm farm in balance in addition to making your compost you can also use curbside organic bin your council provides is whichever way you go the main point is to get your food scraps and garden prunings out of your landfill bin as this creates a potent greenhouse gas called methane this slide illustrates in many ways you can grow from potatoes in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beds grow new food using organic methods has many benefits for people plants and ores and so starting with healthy soil here are many ways to support healthy plants and the insects other animal life connected to your garden there are many ways to source grow and swap food in your local and regional area but it does take an intentional a mind shift to change your shopping behaviors but growing your own food or shopping at a farmers market or buying a seasonal organic food box is a great way to start this pyramid is a simple guide to shopping locally to support sustainably focused and family-owned businesses this resource list includes community gardens in your local area cost us tips for composting and gardening supplies in your region next up we 've got a video showing one backyard food growing I hope you find this an inspiration to growing your own food [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I hope you 've enjoyed that backyard garden tiller this example shows the diversity of food that can be grown in one suburban site there are established fruit trees providing body should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's medicinal plants and animal flowers and herbs and of course there is a compost to take care of any food scraps and which only nutrients back to the soil and now from the garden to the kitchen we 're now going to share in his rationale video about making bread and observing in the process hope you enjoy [Music] [Music] see you in the morning bye [Music] you I really enjoy talking to you about growing food and ways the shots of food locally I 'll handle Italy now to talk about ways to reduce waste thanks Jane it 's going to see how we can incorporate all of those sustainable food choices into our everyday lives to create healthy people and to help the environment it also ties in perfectly with our next chapter which is of course waste chapter 2 less waste over the last couple of years it is undeniable Victoria has faced a number of different challenges around waste our old ways of exporting the problem overseas was stopped in their tracks and Australia was forced to be held accountable for its waste infrastructure or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working towards the 2030 waste issue we will see the implementation of new household waste streams reducing our waste to landfill and transforming our idea of waste into a resource within the following slides we 'll jump into a few specific waste streams some new some old to better understand why they are important and how we an individual level can utilize these to their full potential food waste recycling in Victoria around 50 percent of our garbage is made up of food and garden waste with 65% of the wasted foods still being edible that 's approximately 2,000 in food waste that is thrown away each year now some of us may already be diverting after it waste from landfill with compost bins worm farms or food digesters like jane mentioned however for those of us that do not have the time for their upkeep things just got a whole lot easier in comes your new council curbside bin with a light green lid that your council will be implementing by the end of the month this green lid will replace the dark green lid on your existing green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing for food organics and garden organics along with this you receive a plastic kitchen caddy and compostable liners that you can use to transfer all food waste from your kitchen to the curb to get mixed in with your green garden waste ready for its collection either weekly or fortnightly and when I say all food waste I really mean all from fruit and veggie scraps to meat poultry seafood and even bones and eggshells while you 're at it you can even add any cooked leftovers that have gone to waste or even dirty tissues all of these items are then transformed into further fertilizer that is sold back into the community by simply following the advice of your counsel for your photo bin you can almost half your waste to landfill and help cream sugary contribute sorry to a more sustainable waste system next up is our trusty old recycling bin the commingled waste where we can put in medium and hard grade plastics glass bottles or jars paper and cardboard as well as aluminium and steel cans I 'm sure all of what you are fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be looking a little different with the introduction by 2030 of a fourth purple it had been dedicated entirely to glass now the amazing thing about glass is that it is a hundred percent recyclable and can be recycled endlessly without losing its quality or purity the not so great news is that it is becoming more and more of a contaminant in our commingled waste stream and can be difficult and hazardous to saw since the China import ban recyclers are increasingly focused on quality and reducing contamination to maintain the value of their recyclable materials hence the introduction of your fourth bin now this purple littered bin has already been rolled out in a number of council regions around Victoria so keep an eye out for when it hits yours so until we see this purple at a lidded glass bin let 's focus on doing the best job we can with our current recycling by following a few helpful tips including separating lids from plastic bottles and glass jars collecting alfoil until it is the size of our fists and diverting soft plastics and tissues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please take a moment to read the tips listed on your screen now sadly as we spoke about before soft plastic cannot be recycled in your combing the recycling bin however all is not lost we can still dope out soft plastics from entering our landfill sites by adding an extra collection stream at home soft plastics all you have to do is collect all of your soft plastic wrappers making sure they are dry and clean in one larger plastic bag for me all plastic shopping bags work great and drop them off at any calls or Woolworths where you see collection point if you are unsure about whether or not your product is hard or soft plastic an easy way to tell is by giving it the scrunch test if it 's crunches down into a ball in your fist it 's likely soft plastic a company called reckless then transforms the soft plastic into anything from park benches to fences turning trash into treasure this is also a super easy way to reduce individual waste to landfill and support the circular economy and for a full list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out our resource page at the end of this chapter another great ways individuals to reduce our waste sent from the home to landfill is by collecting specific items and taking them to drop-off collection points this includes items such as plastic bottle tops which I mentioned to collect earlier on in the presentation bread tags pens and markers mobile phones and accessories data storage batteries ink and toner cartridges and computers and their accessories all of which can either be made into new versions of themselves or totally new items altogether for example plastic bottle tops can be created into prosthetic hands by a company called envision hands and bread tags can be created into wheelchairs for more information I encourage you to check out office works Aldi and Australia Post for their extensive collection streams as well as your local council and local primary schools who often have a number of collections TerraCycle and planned arc will also provide you with your local collections and their locations now with all this talk regarding recycling our waste generated at home I would quickly like to reiterate one thing recycling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Victoria it is merely a band-aid solution I often use this analogy with students I work with if you come home to find your house is flooded what is the first thing you would think to do the most common answer is to locate the water source and turn it off and it is the exact same situation without overflow of waste we actually have to do our best to rethink refuse reduce and then further reuse repurpose and even repair before we think about recycling we have to stop over packaging in its tracks and vote with our dollar to reduce what we can at an individual level and some helpful tips to help you do this include regrowing plants from your old veggies and fruit scraps turning old clothes into rags or beeswax raps keeping reusable Tupperware in your car and dropping off unwanted electrical waste at your councils collection points for more tips for reducing waste please take a moment to read the tips listed on your screen and now our lovely colleague Dee will take you through how you can create your own reusable beeswax wraps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you [Music] and for more information on ways to reduce waste generated within your home as well as information on your local drop-off points please check out the links provided on this resource page now I hope you 've found this chapter on waste informative and will be able to incorporate some of these individual tips and tricks into your everyday lives I 'm now going to pass you back over to Jane who will discuss how you can lower your greenhouse gas emissions through your energy choices we 've talked about growing food shopping locally reducing waste and valuing resources this chapter will talk about choosing sustainable energy and transport and helping our environment even more ok let 's do it Australia 's leading the world in per capita growth of rooftop solar with new panels installed about every six and a half minutes by 2025 renewable energies for digital supply up to 75% of the nation 's power in addition to growth the solar panels there needs to be more investment in green infrastructure and batteries South Australia is leading the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mixture of hydrogen wind and solar energy production on a national scale we are still far behind the rest of the world Australia sources mark more of its power from fossil fuels than any other comparable countries in the world when I lived in the top ten for wind and solar capacity despite being the sunniest and wind east inhabited continent Australia has everything it could ever need to be a global energy superpower but this will require the Australian Government to invest in renewing his nations future as consumers at home and in business we can all support Australia 's transition to renewable energy through buying renewable energy to power your home and business as part of your electricity bill another key action you can take is to move your banking superannuation and insurance to funds that are not investing in fossil fuels whether you 're with 80 all-original power shop or any of the other energy retailers they can provide you with clean electricity to power your home business green electricity guide is a handy tool to look at the performance of different energy retailers market forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linked to fossil fuels by taking the steps movie managing institutions that are supporting renewable energy is an extremely important action coming up we 've got a video of series air co house to share some tips of energy reduction in home this is the series eco house it was moved to the series site in the early 80s and has been renovated several times the Eco house has been a showcase to the public in terms of energy efficient housing and today we 'll have a brief look at some of the simple technologies it uses the entrance has dual doors to form an airlock this prevents air from escaping when a person comes into the building the majority of energy use in Victorian housing goes towards heating during the colder months skylights allow for natural lighting a layer of bubble wrap above the fitting helps to prevent heat leaking back outside as well there is secondary glazing over the original windows called Plexiglas which is very strong this can be used on any window and is 70 to 80 percent as good as double glazing with huge reduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is very cheap the film can be cut and fitted to a window and then attached with the use of a hairdryer again it is 70 to 80 percent as good as double glazing externally there are blinds to trap the heat in during winter and reflect sunlight away during summer the garden provides shade during summer but as the plants are deciduous they shed their leaves and prevent obstruction of the Sun in winter the seals of the windows and doors are tightly fitted to prevent drafts the back of the building uses thermal mass to store Heat an internal brick wall captures heat from sunlight through higher clerestory windows and releases it back into the building at night by using a solar system and batteries as well as a heat pump and geothermal technology our eco house is a zero emissions all-electric house the batteries allow the capture of solar power for use at night we hope you have enjoyed this brief glimpse into our series eco house during copa90 with our cars and trucks off the road pollution and greenhouse gases have decreased substantially the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry such as steel and cement this is in New Delhi in October 2000 19 and April 2020 your Delhi is the world 's most polluted city with life threatening pollution during your restrictions New Delhi 's pollution levels are the best in decades in the skies were a rare blue how can we use this moment to reflect on what transport methods which are prioritized to help keep the air clean what riding walking public transport cycling carpooling will you choose to take going forward I hope this chapter on energy and transport has shown some ways you can help to reduce Australia 's collision and the dr. Klenner approach to energy now Lee is going to share some tips on water saving and show you just how precious fresh water is thanks Jane now in Victoria we 're extremely lucky to have fresh running water available at the quick turn of attack however sadly this is not a luxury that all regions and countries have so in this next chapter let 's find out just how precious our water is and ways in which we can conserve it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precious is because if we actually zoom out all the way to view our planet Earth 97.5 percent of the water available on earth is actually made up of salt water that only leaves 2.5 percent water that is actually fresh water which before we get too ahead of ourselves is mostly unattainable 70 percent of this is frozen and polar caps and 30 percent lives underground most of which is too expensive to tap into and filter this then only leaves less than 1% of fresh water available for human consumption this fresh water that is available is then consumed in many different ways around the home from washing our dishes clothes and bodies to flushing the toilet but is all water consumed within our homes visible to the eye our individual consumption of water is probably much higher than we would ever imagine and that is due to invisible water or water used in the manufacturing process of everything that we buy and use this includes all the food that we put into our mouths the clothes we put onto our bodies and the appliances we use in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approximately 52 liters of water and around 720 litres for just one pair of cotton socks so in the next part of our presentation we 'll be investigating how our individual consumer choices can increase or decrease our water consumption and help us make more informed choices plant-based diets now the fact of the matter is that in order for our food to grow it consumes water and a lot of it and according to the United Nations meat production and factory farming are responsible for a majority of that that 's around 70% of fresh water consumption as well as 38% of land use that 's deforestation and 19% of the world 's greenhouse gas emissions now obviously all food tributes to land use as well as greenhouse gas emissions but the problem lies in the sheer scale of the meat industry and the fact that land and water is used both in firstly growing the grain to feed the industry as well as the water and land used to house the livestock itself invite you to look over the image on the right hand side of the screen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just one gram of the listed source of protein it is important to understand that as individuals we do not have to completely change our eating habits or eliminate whole food groups but we do have to hold ourselves accountable for the effects that they can have on our planet simple swaps throughout the week or incorporating it meatless Mondays can be simple yet effective ways to reduce water hungry foods with lesser ones now up next our out are in fashion choices here 's a crazy fact it takes two thousand seven hundred litres of water to produce one cotton t-shirt that 's nearly four times the cotton socks I mentioned earlier that 's around about how much water you 'll drink in over three years making clothes takes a huge amount of resources and sadly so much of our clothing ends up unloved or in our wardrobes and never worn our fast fashion culture today is also designed for a quick turnover of cheap products that results in extensive water consumption and pollution caused by the dyeing process so I want to challenge you to rethink how you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're switching to less resource hungry fibers buying secondhand where possible supporting environmentally conscious brands and rather than pinning old clothes taking them to textile banks for recycling or donating wearable goods to op shops now after all this invisible water talk I thought it best we finish up but taking a look at the water we can physically see within the home now as you can see in this image our water consumption can be broken up into eight main categories and these include 2% of water is used on drinking 4 percent on outside use 8% on washing clothes 9% on other 11% on taps 12 percent on washing dishes 23 percent on flushing toilets and 31 percent on shower and baths so now that we have an understanding of how our water is used in the home let 's jump into some ways to reduce these percentages and form some water saving habits we can start off by catching runoff in the shower or kitchen sink by placing buckets or large containers underneath we can even retrofit old single flush toilets with glass jars as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mulching garden beds and even harvesting rainwater by implementing rain tanks and for more information on ways you can conserve water within the home please check out the links provided on this resource page now I hope these points in water have highlighted just how pressure it is on our and have provided you with some ways to conserve it within your own home now that 's all you 'll be hearing from me today as we have come to the end of our presentation so I just like to say a really big warm thank you to everybody who has joined us here virtually today and I wish you the best of luck on your sustainability journey now I 'll pass you back to Jane for her to say her goodbyes great to talk with you about ways to live more sustainably and take care of our environment there are daily choices we can all make its benefit our environment and take action on climate change thank

were they going to build their houses so off they went on their adventure the first little pig decided to build his house of straw and he was so excited to build his house of straw that he collected all the pieces in a wheelbarrow and he started to build are you ready to help me build i 'm building i 'm building i 'm building my house i 'm building i 'm building my house made of straw the first little pig was so excited to have this house of straw all to himself what a big boy but little did he know that while he was building his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the forest watching the little pig with his house of straw and that big bad wolf came to the door because he was hungry and wolves only liked to eat pigs and he came to the door and he knocked the door little pig little pig let me comment and the little pig said not by the hair on my chin and the wolf said then i will huff and i will puff and i will blow your house down and the little pig said and the big bad wolf said are you ready to blow crash the little pig 's house of straw came tumbling down to the ground and the little pig cried and cried my house my house of straw oh what am i gonna do but the second little pig came to the rescue and he said to his brother it 's okay you can build a house with me we 'll live together in a house of sticks so the first little pig and the second little pig decided to build their house of

guess who it was it was the wolf the wolf was hiding in the forest and he said not one but two juicy piggies now for my dinner and so the big bad wolf walked to the door and he knocked on the door and he said little pigs little pigs let me come in and the wolf said by the hair now and the wolf said then i will huff and i will puff and i will blow your house down are you ready crush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house came tumbling down to the ground they were so sad that the house of straw was gone and now the house of sticks was gone and now they had nowhere to go but the third little pig came to the rescue and he said don 't worry brothers you can come live with me are you sure absolutely what are we gonna build our house with we 're gonna build our house with bricks the strongest thing there is okay so the three little pigs trotted off into the forest and went to find some bricks now they needed to work hard to get those bricks because they were heavy but they put them all in all in the wheelbarrow and they got ready to build their house of bricks are you ready i 'm building i 'm building i 'm building my house i 'm building i 'm building my house made of bricks now the first little

bricks but outside in the forest who was lurking i bet you know it was the big bad wolf and the big bad wolf saw this big house of bricks and he said oh my delicious tummy i have got three piggies now to eat for my dinner and so inside the three little pigs they were having a great time they were having a fire in the chimney and they were toasting marshmallows in the fire and they were so warm and so cozy and so happy but the big bad wolf had come to the door and he had knocked at the door and he had said little pigs little pigs let me come in and the little pig said not by the hair on our chinny chin chins and the wolf said then i will huff and i will puff and i will blow your house down and the three little pigs said and the wolf started to blow are you ready but the big bad wolf could not blow the house down bricks because it was too strong and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can 't get us the big bad wolf can 't get us the big bang with can 't get us and they sat in their chairs and they sat by the fire and they continued to toast their marshmallows but outside the big bad wolf he was cross and he was hungry and that 's why he was crossed because he wanted food and so what did he do he decided to climb up the chimney and go down the chimney into the little pig 's house and that 's just what he did so he climbed up the side of the house [Music] he looked down the chimney but he didn 't see the fire the silly wolf and he went down into the chimney and he went straight into the fire and he ran out the front door out into the forest and he was never seen again and the three little pigs were so cosy and warm and snuggle as a bug in their home for the rest of the time i hope you enjoyed the story we 'll see you next time you,"(-37.9662196, 145.0574374)"

Hwy, Cheltenham VIC 3192, Australia",1666,[Applause] [Music] hi guys to our aqua aerobics members out there who love to be in the water into their own session we 're going to simulate something quite similar but this time you 're going to be seated in a chair so instead of being in the water that 's proper ourselves on a nice sturdy and comfortable chair that allows us to be able to move freely but move safely okay so if you 've got yourself down at home you can set that up all right we 're going to go through a number of different movement patterns five categories and in each of those categories we 're going to try and attempt about one minute on each exercise there are three exercises in a set that I 've created for you and you 're going to repeat that twice to each set trophy about six minutes take the moment of rest as you need it just allow yourself at least a minute on the timer because it 's up to you to move to whatever thing you want whatever music you want just as long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to so the first part we 're going to do is jog on the spot so if you in the water just making yourself comfortable on your chip you 're in the water you 'd be able to lift your legs up and jog on the spot yeah so we 're going to do that motion but if you find that a tempo of this is too fast for you you can always slow your jog down so we can either go for a sequel job or we can slow the jog down now what do you do with your arms bring you in the water we 're going to pretend that we are floating through jogging into the water as we 're swimming through forward and back forward back forward back twelve hours that jogging action from there you 're gonna take your job out white so we 're going to go out white just little flutters of the hands and then we 're going to take that for a minute we were jogging out white okay slowing it down as you need to especially because you are using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you have to slow tempo for about a minute last one winner clock in the Java sequence is to actually take it for an arrow job and then a wider job so we 're going to do that together for a couple of repetitions to see you get a feel free we 're going to go forward jog jog jog jog in out out out out jump now wide wide wide wide if you wish you can go for one two out out breathe in in out out and again if that tempo is too fast you can always slow them Chris play on your music box and you let that music guide you that you 're moving in the sequences that we recommend so that 's your first jogging block the second jumping block is going to be kicks so if you are in the water suspected either in deep or shallow you 've got the resistance of the water playing against your movement so essentially you could keep your leg forward and feel that resistance through the legs but you would be doing some sort of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let 's just keep those armed actions moving as if we were in the water we 're going to keep the leg forward and forward keep forward for a minute just sweeping your hands under and sweeping back down and this since also provides a little bit of resistance and movement through the wrist as you pretend that you are swinging and kicking in that water you 're going to take that kick little bit wider set kick out out one two one two now we 're going to bring it a final minute where we 're actually going to kick forward and then keep wide to the side so this time let 's try that we 're gonna kick forward forward four in a row and keep wide wide four times as well think you can narrow narrow four in a row then keep cool why I don 't even eat you just slide your hands as changing that movement just to keep you upright not pendulum spinning just yet it 's still a kick so forward forward wide wide as an option to move your legs let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're gonna take you through a kick forward we 're going to tap those who are ready tapping through the inner part of our foot so if you were in the water in a tap tap tap or you can 10 3 that is your second block of work and take a rest breathe we 're going to go into our third set which is going to be pendulum swings so pendulum is side to side movement where you are actually extending your arm out one way as your legs go the other way now because we 're either chair you need to keep one foot on the floor to keep that balance essentially in the pool you could speed by the feet if you 're in the deep end outlined we want to stay supported with our equipment and making sure that we 're moving behind safely so one foot stays on the floor we swing out with the arms one way and we sweep out with the legs the other way sweeping through some of that routine water but at the same time allowing our wrists arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pendulum swing one pendulum swing two pendulum has been one pendulum into now our pendulum swing can turn into a rocking horse minute uniteq your rocking horse one need up one pendulum swing one knee up one pendulum speak so if you sent a little bit forward in your chair and you 're comfortable being there you can actually start to rock your body slowly forward and slowly back now if you want to keep that back leg bent as if you are you need rocking-horse action you can do that you can rock forward with money and out back with the foot up what your hands do is dependent on what you feel is comfortable so I 'm just stimulating us sweeping through the water but if you want to pretend that you are breast stroking so you know take your first stroke forward open the arts and at this point you 're using your chest and your legs and your abs as you move okay take a break we are moving on to the fourth blood work is going to involve a bit of chumps obviously we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are going to do is stack your feet together if you need to hold on to your chair so that you don 't and see you 've got a bit of support or if you don 't comment in the chair you 're going to be using your abs which is actually really good work for the abs and for the legs so through in the water would be jumping dumb legs up and so bringing your legs up you can how much that chair bring your knees up up jumping even jumping down we 're gonna actually take that double leg jump into a out and so it 's a jumping jack essentially with a little tap out and a tap in if you need to keep the log impact so you can tap it out Oh bring your knees up throw it more propulsion in your job okay jump in jump out jump in jump out perfect okay last minutes in this block of work we 're gonna step your feet together here in John side-to-side again if you need to use your abs lift your chest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were double jumping through that water taking your time you need to stop or hold onto your chair support take a rest every one last vlog of work is going to involve some a cross-country skis so we 've got to make sure that we 're a little bit full of our chair because we 're going to take one leg forward and then swap and what you 'll notice is I can 't quite take the other leg back without falling forward so the other leg comes in to amend we skied forward we ski back we skied forward we skied back so let 's start to use the arms has been loose in the levites forward and back cross the forward and back now this time you can add a little jumpy in the middle with your legs so we 're gonna add cross ski jump tuck cross ski jump tuck cross-country skiing with a tuck jump cross-country ski in the Tuck jump tap out tap jump out tuck jump that you 're gonna do for about a minute as well then I 'm gonna get you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you were flattering your arms forward and back forward of that forward and back just to get a little bit of that movement through the shoulders brace through the core and finish off your last minute with just some arm work in the breed then recover and hopefully you 'll feel that workout and enjoy it as if you were doing a lower option

Nepean Hwy, Cheltenham VIC 3192, Australia",1354,[Applause] [Music] where 's Patrick from Kingston IQ I 'm here for a chair basic strength program for I 'm senior citizens and it 's going to run through a few exercises today to put those together so they 've got something you can do at home we 're going to start with some warm-up drills so that 's not way they would just be much and we see a little bit forward of the chair so we can just be balancing so supportive and we just match up and down with the favor so we 're just getting the legs moving from here now we can do this for a minute two minutes whatever timeframe you feel comfortable with just keep those having just marching from there once you completed that me to see further back into the chair and we do some the twist so what I 'm going to do is I 'm going to reach across with one hand behind the opposite knee and then reach across from the other hand from me so we 're just turning left to right now we can continue this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit of a movement throughout tour so from here we do some shoulder rolls so you hang the arms to the side and we just roll in the shoulders forward for five or six and then back for five or six and we continue doing that for about half a minute to a minute after that the final warm-up exercise sophisticated to him so just turning left to right with the head just getting the chest shoulders loosened up we moved from here to our strength exercises so the first one I 've got a couple of options here it 's a squatting action so we 're starting with a sit to stand so I 'm going to be in the chair and I want to lean forward do this from this side so it 's really easy to see what 's happening here I 'm going to lean forward get my chest open my knees push through my feet push through my heels into the ground and stand up as I sit back in the chair motor capable chest Authority can have their hands up front for balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit back down making sure the feet are about hip width apart you can make this a little bit easier by having your hands on your knees and pushing with your hands if you need to if you can 't get up with a throwing yourself forward or if you have arms in your chair you can use the arms of the chair and a more advanced version of this for those that are confident is to stand behind your chair hold on and do sports so you 've got the chair for balance you 're sitting back as if there 's a chair behind and sitting into the chair keeping the chest over the knees and I 'm not holding on leading of the chair I 'm just using it to hold on to if I need to I feel like I 'm losing balance if you 're not comfortable with either of those exercises you can do a leg extension so from here these ten one leg out and back and we alternate left to right next one is a hamstring kickbacks we 're working the back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kicking back and so I 'm keeping my knees side-by-side I 'm not throwing my day back after I 've done ten on one side I can switch to the other side do ten on the other side and you can modify that a bit by doing a bit of the cross key so we can go straight up and down well we can do a little bit of a cross peak from there so you can modify that if you feel again if you 're not confidently standing up as long as you could share this but I think I need a horse between the legs you can kick it back from there now we do a bit of upper body work so we do a chest press with a bowl so this is an odd way to bowl if you have a weighted ball at home and you 're confident with it you can do it but we 're holding the ball to the chest and we 're pressing straight up front the next place our alleged more ways I have a 1 kilogram dumbbell here you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight if you have a weight or you can use it in a fruit or or anything that you can hold in your hand you look confident we and we 're just going to do one side at a time here then raise the weight out to the side only up to shoulder height and back from the side it 's not going straight to the side it 's going a little bit forward so it 's a heavy front of the body just a little bigger back we want to watch that we don 't shrug like that keep that shoulder down sorry and finally for the strength exercises angel wings gonna hold the hands up to the side palms forward like so you 're going to squeeze the shoulder blades in together and drop the orbital on the ground and release the squeeze drop and release if you can get your hands right back as far as I 've got mine that 's great but do it if you end up in this position or you can only get your hands to here you just take the position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just feeling that squeeze in the back as we squeeze the shoulder blades and draw the elbows down and finally we finish with some stretching so we 're starting with the hamstring the back of the legs we 're just going to put one leg up to the front and reach towards that foot if you can 't reach towards that foot all you need to do is lean forward and these stretches we hold for about 20 seconds once you 're not 20 seconds a month sigh we can do 20 seconds on the other side then there 's a twist so a bit like the warm-up we did we 're going to place one hand in the opposite knee use it to pull yourself around and hold that position for 20 seconds when that 's complete repeat to the other side next to the chest stretch we have take the hands to the side we take them out about hip height and we squeeze back and finally next stretch which I point hand in underneath the chair take the other hand over here to the side now this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going down if you can 't reach over to do this it 's going to be fine just to tip the head to the side so within swap sides after about 20 seconds so that 's your workout when you get to that middle part with those strength movements we do one or two sets of each about ten to a set of each exercise but first when you have an option of the seat to stand or if you walk off you can do the squat instead if your best confident you can do that leg extension if you do more than one set make sure you rest about a minute to a minute and a half between your sets just to make sure you muscles get a good chance for recovery and you can repeat this on every other day through the week or you might even do one or two sessions,"(-37.9662196, 145.0574374)"

Hwy, Cheltenham VIC 3192, Australia",1398,[Applause] [Music] hi it 's patrick from kingston active i 'm here with a senior strength based program you can use to do in place of say aqua aerobics or the light pace classes or some of the strength and stretch classes um we 've got a couple of warm-up exercises to start with and then we 're running through strength exercises followed by a few stretches at the end so the first two are warm-up exercises the idea with these would be to do them for about a minute of each and the first one is a heel to toe walk so from here we 're aiming to walk slowly and deliberately heel to toe heel to toe like that now if you 're more confident with your balance we can use it as a bit of a balance exercise and we can walk in like heel to toe heel to toe okay you can walk forwards you can walk back so you can do say five steps forward five steps back um backwards does require more confidence and more balance but you can use that as an option @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're standing with our feet hip width apart hands up front we 're going to rotate and reach behind one hand and then with the other so we cross through the middle and we reach and rotate and continue that for your minute we 're going now into our strength exercises each of these will do for sets of ten exercises and do two or three sets of each with about a one minute rest between your sets the first one is a broomstick lunge or squat the broomstick here is to help you balance but want something that you can actually lean on and rely on so for a lunge we 're holding that out front we 're putting one leg back and we just hold on to the broomstick make sure we 've got a good long stance so we can drop that back knee towards the ground and push back up how far you drop that knee down depends on your own confidence your own strength or any injuries you may have so if half or quarter movement like this is enough for you do that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost touch the ground and come back up you can even do it without holding the broomstick same with a squat so we do our squatting action from here hips drop back into a squat and we can use the broomstick for a bit of balance and support if you need it or you could do it without the room stick make sure you 're not leaning on it and holding more of your weight on it if you do this next one is a deadlift from the bench i 'm going to use a chair to demonstrate you want something that 's not up above hip height and something that 's below where your hands naturally hang so i 'm using a dumbbell to do this okay and what i 'm doing is i 'm nearly just lowering it down to the chair see my hips are going back and i push the hips forward and come back up push the hips back and keeping the legs nice and straight never push the hips forward to come back up you can hold on to a ball or anything that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house to use as a weight all right we turn the chair around now and we 're going to do a calf raise to toe raise so you can do this up against the wall or anything you can hold on to for balance and from here i 'm standing up as high as i can on my toes bring the heels back to the floor lift the toes up off the ground stand up as high as i can toes heels to floor lift the toes up i don 't want to do this as well as the toes i 'm going to keep the hips forward i 'm going to keep the core in nice and tight just to squeeze the belly a little bit ocean there so i 'm minimizing that hip movement forward and back you can use the chair as a prop this time as well and you can use a chair or a bench at home to do a one-armed robe now if you don 't have a dumbbell you can use tin of fruits or anything you can hold in one hand from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the chair place one hand there i can bend the knees a little if you 've been comfortable through the back here so you can drop and bend the knees a little from here and i 'm just going to grow from there bring the weights up to the ribs and back down once i 've completed 10 on one side i turn around and i complete 10 on the other side so the next one is a wall or a bench push up so if you have a bench at home that 's a height that enables you to do a push-up you can do it on that the higher you hold your hands the easier the push-up is if that 's too much for you to do you hold your hands out against the wall and you need to push up from there so i 'll use this here as an example out and back so chest to wall push back finally a shoulder press so you can use a weighted ball a non-weighted ball a dumbbell tin or fruit or whatever but we 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having the hands out to the side the elbows will be in front holding either end or either side of what you 're pressing overhead press up overhead and back down watch that you don 't lean back like this you want to stay nice and upright and you get to a certain point you start to lean back that 's as far as you go if you have problems with your shoulders any pinching or anything like that within your shoulders just bring the elbows up to shoulder height and bring those back down and finally finish up the stretching so three stretches hold for about 20 or 30 seconds each the first is a chest stretch we 're going to take the hands in behind the back like so fingers interlocked and lift them away from the body if you can 't do that just hold the hands to the side and pull back for our back stretch we interlock the fingers at the front if you can turn the palms out if you can 't just keep the palms facing in and push forward and hold and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put one hand in behind my back to hold that shoulder down take the other hand over the head pull it to the side this is the first of three after 20 seconds i hold it there i let the chin drop this is the second of three you 'll feel it a bit layer up in the neck and after about 20 seconds of that lift the chin again and i 'm going to rotate my head towards that set shoulder so i 'm looking up over that free shoulder and then you would repeat that to the other side so that 's your workout just a reminder those first two warm-up exercises are around about a minute each a the ones through the middle the strength exercises those are two or maybe three sets of ten of each with about a one minute rest between the sets and the final three those stretches they 're about 20 or 30 seconds each that 's your workout time it should take you maybe half hour or so as you follow that whole sequence through maybe a bit longer if you 're really taking those from those rest periods,"(-37.9662196, 145.0574374)"

rapid growing community it has wonderful and beautiful amenities most of which we all enjoy whether it be during the day or during the weekend and i have to say i do enjoy attending the citizenships and welcoming the new citizens to the wonderful city of kingston as councillor brownies had already indicated the state government has made a significant contribution of forty eight thousand dollars towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there was some 13,500 ideas that were submitted where the community was consulted to to ask them exactly what what did they want for this certainly for today and for

a lot of what the division is going to be for the City of Kingston so the process as that Brian has already indicated was very well planned it clip includes a lot of attractive places of the city of kingston currently holds it actually gave the community the opportunity to have input to their future for today and for the future of the city of kingston and that included businesses parks reserves other amenities that people enjoy and i think that 's very important that as a community we collectively and holistically be involved in part of this process and we also looked at the sustainability in the environment environment or component as well and I think these are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the City of Kingston but also to its people and most of which we enjoy particularly on the weekends maybe not so much at the moment of the weather is really cold but certainly in the summer months you 've got beautiful amenities so well done on that so the victorian government knows that the projects like this require significant investment and planning and i think you 've certainly all come up with with a great plan and a good vision for the city of kingston so I 'm delighted to be part of this launch

forward like the first of our presentations no yeah everybody 's right what I can 't see known as a clock so you 'll have to trust me thank you rather than hello everybody I grew up in the praying south yarra area before it was gentrified and in my young teens with a couple of friends I often rode my bike to Wadi le to wrap up the creek and with a bit of luck see what some of the fishermen had brought in then ride home again and it was always worth the trip I moved to Kingston 20 years ago then there are stables horses in the streets and on the beach and the creek was clogged and polluted so what have to be playing then to allow us to see the benefits today today we have bike paths or festivals to celebrate food wine music multi cultural activities and we have hundreds of tables and chairs outside cafes we didn 't know them then 20 years ago what could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will there be careful how much pleasure time will people have and how will they want to use it how important is the legacy that we want to live is it it 's something we all want to do to try to make the world a better place for our children and our grandchildren these are the sorts of issues that lie deeply behind the project the median age of residents in Kingston is 39 and it doesn 't very much strap Kingston more than thirty percent of our community was born overseas it varies from nineteen percent to up to 61 percent in different areas of Kingston and only four percent of them are not fluent in English we expect the median age will increase wilkie stand become even more diverse it probably will it 's not the important but absolutely necessary to plan ahead to work together in partnership to build the future we want the planning should be informed by an appreciation of our demographics an understanding of trends and a sound knowledge of what residents want this is what has been addressed by the project what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of community engagement in partnership the vision will directly influence the decisions and actions that we all take today and move us towards a sustainable future of the predator in Kingston the project had multiple purposes it was to inform the new council when it develops its plan to develop the shared long-term vision to guide future councils and a community towards achieving long-term goals and to develop a research and data resource for the community and the council to you used to inform their plan in the future it came about as rollers nation by a council decision in 2011 to approve the development of the long-term 20 to 25 year vision plan to to ensure that the project was a true partnership with the community so that it was overseeing designed and monitored by the community the council also a point of a reference panel with ten community members and tens senior council officers to play a leading role in guiding the project the reference panel provide a high-level advice and guidance on the design and associated issues visiting process to ensure the community vision was provided in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community it was possible because of the skills and experiences of the panel members including the community met representatives from a broad range of community volunteer and work activities because of the knowledge and skills and experience of the council offices and because of councils wisdom in appointing Robin popper in this program program leader for the project we hooked it would have been done through our Australian so that we could build on their work to make our project unique and even better the six stages of the project were one naming the name in competition getting initial ideas on bikes improvements and licked and wishes States to was the topic based forums in which we continue gathering ideas on likes improvements in wishes stage three the area based forums I 'm sure many of you went to those for developing lists and voting on a hundred broad wish statements state for was reporting the key research findings to council and to the community by releasing the informative descriptions of the data Stage five was the development of the vision of its release for community feedback and stage 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the release of detailed research resources for the community today is an important part of that final stage we did it this way because a best practice model was developed and used we believe that the greater the number of levels in the process the better the engagement and involvement of the community it was a qualitative research project a rigorous project led by dr. cochrane the goal was to offer residents visitors and people who work in kingston multiple opportunities ways and times to be involved this led to the participation as you can have about 6,000 people the project has incorporated five levels of engagement to inform by implementing a detailed and customized communication plan for each stage of the project to keep the community informed to consult by offering a range of participation offers opportunities so to obtain community input throughout problems of the consultation project to involve by operating community members the opportunity to submit their advice views and preferences on the broad wish statements that were created to capture the essence of the ideas gathered to collaborate by including 10 community members in the community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project by implementing an ambassador program comprising of 12 of self nominated community members and I 'm sure we have many of the ambassadors here tonight finally the level of

anybody ever wants to come down feel free just knock on the door we 're really to let anybody in and money is always good to but don 't say that people see me a messed up running then okay another area we are really passionate about and is developing our student leadership and we 're developing our students into active citizens one of our proudest moments this year was when Daniel became junior mayor it was a fantastic day and we commend him for all his efforts in getting that award and becoming the mayor and he is doing a great job in there as well and it 's a great thing too because whenever we talk about events coming up I just say well we 've got Daniel the June in there and one follows getting all everywhere so we don 't have to worry about booking him in we 're doing a big sedan pro gt1 come and l2 shipping container to set sail sit down that 's an interesting event to as a school under the City of Kingston we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very supportive in many of our school initiatives in fact I 'm usually on the phone to the City of Kingston once a week and if they don 't need for me they ring to see how I 'm doing I always miss me when I 'm on holidays I even send emails from barley guys when I was away as a result of my dealings with Kingston Council I know how committed they are to doing things well therefore we need to commend the council on how community have been in gaining feedback from the Kingston community members to support the development of the Living Kingston 2035 vision Kingston Council were determined to gaining mation from as many sorters as they could therefore they developed and instigated a range of activities to get input from a broad number of members of the Kingston community over 13,500 ideas were gathered on multiple participation of options that 's a really fantastic effort idea was a lot of hard work some of the things they did was the naming competition which was Mark remark which they launched at the carols by candlelight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winner of the competition as we know lost live in Kingston 2035 another initiative was the Ambassador Program which was launched on Australia Day in 2012 63 people signed up to support the project these people did a fantastic job getting out and about in the community finding out the thoughts and ideas of the people of Kingston another important feature of the living kingston 2035 project was the gathering of data surveying the community through 21st century online technology 1535 people complete online submissions 700 city of Kingston 's used the smartphone app 4100 boats were collected on voting online voting platforms and 2642 people visited the kinks living kingston website to further support the collection of data professionally community forums were held 300 people attended the two series of community forums theme-based were all forums included discussions on children and young people safe and clean cities free moving and accessible cities stewardship on our environment vibrant local economies arts culture and heritage of changing population our built environments parks and open spaces strong and healthy communities these forms were held across Kingston to allow opportunities for many members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big thing about getting as many people to ever say as possible start formance were also held at the council this was a really good day I went down to the school competitions this was where this year Daniel one but last year another boring one and what they talked about was what Kingston Google plug-in 2035 this was a great example of how children could have an import on what our future would look like in the competition students address the question of living kingston 2035 what would it look like if students came up with some fantastic ideas that were really were original and different and Ron stole my thunder when he talked about the chocolate fountain but there was another really good idea which was putting a tram track down the middle of nepean highway which I thought was not a bad idea really what do you think we should also command all the councillors and council staff members of the vision in committee and Ian for all their commitment to the project many of these people attended numerous events such as the globe to globe music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shopping centers building business awards village committee meetings Kingston school events Kingston harvest fest walls and a whole lot more now how was all this data turned into a vision you may ask from the initial ideas theme-based forums were held online submissions and surveys were and they would run and they developed a hundred wish statements the which statements were voted on and then from this information we collect a report it was analyzed and a draft of vision was developed the draft vision was then released again for more feedback and now after all the hours of hard work and all those people going out and doing those wonderful things I am very pleased to officially launch the living kingston 2035 vision for 2012 more than 5,800 people in our community told us what they wished for the city of kingston in 20 35 this

partnerships between the community private industry council and not-for-profits we all have a part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thank You Julie for your presentation and thank you for running bold in that video because in seven or eight minutes that captured so much and so many of the ideas and thoughts that went in there and I 'm sure it brought back some memories from what we 've got now as to the perhaps the new horse monument down parked our beach notice the old I thought it was they all do lose Jenna factory on the piano and repellent the saints fully ground down and Roman there was a whole range of things that we could relate to that in the past of apps in the future so it 'll be good to look back when we first saw the drawings that were involved in that with some of the scratch their head and then we look deeper and thought yep they 've captured all the thoughts and when the team put it into a video that was the end result nothing a fantastic production I 'd now like to introduce our key speaker for tonight Simon McKeon Simon is a businessman sportsman philanthropist and of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a decade ago when Simon was diagnosed with MS he decided that he needed to make every day count and even though he had a very successful corporate career he took a part-time role as an executive chairman of the Macquarie Group in Melbourne and that enabled him to support whole range of causes that included joining boards of world Australia is a director of gold the global poverty project volunteers as a counselor for heroin addicts dance and cool and works with the red dust role models working in remote indigenous communities and we 've just experienced native week in Kingston and had the opportunity to attend several functions involving members of our indigenous community and it 's great to see the different aspect you get when you have a close encounter ideas with someone from the far north of Australia who doesn 't normally get down to places such as Kingston together with the crewmen Tim data and Simon has held for a fairly lengthy time the world speed saying recorded for sailing is a leading social entrepreneur Simon also shows how business and philanthropy can work hand-in-hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gentlemen please welcome Simon McKee thanks very much wrong for that very very warm welcome and can I just say that I 'm also better repeat the acknowledgement of some of the not so much important people in the room but people that have led to tonight happening and I 'm doing that for a particular is it not just because it 's commonplace to acknowledge people like that but it 's actually in the rafters anything else them that I want to talk about tonight i want to talk about how does someone in the year 2013 how does a group of people lead an entire community forum so i am going to acknowledge elizabeth miller member for Bentley Monica Bailey represented mark Dreyfus and then the fur Isaac 's attorney general Muir on families and your other fellow councillors community vision reference members we 've heard from one or two but doubt don McDonald Julie when Christine Stevenson and the others council stuff especially Sarah bishop who has been very helpful in giving me a lot more background to tonight and that 's one or two of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outset that to some extent it 's good that I 'm an outsider what do I mean by that I 've never quite lived in Kingston I 've been close to most of my life but never quite I was born and raised in Daniel just to the east spent much of my life living in bayside just to the north now that I said as much as I can just to the south down on the peninsula but Kingston 's always been an important place for me I 've traveled across it I had my first student employment in the factories of Kingston some of my closest friends still live here I travel through here regularly week in week out I 've sailed with each of the four yacht clubs that the City of Kingston swam into beaches indeed for many years Ron we actually built these worlds fastest sailboats in a backyard shed in morning alex is five minutes away from here everyone has their own stories in this room of attachment to this particular part of the world and why is it why do I say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside because in having being informed of what this extraordinary document is and what lays behind it I can actually tell you don 't take it for granted it 's not as if it happens everywhere it certainly doesn 't happen in business and I would dare to suggested city doesn 't happen around the world of the way that you have done it here and that 's what i want to emphasize tonight that having the extraordinary richness diversity the fullness of opinion that has come from your community of 150,000 people it 's that as much as anything else which allows good leadership to happen that 's that as much as anything else which allows your community leaders to make good decisions so it in 2035 people can talk with continuing pride about this wonderful place you know tonight is not I think just a launch it ought to be a night of celebration it 's not the end of the road at the end of the journey not at all but tonight is I think highly appropriate to celebrate at least the end of this particular chapter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been put through to to counsel I think it 's an extraordinary result as I said before I 've had the benefit of talking with Sarah and finding out a whole lot more about the process than actually written or recorded in this document and I do commend everyone whether counselors paid staff volunteers contributors the reference group etc that has put this all together now these sorts of documents nowadays in one sense commonplace the corporate world is full of glitzy corporate documents indeed the secret often is to distill really whether what 's gone behind them because there 's an industry that 's I guess grown-up certainly in my lifetime that is trained to write to write this sort of documents so that every organization that I 'm aware I 've can hand out I blitzie any reporter strategic statement you know whatever a vision whatever it is they tell you when you take the time to really read them carefully do you know whether their documents of substance or not and again I say don 't take for granted the fact that this is yet another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tens of thousands of hours much of a contributed voluntarily by by the community at large nowadays you know we often worship I guess our our corporate leaders they get paid millions of dollars and they think they lead large organizations some of them are fairly large Coles and Woolies employ around 100,000 people edge but Kingston actually has 150,000 people in it and the community leadership team as a whole councillors CEO etc are actually I would argue strongly in charge of a much bigger enterprise than any of our largest corporations in this country I want to spend a few minutes tonight actually talking about what does that entail what does it mean it inevitably gets into politics i 'm going to talk tonight about to party politics i 'm not in any way qualified to talk about that but i am going to talk a little bit about what does it take to actually be an effective public leader not someone running a Coles and Woolies but actually trying to be the steward of the environment in which 100 or 50 thousands of people live but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell the story that I don 't tell all that often I actually don 't talk much at all about being Australian of the Year I still find it awkward I don 't understand really why I was chosen there are many many more qualified people than me but I was standing on a stage a couple of years ago in Canberra and 300 people in front of us and I was one of a two finalists from the other states and territories and the Prime Minister open an envelope and inside it was my name and just at that point there was a an older lady in this audience who stood up and with a plenty of his sin yes and she had slightly slightly bedraggled hair and perhaps some people didn 't know what was going on with a bit of an odd thing to happen and just at that point channel 9 that we 're doing the live broadcast around the country went off to a quick outbreak and Julia Gillard said to me do you know that lady and I said yes I do she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name is died and she has an intellectual disability she 's had since she was born and Julia but for her I wouldn 't be up on this stage today I 'm going to park that story we 're gonna leave you in suspense as to what that has got to do talking tonight I 've come back to it in a minute or two I have a privileged existence as Ron said I gave up working full-time quite some years ago and now I indulged in all sorts of fabulous campaigns and things that are passionate about by oxygen spends lots of time in County with with politicians of dominance federal state in fact this afternoon I note that Elizabeth Miller is representing the Minister Minister Wooldridge and I spent most of the afternoon with Mary Wooldridge on an NDIS engagement task task force and you know some people might say gosh you know why do i do so much i 'd do it because it 's just damn fun and fulfilling and rewarding and I 've got the ability to do it and not only that but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people but some of those people our community leaders many of them are their elected and I guess what I find interesting is that we as a community don 't regard particularly highly our politicians I bought into anything tonight offenses but I think even our land and perhaps it 's been it 's easy being an outsider but but i do want to tackle what i think is a tough subject if you look at what the readers digest roulette released as two or three weeks ago over here they come out with a report on who do we trust and I slice and dice our professions in 250 different areas and right at the top we have people like ambulance workers and nurses and teachers and other doctors and what have you and there are most highly regarded professions and then write down the bottle and I mean right down the bottom just one place above door-to-door salesmen politicians and what actually don 't quite get that equipment again I didn 't come down the last shower I know that taking the mediator politicians as a stray lien @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful about being like that too much i think last night and i turned the telly on just to see the last few minutes of this amazing liverpool victory maxim a very young side that is affecting primary school and i did a fabulous job at holding them imported to but of course i was also there to see the ceremony at the end and there were a handful of dignitaries acknowledge the the coaches and the managers and some sponsors of what have you and when our previous name was mentioned there were boobs that came from a 90 or thousand people in the MCG now I 'm one that thinks it 's okay to boo the umpire on Saturday afternoon and AFL match because they do get wrong so often but seriously I don 't think that you know as a nation were in any way but you 're irrespective of which side of politics we vote for when we so readily boo our elected leaders the reason that you know I 'm one of the last people ever criticized politicians is that in truth I myself have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them and the willingness to put myself up for re-election every two or three years for such a position I don 't have a thick enough skin I 'm actually someone on the home admires community political leaders I 'm someone who says who actually has the privilege to spend some time with an understanding for the most part they are overwhelmingly people who are just interested in trying to get the right result yes sometimes they have egos who larger than ours sometimes they have to work within a part of machine people like we don 't necessarily fully understand but by and large they are there in my opinion for the right reasons if everyone had spent the afternoon with me with Mary Wooldridge they would come away and certainly not repre politician 49 out of 50 a while ago at the last state election I was standing in a boating queue waiting to vote on there was a couple in front of me they were talking in a voice that will slightly louder than I would have expected but it was pretty obvious they were labour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train line regularly and they were talking openly about their voting intentions I tried not to listen but it was pretty hard to avoid it and they were somewhat annoyed at the reliability of what have you Colonel the frankston trail unless if you know what I think we need to make a protest vote today labour will still get in that 's what the polls are saying but we 're going to send out a little message I think we can say in hindsight that there were many such people like that but what do I mention that no actually I 'm interested in public transport I 've commuted violet medium or my entire life i actually just enjoy it i came here and tonight on the 440 six out of flinders street came to park down are there are many reasons why i choose to use public transport but i think one of them is that actually I like a dose every day of being with blue collar workers white collar workers unemployed unskilled people with issues disabilities intellectual and physical occasionally people that are deranged people that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trains and for me I don 't find it difficult experiences part of life it 's part of being connected it 's part of being informed so whatever I 'm doing from time to time I 'd like to think I 'm a bit more in touch with so much of what our community is experiencing I was actually offered a car ride here tonight I decided not to to take it i didn 't need someone to drive me here tonight train is perfectly good interestingly several weeks after Labor love lost the last election a couple of the ex cabinet ministers were talking to me once and a pining as to what had gone on in that interesting election I just make the comment i said you know for my part I think it would have been a good idea they 've been a bit of a rule that cabinet ministers in fact all politicians tried once a week once a fortnight to actually spend some time on the peak hour commuter train or tram or bus because one learns a lot what when emphasizing this for simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader one loses that are almost amount of time it 's a flawed job but that is no excuse in my opinion to take all of our information about how to lead a community from newspapers focus groups mindless whatever sometimes we need to taste it for ourselves and the number of things that I 've worked absorbed over the years simply by sitting on a train standing on a train have been invaluable for me tonight in this night of celebration about the launch of living kingston 2035 rarely have I seen a more concerted effort for a council to reach out and be connected with the community that it 's served I 'm often asked to talk about leadership and people what we 'll talk about you know what is an appropriate leadership style for particular circumstance you know is it for leadership inclusive leadership leadership by example leadership through our Asian at center etc I always take the opportunity to say that that 's all very interesting what style of leadership that at the end of the day the leader doesn 't know what the group that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the group is expecting if the leader is simply leading in isolation that is the most dangerous leadership of all the trouble is that to be informed takes time it takes time to consult properly and many Valentines today said anything that there is no time that the 24 only a cycle in particular it 's important to come out quickly and how many illustrations can I think right across the broad spectrum of human activity has leadership sometimes let us down so much we wish of ads half day every year and of course much of that was founded on the disastrous decisions made largely by the the British military leaders who were disengaged not connected didn 't know what was happening on the front line of the Australian front lines above anzac cove kodak is really no longer a household name as its leadership became disconnected with its front line sales force and one of the CERN consumer in a digital age was requiring i referred to lead in a torito 's digest just a few minutes ago rinse digest went into a pepsi earlier this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was was holding for it and perhaps eating one of the many many reasons why state labor government lost the last elections that it perhaps wasn 't a Miss connected with three critical train line standing on Langston and the eastern suburbs where voters did vote with their feet the effort behind this document tonight has been enormous how I repeat the steps that you 've already heard except to say you know more than 1500 surveys submitted by the community 4,000 votes on that online voting platform 13,000 separate ideas came in and that all had to be distilled down to 100 broad wish statement and where does all this lead well I guess in a practical sense and in a short-term sent it leads to the council 's strategy they call it the council plan 2013 17 most organizations have such a medium term strategic plan that of course in turn informs the current budgeting process and ultimately what occurs day to day indeed whatever council deliberates whatever council stuff try to make a decision at the back or forefront of their minds ought to be this extraordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's very broad I actually don 't need to speak on it tonight it speaks through very clear language for itself but it 's themes compelling and relevant only mention a few things to that but you know the aging and growing population I can speak for an hour on that alone too often we see the issue of aging and growing populations only as a threat of a challenge and the more that as a community we see the extraordinarily tunity of the elongation of this species are never in the evolution of this world we seen a species change so rapidly in a hundred years our life expectancies gone from 49 284 and is continuing to increase but it 's not just what do we do with old people it 's how do we empower what what can we expect of an aging and increasingly well and active mentally alert part of our focus on waste collection recycling beach management and the issue of low-lying areas is chairman of CSIRO we have great difficulty sometimes talking frankly about what climate change and increasing water levels might mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that but the more a community is receptive to that and talks logically and practically about what we do the greater the chance that we have of not having a repeat of issues that we 've sent overseas such as in the u.s. community facilities you know I 've got off the train tonight and once a few minutes early I wanted to get my thoughts together our wonderful to still wander into a place I 've never wandered into before parkdale library smiling face at the front door come on in we take these sort of facilities so often for granted but every local authority around the state and the nation is producing these things transport natural environment the importance of volunteering that aging population is a vast resource waiting to be used constructively with appreciation for so many community needs a growing Kingston charitable fund again I could speak for an hour and importance of that sector as well and of course I 've only just touched the surface of course one of the exciting things is that you 've allowed yourself to dream long-term you know we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year by the federal government to do a report into the health and medical research in Australia and I was allowed to think forward for 10 years that 's an indulgence that the corporate world and certainly the world of politics doesn 't often none to give us but it is important to take the time to think long-term every now and then interestingly around the world particularly the developing world places like China is start by thinking long term and end by thinking short too we often feel very disconnected to the federal government we read about a little front pages of the newspapers every day it 's a long way away it makes decisions that are necessarily directly affect us constantly the state gets a bit closer it provides schools hospitals and police force but not a day goes by where typically there 's not some interaction or appreciation for what goes on at the local government level they collect their rubbish twice a week the roads hopefully are well maintained and open the local government here has got a vision the council visually as a first dynamic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a thriving economy now that 's great that 's a great set of words but actually what does it mean for us as individuals well I 've got an answer to that because I think such a vision providing such an environment means that we as individuals can actually and Oliver Slade a rewarding and fulfilling life with lots of opportunities to get back and deep down surely we all aspire to be happy in some way and happiness i 'm sure starts with feeling we are element that we fulfilled that we 're doing something of value and of course living in a place that supports all of that I referred to my sister died awhile and said that she had intellectual disability she 's married to someone over similar intellectual nature of the event under 12 each of the value of independently I live on the Mornington Peninsula they do their own shopping and I make many of their own decisions they occasionally go for a swimming on a hot day if they feel like it they can be very funny in their own ways and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people that interact with them on what analysis they should have been institutionalized many many many years ago put-away looked after by our standards but in many respects many of their decision-making capacity taken away one of the reasons that they live a relatively independent life is because of the support of local government local government that provides many of the things that they need weekly care provision of parks the maintenance of beaches assistance for transport assistance of various groups that they 're involved in particularly senior citizens my stepsister around her brother-in-law do not take any of these for granted we all have our own needs and wishes of an expectations of of a local government and what I certainly do hope is this next election the federal election approaches is that we have the opportunity as a nation as a whole to to have embraced in the Constitution the important relevance and appropriate funding of the Lee of the sector of local government again I commend everyone has had anything to do with this extraordinary document I repeat do not take it for granted don 't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the stable relation is doing it 's extraordinarily significant the importance is to actually retain or in fact to note that its title is living Kingston 2035 it has to be a living document if we the need for further consultation as the years go by feedback councillor Bradley 's is absolutely right it 's important to have a vision to have a plan to march forward I would just add to that slightly and to be reflective of the fact that we live in a dynamic world things change me and to continue to keep in touch in the way that this council has in recent months with them with its community and one day when I 'm 80 I hope that perhaps I can still get out my little boat and sail off either karrimor Chelsea parkdale amore elegant enjoy your beaches and perhaps look back because that would be 2035 to a time quite some years ago when this document was put in place in the community made a commitment to try and keep this part of the world as precious and we 'll sustained as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diversity of thoughts experiences and what a great example of how a clear vision where people work together collaboratively can lead to significant sincere and achievements and outcomes obviously Simon has experienced those things I only go on the train when I go to the football at Etihad Stadium that 's an experience coming overs even better but it does remind us that it is a passing parade of community life and expectations on the train and perhaps we all should do it more often there 's certainly lots of suggestions and lots of ideas about our direction in the future Simon again thank you very much for those great words particular about local government local government and any other governments you 're right they do make down the bottom and some people most people are in it not for themselves they 're in it for the right reasons and that doesn 't quite often get recognized so why is a vision important to council on what 's our role we 're not required to produce a community vision it 's not required in the act we produce an annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're very proud of that because because it did the right thing ok so those of you who don 't know we the award we achieve for the best annual important we 're going to Gold Award for the past five years but we beat all the big organizations in Australia because as the judges said we didn 't just tell them all good things we 've done we also told them we didn 't reach our goals or our achievements and told them why we didn 't hide anything was open and it was transparent because if we 're not required to produce a plan but we believe it to be an important part of our community engagement and our the ship words that we refer to quite a lot in Kingston because it will provide us us with direction for the council not just for now but in the long term and in the future the vision and research has already been used to help us develop some of our key priorities and strategies in the next four years and as Simon referred to in the inner corporate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vision is this building most of you some of you will remember what it was like only a couple of years ago thanks to a partnership and a community idea and suggestion and council vision it was a very old book it was originally a knitting mill or a young bill that night done with 12 stage parachutes during the War and was then transformed by the former Maudie other council into a community theatre and it progressed along and it did it cinnamon again there 's some and said you 've got to be prepared to change things and move things a lot of it it SAT there it did its thing it was lovely for the local community very comfortable but it certainly didn 't meet the standards of what we required it was very unsafe if I remember when we visited it looked out the back so council had a vision it had a plan it then addressed it in partnership with again the support of the state government and the community it was transformed into this fantastic I 'd quality and community facility that we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm really pleased to be here tonight as part of your function because it is your function to launch our council for years strategic plan 2013 17 with a course the vision it 's part of the overarching one vision document that you all receive tonight and we will go on and review that that vision but we 'll certainly use it as we explain in planning our future over the next four years will focus on six key goals which will closely align with those in the Kingston 2035 vision and underpinning each of these goals as a series of outcomes which I think articulates what council wants to achieve in the strategies on how we 're going to achieve them some of them are and that 's what we want and the community ones they want facilities that are well used and accessible we 're going to do that by continuing to grow and develop the facilities in the spaces we have and increase them where possible we 're going to progress development of our community hubs we 've already started that process in back down udas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings and facilities that we have as I said and increase the opportunities for access by our community we want to see green which is playing in improve for future generations we 're going to continue to advocate for removal of the landfill sites are there at the moment of life on our community a part of history they have the tip sites and the landfill site came because they were origin people needed the sand to build the buildings we live in it progressed we now have to move on from that we 're going to develop the chain pact we want to facilitate connected and effective community groups and we 'll do that by community engagement and also one out to be an effective voice for our community these are just some of the examples on how our council through a delivery of the plan will contribute to the future vision of Kingston over the next four years will report back to the community we plan to do a quarterly and then every year through our annual report of course what happens after four years how will the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relevant it needs to be reviewed and excitement again said that if you can have plan but it changes just as the community changes it changes every year it 's planned of course for an integration of the Living Kingston 2035 vision and the council playing 2013 17 into one document and that one document will be called one vision this means will always be at the front of our thinking and our processes there is always strategy in the council plan ensures will be kept and reviewed and updated that part of the process and through all of this and of course it 's hoped that by everyone 's continuing engagement and involvement you will ensure you are community that it 's kept alive because it 's your work it 's not as as a council it 's the community 's work as was highlighted all those ideas and all that work came from the community said there are three reference panels going to my panelists going to make a superb presentation tonight I 'd now like to welcome our third presenter Elizabeth Steve Stevenson who 's going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can get involved Christine supposed to be a new knee doesn 't seem to be working tonight thank you everybody thank you one my name is Christine Stephenson and I 'm one of the thirty percent who live in Kingston who were born overseas I 've came a new Australian that 25 years ago and I have lived in Kingston for around 19 of those years I was drawn to Kingston because it reminded me of my homeland where we had and where I had always looked close to the late and so I 've come to Kingston because I enjoy walking on the beaches in the winter and I find the cold wind grey skies and the sea is at less than your face and then the summer those beautiful warm evenings when you can spend the night sitting on the beach watching the Sun go down surrounded by families all enjoying the same thing I have been fortunate that I 've been able to work in the area for a few years but predominantly I 've been what I call alleged or resident where I 've left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come home at night but five years ago I was retrieved and I was suddenly given this wonderful opportunity to actually spend more time and pen and to start contributing to the local community and I was very fortunate that I was able to participate and the governance of the children community center they welcomed me in and I certainly enjoyed the time that I was able to spend working with them good unfortunately work has again taken me back out of the city of kingston until I find that I have less time for that however I have been able to work with the reference panel and I have thoroughly enjoyed every moment of it as I know other members of the reference panel have we 've heard from Simon tonight as he 's been talking about the importance of the vision being a real document of it being compelling and having engaging things and I believe that that 's what we have produced but now it 's a case of bringing it to life and trying to make sure that it continues to live and grow over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bringing this vision to life and sustaining it and a lot of them are in this room counselor Bradley 's has spoken of the commitment the council has to the vision through the inclusion of the outcomes of the vision of the four-year cancer plan and is representative some members of the Kingston Council community you and I all have an opportunity to support and grow the vision the vision has been dreamed discussed and finally written down and I now hand the baton over to all of you to continue to individually and collectively make sure that the vision grows and is represented in the community basically it 's time to turn this project into a business-as-usual event you have been given tonight or if you haven 't please make sure you click them on the way out and the document together with a USB stick and on this very small device is everything that you need to help spread the word of the one version know of the Living Kingston 2035 all the data on research is now just at your fingertips or at least on blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ versions of the vision a description of the research that 's been sorted into 10 failings detailed reports that came back from each of the wards that we visited and spoke to and one overall report of every idea collected when it 's printed out it truly stands about that thick but on the USB you will be able to cut and I since license based too difficult adds content the data and research is really important when you combine this data with the vast demographic details that are already available on the Kingston Council website you have an invaluable resource to help you and your organization create plans and visions that will complement the council 's four years strategic then and ensure that the outcome is in line with what they 're planning for the next 20 years if as an organization you are applying for funding to the council I would strongly recommend that you use some of the data that is gathered that you make sure that your funding presentations are in line with the vision that the council has ensure that your requests complement loving Kingston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all the council strategic plans on the website every call there will be any number of plans that are subject to this vision and so their overall performance and adherence to live in Kingston vision will be reported in the annual report every year but to succeed the community must also commit to the visions principles finally thank you to all who have participated in this project the result is yours to own and as Simon said you should all celebrate the success but to be truly successful we all need to continue to work together council community and private sector we need to use the information wisely and continue to grow and provide the community with everything that they want they enjoy love and that they can be proud of so finally please take the packs back to your community share the vision use the data plan big

Australia",1123,I was elected to Kingston Council in two thousand and served three terms before finally deciding to retire at the end of 2008 I was mayor for four years of that term again in 2002 and I served three terms back-to-back between 2000 and anything for through to 2007 it was a really long gig I suppose the main focus for me was always to be able to feel that I was I had the ability to build strong communities to work with the community so that the community felt very very connected with a sense of belonging and a real pride in where they lived to me that that was always what it was about I was started on the City of Kingston Council in two thousand and I ran through all the way through to 2013 I was elected on four occasions and I was mayor on four occasions also so I had quite a lengthy stay on the City of Kingston is quite a privilege and a joy I had a real desire to make a difference in the local area that I grew up in I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of things that we felt as a community wasn 't well represented on council I thought that hopefully a local person the local voice understood the issues knew the connections in that community could represent at the council and really push the case to make sure that the Clarinda Ward got represented and got the facilities resources and services that deserved my name is Bill Dixon I started on council in 1982 with more tle council served as mayor in 1986 287 well the most thing rewarding about being a local councillor was meeting the people meeting the grips you got invited to a lot of groups and you got to meet the whole community and was broken up into three wards so you knew your ward better than any other so i was pretty dizzy meeting people going out to word to meetings and there was great enjoyment here there are always our challenges of course with with the role and you hear about them on quite a constant constant basis but most of them I think we 're really very positive every day brings up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity to learn from a personal point of view and something that I would always advise anybody thinking of standing for Council and indeed long-term counselors it 's necessary to look after yourself the time commitment can be quite enormous as much or as little time as you want to put into it but you really do have to strike that that right balance work life balance the golden rule is always the golden rule no matter where you are family first council second other committee said so make sure that you don 't put yourself under too much pressure I think the challenges were the frustration that you can 't do it all at once you cannot do everything for everyone and you 'd love to so you need to prioritize by analyzing the information that 's provided by the officers and in general through all the departments that you have you were able to then make a informed decision to make sure that you put the best foot forward and deliver the services and facilities and all the things that community needs to have a wonderful city to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any new cancer coming in to perhaps have a really good understanding of the role of the counselor as it applies through the local government act to totally understand where the where your role starts and where it ends it can be very very confusing understanding the difference for many councils I think they have that difficulty understanding where the operational side of things begins and ends and where the more strategic and the policy direction lies and that 's of course where councilors should be you know one thing I would have been a lot happier to sort of understand is to answer a bit more bit dynamics of cancel it obviously is an environment on council where you need to get the support of others to back proposals or thoughts or ideas or strategies that you want to implement I think being upfront I think being clear about your ideas but you know also this thing into what others want early on because that put you in good stead so that you 've got a good relationship and that you can come up with with ideas and solutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think earlier if I 'd actually understood and have been advised to read the local laws as it related to meeting procedure your elected and auto soon you find yourself in the chamber and for many who haven 't ever been in that formal position understanding how how that plays out is critical I didn 't understand councils maybe so you just say for the first three months I just attended the meetings read the books picked up what the others were doing learn the different type of debate with counsel that was the most challenging knowing when to speak and where not to speak the person that makes a really good counselor in my view is somebody that is passionate about the area they represents you always keep in mind that yeah objectively in order for you to achieve some of the things you think are important and must happen for the area other people have different points of view it 's about working out ways that you can tease all the issues out put the best plans on in place so that you can then have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local community you can have two lots with the difference of opinion they can debate hard and though but after that you 've got to move on with the result and make it the best result again you don 't you 're so close to the issues at times it is very very difficult to get a perspective on things and to celebrate the successes and not to beat yourself up too much when things go wrong as they do learn from your mistakes and don 't be too hard on yourself that 's what I 'm saying actually have fun it 's a great opportunity to be able to serve and to be able to represent your community enjoy really enjoy

encourage and help and support business we 've got around seven nine and a half thousand people employed in the manufacturing sector that area is concentrated largely through Dingley more elegant braeside it would be aware that the in general the Australian automotive industry is winding down a lot of the components that go to make up your family car come from this area they 're small components often you don 't see within the vehicle but for a number of years that 's that 's been a provider of employment I think we 've had around 163 firms latest measure who are involved and over the next couple of years they 're their jobs that simply aren 't going to exist so we 've had to as a council get involved and do two things we 've had to see where we can help businesses shift their skill sets and their their abilities into other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to make sure that the businesses that aren 't in that sector but as well supported as possible now there 's an expectation in the business world that you can communicate and in an area where we really need that and that is this manufacturing industrial area we simply haven 't got it and it 's been one of the focuses of this council of light to lobby the federal government and try and get the state government involved as well because they all recognize the need for this provision but it 's simply not here now and we 're as far as we 're concerned that 's not good enough and we 're not going to accept it because what the businesses here provide is jobs for the whole community we want people to be able to work send their children to school enjoy living in Kingston have all the amenity and provision so as a council we 've taken the we 've taken the stand that we 're not just involved with the with the parks and the roadways and the footpaths like it has been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tier that 's closest to the people and we 're closest to the business so we 've been working with those businesses and working on their behalf to give you a little bit more background I 'm joined by the owner of new lab Michael orsal who 's joined me today thanks Michael for having us here would you just like to tell us a little bit about how this lack of high-speed broadband and we can call it the NBN it doesn 't matter what it what it 's the cost is to your business well our business predominantly were involved in printing so we 're at digital printer servicing the whole of Australia and New Zealand and ninety-nine point nine percent of our work arrives in the internet we 're dealing with professional photographers b2b and government and advertising agencies so we work on a just-in-time method so you have a client who rings you up from New Zealand says I 've just sent you my order have you got it said no we 're still waiting for it we 've got a dozen adsl two lines coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything just slows down so what happens is that if we can get the work out on time the client says look I can tag the risk so I 'll just send it somewhere locally so we didn 't get the work just ask you in terms of your industry your competitors in other states or other countries or wherever your competitors are located they 're not working under the same burden that you are in terms of not having that high-speed broadband is it is it placing you at a competitive disadvantage well it definitely is because there are areas where people already have a high speed internet and especially from overseas we tried to to deal with overseas countries and we did for a while but we 're getting a reasonable amount of work from USA and I 've got friends who have similar businesses there they 've got t1 and t2 lines and they tell them a variety is held to and their laugh at us they said how do you work in your business I have had on a couple of occasions reason to talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 've shared similar stories is that as a group of businesses in this industrial area is that is it a common place not just in photography businesses but just in a broader range of firms definitely is because many businesses here are high-tech businesses and they all get they all reliant on the internet and we 've got manufacturing plants we 've got laser cutting they all get their files and internet from their customers and if they can 't get it fast enough all businesses now under pressure to produced faster so we 've heard a lot about high speed broadband it 's it 's one it 's a terribly important aspect of businesses Michael very kindly shared he 's his situation with us recently the CEO John Evans and I went to Canberra and spoke to eight senior ministers all their advisors about the need for changes to occur in terms of availability of high speed broadband in this area we will be pursuing each of those ministers until we can bring about the change we know needs to happen there 's many other aspects to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different sorts of businesses so as a council we 're getting involved where we can we have CEOs roundtables we have business workshops we support the Melbourne business awards where in terms of our planning working with businesses when they need to make changes and they need to make changes quickly because that means jobs it doesn 't matter what business you 're involved in with your work for a business with your own a business if you 've got a suggestion if you 've

3192, Australia",1262,as you can see or at the top now this is a first week we 're just sketching up the tree here and then we 're going to start painting this afternoon so looking forward to it getting pretty exciting I 'm roughly chopping up this ocean beach city scape and aroma scene just gives me a rough idea of where I 'm at make sure I 'm fitting everything onto the world properly and then when I start actually painting it in it just saves me a bit of time there are few weeks into this project now can see it we 've got to clean a walkway now so we can stand back and have a look at this mural with lay down all the base bill which is what you see here this shape geometric sort of shape and pattern on the wall a big part of this project was that we want to engage with the local community and big part of local community is being interrupted with the young teenagers that are very interested in this type of art and a lot of them come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the educational school system so we can provide them an opportunity to sort of run a bit of a mentoring program and get them thinking that what they can do if they put their minds to something positive I think art therapy is fantastic and I know that it got me through a lot of hard times when I was that age and therefore I know it works would probably be relevant to children that 's it and so we really wanted to incorporate this historical component into the word what stage now where we 've been stuck it into the nitty-gritty and start getting all the detail and the imagery overlapping these are these big geometric patterns and all should start to really come together over the next couple of weeks so this week we 're moving on progressing on the cityscape and then today I 'm going to be working on the ocean in this section and this will come all the way across here and this will be my foreground bush area here and then this is where the curtain gets film and this would be all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sketched up some of this stuff last night the idea is to get a basic outline up in the wall and it 's more or less we just use it as a guide so during the day when we come and fill it in we have the exact proportions up on the wall and that makes her life a lot easier rather than by I trying to actually get the proportions and everything in perspective it 's good old-fashioned projector they 'll take it split at 20 years old those me the absolute world of favors as you can see the last week or so we 've really got some progression going now all these historical sections really start to come together but all the signage starting to happen there my little beach scene coming along as well being really good for the kids though to see this whole progression and see how it out starts from such a small sketch up to to the finished piece these guys were mentoring them with this project we 're also going to help them produce these we 're going to paint some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto the wires and they 're going to be produced acquires the National Youth Week it 's more rewarding if you have two people that I recognized his stuff a little bit of feedback as well why not just the sort of sketch that you see yourself I don 't like it in two weeks that 's not the top of this gum tree nice and high up in the air so yeah just had a few bit bit more shading and bit more texture up there and then that whole sections done and we can start working this bottom fish just been adding lots of detail by plants so this will still get laid up a little bit more here then just including a bit more specific native plants for the area you can see here we 've got the curtain coming in now so this is where the this whole section gets drawn back from the the flora and fauna so this is looking really amazing Andrews been working on Trevor Barker just got the wings in there and halo golf image at the top there and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the fun bit I 've kind of graffiti motifs that we 're running through the area I think for us this is really important that this will really help deter the kids from wanting to touch it or target I 've already had lots of great comments from some of the local kids about how happy they are there 's some of this stuff going on the mural as well here we are the final day of our project being here for well over two months now chipping away at it having opportunities like this should be well embraced and we only hope that it goes further so we look forward to seeing what comes to this is definitely and I mean it 's been really great the support we 've got from the council and from from the construction company and from just from the local local people in general I mean the feedbacks been awesome very impressed it 's the yam it 's it 's it 's a lot bigger when you get up close to it as well like it 's huge amount of work and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street art thing and then you 've also got like the realistic images of cheltenham valley I really like the broad section here just around the football player I think the colors are really beautiful and the seascape and v view of beautiful and definitely the bird at the end of the tree they 're probably my fav i lo cierren nicely shows it off because it is an historic area every time you look at them to see something else it depicts the areas so much the attention to detail on the way they 've been able to merge all the different historical elements in such a way that 's really really impressive I think it 's absolutely outstanding it really shows children over that its development its involvement from the market garden days gift to the community and it becomes a feature and it 's lovely and it 's a talking point and it 's great for families and kids and it 's just a lovely thing to have on a wall instead of graffiti today was a wrap it was excellent we had the mayor come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was good to see the level of excitement was amazing to have the barca

no thanks mr man i 'm very happy with the ceo 's report okay no further queries can i have a show of hands on the ceo 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the infrastructure and planning directorates bonnie dunes streetscape project the responsible officer is manager of the planning environment melissa crane councillors to have any questions or queries in relation to this item council of slavery uh yes just uh stating that i am a resident of uh body doom mr mayor just getting that clear so there 's any perceived conflicts so put that on the table uh ms crane uh the balance of the 50 000 that he 's currently allocated will that go into construction or will that go into further design through you mr mayor the intent is that um the balance will be able to use be used to implement some of the actions straight out of it so we 're anticipating that yes it would go into construction of whatever is necessary what would be the highest priority um out of that plan in the first instance so through you mr mayor just to be clear on that um if if the funds are not spent in this financial year or committed this financial year council would need to re-budget that in the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to be mindful of that miss crane okay so just a follow-up question regarding that i mean given uh as outlined in the ceo 's report there were a number of deferred projects and carryover projects uh what is the likelihood of that being affected in terms of our carryover policy so um our council 's carrier over policy says if if council funds are committed so there 's a contract or in place or commitment in place that becomes a carry forward project if there 's no commitment the funds are not spent but the intent is to continue or start that that project in the next financial year then it would be a deferred project and and in our draft budget coming to councillors for discussion in the next week or so there are a number of projects that have been re-budgeted for next year so i 'm going back to this this project it would be important that the funds that are not committed this financial year are re-budgeted to be construction um in accordance with the action actions coming out of the plan okay so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the budget also uh allocated fifty thousand dollars to the dofs bay streetscape so uh that design has been completed and accounted for so that design at the moment is up for public comment so the design has been worked up between the goffs bay progress association and council and now it 's it 's been advertised i think this is the last week that we 're calling for public comment on what um council and the progress association think is a good plan but just testing that with the broader community and the intent is then to get on with it so the um the view is that a lot of those projects will be completed by the 30th of june thank you no further questions thanks uh council sladen any other queries or questions [Music] in that case can i have a motion in relation to this agenda minor council holcomb other council approve the allocation of 22 000 from the bonnie dunes street skate budget to the planning environment strategic planning you need to undertake preparation the bonnie doing structure plan to provide certainty you 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council hulking hawking partner seconder council sladden council holcomb do you wish to

visit information service review councillors do we have any questions about this review council web mr mayor um the implementation plan is a pretty significant body of work um and i know you 've flagged to increase efts particularly around the social media side of things do you think the work could be actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order to execute the plan those few points of meeting extra staff is really something that will need to be reviewed and those items are really for the second year of implementation um social so the two efts it 's not a complete it 's not a full eft um it will be for social media and the upgrade of the website so at the moment for the first year we will be able to do it within in-house with the stuff that we have but we will be doing a review to see what is required okay great um and just to clarify we 're a pretty high visitation area generally um is the intention here not to necessarily increase the amount of visitors but just to increase that average spend is that the plan that is one of the main objectives yes to increase spend of division that we have and increase their knowledge of different products around our shire excellent no further questions thank you any more questions counsellors no in that case can i have a motion in relation to item 13.3.2 webb thanks mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mansfield visitor servicing review report 2021 delivered by the tilma group and endorses the mansfield visitor servicing implementation plan 2022 as contained an attachment to thanks councillor webb as a seconder councillor sladden councillor webb do you wish to speak to the motion just a couple of points um i think this has been a long time coming um just the visitor servicing uh and in general the structure of our tourism uh direction in general so i think it 's a really important step because as i mentioned in my questions we we are a very high visit visitation area but it 's it 's without direction so if we can put some structure and some plans in place which um directs our visitors to areas that we want them to go we can increase that average spend and all of our local businesses will benefit as a whole thank you thanks councilweb council sladen uh thank you mr mayor uh just endorsing councillor webb 's comments uh it is critical that we do have a plan for this rather than let it happen around us and that we @ @ @ @

other council 's wish to speak to the motion no in that case i 'll put it to about all those in favor of the motion motion is carried thanks miss van biver item 13.3.3 is the loan borrowing 2021-22 the responsible officer is manager of business and performance and anthony smith anthony are you uh are you there hi anthony uh anthony can you hear me we can see you but we can 't hear you and can you hear us wave your hand through you mr mayor um rit uh coordinator has just gone to see mr smith to see if he can assist with his sound that 's right thank you i 'm sure he will reappear shortly nope still nothing maybe two anthony can you hear us because we can hear you yep i can hear i can hear you now hi anthony how are you well thank you apologies that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're looking at uh uh item 13.3.3 the loan borrowings for 20 21 22. uh so councillors is there any questions uh in regards to this to uh mr smith councillor ravi yeah thanks mr mayor g 'day anthony i 've just got a question about the um australian [Music] sorry the treasury fund generally could you talk me through that if they got a reserve bank plus one and a half percent rate on top of that how do how do they operate yeah they um they don 't they operate similar to that but their rates and um percentages over and above aren 't as high so they have um they have their interest rate plus i think it 's 0.15 of a percent that goes on and that covers all costs so there 's no there 's no signing fee there 's no application fee it 's a straight administrative fee to borrow through treasury called victoria yeah thank you councillor holcomb thanks just a minute um anthony just following on from that question is the rate with tcv right now is it 2.2 percent uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was about two weeks ago for this sort of loan was 2.6 so because of all the movements in the market financial marketplace we won 't know the actual rate until the day that we actually lock in the borrowings so that 2.6 may move up or down um the four percent which was quoted in the report that would be if you went through one of the australian banks so that 's a comparison so when when do you when what 's the earliest we can lock in that borrowing rate well once once we get the decision um one way or the other from council tonight we need to just look at where the works are at and when we need to borrow so the locking in rate is that different to the drawing down right sorry the locking in time frame is that different to the draw down time frame were the words right there so we would lock in the rate and it might be today we might then draw down say in a week 's time right because at two point two percent you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe so we would then if the money if the funds aren 't required we would invest those funds to try and reduce that overall interest cost to council correct to me it 's almost a no-brainer be honest thanks that 's that 's an amazing rate so thank you thanks council holdings thanks anthony thanks anthony thank you councillor webb thanks mr mayor um and this is probably a question more towards ms crane um i know construction industry in general a lot of cost blowouts and estimates um over the last 12 months this borrowing of 2.632 will that fall in line with the project still is that that 's still going to cover the amount for you mr mayor from my understanding there is contingencies in place within the estimated budget for the project that will be accounted for so should there be an unplanned expenditure that the funds that have been requested will cover the cost of the of the project very good thank you there 's no further questions councillors can i have a motion in relation to this item counselor holcomb uh thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council notes the planned borrowings of two million six hundred thirty two thousand as prescribed in the twenty one twenty two budget it notes the loan of two million six hundred twenty thirty two thousands to fund cap council 's couple works program authorized the ceo and mayor on behalf of council to execute the necessary loan more mortgage documentation sign and serve if necessary

officer is the ceo caitlyn conrad councillors do we have any questions or queries in relation to this agenda item counselor sladden thank you mr mayor uh just the one to uh ms conrick in the office 's report it says that the red enzyme flag will replace the aboriginal flag is that correct for you mr mayor it 's saying that if castle was to fly the flag on on the day nominated it would have to take down the aboriginal flag because castle has two flag poles at the front of its office so the other australian flag would still fly it has priority over the flags and the aboriginal flag would come down so my understanding is from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ australian flag before the current one i 'm just wondering why that wouldn 't replace that yes um that is correct council sladden i think the report talks about when the other flag was officially nominated as the flag of australia um it still takes precedence so that is the formal flag and that is the flag that flies first irrespective of any other flag so it still is the flag that cats would need to fly the aboriginal flag flag would come down and council would fly this flag and would we need to consult with uh tongarang for example um well council would be can take the flag down for a day and fly we still supply other the aboriginal flag and and the torres strait islander flag at the vic vic which council does so um council has the authority to take down the aboriginal flag and fly another one for a particular day thank you thanks council slatten any other questions counsellors no in that case can i have a motion in relation to this gender item thanks mr mayor uh recommendation being that council declined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council buildings and reconsider the proposal if approval is given by the victorian government to

allies supplied with raw materials arms ammunition fuel food and all the necessities of a nation such as australia or the uk by the end of the first world war more than 3 000 british flag merchant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merchant seamen had died in world war ii they sustained a considerably greater casualty rate than almost every other branch of the armed services and suffered great hardship seamen raged from 14 through to the late 70s it 's calculated that up to 185 000 men served in the merchant merchant navy during the second world war of which 36 749 seamen were lost to enemy action 5720 were taken prisoner and 4707 were wounded totally 47 176 casualties a minimum casualty rate of over 25 27 of merchant seamen died through enemy action alone the widows have killed seaman often found out their husbands or fathers were killed by the harsh surprise of not receiving their paycheck because if the ship was sunk they were off pay similarly if they were in a in a lifeboat they would deem to be off pay as well on the west gate bridge thick roads fly the australian and victorian flags daily no other flags are ever flown except for naidoc week 4th to the 11th of july when the aboriginal

department of transport to have the australian red engine fly on the west gate bridge on merchant navy day on the 3rd of september each year in recognition of the significant contribution the merchant navy has played in the development and ongoing life in victoria it 's an estimate it 's estimated that six merchant navy seaman died to one naval seamen we owe our freedoms in part to these brave men

report uh councils who have any questions or queries in relation to this report council arabi now just uh bear with me mr mayor on working out this new system that we have we 're going paperless in the uh here so i 've just got to find ceo 's report here we go um all right yeah kayleen i just got a couple of questions um the family violence on um uh 0.9 the community health and wellbeing i see that there 's zero counselling sessions for january on assuming that that may have been because we 're closed is that right for you mr mayor that is correct counselor robbie there would have been staff on leave in january yeah okay um no worries and just this one here trying to get on page 26 the emergency relief for the mansfield and district welfare group um there were nine requests in december for assistance and in january there were 15 requests um do you got any idea why they would be nearly twice as many nearly twice as many but more requests in january @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have over the christmas period more requests so through you mr mayor um to councillor rabbi the mansfield and district welfare group is a a group that meets of which our financial counsellor is a member of and that 's where these figures come from i would have to take that question on notice however i would um would add though january is often a very difficult month for families post christmas so some families spend quite a bit around christmas and and there 's more hardship in that month following christmas um so and as it said it talks about 200 for education the build up again to school school uniforms getting ready for school so i 'm assuming it 's probably relatively normal um it 's it is a difficult month for families that vulnerable families and families that are struggling but i will take the note the question on notice and provide you with a further response yeah thanks that 's just the figures jumped out at me and uh page 23 um i have to refer this to kirsten i 'm not sure but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using so that would be the grader have has that greater actually been purchased and in use now through you mr mayo i will refer to our general manager of infrastructure and planning and she may have an update thank you uh yes it has been uh well it 's contracted for purchase i don 't think it 's actually arrived on site yet but it it will very soon i think where it 's eagerly awaited wonderful looking forward to that um and then the last question kaylene is on page 19 with our revenue services i see that their debtors over 90 days has decreased significantly and i 'm assuming um that may be a developer 's contribution is that correct um through you mr may i do know of a developer contribution that was coming in and and i 'm assuming that has been paid but again i will take the detail i 'll take that question on notice to get you with some to provide you with some detail um i also know that um right there was a rates installment um let me take that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the detail after the meeting thank you thanks mr may thanks madam ceo thanks councillor ravi councillor holcombe uh thank you mr smith um and through you mr mayor this is a minor question but it 's a fairly uh uh volatile topic in town in terms of signage uh i said that there 's two application statutory planning applications for construction for internally illuminated business identification signage where are they through you mr mayor i 'll refer to the general manager of infrastructure and planning she may have the answer she may have to take it on notice thank you sorry i 'll have to take that one on notice our planning manager melissa crane would be probably in the waiting room but uh yeah i might take that one on notice i think thank you thank you thanks councilman councillor webb thanks mr mayor um a couple of comments from me firstly uh i know i was hassling a fair bit at our council meetings last year to get good reports on our youth services and i 'm very very happy uh to see some really interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are taking part of so thank you thank you very much um just one question from me regarding the capital works program lots of carryover and deferred projects are starting to pop up madam ceo is that usually just due to um staffing issues and covert delays is there anything else which would be impacting those at the moment for you mr mayor um no i think that is correct and if councillors recall there has was a backlog of capital works um projects from previous years that the year that was carryover as well so it 's quite a substantial workload for this financial year and we have been extremely challenged with resourcing and and covert so it 's a combination one of those we 've heard the statement a lot lately perfect storm um but as as you will note in the report there is some of them have got possible carryovers so the team is working really hard and i might pass over the general manager of infrastructure and planning to comment further because they 're doing an excellent job trying to get through a very very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mr mayor um that spot on and uh it 's one of the big gaps that was in the team as our capital works coordinator one of the positions we 've had difficulty filling and i 'm very pleased to say that our new coordinator is on board and he 's hit the ground running and he 's been here with for a week so we certainly will be doing as kailyn suggested trying to recover as many as we can now that we 've got a full team there excellent um i 'd also just like to say i 'm glad that we are managing to fulfill our obligations with the orange door for the family services referrals it 's really encouraging i 'm glad that 's the case that 's all for me thank you thanks councillor web um kirsten maybe if you could just turn your volume up slightly uh if possible yeah it 's a little bit fine um council slavin uh thank you mr mayor um this will probably also get deferred to uh general manager of interstructure and planning and um i 'll preempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war between goffs bay and bonnie doon however the streetscape projects um have been in the pipeline for a number of years now and i 'm concerned to see that the body doing one has been held over until dos bay get their um act together so to speak uh can i just ask what the hold up is with both of those um streetscape works because as i say they 're um they 're about two years old now i believe thank you council sladden and through you mr may i will refer to our general manager to respond thank you problems um can you hopefully this is loud enough um yes we have been working hard with both with both communities with the bonnie june one it was look it has been primarily a resourcing issue just you know needing to stage works through the year but we have had conversations with community members there we do have someone working on it and um and uh melissa crane our planning manager is also involved uh um to try and help the community in terms of coming up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um we will be meeting again with them very soon i haven 't yet set up a time frame but we do want to keep that one along because we we know that it 's really important to the community there so we 're certainly not playing favorites oh no no no i certainly wasn 't suggesting that you were it 's just it was interesting that the bonnie doom one may be carried over again it 's only because we started on it later um the the goffs bay they already had some really concrete ideas about what they wanted to see and that they had approached council with it um with bonnie dean uh we 've had probably a more mixed feedback from the the local community there so we really want to work through that and make sure that we 've got a good holistic plan that they 're all happy with so um we certainly will be doing that okay thank you very much alexander that 's it mr mayor uh thanks and thanks council sladden um any other queries counsellors in relation to yeah councillor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that your activation of the outdoor funding the items that are listed there is a fantastic list of items across the whole a whole lot of different areas in our shower and it is if we can see what 's already been done in the median strip and that looks fantastic and has really

place to live in in the future thanks councillor abi councillor webb would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly reflecting on councillor rabbi 's points as well completely endorse his points i do want to add to it though that this is a proponent-driven amendment which means that somebody 's come to council with this idea and this is excellent and this is this is uh good planning and good economic development at work um attracting investments in tracting developments in our town which work within our plan certainly we know that we are short on houses that 's not a secret this will help relieve that pain a little bit as much as possible uh and i also did find out to last last week that we have uh obviously we have the largest growth rate but we also have the largest amount of subdivisions in

and uh good evening councillors um i 'd just like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's still got a couple of patients he 's just texted me so i 'm speaking on behalf of mansfield matters group tonight we say that the proposed amendment c-51 in a nutshell is a tidy-up of the past planning scheme it 's an acknowledgement of what 's developed and been permitted to develop over 100 years in particular reference to along courier street where the majority of the residential dwellings are certainly overwhelmingly houses um we think it 's a very good opportunity to deliver on a whole of township approach this c-51 amendment and it 's needed to provide clear policy and direction for mansfield 's future we say that c-51 also has to be very strong in the language that it brings without any loopholes to provide clear instruction and direction we need it so that ratepayers dollars the shire and the community time is not being endlessly wasted with the conflict that we 've seen over the last recent years and the the inconsistencies and the openness for interpretation this is a good chance to tidy it up and to make it really clear for both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth for the town and the right direction for the town as we 're moving forward and it will also bring an opportunity to stop unintended consequences arising from interpretations of wording that may or may not change over time so to be short and sweet tonight we just want to say that mansfield matters group supports the planning office 's recommendation the c51 part two we also recommend we also support part one but that 's not going to the panel hearing um and we also want to say that we will stand by you and we will vigorously participate in any panel hearing um if it is voted to proceed thank you thanks miss lynch that was great um councils any questions from miss lynch no questions no well thank you for your attendance tonight thank you thank you thank you all right councillors um so do we have any

that 's fine okay no that 's that 's good um and so oh there you are i can see you now ross welcome um and uh you have three minutes i 'll just also like to welcome tim burger who 's just come in welcome tim to the meeting um so ross you have three minutes to speak sorry councillor sladden thank you mr mayor um i 'm just wanting to ask the question does uh or do the draytons have they been made aware of the um information that has come through to councillors regarding the change in the motion for this item a good point councillor sladen yes would you like to sorry russ no we 're unaware man right um it might save us some time if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do that yes thank you councillor flooding through you mr mayor um since the council agenda was published there were some late changes to the information they 're in um which will require a change to the resolution um the key points are that the objection that have been lodged to the application has been withdrawn there are now no objections to the planning permit application and that a referral response from goldman valley water was received with a requirement for a few conditions so i do have an updated motion for council mr mayor if you 'd like me to read that out or now or later i 'm not sure um yeah uh perhaps we 'll hear from ross first um and then we will uh get that after that thanks tim so ross um given that uh news um you have three minutes and if you 'd like to speak uh well yeah go ahead uh mayor councils and shire officers thank you so much i i have a written proposal if you would allow me to read from that if it 's okay but given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat superfluous what i was going to put forward it was in essence suggesting that we had complied with all the laws we 've purchased the land in the zoning in compliance we 've worked closely with our planning officer and your team who have done an outstanding job to get us where we are today and we thank them sincerely we were going to raise our particular concerns of the objections um because we felt it was an inference that we weren 't particularly people of good character and we would object to that we 're both highly regarded people i was a nominee and the citizen of the year this year for our community i 'm past president of rotary i 'm a fellow of australian new zealand institute of managers and leaders where i i work with and assist mba graduates my wife is a highly skilled business person um we do a lot of work with rotary i 'm in the rural fire brigade i 'm a member of ag force our agricultural community out here so we are good people um we just wanted council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a a test of someone 's good good community is not what you 're looking to it 's the planning issues but the reference by the objective made us feel that there was some suggestion we may not have been good at citizens and we are quite the opposite we are good citizens we work hard for our community because community is only what you make it to be and if you 're prepared to invest in it it 'll be what you want it to be and thank you council thank you for your time and we were in mansfield only recently uh enjoying uh discussions with our neighbours in mary jig and they 're all looking forward to the construction of a beautiful big facility a wonderful big log home that will tie into the community very nicely we all believe thank you for your time there thank you councillors and officers thanks um thanks ross um councillors you have any questions for ross no no questions so that 's um that 's good thanks very much ross and andrea and good luck with your with your application @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a motion in relation to thanks mr mayor um i do have the updated wording of the motion if it 's just a bit easier for me to read out the amended parts mr mayor would you prefer that yeah that 's fine go ahead um so the motion i will be moving um the wording will be the same as tonight 's agenda however there will be some changes the first change being that uh in the first line instead of a notice of decision it is that council will be issuing a planning permit in addition to that there 's an additional clause under golden valley water at point 13 provision of separate water supply meter to the development located at the property boundary and to the satisfaction of the golden valley region water corporation 14 connection of all sanitary fixtures with the development to reticulated sewage at the developers expense in accordance to the standards of construction adopted by and to the satisfaction of the golden valley region water corporation all works required are to be carried out in accordance with as3500.2 sanitary plumbing and drainage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section 15 discharge of trade waste from the development shall be subject to a trade waste consent agreement the owner and or occupier is required to submit a completed trade waste application and install the required pre-treatment facility to the satisfaction of goldman valley water 's trade waste section before approval to discharge trade waste from the development into the corporations saw is granted all other points in the recommendation will be as part of the motion mr mayor thanks uh councillor webb uh can i have a second to the motion councillor sladden councillor webb do you wish to speak to this motion and no thank you mr man councillor slade in a second that do you wish to speak i cancelled slavery you 'll have to turn your microphone on that 's a good idea thank you very much i 'd still like to hear from mr burger but i 'm um yeah i 'm happy to move out to second this motion thank you thanks councillor slatten uh councillor what slaven what would you like to hear from mr berger about uh just on um the changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you it 's the clarity thank you through you mr mayor uh so the reason for the change in the first line is that now that there are no longer any objections to the application we are no longer obliged to issue a notice of decision so notice a decision is where objectives are notified of council 's position and can seek a review of a decision at vcat if they wish obviously as there 's no objectors there 's no need for such a notice to be granted anymore and in relation to the additional conditions uh goulburn valley water responded to the referral uh outside of time and after the report had been finalized so that those conditions reflect the request to goldman valley water for those to be put onto any permit issued thank you thanks mr burger thanks council sladden uh would is there any other councils that like to speak to this motion no in that case i will put the motion all those in favor against the motion is carried thanks uh mr berger i know you 're staying with us anyway for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ application p11921 development of a replacement dwelling at 575 mount buller road mansfield uh councillors do we have any questions or queries uh to the responsible officer coordinator of statutory planning tim berger councillor rabbi yeah through you mr mayor um hi tim and welcome i believe that this is the only reason this is in front of councillors now is because it triggers the uh one million dollar um cost of works is that correct no other reason through you mr mayor yes that 's correct counselor robbie so it 's a very vanilla application and your recommendation is to pass it yeah that 's right counselor robbie thank you thanks councillor councillor holcomb yeah just a quick a couple of questions mr burger um three miss smith uh i 've just got a question with respect to the amended plans and particularly with respect to the the landscaping type type of uh conditions that put on this and i notice that 's also the uh there 's almost identical conditions have been put on the uh development in the parking development analysis street as well but there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we just approved can you tell me why what and the detail the landscape conditions that seem pretty honest i mean in terms of you getting down to the level of the minimum pot size uh it just seems to me far too much detail and i just wonder is it is it a vanilla um and i had to be cynical is it a cut and paste uh a job that 's been done with both this one and the next one but not with the previous one um how does that all work uh thank you councillor holcomb and through you mr uh mr mayor um so in relation to this application specifically so the application has been put forward um if you i have the plans in front of me at hand and part of that is landscaping along boundaries in a revegetation zone within the front half of the block um part of the reasons for the specifics of those conditions is essentially the planning permits become enforceable so while i have no doubt that this applicant will do all that is required under the permit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to measure against were something to not be not be done correctly the idea of pot sizes and tree heights as well is to make sure that again not doubting that these people this applicant will do everything as proposed but that someone who plants vegetation or landscape screening doesn 't say put in a little tube stock tree that won 't have any effect for 10 or 20 years so it 's to set a standard as to get that landscaping effect so in this application given the bulk of the development and that proposal from the permit applicants to do that revegetation that 's why this condition is here in relation to the next application vegetation was one of the key considerations of the assessment and that 's why a similar condition has been placed on that recommendation in relation to the previous application the council has just passed in that instance the landscaping screening was not determined by the assessing officer to be required nor were there any objections about landscaping that application was considered to meet the requirements of the significant landscape overlay without the need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinction as to why the condition is on this application and the one coming up next but not on the one that council has just passed sorry again through you mr mayor um so just so was there um objections to the landscaping for this one three mr man no no council hulken no no no that 's right the landscaping that is shown on those plans was presented was in the advertised material right but so there are no prior projections objections about what had to be done with landscaping there or anything like that no chance for homecoming right okay thank you mister thank you miss bird thanks mark thanks miss berger um any further uh any further queries in regards to this item in that case can i have a motion for item uh where are we 13.2.5 councillor holcomb uh can i take it as mr american we take it as read that the uh yeah you you can cancel them that the recommendation is on page 31 31 uh 32-33 [Music] so i moved the notion that uh as is written on pages 31 32-33 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ councillor holding do you wish to speak to the motion uh no i have no further comment on him thanks man councillor arbi uh no thanks mr me and you would have liked to have heard it read mr mayor yeah i wouldn 't have here at midnight we might pay for [Music] yeah um would anyone else like to speak to the motion in that case i 'll put the motion uh all those in favor motion is carried item 13.2.6 is a planning permit application p 0 9121 development of buildings and works associated with medical center 38 hyatt street mansfield uh responsible officer is coordinator statute planning tim berger uh councillors do we have any questions in relation to item 13.2.6 councillor rarbie yeah thanks mr mitt um i suppose the only question i have is uh will the proposed works interfere or put any undue pressure on our stormwater drainage through you mr mayor thank you councillor robbie council 's engineering department have not raised any concerns about the capacity of the stormwater system so it is ultimately an extension or an addition i suppose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard stand area so in that respect the actual site itself isn 't really losing any permeability and the loss as a result of the car parking alterations can be accommodated within the existing network thanks mr berger thank you mr mayor thanks councillor robbie councillor holcomb i thank you mrs man and three mr very question mr berger again um is there any uh can you give me an assurance that there 's no costs going to be incurred by a council in this application through you mr yes counselor holcomb so the costs of the realignment of the titles to best land within council or costs associated with that will be required to be met by the permit holder and this despite it being construction on a uh on this on the street itself there 's nothing there nothing there that counts no costs there the council will incur no councillor holcomb so the developer is proposing to construct that at 100 of their cost look i think it 's probably stating the obvious but longer-term maintenance would obviously fall to council in general um as it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and any defect periods in the life would be covered by the developer thank you thanks for subscribing uh thank you mr mayor uh mr berger uh the um you say that the ongoing costs of the parking the way i read the your report that all maintenance costs for car parking is it only on site that they are responsible for the maintenance of three mr mayor uh yes councillor sladden so there 's a proposed or it 's existing in retrospect car park at the rear of 36 hyatt street so the condition i believe it 's condition nine that relates to the maintenance and provision of that car path relates to car park on 36 hyatt street and that that maintenance must be made available and maintenance covered by the medical center operator whether it be the current operator or a subsequent operator so that only extends to the car parking on private land thank you thanks councilman councillor holcomb yeah mr smith um again just uh through you miss me um another further question mr burger um i just noticed that the uh the landscaping requirement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different environments um is is there any reason why they 're almost identical landscape requirements thank you councillor holcomb through you mr mayor uh in terms of condition wording essentially we use fairly standard conditions on most permits and then make any amendments to suit so for example the previous application the council passed a reference to the revegetation zones in that frontage whereas this condition then references the alsa street road reserve uh the reason this condition is recommended as part of this application is because the streetscape impacts from the development including the car parking on the road reserve are such that it was our assessment that landscaping would be required to soften that to offset that loss of grass and impacts onto the verge okay thank you thanks council welcome thanks mr burger council is earning more questions for mr berger now in that case can i have a motion in relation to i team item 13.2.6 council arabi thanks mr mayor i would like to propose a motion as stated in our council agenda tonight on page 37 38 ages 39 40 and [Music] 41 please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um that will be sufficient do i have a second of that motion uh counselor sladden um counselor rabbi would you like to speak to the motion it 's a rather long motion yeah just just briefly thanks mr mayor and other council officers have done a lot of work on this and there was some uh unusual concern about the deciduous trees and glad to see that there there 's uh it 's been recognized part of mansfield 's beauty on on our streetscape is our deciduous trees which provide shade and they look fantastic also like to um also say that this will help i suppose with parking and disabled parking access to a medical clinic which is um something that we with our aging community that we 're happy to support so thanks very much mr mean thanks council arabi uh council sladden and secondary i need to say that that 's this will uh to my way of thinking improve that corner and um hopefully it will assist with the traffic congestion that we now see in alessa street um with that complicated in my view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i think it 'll be a great improvement thank you thanks council so any other council 's wish to speak to this motion no in that case i 'll uh put the motion all those in favor against the motion is carried item 13.2.7 is the statutory planning delegations review a responsible officer again is coordinator of statutory planning tim berger councillors do we have any questions in relation to this item no um can i have a motion in relation to 13.2.7 councillor webb thanks mr mayor motion being that council endorses statutory planning applications referral to council policy 2022 thanks council weapon of secondary council sladden council web do you wish to speak to this motion uh just to say it 's good to tidy up some of these uh policies slapping in the wind and it 's just a uh just something good to get done and sorted in a way thanks council webcaster sladen no any other councils wish to speak to this item no in that case i 'll put the motion all those in favor against motion is carried thank you um and thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the finance report for the 1st of july 2021 to the 31st of december 2021 the responsible officer is the manager of business and performance anthony smith welcome anthony welcome anthony thank you mr mayor uh good to have you on board anthony we just uh opened up item 13.3.1 the finance report and i was going to ask councillors if they have any questions of you in relation to this report councillors uh councillor sladen uh thank you mr mayor mr smith i 've just got one question in relation to the dual court stadium and this is in the capital works um favorable and unfavorable uh results and i 'm hoping you can clarify for me the outstanding grant allocation of one point uh whatever it was uh million and then we 've got the understand for the project not completed at one point something else do they cancel each other out yeah through through the mayor council of slatten they do virtually cancel each other out one 's on the expenditure side which hasn 't hit the accounts yet and the grant hasn 't come in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to remember the exact figures um because the favorable variance or the under spend is about 1.6 right so and the incomes just over 1 million so it 's a variance of about 500 000 between the two right and it 's probably not fair to ask you this question but maybe um ms alexander can help us out so that 500 is the project complete or is there still work to be completed can you answer that one uh council through you mr mayor yeah can you hear me cancel something um vaguely yeah sorry there 's a problem with my microphone tonight yes it is complete but we haven 't yet as i understand it received an invoice from the victorian school building authority who were the project managers on the project so i think we 're awaiting that invoice before we can actually complete the grant acquittal and claim the final payment right okay okay yep that explains it thank you that 's all thank you thanks councillors councillor robbie yeah thanks mr mayor um it may be not a question for mr smith but rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page 47 the major variances um it says that um one of the variances is 390 000 for plant machinery and equipment timing of budget no new vehicles or plant yet purchased which is 316 000 dollars and plant sales income received one hundred and twelve thousand dollars does that mean we 've sold our grader but haven 't received the new grader yes through you mr mayor that is exactly the uh the answer there so when you say not yet purchase we have actually purchased it just hasn 't been delivered so we haven 't been invoiced for it yet so that 's um but we expect as i said earlier that that will happen imminently i don 't have to drill down and ask you when it 's going to be on the road grading our roads then i will definitely get an update from our senior coordinator field services for you and and let you know but it won 't be long yeah thanks thank you very very much mr mayor no more questions thanks councillor abby uh councillor webb thanks mr mayor uh just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is pretty well long in the tooth now that delay in getting the payment is that typical or is it just for the course for you mr mayor um our whanau acquittal hasn 't been submitted yet where there 's a time frame for that and we 're just working on it 's quite a complex acquittal um because there 's all salaries of course so staff are working through that acquittal as we speak great thank you councillor holcomb uh thank you mr smith um and through you mr mayor a question to uh mr smith and maybe to the ceo i find these reports uh particularly year-to-day ones really difficult to read and understand and they never seem as straightforward as it 's certainly reports i 'm used to reading financial approach on history um so that so you have to excuse my ignorance um that if i look year to date it 's really hard to tell year to date where we are in this business in terms of actual year today financially personally i find it really hard if i look at and it 's and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patterns or anything there but if i go to if you look at the uh four year forecast it looks as though we 're going to be and this is a big call and uh but smack on budget uh and full credit to um mr smith and the ceo and all the staff for achieving that i just want to know how confident you are of going from where we are now to being smack on budget we 're so close to smack on budgets not funny so are you in the end forecast mr mayor you 've hit on two two key key elements of the budget that um both anthony and i have been discussing in length over the last couple of weeks and also including the general manager infrastructure and planning as we start developing next year 's budget so there 's two aspects the timing as you mentioned so year to date relies on good phasing throughout the year and understanding when payments are due and expenditure is due to be paid and forecast relies on on staff experience so i 'm going to hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his experience there and where he thinks we 're at and i 'm quite happy to to assist again um anthony that 's that 's required thank you yep thank you kailyn um through the chair at the moment we are currently going through and developing the 2223 budget and what we 've requested all those that have budget responsibilities we 've been working with them and asking them to go through and accurately review their forecasts we will be in a better position when we start talking to you in relation to that budget around how that forecast figure that we see there today which is very close to the original budget i do anticipate that it will move slightly but at this stage in developing the budget and discussions nothing 's come forward to i suppose you know raise that um that red traffic light that says oh you 've got an issue here so that 's where we 're at there and we will continually monitor the forecasting as we go through that budget process so when council finally adopts the budget they 'll be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah thanks um um and i understand i understand what you 're saying but in and you sort of touched on it in the um interests of no surprises uh is there anything that uh in any of those items that look a bit soft or that we 're not going to achieve that you think are you through you mr mayor i i believe there will be ups and downs right through the budget um and that 's i think what mr smith 's referring to in terms of good forecasting um that 's really occurring now we 're trying to really appreciate from each staff member there 'll be there 'll be ups and downs but um in terms of the overall budget there 's nothing that 's jumping out at us at this point in time thanks madam ceo um and just taking that a step further the other one that sort of interests personally and also i think uh based on what we 've also got in the pipeline for various projects the casper the cash position looks pretty good um how confident are you with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass over to mr smith to respond to that thank you thank you and through through the chair at this stage we 're very confident with that cash position we currently do still have and have maintained for most of this financial year investments of around 11 million dollars so the cash flow has been quite well and quite well managed um it 's also um noting that even with the covert and the impacts with with our rate payers and some have been on on arrangements they 've generally have been caught up and we 're slightly ahead of where we were 12 months ago without any arrears that 's really good news thank you mr smith thanks councillor holcomb councillor sadden uh thanks mr mayor this is a question for the ceo um ms conrad the the addition of your well the ceo statement to the financial report is that a requirement of the new act um i through you mr mayor thank you for the question council sladden um i i believe it is and i 'll pass over just to mr smith to to confirm that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you yeah through through the chair that is correct that the ceo must make a statement um at the end of the second quarter so for those just that court of ending december the ceo must make that statement and advise counsel thank you because i 've never seen it before that 's why okay thank you thanks any more questions counselors no in that case can i have a motion in relation to item 13.3.1 council arabi thanks mr mayor move the motion one received the year-to-date finance report for the period of 1st of july 2021 to the 31st of december 2021 and 2 note the statement by the chief executive officer that a revised budget will not be required for the 2021-22 financial year thanks councillor rabi uh secondary do you wish to speak to the motion just briefly um in the attachment um of the finance report uh the bottom line is in green which is you know black for 28 percent up i 'm happy with that i think the um the business is looking good and i 'm pleased that we 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks madam ceo for your report councillor sladen uh [Music] i need to say that the community is looking good thank you thanks council sudden uh any other councillors wish to speak to this motion councillor holcomb yeah thank you mr mayor yeah i 'd just like to add that uh those numbers if we come into that budget uh particularly encouraging and uh there 's a way to go but they look very strong and considering all the doomsdays at the start when we did this went through this budget process that 's a result which justifies the position that the council took at the time for accepting the budget thank you thanks councillor holcomb uh any other speakers no in that case i 'll put the motion all those in favor motion is carried thanks mr smith for your attendance thank you mr mayor uh moving along item 13.3.2 the outline communities infrastructure fund grant outcome and assessment panel recommendations the responsible officer is the coordinator of community development claire berghoffer hi claire welcome and saskia welcome to you too councillors do we have any questions or queries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i do have one query sorry in relation claire if you could just run us through table 1.1 the um you have a score and a panel ranking um and they don 't correlate with each other at times i just wonder if you could give an explanation as to how the final decision came about giving those given those scores and rankings sure through you mr mayor the assessment was a two-stage process so the panel reviewed the applications and scored individually then they met to discuss each application reviewing the comments that had been made using knowledge sharing and then agreed on a fair ranking of applications to produce the recommendations which is why you see a slight difference thank you yeah because they yeah they don 't realign with with each other do they in some situations so you looked at each proposal objectively and subjectively to get to that result correct thank you uh councillor holcomb did you have a query yeah i just it 's more of an observation um the mutant cam draft is a really interesting one from my perspective in a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real opportunity i think for the shy um how i read it that means there 's three camp drafts in this shire there 's mary check magic mansfield and merton i don 't think i know of any other rural area in australia which has three camp drafts in the one shot and camp drafting across rural australia in region rural australia definitely and even regional australia is one of the fastest growing sports so it 's a huge effort to have a uh three camp drops in our shire it 's something that 's worthwhile capitalizing on in terms of camp draft capital of australia that 's that 's sort of that 's how big it is in terms of uh and you 'll be flooded with uh um nominations for that just like they are with um it 's not they get so many riders it 's difficult to getting cattle um for these camp drafts but they are a huge event with people coming from all over victoria uh and from them from new south wales as well they 'll be here so it 's it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps you could donate some of your cattle to the upcoming merton campus happy to do so james this is a community gesture happy to do sir great great to hear um councillor you must make a comment uh no it 's a question just clarification just regarding the merton camp draft given that it 's um for facility infrastructure improvement who is the actual applicant is it the management committee of the recreation reserve to you mr mary um the organization is martin camp draft and they work closely with the merton rec reserve so they have approval from them because it 's the wreck reserve of merton that answers your question merton campdraft is an incorporated body it is okay thank you thanks council slavin any other questions in relation to this item now in that case can i have a motion in relation to item 13.3.2 councillor holcomb i 'd like to move the motion the council received the assessment panel report for the outline communities infrastructure fund 2021-22 that they provided the council provided grant to the tommy community social club an upgrade of twenty thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provides the merton camp draft with a grant of twenty thousand dollars to improve sport and recreation facilities at merton recreation reserve they count council provide a grant to the goffs bay area progress association for the golf space shelter and barbecue fund funded at fifty percent of the applied amount that being ten thousand dollars to cover costs to build a shelter and finally right to all applicants to thank the groups for their time commitment in making an application to the fund thanks council holcomb can i have a seconder for that councillor rabi council holcomb do you wish to speak to the motion yeah i 'd just like to it 's terrific that we 've had such a response to this um from a real diversity of groups uh and from different areas of the shire so it shows the value of these uh outline community infrastructure fund funds themselves uh it 's a shame that we can 't give money to everyone because there 's a lot of a number of other applicants there that are well worth funding as well but we just encourage those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're as good as this year you never know your luck i 'd also like to acknowledge the work of saskia and claire and the other members of your group who decided on this well done uh it 's a greater range a great array of very worthy uh community events so thank you thanks councillor holcomb councillor ravi is seconded he used to speak promotion thanks mr mayor i totally endorsed councillor holcomb 's comments i see a correlation here from our bus trip the bus trip that the all the councillors and council officers um undertook when we were voted in to represent our community and it 's great i don 't want to single one out but it 's great to see the ptolemy community receiving some help for the great space up there as councillor holcomb said be disappointing for some people to miss out but there are opportunities thank you very much thanks councillor robbie anyone else like to speak to the motion counselor webb thanks mr man um certainly in dersen endorsing the comments um of councillor holcomb councillor robbie um regarding this particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these community groups have put an enormous amount of effort into these applications and as noted on on the agenda the the quality of the applications was very very high so those who weren 't successful in this round of funding shouldn 't be dissuaded and shouldn 't be decided at all they 've done an enormous amount of work here and they will be able to use that work to apply again to another fund when it comes up so sometimes you have to play the long game here but certainly each one of these applicants were deserving um of receiving some money for their community groups uh and the the best applicants won but don 't be disarmed thanks councillor webb um there 's no further comments i 'll put this motion all those in favor of the motion motion is passed uh thank you saskia and thank you claire um item 14 is the assembly of councillors councillors can i have a recommendation a motion sorry council arabi uh thanks mr mayor the council

my grandfather the light gym team was mayor then so uh uh one particular story that uh i was interested in reading from memoirs just recently was that when uh he first joined council uh there was 14 councillors in the mansfield shire then and it 's been whittled down to five now so we 've got a lot more responsibility than those guys uh did back then and uh he also noted that uh uh council meetings were held on a full moon in in that time and beforehand so that after a full day 's meeting and a couple of drinks after they were able to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't have so uh it 's a it 's

family has in this community uh i would like to thank uh as james said uh everyone in the shire who was involved in the election it was a quite competitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debated and fought in uh

office will mean i will have less family time to share with them and they understand that and they still support it moving ahead i think now more than ever is the time that we need to work together

second otherwise nothing will be achieved but i know that this group of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you i now ask council elect steve ravi to come forward and declare his oath of office uh i steve

thank you through you mr mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the infrastructure and planning she may have some understanding there thank you miss kane great thank you through you mr mayor um i 'm not sure as

imagining it 's a cyclical thing but i can certainly confirm that for you okay thank you councillor rabbi yeah thanks mr man um through you on page 18 um of the report like to bring that to the attention of the mansfield residents that the um the land information certificates which is a a basically a view on how many properties are being sold in our district is up by 43.75 cent this year on last year it 's a big increase on everyone in manchester knows that there 's been the real estate has boomed since covert and i for one and i 'm sure the council are keeping their eye on on those lics for our budget um and one other question i have um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of requests for road maintenance um with a road maintenance so i expect that 's probably because of the the wild weather we 've been experiencing lately and lots of rain and potholes emerging for you mr mayor that would be a reasonable assumption councillor barbie yeah thanks thanks son madam ceo thank you mr me thanks councillor arby if there 's no more uh councillor holcomb uh through you missed me i 'd just like to make a comment the um it looks like the library has really bounced back in the last since july um

be care make sure we 're taking extra care with those facilities we 'll make a couple of additional small changes to the incorporated plan to reflect the specifics of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perspective so i 'd like to respectfully request that the um result their recommendation as put towards you tonight may be amended um to include um at point um where 0.1.3 where it says amend the incorporated plan um to show bus zones and additional access is indicative only and then add an additional section that says add details about the heritage structures on the master plan and include reference to the commercial one and general residential one zones on part of the land and that will allow us to put the amendment up with those additional small changes just to reflect the heritage values a bit more specifically within that plan thank you thank you thanks melissa thanks councillor ravi uh any other comments counselor webb thanks mr mayor um just a general comment uh for those watching this is an incredibly important piece of work for the station precinct master plan uh this is the first domino to fall that will help us push this plan along so it 's really really really

have a motion in relation to item 13.2.1 councillor webb thanks mr mayor um i do wish to move the uh motion as recommended in the agenda with uh amendments uh as follows i wish to amend the dot point uh that starts with the sentence amend the incorporated plan to show bus zones and additional accesses as indicative only and at the line add details about the heritage structures on the master plan

webb can i have a secondary council of holcomb councillor where would you like to speak any more to the motion no further thanks mr mayor councillor holcomb yeah um yeah i just like to say that this

been put forward have all been responded to by um mr crane and her department and and responded and resolved satisfactorily so the community is very much behind what this [Music] motion is all about

councillor holcomb thank you mr mayor i 'd just like to thank uh sasquatch for her work through this project it hasn 't been an easy one uh it 's just because of the time that uh it was spread over uh because it was all done i think right from the start with respect to being on zoom so that 's been difficult in itself um and it 's also had such a mixture and such a large number of members on the committee it i 'm sure from her perspective it hasn 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on sticking with it getting through it and getting the results that she got i 'd also say that some of the feedback from the surveys from my perspective has been chairman of for some time were really relevant and so we need to learn from some of that feedback and make sure we take that on for the future committees like this where there 's a large community involvement thank you mr mayor thanks councillor holcomb uh no further speakers then i 'll put this motion to avoid all those in favor of the motion against motion is carry thanks saskia all right uh item 13.3.2 is the scoping study for the mansfield emergency services precinct a responsible officer is the general manager of community and cooperative services kurt uh welcome and um uh councillors do we have any questions or comments in relation to this agenda item counselor holcomb uh just in terms of the next stage uh in this i just want to ask a question about the um just a bit uh concerned about how the the next stage of the 720 000 funding and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or how where is that coming from might be a better way to phrase that uh through you mr mayor um in terms of council holcomb 's question uh there is an uh a funding application under the black summer bushfire funding a federal government funding grant that was has been previously submitted to to the assessment authorities we 're looking for a response from them in january february of next year and it is our hope that that funding can be used to pay for the next feasibility study and then looking into the detailed design for for that project thanks thank you is there any community money involved in that uh not at this stage council welcome thank you councillor avi yeah thanks mr man um kurt we were all at the um the presentation of this report which i thought was um pretty pretty good was a wonderful report in fact i was initially concerned about the land not being large enough my concern in that area in that regard has been laid by the fact that these guys that wrote this report really know what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the to the next part of this um thanks kurt to just want to shout out to you thanks kurt for organizing those guys to come and give us the report a couple of weeks ago um i was very impressed i thank you mr mayor thanks councillor rabi any more comments questions no in that case i 'll ask for a uh a motion in regards to this agenda item counselor holcomb uh thank you i 'd like to move motion the council receives a stage one mansfield emergency services precinct scoping study uh that it endorses the recommendations of the scoping study report for the mansfield emergency services precinct and it authorized the chief executive officer to identify explore advocate for and accept opportunities to fund the feasibility study and if possible detailed design stage of the emergency services precinct thanks councillor holcomb i have a second after that motion council arabi council hulken would you like to speak to the motion uh yes i would thank you mr man um this item uh and this motion is extremely important to me it was one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place and it was one of my election promises so it 's very close to me the reason i stood for council goes almost back to this meeting back in 2018 uh whereby this yards was going to be sold by the previous council and the debacle that arose from that and what followed on from that uh and how divisive the community was against council at that point in time is one of the reasons why i stood for council so i think this is really important for the community but that stays the council wasn 't listening to the community and i think now i 'd like to think that this council is very much listening to the community the consultation uh that aura has risen in this project in the last 12 months or a little bit longer has been excellent to say the least we 've seen a community group driving this uh they 're very passionate about it and they 've maintained the momentum going forward [Music] they certainly have the majority of the community behind them i think the study that was done uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well put together concise and he gave very clear outcomes for us as a council to follow one of which was that the emergency services precinct should be located at the sale yards and that to me was also just a justification and confirms the community mood that it should be set uh located at the stadium which has been their their position right from the start so i 'm going to totally endorse the study uh and really look forward to the second staging of this which uh hopefully we 'll get that funding for uh i 'd also like to acknowledge the fact that the community group behind mr mansfield emergency service precinct committee put their own money into that as well into this study and that 's a credit to them and i thank them for all the work that they 've done on this project today thank you mr moon thanks council holcomb councillor ravi would you like to speak as seconder thanks mr mayor i would um next year 's my 20th year in the cfa i 've been to some fairly large fires in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have all our all our emergency services in one area this this is going to be a game changer for mansfield in my view as people drive into mansfield they 'll see the ambulance victoria ses and eventually the cfa mansfield community radio in the one area it will give them a level of confidence and comfort and it is definitely in the right spot there couldn 't be a better spot for this um and i commend the efforts to the community group that work so tirelessly and hard to to push this their agenda to get this through and i 'm just absolutely overjoyed in the fact that that we 've got this far i 'm looking forward to the next phase of this and uh raising some money and getting some money off both governments with any luck with election years coming up so thanks mr mayor i think i 've said enough thank you yeah thanks councillor abby would anyone else to like to speak the motion council sladden uh thank you mr mayor i 'd actually like to make an amendment to the motion okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word and that is an item at point number two that cancel notes the recommendations of the scope and study report instead of endorses the recommendations uh councillors uh do you all understand that council is okay so councillor sladen you have moved are you moving the motion yes without a memory yep okay so counselor notes the recommendation so mr mayor you need to call for a secondary secondary please yeah do we have a secondary to the motion to the amendment the amendment sorry yes council of web councillor sladen would you like to speak to the amended notion yes thank you um mr mayor um as both councillors uh holcomb and uh rather you 've said this is a um this is a very good report uh the presentation that council received um uh was in in fact very well uh delivered um my concern is uh that the location still needs further work and still needs further community consultation um i have been contacted by many members of the emergency services um ses cfa and ambulance um who have clearly stated and long-term members of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um and it is not the right location because of the size even though the report says that the size is there here we are in you know 2020 going into 2022 we 're seeing the growth that is happening within the shire and the size of such a complex i believe will quickly outgrow what is the footprint of the sail yard site secondly given that we have an alternate site which is lakins road where it is planned in the future that a large incident control center will be constructed where incidents will be controlled by which will involve all emergency services and again going back to the report the report says yes ses are in favor ambulance victoria are in favor but the cfa have not committed and neither has police so we 've got two services uh which are ready to go particularly ses and cfa working with delwood department of environment land water and planning it makes sense of a co-location with them the sale yard site is not big enough for the delaware operation um so i yeah i i think we well not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the site um that 's why i 'm saying uh note instead of endorsed the recommendations of the report thank you mr mayor thanks councillor sladen uh councillor webb is second to the motion jewish to speak yes um yeah look marrying a lot of of council satan 's comments um i too have been contacted by a number of of people in in these emergency services and and they 're not sold on the location of the site um not to say that that 's not the most ideal site um i think it 's premature to lock ourselves in as council into the recommendations of the scoping study not discounting the study at all i think it 's excellent and really well thought out but by changing the wording here it certainly does give us as council a little more a little more latitude to move as the plan develops uh it 's not putting a stop to this it will continue pushing through at the same rate and i think it 's uh just a uh a risk a low risk way to push this through thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak to the amended motion no for no further speakers to the uh amended motion then i 'll put oh sorry councillor arby yeah i 'm speaking against the amended motion this has been going on for far too long and i 'm not playing politics with this one i 'm just going to vote to have it where the community want it and i think i 've said enough on that thank you mr may just to be clear it is an amendment not a motion at this stage an amendment to the motion yes just an amendment yep uh any further speakers the amendment in the motion no further speakers then i will uh i 'll put this motion amended motion to the vote all those in favor of the motion amended motion all those against the amended motion that the motion is defeated i 'd like a division on that please mr mayor point of order uh point of art that was just the um the amendment now you have to go back to the original motion yeah yes thanks yeah thanks councillor sladen that 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ councillors do i have a motion in relation to yeah i don 't know yeah you

original estimate was for five thousand dollars for a full one day hearing um the hearing was able to be completed in less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact with him or my uh con representative within the justice department estimates that uh it 'll be in the vicinity of three thousand dollars and yes uh sorry mr ernik can we get uh as councillors can we get uh the full summary of those costs when

certainly a waste of ratepay money and and the result was totally dismissed uh furthers my uh thoughts on the matter it clearly and that shows it but the arbitrator obviously found that it was also a waste of time so um as i said it 's a waste of white power right uh ways to rate paying money in my view thank you mr mayor thanks council how can anyone else like to speak to the motion no in that

through as lip service to an act i like to see um implementation plans and i guess metrics attached to this kind of thing um so just flagging it with executives that if we 're going to put a policy in place we 'd like to see improvement in the area and and ways to measure it going forward thanks councillor webb if i can respond please mr mayor the annual report requires us to report on gender equity and in terms of the gen the commission we are obligated to present gender data and um and our data is just about to be submitted and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present a um a action plan i 'm looking at our coordinated governance governance and risk who may be able to even contribute to that further for you mr mayor i can enhance and confirm what madam ceo has just said we have a deadline to submit gender data by december 31 the idea is that that data is to inform our action plan which we have to submit by march 31 we are then going to be doing this at two years time and the expectation is that we will have progressed in this area so in to answer your question i think we can give you comfort to know that we are implementing this policy not as lip service but with data and

thank you councillor volkering uh madame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doll uh confirming i have no conflict of interest thank you i also have no conflicts of interest thank you we will move on to item number seven which which is the presentation of reports first report is 7.1 mansfield shire business recovery plan we have a report there for you councillors do we have any questions please counselor ocarina questions to our interim general manager uh yeah look i i was uh just a little bit uh confused by some of the data in the urban enterprise report it mentioned i think 980 000 visitors to mansfield that that visitation figure is that just to mansfield or mansfield shire and does it include mount bulla mount sterling because if that 980 000 is the figure being used it 's way off what we had been told by uh tourism north east i think the figure was up around 1.86 million visitors including mount fuller mount sterling if it doesn 't include mount fuller man selling i can kind of accept the 980. thank you um jenny or um our ceo kailyn would you like to answer that question please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the figures confirmed but i do know the lake elden master plan talks about 900 visitors to the lake ildon region so i 'm assuming that it it doesn 't cover um much more than mansfield shine because it wouldn 't the lake gildan plain covers the whole of lake building including the area in marindindi and that 's got 900 000 on that in that plan so i 'm assuming it should be a lot more if we 're including mount buller in particular thank you thank you very much um councillors councillor valkyrie are you are you uh seeking questions generally about the report the action plan if you have any just if you have any questions of um the offices that 's all prior to putting the motion uh i 'm just a little bit of a loss i 've read through the report and got just a comment i find it a little bit underwhelming to be honest um for what it doesn 't say as much as what it does say for example there 's scant regard for now below mount sterling i think generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty much the same old same old stuff i don 't see anything in there that really excites me i have to say um the absence of the word technology and new technologies you know i i just get the sense that we 're almost playing a straight back to everything um i think we have to have a point of difference i i like some of the suggestions for example didn 't the action plan down at around action items fifteen point one two and three it 's starting to talk what i around what i think are bigger ticket things um but i think we 're going to come out of covert 19 and things are going to be significantly different for at least the next two to three years before we see the visitor economy back to what it was and i and when i read the report the words uh echo tourism i thought was a little bit light and yet tna had mentioned the importance or the change to more eco-based tourism one of the things that tna mentioned that cat stayed with me was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the regional areas mansfield included really just to almost be consumed by the beauty of the area so they don 't they 're not looking for too much but they just want to be able to come and immerse themselves in what we take for granted every single day and when i read the report i couldn 't figure out how that was going to be activated now i know the the business looking at the businesses but then when i started to dig a bit into the detail around that i found some of the figures really hard to comprehend manufacturing for example is going along okay so as is agriculture but i have to take that data as being 100 accurate because where it 's come from same in in mansfield we 've got some businesses in town here who are going absolutely gangbusters and i suppose overall in retail if you put a an umbrella around retail the downs are probably bringing those that are doing really really well down as well so i i i 'm not sure i 'm i 'm a bit perplexed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council is sort of on the same page as i am with that that 's thank you madam ceo thank you madame i i certainly do have some comments that might assist council vulcan in understanding the premise of the document but i see counselor slams hand is is up and he is on the committee so i 'll i 'll refer you back there uh thanks madam mayor and uh thanks uh councillor paul um i want to uh rebut your uh your comments there firstly i i think it 's a um it 's a well detailed plan um clearly distinguishes between two phases um the first phase being supporting the businesses through our current restrictions and also the second phase being planning for the future and if you do look at the extensive list of recommendations there just picking up on your technology there are many recommendations there relating to digital technology and increased use of and increased cooperation between council and businesses to utilize that technology through the bushfire recovery plan funding there is money set aside for that improved technology coordination and communication and again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the significant highlights and business plan within the lake yield and master plan focuses on two projects which are entirely focused as eco-tourism developments this plan has been advised or has been led by a number of community members and business people that the committee has representation from the district business association from the agricultural sector local business operators tourism operators and uh community members as well um the as i say the the plan that has been set forward i think does set the shire up for when those uh metropolitan centers are open and we do see the influx of people coming back to our area we will be competing with other pro shires shies across the state and having this plan in place i believe uh sets up the shire um quite well to cope with that and for our businesses to respond thank you councillor sladden um madame ceo would you like to add to that because i need to call a motion because i think we 're starting to debate thank you madam me just to respond to councillor baldwin 's and further to council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well the group was also really conscious not to duplicate the echo economic development strategy which which really takes council forward in a number of areas so similar to the lake yield and master plan the economic development strategy still exists so the group was really conscious not to duplicate that but more to dovetail into what exists there and to take some of those actions further and you will in this plan here the one of the big standouts is the tourism plan so it does talk to developing a tourism plan for the whole tourism area thank you madame thank you madam ceo i will call for a motion please counselor sladden move do i have a seconder counselor western door would you like to speak to the motion and add to what you 've already said counselor sladden please uh firstly madam mayor i 'll actually read the motion thank you and that is that 's the council endorsed the mansfield shire council business recovery plan and acknowledge the business and community community uh business and community recovery committee for their work to date in informing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dawg would you like to speak to the motion very briefly if i may madam mayor i 'm encouraged by the fact that the plan does include some very specific projects and some of those around the lake elden activation like the fry 's bay uh ecotourism the goffs bay sewage the mountain bay resort i think it 's a great opportunity for us to take some initiative here and kind of leverage what would otherwise likely be a document that sits on the shelf but using this recovery plan i think we have an opportunity to actually drive some of those initiatives the next step forward thank you do i have anyone wish to speak against the motion i 'll put the motion those in favor carried thank you and we do acknowledge the membership of that group and the hard work that 's been done by the group and the staff and obviously the contractors thank you we moved to item 7.2 declaration of a revised rate do we have any questions of our manager of business and performance ms kennedy please before i call for a motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you confirm that this recommendation that is before us will not have any impact on our budget yes that 's right that 's correct the um the total dollar amount in the budget is correct it 's the actual rate in the dollar the cents in the civ that needs to be revised the total dollars in the budget will stay the same so as a as a follow-up question um it 's not a significant change that uh requires cancel to go back out to the community for consultation on on the budget yes that 's correct so the requirement for a revised budget is if there 's a material impact um of which this will not be yeah again again for ms kennedly um the the impact of not doing this rate change would leave us in if you could confirm that would leave us overcharging our ratepayers and basically we would then be increasing our rate base by more than the allowed amount that 's correct we 'd be in breach of the rate cap so we would we would be in breach of the legislation or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i have someone move the motion please counselor over second counselor western councillor oliver would you mind reading your motion please the council number one repeal the general rates declared on the 4th of august 220 in respect of the 2020-2021

@ @ @ @ @ @ for the consideration of the mayoral term and the election of the mayor but until i do that i would like to provide the outgoing mayor councillor holcomb with the opportunity to address council about his term of mayor and um thank you councillor holcomb thanks mr conrad um i 'd just like to we 'd like to say a few words just as uh as an outgoing mayor and firstly it was a great honor and a privilege to be elected and to serve as mayor of the mansfield shire personally i found it quite demanding and at time and at times very enjoyable and at times very frustrating it gave me great insights into the mechanics of local government which i had very little experience of before but it very clearly showed to me the importance of local government and particularly the importance of a strong fair honest and a positive well-functioning local council and what i thought what we 've seen with mansfield versus what we 've seen around other areas of the state we are almost an outlier in terms of how we 've been fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well functioning and that 's a credit to all the councillors if i look back on the year we started with we all started all the new councils started with a crash course in both local government and in our shire through the induction process that from my perspective was quite intensive there was an awful lot of information given to us to be absorbed and for most of us coming from a zero base it was quite challenging we then got straight through the induction process went into a budget a 10-year financial plan a four-year council plan and a 24-division all massive pieces of planning and all absolutely critical to this council and critical to the period of us as councillors over the next four years i think those plans have really set us up and given us clear guidance and the staff and the organisation clear guidance of where we 're heading as well as the community and the community were very much involved in those plans so it gives me a great deal of comfort that they were involved and that they know where we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those plans as part of those plans and through the year we signed off on an awful lot of initiatives which you tend to forget about until you actually go back and have a close look things like and some of these i think are extremely significant and i 'm very proud of to be part of the zero percentage increase in rates we have we 've had a record funds allocated to road sheeting we passed the resolution for the heavy vehicle bypass to go ahead we commit stage one of the emergency services precinct and basically that study is the initial study is all but completed we supported community groups uh in terms of getting again sorry we supported community groups against the convenience restaurant application and have been very very successful in that opposing that application the community satisfaction surveys that come back on this council were extremely positive and dramatic increase from the low levels low levels achieved in pride in the prior two years we also signed off on significant and are doing so tonight as well on significant planning initiatives some of the as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which are really key to the future of this shire going forward and i 'm very proud to be part of that process to have been part of that process we also put on the agenda the all-around aquatic centre and that 'll be a very interesting project to follow and see where that that leads us to we also got funding and passing got funding for the heritage visitor facility which is a major project and is a key element in activating that whole station precinct plus as councillors know there are a number of initiatives in front of us now which will be decided the next few months which are also obviously almost game game-changing initiatives for this shire none of the above that or none of what i 've just spoken about it was possible without the staff and as councillors as we all know we only have one employee very simple our ceo the relationship between our ceos and councillors is absolutely critical and the relationship between the ceo and mayor is just as critical if we all want a well-functioning council i think the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the fact that the relationship between the ceo and councillors and relationship between myself and the ceo has been extremely positive and from a personal front on my side highly rewarding i 'd like to just touch on that a bit more uh i 've really enjoyed working with the ceo i admire what she 's been through over the last 18 months when she first came into this council i think i 'm being quite i won 't say i 'm going to be quite quite kind in this this council is a mess and if it continued we 'd be in all sorts of strife and how that was going colleen you 've really been instrumental in taking this as a major step forward and you 've done it in a time which has been unprecedented in terms of any form of management in this country or anywhere in the world with a pandemic going on it 's made extremely difficult to manage um there 's no book to follow no textbooks on that it 's been an absolute nightmare to manage and it 's been complicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have come in towards the end of that which has just made it a nightmare for everyone and trying to manage your business it is extremely difficult and a credit to you and and all the staff who who work with you to get through all of that um something that we as counselors extremely thankful for i think the changes in the organization that we 've seen the quality of the staff that that has joined us a lot of them on screen here tonight you thank everyone on screen here tonight with us is a credit to you as a ceo to attract that sort of stuff and i think what we 've also seen is the change in rate payer perception to the council what we saw in the community satisfaction survey and what we all are hearing around town and the feedback we 're getting is extremely positive across all different areas of council 's activities so i 'd just like to say thank you to everyone on stream on screen here from a management perspective to all the staff in the council thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me in the line a whole host of times we had some really interesting discussions which were always challenging that i really enjoyed uh and i think we walked away with a healthy respect for each other i hopefully i did for you anyway um i 'd also like as i said to thank councillors you put up with a whole lot of my learning in this process and i appreciate the patience there and i sincerely wish the new uh mayor all the best and i i will be of whatever assistance i can to make sure that the transition works well for not just for him but for all of councils as well i 'd like to thank one other person uh by name and that 's lisa frick uh lisa has put up with a heck of a lot from me um and it 's been absolutely a pleasure to work with and couldn 't have been more helpful i 'm more speechless with words to say how appreciative i am with with lisa so thank you all uh for everything and let 's just go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got far bigger things to achieve over the next three years and i 'm sure we 'll do it thank you all thank you for helping thank you councillor holcomb councillors the opportunity exists to um address the me the outgoing mayor 's speech and and say some words if you wish would any counselors like to say anything don 't feel that you have to well thank you mark i think you 've done a brilliant job as you said um new to the job um but with the assistance of the ceo and the other staff and uh i admire the way that you spoke about the your admiration and support of the staff so well

you uh thanks uh thanks kaileen and thank you to my fellow councillors for electing me as mayor it 's certainly a great honor and a privilege to represent the best and the most beautiful shire in victoria firstly i 'd i 'd just like to acknowledge the uh excellent efforts of the outgoing mayor councillor holcomb who was certainly thrown in at the deep end newly elected and taking on the mayoral role but being a fine swimmer as he is he quickly worked hard into the role and has set a really solid foundation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ madame ceo uh were tasked with overseeing count through council through a pandemic and a new local government act and i 'm not sure which one was more challenging at times and he has quietly and efficiently proved to be a very good leader this was confirmed as council arabi talked about just before by mr terry barron a local government governance expert who after viewing a recent manchester council meeting commented that they were conducted as good as any if not the best he had seen in recent times and he said that he would be recommending other councils use them as a guide to good meeting procedure so congratulations mark thanks councillor thank you um the uh from my point of view the recent completion of the uh community vision 2040 the council plan the 10-year financial plan and the manchester choir council health and well-being plan and the draft planning strategy has given us an excellent insight in the future requirements and vision of the people of the mansfield shire and central to this is the facilitation of ordinal orderly development the protection of agricultural productivity that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of health and well-being of all of the residents in the shire and i believe that we 're at a critical time in the future of this shy given the extreme growth pressure that we 're experiencing so these points will be a priority for me in the upcoming year i 'd also like to thank the ceo and all council staff for their hard work and dedication over the last very challenging year and i look forward to working alongside them for the next 12 months and lastly i 'd like to thank my wife sarah and and uh my children lily izzy alice and joe who i think excuse me a great source of support guidance and invaluable advice to me in my role over the past 12 months and i 'm sure the next 12 months so thank you um right having said that now move on to um the next item on the agenda which is the uh the election of the deputy mayor so i 'd just like to ask uh ceo we have any nominations in writing for this position madam ceo thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of me here just lost it for a moment um i have a nomination for in writing but i i think probably the council law nominating would probably like to actually um state that nomination i 'll provide the opportunity thank you mayor for that counsellors house for whoever would have a nomination for the position of deputy mayor i 'm nominating uh its position of wtma thanks councillor holcomb do we have a seconder council of rarbie are there any other nominations for deputy mayor being no other nominations i 'd like to um uh seek approval for councillor holcomb as deputy mayor all those in favour the motion of his past congratulations councillor holcomb thank you and i very much look forward to working with uh the new mayor in whatever capacity is required and congratulations james very very much so thanks thanks council holcomb um item 17 on the agenda public question time madam ceo is there any public questions there are no public questions tonight mr mayor um thank you uh item 18 officers reports chief executive officers report do we have any counsellors we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16 value of building permits lodged with council i think there may have been an accounting error in the right column it should add up to four million seventy thousand six thirty eight and if it does and if i am correct that will change the outcome on [Music] page 15 building services uh the total for october being being 4 million and seventy thousand six thirty eight which still shows a slight decline over the month of building permits uh value lodged but still in a healthy position thanks councillor ravi any more questions or queries council holcomb uh just one uh with respect to planning i noticed in the planning permits there was a uh an application for rock extraction um through you madam ceo um can i ask where that is at where that yeah thank you councillor holcomb and through you mr mayor i will pass over to our manager of planning and environment ms kane crane to answer that question please thank you through you mr mayor um we do have an application for a small quarry it 's um there 's some provisions that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work authority requirements i 'm actually not 100 sure of the location but i can certainly find that out and advise you in due course of the address of that property thank you uh if there 's no more questions um councillors do i do we have a motion in relation to item 18.1 on the agenda councillor rabi yeah i 'd like to move the council will receive and note the chief executive officers report for the period 19th of october 2021 to the 9th of november 2021 thanks councillor abu dhabi secondary councillor holcomb councillor ravi would you like to speak to that notion council in that case um can we have a uh show of hands in relation to this motion those in favor those in favor passed barry thank you right the next item on the agenda item 18.2 the adoption of the mansfield planning scheme amendment c-45 stockman rock stockman 's rise rezoning uh the responsible officer is melissa crane and manager of planning and environment councils is there any uh questions or queries in relation to this item councillor robbie thanks mr mayor um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plan of stockman 's rise uh is that the final plan uh that we 're looking at or is that an indicative plan thank you councillor robbie through you mr mayor it is only an indicative plan so any um the rezoning um will any development of that lot will still require a full planning permit to be assessed as part of um the development of that land so that was indicative more to show the size and number of lots that they 're anticipating could be developed there i will note that we have flagged with the developers that we are going to try and look at micro sighting and things like that to minimize impacts on vegetation and the like so whilst it shows a lot a lot layout that 's not necessarily the final layout that will be um approved but any application we receive for subdivision of that will be subject to the normal planning permit process thank you yeah thank you melissa uh councillor sladen thank you mr mayor um ms crane noting the commentary from the catchment management authority what discussions have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through you mr mayor we 've spoken with the um catchment management authority and one of the conversations has a result revolved around putting within the 30 metre setback so we don 't lose too much of the developable land having the road itself within the setback and then you would only have your front yards if anything within the land that was subject to some element of flooding it 's not particularly deep or often and then all houses any buildings particularly would be set well away from any flood prone land itself and they 'll have to provide um a full stormwater management plan for the development of that land to make sure we are dealing with things appropriately and that may include some on-site retardation through tanks and things like that as we go forward so all of those different water sensitive urban design elements will be utilized to minimize any impacts there may possibly be as a result of any flooding because it is very flat out there and the requirement for any buildings to be on a raised bed if you like does that form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with building approvals so through you mr mayor the area of land on this site that are going to be used for dwellings for dwelling development are outside of the flood prone areas so the areas um so they won 't have a specific requirement to be built at a particular height normally if you have a piece a piece of land that 's in a land subject inundation or if it 's in a floodway they 're normally required to build 300 millimeters above the flood level but in this instance because the residential blocks are outside of that they won 't have that particular requirement from a planning perspective thank you the confusion as per um councillor robbie asked regarding is that the final plan it 's hard to distinguish what are residential dwellings or potential residential dwellings and what aren 't so um a bit of caviar dental i think might be required thank you uh councillor holcomb uh through you mr mayor um ms crane the with this the houses that are going to be planned here would they be falling into the category of affordable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mr mayor the um the blocks as once they 're developed won 't need a planning permit to have a house developed on them so there 's no particular requirement for the developer to build houses of a particular kind there is a lot of state government programs that are currently in place to try and pursue and improve affordable housing and the planning scheme also provides for those so there are funding opportunities for companies to do that um the in this instance the because the lot yield is higher the main impact will be that the the lots will be cheaper than they would have been had they been in the large 2000 square meter size so this will provide a cheaper lot than they could have got in this space before if nothing else so that 's that 's how that fits in with the affordable housing from a planning perspective at this point thank you any further questions counsellors um uh councillors i have a uh a motion in relation to idea 18.2.1 council web thanks mr mayor uh motion being that uh council adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section 29 of the planning and environment act 1987 in accordance with the attached amendment c-45 package and submit amendment c-45 to the mansfield planning scheme together with the prescribed information to the minister for planning in accordance with section 31 of the planning and environment act 1987. thanks council levitt we have a secondary council holcomb uh councillor webb would you like to speak to the motion uh my only comment would be it 's good to see uh more lots becoming available for building we all know the pressures on our housing at the moment and the more plans like this can come through the better for the for the whole community thanks councilweb council hulkmann yeah no comment no comment no thank you any other councils wish to comment in that case i 'll put the recommendation the motion to avoid all those in favor against motion is carrying the next item on the agenda is the 18.2.2 c-48 township approaches the responsible officer is melissa crane manager of planning and environment melissa i believe there is a late submission that has come in in relation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us on certainly thank you through you mr mayor we received a late submission from the department of transport um they 've asked for a couple of changes to be made to from exhibited documents i don 't change the intent of the amendment but provide for some more alignment with state policies um it would have been included in the council report had we had it at that time but unfortunately we didn 't it 's still an opportunity to include that now um as i present you the um applica the amendment the only of request a small change should we be willing to include the department of transport submission in our assessment will be to amend the second part of the resolution the recommendation where it says the summary of submissions to amendment c-48 attachment 2 to include the words and be amended to include the department of transport submission and support of their requested changes and be adopted as mansfield shire council 's position on these submissions that will be presented to an independent panel um that will allow us to adopt that uh consider the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will only assist with strengthening the position of the department of transport and how they want to manage their arterial roads thank you thanks thanks melissa for that update um i 'd uh just like to welcome we have four deputations uh to to to this item agenda tonight and i 'd like to welcome the depth deputationers awes um going from left to right on my screen joan taylor welcome thank you sarah stegli from mansfield matters thank you and kim lynch from mansfield matters welcome to the meeting um the procedure will be uh kim you 'll speak first followed by sarah then joan uh you have three minutes uh and in which time just before a bell will sound so if you could keep it timely that would be great there is a fourth uh deputation from dr will twycross who may or may not make it to the uh to the meeting so welcome and uh i 'll pass over to you kim to uh to begin okay thank you mr mayor and congratulations on your new appointment um on behalf of manchester united matters group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mechanism that delivers the vision for the town both aesthetically and also functionally and it underpins and makes it all of the planning rules so c48 that we 're talking about tonight and have been in and out of consultation for a while now is a key driver to preserve and promote the look and feel of our township entrances and to be very clear we need that to be aesthetic and functional we need to be able to make it look like it 's the type of town we wish to live in and to showcase for residents and tourists alike what we think is the way we need to look c48 must deliver on a whole of township approach to provide very clear policy and direction for mansfield 's future vision and there 's a number of reasons for that and i 'll um extrapolate that out firstly we want to talk about the style of the town we want to be and the build of our unique position and the opportunities of the high country both year in year out all seasons we have fabulous attributes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at anywhere at any cost interfere with the with the aspirations of those of us who live here c48 goes some way towards that a good way towards that but mmg say that the current draft has left some important elements of the dd01 which is in the existing overlay out and we 've left it behind we seek to have some of that reincorporated c48 needs to be strong without loopholes to provide clear instruction and direction so that ratepayer dollars and the shire and community time is not being endlessly wasted by conflict caused by planning scheme inconsistencies or openness to interpretation where developers seek to find a loophole we therefore have an argument that says that we need to be strong so that we don 't end up with unintended consequences to the township strategic vision finally councillors i will ask you to observe that of all the current and prospective developments across the town on the table and being talked about for the future the only developer who has found fault with the current c-48 amendment is the one whose proposed developments have both been refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submitted here um whether he speaks tonight or not i 'm not sure trying to fashion our planning scheme to accommodate their personal endeavors this is our town we need to have it looking and functioning like we want it not for the personal development of developers mmg broadly supports the planning office 's recommendations we understand that some of the issues that we put thank you are one sentence to go that we understand it 's going to go to a panel and we just put on notice tonight that menswear matters group will vigorously participate at the panel hearing so that we can identify and put the best of our past and supporting new ideas for the future beneficial growth of mansfield not opportunistic growth thank you thanks uh kim councillors do we have any questions for kim no questions thanks very much for presenting kim um i 'd like to now welcome uh sarah stegli also from the mansfield matters group thank you can you hear me yep uh congratulations mayor james 10 and uh thank you uh councillor mark holcomb uh for all your hard work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to thank the shah strategic planners for considering and responding to my submission most particularly in the areas of retaining the strength of the current dd01 with respect to signage which has been a focus of community consultation about the township approaches for many years the only part i 'm worried about is we 're a private planning firm whose clients interests comprise less than one percent of the township approaches describes the revised ddo2 as unjustified inappropriate and overly prescriptive let 's examine those words are they saying that an amendment backed by years of community consultation is unjustified are they saying that laws protecting the beauty of our township approaches is inappropriate and over prescriptive if this is what ratio is saying then i say bring it on this is not about their commercial interest it 's about our ability to control what happens in the four entrances to our town these new guidelines are responsive to years of community consultation having been intimately involved in the saving of the railway land for public use for years ago and its subsequent development i know about the work that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land owner to come along after the fact and describe this work as unjustified and inappropriate is disgraceful a motto ratio actually trying to say in describing a drive-through facility as a use it 's not a use it 's a built form the draft ddo2 says the following buildings to work requirements apply to an application to construct a building or construct or carry out works and it talks about access and circulation that new crossovers should retain mature street trees and avoid impacts on their long-term health and system and stability drive through sales facilities should not be visible from a township approach a facility is is a thing that is constructed it 's a development not a use and a development needs a permit even if its use doesn 't what this is saying is merely that part of a development pace facing the alpine approach needs to respect the design guidelines of the design and development overlay the same line about drive-through facility also sits within the township approaches document i 'll jump ahead mansfield 's western gateway is our pride and the envy of probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good outcomes i 'm supportive of the officer 's recommendation thank you thanks sarah thanks very much councillors do we have any questions for sarah no thanks sarah thanks for your time um i 'd now like to call on joan tayan um joan you have three minutes and um and then time to ask be asked questions after thank you thanks thank you mr mayor councillors ceo and officers i wish to commend the council and its staff in drawing together all the feedback and analysis from previous consultancies going back 16 years that now bring us to today 's meeting to consider amendment 48 it is important to recognise the long journey the shower has taken to ensure our township gateways reflect the resident 's vision as well as sustainable planning practice i welcome the officer recommendation to retain the alpine approaches and township gateways title in both the dd01 and ddo2 schedules this title which acknowledges the strong connection between community values and local alpine vistas is what sets mansfield apart as a destination it dates back nearly 40 years to a landmark move when the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by bringing a halt to rampant inappropriate subdivision that intruded on the vista again the story of how the shire has arrived at the planning stage we are at today is long but is consistent with the community vision the second recommendation to apply existing scheduled ddo1 signage provisions to both the schedules brings clarity and consistency that will assist council officers and developers in understanding and interpreting the intent of c-48 amendment c-48 will put council on the front foot with regards to protecting and enhancing the township gateways based on the effort that has been invested by the community working with the shire it will bring cost savings and certainty rather than wasting shy resources having to react to inappropriate development appraisals proposals and face costly planning tribunal reviews that we have seen in the past i see the office report as fair and reasonable and i am supportive of the motion as it appears before council thank you thanks very much joan uh do we have any questions counsellors uh through you mr mayor to uh ms crane the changes that was um to signage that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what they are necessarily at all thank you um yes through you mr mayor the department of transport talked about so one of the big considerations for the department of transport is about how signage will impact in on road users and making sure that we minimise any impacts so they were asking for some changes which we 've we 've already included in the recommendation in response to the existing submissions um in relation to making sure that there 's a the proliferation and type of signage that uses is used in the township approaches doesn 't have a negative impact on road safety um and that has been addressed through the um existing officer recommendation um and we have actually spoken to the department of transport about that and now they 're comfortable with that as a response thank you thank you thanks melissa um uh is there any further questions for joan thanks for your uh uh deputation jonah um i see councillor will twycross 's name has popped up will you there if you are you 're on mute it doesn 't look like will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um mr memmer just call will just make sure he 's there i know he 's had a tough day yeah sure yeah he 's um he 's certainly on screen but no camera or no sound [Music] he 's sorry he 's not picking up okay no ways well i think we 'll uh we 'll move along um councillors do i have do i have a motion in relation to item 18.2 0.2 councillor rarbie

independent panel three each submitter to amendment c48b notified in writing of mansfield shire council 's position regarding their submission and informed of the forthcoming independent panel process thanks councillor rabbi um you 'll have a secondary for the motion councillor sladen council arabi would you like to speak to the motion just to say that there 's been a lot of effort in this and i know mansfield matters group have been very active and supportive and i would like to thank them very much for their um unwavering support for our beautiful town and it 's um and it 's approaches something that i feel passionate about this town and not losing the uh the beauty that we all came here for so thank you to them and uh also thanks to melissa crane for putting this together it 's a it 's a lot of work thanks counselor are we uh councillor sladen ah thank you mr mayor um just picking up on the outgoing mayor 's speech he alluded to significant developments that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning matters that this council will face in the next three years and this is certainly one of those planning amendments that will cement i suppose those well hopefully without cement the uh alpine approaches to our towns not only the western end but all of our alpine approaches um entrances to our town and i think it was mrs tan that actually said that um this will provide clarity and consistency which is something that has been missing for some time so congratulations to ms crane and her team in getting uh this to this stage and i certainly welcome the outcome of the panel but also acknowledging um ms stegli and dr twycross over many many years and their passion and commitment to this particular design development overlay and indeed to all the submitters uh tonight so thank

minutes to um to speak after which um i 'll ask counselors uh for questions to you so yeah away you go okay thank you um apologies uh i don 't know what the problem was with the audio i hope you can hear me um in september council resolved that the original intent of the auspice agreement between mason and menshed was that the lease would be handed over to the men 's shed on its incorporation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the lease the mention is acknowledged as being the beneficial holder of the land lease an owner of the shed itself there is no impediment sorry no you 're right i 'll keep going there is no impedance impediment to council resolving the following motion tonight requested by the men 's shed as beneficiary of the lease please one terminate the existing lease with mace which is an overholding two waive the obligation of mace to remove the shed and other improvements three acknowledge that the men 's shed is the beneficial owner of the shed and other improvements and will continue to be so after termination of the existing lease and four grant the men 's shed a new lease of the land to allow us to invest in the continuation and expansion of our community services without interruption on compensation any potential compensation to make is a separate matter and does not warrant any further delay in the council making its decision the men should respectfully request a council resolve as we have requested here tonight any issue from mace is separate but our position is as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received and expanded in relation to the ship premises be provided by mesa we could consider compensation if may shows it was out of pocket the men 's shed suggested a mediator to assist both parties and mace declined the mediator and declined to provide the information unless men shared signed a confidentiality agreement and media embargo mace repeatedly insisted on an mba the menshid will not sign an agreement to restrict use of information it is legally entitled to and cannot offer any compensation without it mace finally agreed to a mediator insisting on its own selection but still remains unwilling to provide the information without condition if mace has any claim against us then they should submit it to us until then there 's nothing to agree refute mediate or dispute and these matters are beyond the responsibility of the shy and the shy should not be troubled by it later if mediation is required regarding compensation the men should remain supportive of that and will actively participate but only if mace supports council 's decision now to grant us a new lease directly and mace provides the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even needed the menshed has attempted to resolve this matter for three years and has been misled blocked and stalled we desire the matter to be resolved now tonight the menshed appreciates the willingness of council to assist in resolution of this matter starting with terminating the current lease however if council 's decision is delayed or council proposes to enter into a new lease agreement with mace the men 's shed will regrettably have to act and consider its legal options against mace for breach of the auspice agreement the menship respectfully requests that council resolve as the menshed has requested thank you uh thanks thanks mr copley um councillors do we have any questions for mr copley while we 've got him on the phone i 've got through you mr mayor i just have one question uh mr mr copley with the um if the lease is with directly with the men 's shed what happens to the current tenants uh that are there one being the quarters group and the welders which i think come through my is that my understanding yes um the quilters and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become members of the men 's shed and we have provided insurance and support for them and committed to auspice then for future grants we hope to expand their capabilities so far as the world is concerned we 've documented through numerous emails to mace starting in november 2018 that the welding classes are welcome to continue and we would offer them a sub license on the same terms that they offered us a sub license initially basically we 'd flip that round and allow them to continue with the world in classes the one thing we asked from um mace originally was a small commercial fee for the use of electricity um but we would negotiate that or waive that depending on other issues surrounding the mou which you know we would sort out directly and separately with them thank you uh councillor robbie you have a question yes please uh mr copley can you hear me yes i can counsellor all right thank you my question is for the avoidance of doubt the i believe the negotiations between you and mace have broken down and will not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to negotiate mace have not submitted any claim to the men 's shed but they 've intimated to us that they won 't support the termination of the lease or the handovers at least until the full um the other matters in relation to the mou are completely resolved now this is an avenue for great um great time wasting and expense because and that 's you know really not the problem that the shy should have to be concerned with the issue here is we 've got well we have two issues we have the lane lease and we have the resolution of any compensation claims between mace and ourselves now it was on your suggestion council arrives on the september meeting that i reached out to mace and i made an offer of to consider compensation if they were able to supply us with a substantiated claim to show that they were out of pocket and they 've refused to do that that that is the only process that 's broken down as i said in the submission i actually sent my uh submission notes because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the madam ceo and councillor holcomb because i had both those emails addresses uh here um the issue is we need to terminate the lease and let mace and the membership sort out our other financial issues um if that 's not possible um then we will take the legal advice that we have and pursue mace um we don 't wish to harm them but we are equipped and ready um to do so um and to seek the declaration of our rights and um uh you know ensure that the proper ownership of the shed is with us because mace has only ever held the lease as beneficiary as as in trust for the men 's shed as beneficiary so the land lease we are the beneficiary of the economy thanks uh thanks mr copley uh no further questions um councillors um we have a motion in relation to item 18.2.3 councillor rarbie yeah thanks mr me um i 'd like to move the motion that council won in accordance with clause 9.1 of the police agreement the 17 errol street man between mansfield shire council and mansfield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council will give written notice to end the tenancy at the 18th of february 2022 uh two notifies mansfield adult continuing education incorporated of its intentions into a lease agreement with the men 's shed incorporated three negotiate a lease agreement with the menshed incorporated to the lease of the land at 17 errol street mansfield and four receives a report no later than february meeting february council meeting 2022 thanks councillor rabi do i have a second into the motion council holcomb councillor rabi would you like to speak to the motion yes i would um i think it 's uh both mace and the men 's sheet incorporated are well regarded within our community however what 's in what 's very evident here is that uh both cannot achieve a successful reconciliation in this matter uh what is obvious in reading all the documents and analyzing the content is that there 's a clear intent that once a men 's shed was incorporated the lease was to be transferred to them this is very clear the previous council resolution on the 21st of september 2021 refers to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month to month basis this motion put forward makes it clear to both parties that council recognize the original intent of the auspice agreement between mace and the men 's shed ink signed in 2003 that is once the men 's shed became incorporated they would have the lease additionally having read the correspondence between mace and the men 's shed incorporated i cannot see any successful resolution being mediated anytime soon and to this end for the community benefit the council has made the hard decision and this is one of them thanks mr mayor thanks uh councillor rabi councillor holcomb and secondary would you like to speak to the motion yes thanks miss uh mr mayor uh i 'd endorse very much what council robbie just said to me there 's a few very clear principles in all this the first is an mou in 2003. it very clearly stated that once incorporated the mates would get the hand over the osmosing roll directly to the men 's shed they were incorporated in 2013 i think it was um and at about the same time uh uh mace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lease that they had with the shire in 2013. uh so the lease itself has been in overhauling a month by month basis since 2013. so the auspice so the mou i believe should be honored the lease is on a month by month basis since 2018 these two organizations which are both very well known in the community and very well respected have been in dispute council has tried many times over the last three years to resolve that and has not been successful the last as we 've stated before where we are a councillor who tries to get things done and resolve some of these issues that have not been resolved for various lengths of times this is one of them i 'm over it um i and it 's i don 't find it very gratifying at all to see these two organizations at head to head and i think it 's beyond resolution uh between themselves as evidenced in the last two months when an ultimatum was given to them by council they 've left us with no option but to terminate the lease as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lease uh by the end of by the 22nd of february so with that in mind i totally endorse uh the motion thanks uh councillor holcomb does any other councillors want to speak to this motion councilor webb thank you mr mayor um i 'd also like to endorse both councillor roberts and councillor holcomb 's comments here um these are two very well known and well thought of organizations within our community and they mean a lot to us as a council i don 't like having to draw a line in the sand like this but i honestly feel as councillor holcomb mentioned that we 've been left with no choice the constant friction and the back and forth is counterproductive and it detracts from everything that both of these organizations do uh by council making a statement here uh and intervening where we really shouldn 't be in my opinion i wish these two organizations were able to sort out themselves we can all move on and we can carry on and these organizations can carry on doing what they do best thank you thanks councillor webb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stage where we 'll put this motion to a vote so uh um councillors i 'd like to uh put it to the vote all those infirmity of this motion emotion is carried um thanks uh mr copley if you 're still there for your deputation and um thanks mr dunn for your contribution to uh to this uh agenda item thank you very much mr mayor um on behalf of the menship you know we 're sincerely grateful it 's been a an issue which has impacted many of the members and uh mr copley uh i 'll just have to cut you off there because we 've actually dealt with the motion now and uh we 'll just move along so thank you anyway yeah thank you very much and goodbye thank you good night um right moving along council sladen 's back welcome back councillor sladden um and we 're now moving on to eyes on 18.3.1 the finance report the responsible officer is uh anthony smith who is coming in maura mr mayor i admitted him just before then he went of his own volition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's coming in again anthony mr smith can you hear me yes mr man i can thanks uh yeah your video is oh there you are okay your video is good welcome to the meeting thank you thank you um and we 're dealing with uh item 18.3.1 the finance report councillors do we have any questions for mr smith ah councillor sladen sorry thank you mr mayor that 's all right um well it 's probably a question that mr smith may not be able to answer uh but i 'm sure mrs alexander could probably answer the question just in terms of the underspend and it 's the 90 or 89 000 regarding the dual court stadium what 's happening with the with the landscaping hello uh miss alexander you must be on mute can you hear me now that 's yes oh good excellent um yeah three you met er three miss me it 's um that i think there was some final tidying up that was being done um by the vsba um things like some cleaning of the streets there there was a bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was some final planting uh that council 's field services team were going to do but they had held off until the dual court stadium works were completed just to avoid any damage to those plantings so there was just i think going to be some ground cover and and things like that in in and around the car park um so that is the only landscaping that 's left is my understanding but we are waiting on a final invoice and everything from the vsba is my understanding okay so in terms of um the acquittal of the grant that was received which is pantel 's responsibility the the grant application detailed a number of items that would be included and i 'm just confused as to why we still got that 89 000 outstanding that won 't all be on landscaping i assume no there 's a number of sorry three years there is a number of items that that relates to but we 're waiting on that final invoice from the bsba right okay uh do we know the timing of when that acquittal has to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on notice i know that the team are in the process of putting together that acquittal uh now so they 've reached out to the architect that was working for the vsba just to get any final their final details so that they can compile that information so it is in progress but i don 't have the date with me no that 's okay that 's okay my second question is in relation to the alternative route or heavy vehicle bypass or whatever name we 're calling it um and that is again um as a council i think we 're still waiting on final design and costing which has yet to reach us and i 'm just wondering what impact that is having on the on the uh the current financial situation the first part of that question yes that is correct we have the design for part one we 're still as part two is expected this week was it was delayed but uh we 're anticipating receiving uh that this week uh in terms of the impact of the financial situation uh we have timelines that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commonwealth grant and they are april 2022 we have an extension until so we are we are getting quite tight in terms of the timing to get that second stage out to tender we 're still hopeful that we will be able to do that and we 'll obviously update council you know if if it gets to the point where we think that won 't be achievable uh it will be it will depend on the tenders we receive right so stage one tender has been given yep stage one tender is out and closes on the 25th of november yeah and we 'll be getting a report uh anticipate getting a report to the december meeting and stage two we anticipate getting out to tender uh if not later this week could be early next week right okay thank you my question just relates to you know this is funding that we 've been holding for quite some time and how long can we hold it without expending it yeah okay thank you that 's all thank you mr mayor thanks council student council web thanks mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our high working capital ratio and notice here that um we recognize uh the rates income uh on invoice as opposed to uh i guess remit of the invoices coming in um a couple of questions is that 's is that standard uh practice for local government and then i guess how does that impact our actual cash situation so through the chair yes that 's that is common practice within local government financial reporting to recognize that um rate revenue as soon as the rates are raised so 79 councils um treat it the same so therefore that the cash the cash position at the moment that is indicated in the report while it says there 's eight me there 's 16 million dollars currently um as opposed to 8.4 million dollars that 8.4 million dollars actually reflects the cash position at the 30th of june 2022 right thank you thanks council web any other questions in that case council 's over motion in relation to item 18.3.1 councillor webb thanks mr man motion being that council receives the year-to-date finance report for the period first of july 2021 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ councillor webb do you wish to speak to motion uh no thank you mr mayor i actually no i will speak um just to see it is early in the year obviously and early in this budget but um happy to see that everything 's on track and i hope it continues on so thanks councillor holcomb no i have nothing to add thank you anyone else in that case i 'll put the motion to avoid all those in favor of the motion motion is carried thank you mr smith for your attendance thank you mr mayor uh item 18.4.1 rural council 's transformation program joint council 's application responsible officer is madam ceo caitlin conrad councillor so you have any questions or queries in regard to this matter counselor web thanks mr man um madam ceo if we were successful in this grant application which council would take the lead on it or would there be a a group a working group formed thank you councillor webbing through you mr mayor um at this stage we haven 't identified the lead council but there will be a lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project group representing all three councils currently this um at this point mansfield is taking the lead has taken the lead for some time how that pans out we will look at our resources and whose best place and it might be that um there is a different lead council depending on the system at the time that 's been put in place but the same project group will be supporting the project over two years understood thank you thanks council we have any other questions council sladden thank you mr mayor um madam ceo this is the second time that mansfield shire council has applied to this fund and i 'm just a little concerned that yet again we 're putting in an application for something we don 't know what we 're applying for is that correct no that thank you councillor sladen and through mr man no that 's not correct in this case and i 'm not familiar with the previous application although i do know the previous application included a number of the northeast councils it was quite a big application round two has changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projects and i think there were four um awarded across the state and at least two of them had have fallen over so the the guidelines for round two have changed to exclude more than four councils so it can only be up to four and that 's part of the reason of trying to contain it a little bit in terms of knowing what we 're going to apply for we certainly do we 're applying to put in platform systems so rolling out 365 across all three councils putting in a customer request system and a records management system over two years which will be foundation systems but then putting a finance system on top of that and a number of other systems including building and regulatory services so we 're looking at year one as being foundation systems so we all get the same platform in place and um and customer request system and the records management system so we do know exactly what we want um for the next couple of years and all three councils are in a similar position thank you very much ms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have a motion in relation to item 18.4.1 councillor webb thank you mr mayor uh motion being that council notes that the man 's toolshower council is a participant in a grouping of councils that will be making an application for funding under the victorian government rural council 's transformation program rctp for the following initiative lifting service performance through shared technology and collaboration two notes that the application is due for submission by 10th of december 2021 and three approves of submission of the grant application by mansfield strathbergie and murrendindi councils we have a second into the motion councillor holcomb councillor webb do you wish to speak to the motion oh mr mayor um this is really really important i think for us as a council and it is only the very first step on a very long journey um from what i know of the systems within council they are antiquated and decrepit and it 's putting us at a really bad disadvantage uh we 're having to plug the holes with people and that 's burning people out getting systems up to scratch to what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an incredibly important project and i really hope we 're successful because we don 't honestly we don 't have the funds and we don 't have the ability to do this by ourselves and this is why this grant application is so important and i 'm very excited for this to go in thanks councillor webb councillor holcomb yeah i think it 's a really important uh funding application and highly supportive of it i think it 's important a couple of fronts one because our systems are antiquated and need updating and our people and for our staff uh they need a lot of help in this area as well and this will address that and i thought i think it 's also a big one in terms of but if it goes well it might be the start of a number of different shared services arrangements between these these councils and i think that 's really important and a real opportunity if we can get it right so i 'm very much supportive of it thanks councillor holcomb anyone else like to speak to the motion no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all those in favor of the motion motion is carried item 18.4.2 schedule of meetings for the years 21 year 2021 2022 responsible officer is um ceo miss conrick uh councillors do we have any queries or

i 'm really really pleased to see that and good to see a bit more engagement happening uh particularly over social media uh with you services so that 's great um i know there 's a few new initiatives coming through um through economic development which is exciting um a quick question about these new initiatives some of them particularly the one about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay in mansfield um is that in partnership with tna or is this something we 're doing off our own bat and this is probably towards kurt mr hyder card and directing this question it 's through you mr mayor um it 's been done yes through the um tourism north east uh in in terms of putting those packages together so that we can encourage and increase stays um and also done with our visitor information service as well so it 's it 's a uh a joined up effort to try and extend the the length of stays as well as the quality of stays in in our region great good to hear um marrying the other point on the sierra report i just noticed there 's a spike in the 90 day debtors on the rates payment um is that just because the rates notices have just gone out or do we have an explanation why it 's jumped up so steeply mr mayo also pass over to the general manager and community corporate services to respond uh through you mr mayor um it 's in relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh is has been generated by a subdivision um that uh is waiting for ministerial approval so the developer has declined to pay that invoice until they get that ministerial approval but we are separately following up with that invoice to get it paid as separate as as quickly as we can and to hasten it very good thank you very much councillors any other questions um casatan uh yeah i just uh note on um in the report about planning applications uh for the previous month there was uh zero planning applications that went over 60 days so congratulations to the planning department on that front it 's the first time i 've seen that since we 've been here so that 's fantastic um and uh yes no the uh the the debtor 's days was also which council aware has covered so uh no that 's very good thank you thanks cass council writing thank you mr mayor through you i 've got a question for um ceo there 's two fois ones been resolved can you tell me what the second foi is for please are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community and corporate services um regarding the foi just from aboard board high-level response please general manager and through you mr mayor i might ask our coordinator governor some risk just to to give that um that high level overview please um through you mr mayor in answer to your question the second foi was for some solicitors there were numerous parties i think it related to a building in sawmill settlement and seeking original planning and building documents perhaps to an asbestos claim we did not hold those documents so that is now between the ceo 's report in the last couple of days we 've closed the foi within the time frame and informed the parties that we don 't hold those documents after a very diligent search through our storage by miss jane carter thank you are there any other questions counselors i do have a motion council web thanks mr mayor motion being that council receive and note the chief executive officers report for period 8 september 21 to 6th of october 21. thank you do we have a second casa turn those in favor the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adoption of a planning scheme amendment c49 news street rezoning and the responsible officer is melissa crane he 's the manager of planning and environment and welcome melissa welcome listen sorry um council are there any questions or comments on this report uh council rabbit yeah just um i suppose it 's more a comment than a question maybe perceived as both that this came before us in the meeting of the 16th of march 2021 is fairly well covered there and i don 't see any issues are there any uh issues that have come to us since then melissa through you mr mayor there has been no issues raised as a as a result of the exhibition um we had some inquiries about the state of the road adjacent to the property which were referred to our senior coordinator of field services who 's actually done some work out there to brought more broadly make the community a bit happier out there but there was no concerns with the proposed rezoning or the planning permit that 's to be issued right thank you any other questions or comments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ c-49s um in local government or in this shower possibly would be a better question yeah so through you mr mayor the proponent driven amendments is something that are allowed if strategic planning sometimes isn 't keeping up with what the community may want on a particular property this one was a bit specialized because it was about flooding so it was a very technical matter involving the goldman broken catch management authority they do come up from time to time we would prefer to have planning scheme amendments as part of a broader consideration when we 're doing a strategy say like the commercial and industrial land use strategy rather than splitting things out individually but it does happen and we have to consider them when they propose to us thank you for that explanation and just noting that there was no objections received to this that through you mr may that is correct any other questions or comments do we have a motion cancel robbie yeah thanks i 'd like to put to the council of motion that uh the council want to adopt the amendment c-49 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the planning and environment act 1987 two recommend to the minister for planning the planning permit number p 014 backslash 21 be granted in accordance with section 96g the planning and environment act

this report that the um bonnie dune wreck reserve has been removed uh from the policy as council resolved on the 21st of september to take on the committee of management responsibility um is that if that proves to take longer than anticipated is that going to be an issue for what we do down there through you mr mayor um no councillor team that won 't be a problem with i think we 'll be down there again tomorrow maintenance works are ongoing in the meantime so that won 't create any problems from an upkeep perspective right thank you any other questions counselors okay there 's no other questions um do we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'd like to recommend that council endorse the updated township reserves maintenance policy thank you give it a second cancel web guess the team do you wish to speak to the motion uh yeah just i 'd like to um congratulate firstly the merton cricket club i think it 's a great success story to see that uh they 've been resurrected after four years of um of uh have not been able to feel the side so and this goes against the flow of all small local communities usually once these sporting clubs um fold they don 't get back on the track so huge congratulations to uh to the committee down there and the people who persisted to uh to put a aside back on that on the track and hopefully they 're successful um in the uh in the upcoming season which i think starts in about a week 's time so um and great that the shire are able to contribute by going down there and helping out mowing their their uh the mcg as they call it so yeah thanks councillor thanks mr mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that the amount that that council allocates to this uh this particular item is is multiplied many many times by the the communities themselves so this is um a small amount um that council contributes compared to the enormous amount of effort that these communities put in to maintain these areas so this is council empowering communities to uh to help them i guess paint their own destinies so i 'm very very pleased to see this go through and carry on because this small amount of money means an incredible amount to these community groups and it 's good to be able to support them in looking after little patch so i 'm glad to see this go through thanks catswebb um cancer turn is it moving um do you wish to sum up nah thanks okay uh do we have a motion i

yaffen continuing on now that we have that we 're going to be voting on this vision tonight thanks any other questions comments or comments um i just got one question for uh mr kurt hydeker who i should have mentioned as a responsible officer for this vision okay this is if i 'm correct this is the first time the council has used the deliberative engagement process that 's that 's correct mr mitchus thank you thank you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what is it has it been a success or is it things we could have done better or and how 's it been received uh to answer your last question first mr mayor it 's been received very well we had a very positive uh panel deliberative panel who considered this vision and and went through it and uh gave the feedback to to the consultant running facilitating the process i think being the first time that we 've done this process there 's always things that we can improve and this afternoon i spent two hours with the consultant and our communications officer going through some of some more suggestions and how we can improve that process and uh and flesh it out but i think generally the the process was was well received it certainly i think you 'll agree got the results in terms of the detail of the vision and certainly the the three thousand people and twenty five thousand words we received um speaks volumes about the way it was received by the community so i think overall um it was a challenge being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think the the process has been very successful at the same time thanks so hard okay um honestly the comments that are in the feedback i 'd just like to congratulate the communion and i thought some of the feedback was excellent and really gave us a platform to um to end up with what you you 're putting here today so um that 's been well done thank you mr man uh are there any other questions or comments counselors we have a motion guess or ten yeah thanks mr mayor um i 'd like to recommend

'd just like to uh congratulate kurt and his team for a really good um a really good policy a good document and also the consultants from spur i think um the the key issue here is that you know the vision has been developed by the community for the community and um it 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to and as you mentioned before mr mayor the community comments in there are incredible and i 'd encourage the community to actually have a look at this document read it and see what a diverse range of views that the community have and what they want us to do and i think it 's a really good reference document for us to go back to if we 're ever in doubt about anything because it certainly gives good ideals and ideas of where we will be in 2040 and how we 're going to get there so um i 'd just like to congratulate you guys again on doing it and um and yeah i 'm happy to endorse this thanksgiving uh council robbie is the second in do you wish to speak yeah thanks mr mayor i i um fully

happy to see that it 's rolling along quite light uh pun me quite nicely more of it not a question but just uh thank you very much kurt through you mr mate it 's again a team effort but certainly appreciate your uh your recognition of that that effort councillor robbie any other questions or comments counselors i 'd just like to add um because there 's a lot of community focus on this um if we look at the history of this the that whole site when it was first put out for sale it got a massive response from the community from the community about what should be done and out of that was formed its emergency services precinct it 's very high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a lot of interest in it um so we want to make sure that we do the best possible job in meeting their requirements as well as as well as what 's going on through what 's going to come out of this study but it 's a very high profile i can 't emphasize what a high profile project this one is councillors do we have a motion council uh yeah thanks mr mayor i 'd like to move the council endorses the submission of the black summer bush fire recovery grant application for the mansfield emergency services precinct lodged on the 6th of october 2021. thanks consultant secondary council robbie uh council team would you like to speak to the nation um yeah thanks mr mayor um this is as you highlighted before a very important project and the community is looking for some progress here and i 'd just like to congratulate the ceo for the excellent grant application it was really detailed really thorough and um let 's all cross our fingers and hope that um you know it goes it 's well received and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all aware the uh the amount the demand for emergency services in this shire is just growing year on year and we really do need a state-of-the-art um emergency services precinct we 've got people the community backing it behind it so uh yeah let 's just uh hope that this is successful and we can move through to the next stages yes against the turn uh council robbie is the second one be brief as a as a active member of the cfa um i found it that the the what if we 're supported by having good infrastructure around us it makes us feel better out there in the fire grounds and we are a very our shire is growing exponentially it 's a great vision to have this in our town fully supported i know there 's a lot of interest in it try and get it shovel the ceo 's done an amazing job an amazing job is you know hurting cats and and it 's i can 't speak highly enough of you kayleen on this it 's fantastic i really am emotionally um uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and kurt this is an amazing job that you and your team are doing and i know i speak for all the counsellors here i really do so thanks very much for that thanks cancer uh councillor turned do you wish to add anything more no that 's all thanks uh counselors those in favor of the motion motion is passed thank you item 13.3.4 uh is the council plan um 21 25 responsible officer is general manager community corporate services kurt heidegger counselors any questions or comments council web thanks sister man um just the one i know i brought it up uh when this went out to community for comment but i 'm just regarding the kpis that are listed against the plan i 'm still not satisfied that they encompass the plan in its entirety um there 's a number of strategic objectives um namely 2 4 and 5 which no kpi really reflect or measure in my view i think we could do better in outlining things to measure which reflect these objectives i i just don 't think it 's quite there yet in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or comments cancer right yeah i suppose on on that note um the question is that uh how difficult is it to get a kpi for two four and five i know that kpis are a very um they can be very difficult to capture i know there 's been a lot of work in this plan um so kurt could you just run me through that and say and how did how did you how do you feel it 's running uh through you mr mayor um look certainly we we mentioned before the changeover of personnel and that this has been a a challenge for us there 's been a lot of work that 's occurred in this area and uh we we have struggled i think to find representative kpis with the council officers have put their heads together and um we 've come up with these uh we would probably admit that they 're they 're not perfect and they could still have some some further um detail around them some further items but uh this this is the um the the best that we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that effort um so but yeah i think for for any other further comment maybe the the ceo could could suggest a way forward in terms of that resolution who you mr mayor [Music] the the challenge is always about whether you have a kpi for every objective or whether you have kpis that give you an indication that you 're moving forward in the general direction towards the destination so as our general manager of community corporate services has stated we have looked at various plans across the state and there seemed there seems to be a view that less kpis the better um and and this is what we 've come up with so there is a deadline that council needs to meet in terms of the local government the new local government act around the council plan and it is the 31st of october so um it is presented tonight as the best effort that we can have been able to come up with to date i 'm really pleased with how the plan is looking and i understand that a couple of kpis may not necessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council plan each year is my still my understanding so there would be an opportunity next year to to add some kpis review the plan and some further kpis if they can 't become more apparent i guess thank you mr mayor thank you councilweb thanks just a man um i i guess an additional comment to that from my view would be it 's it 's difficult to have an objective in a plan without having it to measure anything against and if it 's truly something that we wish to achieve from from my management background in business um if it 's if it 's not measured it 's it 's not viewed at all as important and it does tend to drop off the wayside i accept that and i can understand there 's an incredible amount that goes into this plan and and it really is an incredible effort to get to where it is uh not discounting that at all and you should be congratulated um and i yes given the time frame being 31st of october that needs to be submitted um it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i would like to review it um as next year um but i just it 's yeah to me it doesn 't sit right with me but uh i guess it 's acceptable for the next 12 months counselors any other comments um it 's just a comment mr mayor that um having been in the merchant navy and driving big ships around the world it 's very difficult to have kpis for everything um sometimes you have to have room to move and uh i i i think this is a great plan i don 't want to make a comment before you vote or not but yeah i see it as a good plan it 's a lot of work in this has been going on for a long time since we 've joined council we i think this came to us when we very very first joined council about a year ago and uh you know there has been some changes in in the business and i know everyone 's been working very very diligently and hard to to get this through so i suppose that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you um before you ask for a um a vote thanks thanks again any further comments uh counselors do we have a motion council team uh yeah thanks mr mayor i 'd like to move that council adopts the giraffe council plan 2021 2025 and two endorses the publications council plan 2021 2025 plan on a page understanding that there are dynamic these are dynamic publications that will be developed ongoing fit for purpose and three authorizes the sea chief executive officer to make any editorial corrections as required to the draft council plan 2021 2025 and the plan on a page publications next council tan uh second council arabi question do you wish to speak to the motion uh yeah thanks mr mayor um i 'd just like to again congratulate um the uh the community for one for their contributions to this plan there 's been a huge amount of contributions and that 's why it 's taken a while and it 's changed to get it to the right spot where where it is i think the the measurements in this plan i i i just like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if you look at it it 's it 's very detailed it 's got 29 points that it 's across and i think i can 't see anywhere in there which doesn 't really um align itself with this council plan so i 'm actually very happy with that as the feedback on this um as the ceo said um the council plan can change from year to year so if council edward wants to come up with some uh roaring kpis too that would be better all you know i think that would be a great idea um and uh to put them forward and so that we can look at them but um i certainly think it 's it 's a that 's a great plan i 'd like to thank the consultant who um who we worked with on this because as councillor rabies said when we first came in i think it was the first briefing session we had had was on on forming a council plan so you get thrown in the deep end there 's no doubt about that and uh and i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he really specialized in contacting each individual counselor and seeing what their individual needs were where they wanted to go what they thought was good for this plan i think it was very um well explored in that respect so congratulations to um just forgotten his name for a second um yeah andrew hollow yes yeah yeah so um uh that was great and and kurt and uh and your team for uh for putting it all together and um um yeah so that 's all thanks thanks again casserole you suspect yeah thanks mr mayor talking to the community out there i think you 'll be happy to note that it 's not a massive breed it 's actually something you can pick up and read that was our brief to andrew hollow we didn 't want you know a large volume plan we wanted something that the community would be engaged with reading and it 's for you that this is done um please read it it 's only 30 pages it 's it 's not much and i 'd like to say that andrew hollow is probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he he he was amazing to guide us through that was a very difficult process to be thrown into this as a new counsellor but um he he was incredible uh thanks mr mayor thanks cassarow uh councillor team or sorry any other castles we suspect council 13 do you wish to wrap up no thanks mr mayor those in favour of the motion those against catholic uh castle webb so three-fourth motion is passed thank you i 'm 13.3.5 is

a plan such as this um and it 's really great it it is really well balanced there 's strategies actions and outcomes desired from it and measurable targets really well set out plan and i think based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to congratulate you for being able to put this together um it 's it 's wonderful and and i just want to congratulate you thank you thanks because any other comments counselors no other comments castles do have a motion guts web thanks mr mayor uh motion being that the mansfield municipal public health and wellbeing action plan 2021 to uh that 'll be 2025 be endorsed by council do you wish to speak to the motion i 've said everything i want to say thank you mr mayor do you wish to speak as a seconder uh thanks mr mayor yeah look i 'd like to just like to support uh what councillor webb has said about the um the health and well-being action plan um it was um really well put together it covers all the vital areas that we need to be uh healthy and um and have good well-being so i encourage everyone in the community to have a look at it to read it there 's some really interesting statistics in there about how we as a shire are progressing with our health some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh and there 's obviously more that we can do so but congratulations to jenny and her team for um for putting this together thanksgiving any other councils we should speak council web do you we should say anymore no thanks mr man those in favor of the motion motion is passed and jenny i 'd also like to congratulate you it 's a really good report and if i 'm correct it 's the first time this report 's been it 's been it 's highly placed front and center of our plan am i correct in saying that yes uh thank you mr mayor and thank you councillors um yes this is the first time we 've put in an integrated plan so we 've embedded some of our health and wellbeing initiatives into our council plan and then the action plan sits alongside it with the detail um it 's very action focused and and certainly outlines our partners and how we 're going to achieve some of those outcomes yeah now well done yeah it was a good plan to read and uh it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um item totally different uh tactic uh items quite different to health and wellbeing uh is the 13.3.6 financial plan 2021 2031 uh responsible officer is actually managing business and performance anthony smith welcome anthony thank you mr mayor um councillors do we have any questions on this can 't believe it first time we 've had a lot a long-term financial plan there 's been no questions but i 'm stumped uh councillors uh do we have a motion council tan uh yes thanks mr mayor i 'd like to recommend the council adopts the financial plan 2021 20 31. thanks for turning do we have a second casserole counselor turned you wish to speak to the motion uh yes thanks mr mayor um i know you 've just come into this role anthony so uh well done because i reckon it 's a really good 10-year financial support i 'd like to acknowledge your predecessor mandy kinsley who did a lot of work and her teamings as well too from where we started off to where we finished was a huge difference and i think there 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't think that at the start it was probably been looked at for quite a long time and um interestingly enough the um there was no submissions received on this so uh obviously the community are fairly satisfied with it um given that uh initially when this came out there was a lot of questions and queries raised about our long-term financial uh our particularly cash flow by some councillors and it 's very pleasing to see that now the cash reserves uh going out the next 10 years don 't drop below 4.1 million and i think in 2627 they actually get to that level which um is is a very healthy position for this shot but for us to look at going forward means that we will be able to do lots of things down the track and i think there was a lot of scaremongering uh at the time around the budget about our long-term financial position and i 'd just like to reiterate to the community that they should have a look at this see where our financial position is uh going forward and uh and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and put forward questions regarding it um but so anthony well done on on being here today and uh i um i 'm very happy to recommend this report thanks council tan uh councillor do you wish to say anything against the second yeah um mirroring council councillor teen 's comments here um the low point in this plan continue plan is positive 4.1 million in 25 26. now um in in my term of council he was isn 't long uh our previous budget there was reference made to our current cash flow projections of this budget and revenue rating strategy has us going broke in year 2627 that is not the case everyone out there this is a very very good solid responsible financial plan in fact we 're in positive territory in 2627 at 4.8 million dollars so i i think um anthony you 've got you and your team have done an extremely good job of this i 'm happy to have seconded this and i 'm happy to go along and see that mansfield shire is in good hands financially and uh and hopefully will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh council for the next next uh term that you know next three years thank you very much thanks cataradi uh any other speakers counselor team do you wish to say anything more uh no thanks mr mayor okay uh because of those in favor of the motion motion is passed thank you thanks nancy thank you mr mayor and by the way welcome to the organization okay thank you

of council 's report for this for the 11th of september is it well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16th of october yeah i apologize um mr mayor that that was incorrect so council robert would you just want to say that again um okay so um the recommendation that 's put before before us is as i 'm reading um the incorrect one so it 's uh can you give me the dates madam ceo please yes yes um through you mr mayor the date should be from the 16th of september to the 13th of october okay here we go again so i 've moved the recommendation that council receiver not the assembly of councillors report for the period 16th of september to the 13th of october with the amendment that the ceo kailen conrick and councillor stephen rabi were apologies for the 12th of october 2021. well that 's correct understand and my apologies to everyone watching here we don 't always get it right but we do in the end no problems thanks so much for watching uh those in favor of the motion the motion is passed item 15 is the council resolutions register um councils do we have a motion please council web @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the council resolutions register as that 28th of september 2021 a seconder council robbie those in favor of the motion motion is passed next item is item 18 the closure of the meeting to members of the public we will close the meeting to discuss confidential information uh do we have a motion please counselors council web thanks mr mayor motion being that the meeting be closed to members of the public under section 66 2a of the local government act 2020 to consider confidential information as defined by section 31 of the local government act 2020 as council business information being information that would prejudice the council 's position in commercial negotiations if prematurely

3722, Australia",1414,i 'm here today down at the scar tree at the station precinct and at the rainbow servant joining me today is aunt and marie who is the chair of our gutter bar group each july starting on the first sunday nadox celebrations are held around australia to celebrate the history culture and achievements of aboriginal people and torah state islander peoples this year 's theme for naidoc week is always was always will be and it acknowledges and celebrates that our nation 's story didn 't begin with documented european contact but the aboriginal and torres strait islander people who were our first explorers our first engineers first farmers first botanists first diplomats first astronauts and of course the first artists australia has the oldest continuing culture on the planet nadoc 2020 invites all australians to embrace the true history of this country a history which dates back thousands of generations it 's about seeing hearing and learning the first nations 65 000 plus years of history of this country which is australian history today as i 've just said i 'm joined by auntie and marie fletcher who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar to talk about nadoc week anne marie can you start by telling me a little bit about the gada bar network please i certainly can thank you mark thanks for having me today um here in mansfield there are more than 60 aboriginal people residing and the gatobar local aboriginal network was formed or founded in 2012 to help bring aboriginal people together to connect and support each other and to celebrate being an aboriginal the glenn as we call it um is a unique network that it includes both aboriginal and non-aboriginal members the gatobar is a tanarang word meaning together a traditional name adopted by the network to reflect the vision of working together alongside aboriginal people um and non-aboriginal people to achieve the goals and aspirations council is really proud to be an active member of the ghadabar and gadabar together is so significant as it demonstrates what we can all achieve when we 're working together and can you please tell me what made up means to you oh good question good question for me nadok means that personally personally i can embrace being an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand regardless of the colour of my skin side by side with all australians to bathe in the richness of this wonderful country and the history that it offers it 's a special time for us as aboriginal people to celebrate our language our culture our heritage our survival our achievements a time for our identity i think it 's a coming together of our people from all around the country and a big celebration acknowledging all the peoples it doesn 't matter where you 're from in this country we 're all the same yeah we celebrate each other 's achievements and that to us is a very important aspect of being an aboriginal nato is an opportunity for us to share our culture with the rest of australia so it 's actually a very significant week in the in the year for us sharing the celebration with the mansfield community is something that we in the gutterbar local aboriginal network look forward to every year and the support that we get overwhelming and it grows every year year by year it just gets better so i think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just said that is what it means to me it 's a celebration i understand plans were well advanced to celebrate native week as this week um which is unfortunate but we uh you are planning for later in the year so what are you planning we certainly are we 've got um quite um a number of events we originally planned to have an online extravaganza of events um anticipating the no uh the kovic i should say um restrictions but then the national nato committee moved to uh change the week of celebrating nato to the 8th to the 15th of november and that was done nationally so we as a group here determined that we would follow suit um so we also moved all of our events in the hope that more people might attend now in november we will be holding a special flag raising which we 've done before uh and a smoking ceremony at the out the front of the council building and a new thing this year is a walk and talk to the wetlands by one of our local indigenous flora experts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaker melbourne university assistant dean in the faculty of science too much to say dr michael shawn fletcher providing some lectures one for young people demonstrating a dig into the wetlands and taking samples of pollen charcoal and spores to reveal the layers of the history and how the landscape changed since aboriginal um and ownership and colonization in the evening a second lecture is planned for both adults and young people to learn the interactions between humans climate disturbance vegetation and how cultural burning practices of the aboriginal plans can assist in the future control environmental control in this region that is certainly exciting an amazing program and i 'm sure that many mansfield people will be interested in and what an incredible opportunity to hear from dr michael shawn fletcher i 'm sure you 're very proud as an aboriginal but as his mother of his amazing achievements the theme for naidoc week is all well as always will be this is a really powerful statement for both aboriginal non-aboriginal australians what does this year 's theme mean to you [Music] always questions always was always will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first nations people have occupied and cared for this land for sixty five thousand years or so and nadoc invites all australians to embrace this ancient history with our history and knowing what happened to the aboriginal people to actually still be strong thriving growing culture i think it 's a testament of the resilience of the aboriginal people there 's still a stigma around being an aboriginal events such as sorry day marble day and nato 's have helped shed light on some of the issues and the successes experienced by australia 's first people and encourages all australians to engage in a conversation and understand the history that 's important it 's not your appearance or the color of your skin that defines you as a person you 're defined by who you believe you are within yourself and you are who you believe you are and that goes for everybody the most amazing thing is that everybody joins in to celebrate our differences our similarities our achievements and just to have fun together and it 's getting better every year without the support of the mansfield shire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been made all the more difficult as the years have progressed our celebration of this significant event in the app in the aboriginal calendar has been made more enriching for all of us indigenous and non-indigenous so i thank you thank you to you and thank you for your openness um and as you 've mentioned unfortunately due to cobra 19 restrictions which help help everyone 's safe the national night off committee has moved night off week to be celebrated from the 15th to the no the 8th to the 15th of november so for more information as time gets closer keep an eye for local publications including council 's website and the mansfield period as we get closer to the date and contact the gland and thank you so much for all your openness today it makes it really important to us to listen to what you have to say about the week naidoc week celebrations in mansfield this year will be fun and i wish you the best for the ongoing preparations but also for the ongoing work of the gland the gutter caterpillar group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'm pleased that you invited me to share this thank you so much,"(-37.053645, 146.0869862)"

Mansfield VIC 3722, Australia",11913,i just realized marco with the emails that i 've received so far i 'll just put them um in the chat i don 't think i did end up sending them to you so i 'm sorry about that um i 'll have to answer all of our questions on the fly now um but i will get them for you and make sure that you have them ready to go in the chat and i 'll facilitate the other questions that come through huh please okay just for everyone as you 're joining i am turning um i 'm turning visual and audio off for the moment we 'll start with a presentation by dr mark quigley um so and then at the end of that presentation we 'll be able to jump on so if you could please keep your cameras and speakers off until after dr mark quigley 's presentation and then we can jump on and ask him questions okay we might get started so um dr mark quigley uh the associate professor of active tectonics and geomorphology in the school of earth sciences at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name to say that he is an internationally renowned in his field and we are very lucky in the mansfield community to have him here to answer all of our earthquake related questions tonight we know that the entire community has been abuzz with all kinds of questions and so this is one opportunity where we can seek the answers so thank you so much dr mark quigley for joining us tonight um dr mark quigley has got a presentation for us and then he will answer our questions um following that presentation so if you will all kindly keep your microphones muted and your videos off for the presentation and then we can jump on and um ask him anything we want to after that presentation so go ahead dr quigley thanks very much tanya and welcome everyone it 's good to see you thanks for your interest in this um really appreciate it uh it 's nice to talk about something other than covert and this talk is going to give you a steady dose of earthquakes and so i hope you enjoy it just acknowledging i 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh brunswick east murray mary means very rocky and that 's quite a suitable place to live for a geologist so very delighted to be here i 'm also acknowledging we 're on tongaran country in in in manfield mansfield shire and you had this earthquake uh in your neighborhood and you deserve to know what happened and that 's why i 'm here so thanks for your company i 'm representing the university of melbourne and the seismology research center here uh in in victoria uh but i 'm also um collaborating with the australian government through geoscience australia so i 'm gonna present a little bit of their work related here i 've spent uh four days in the uh epicentral area immediately after that earthquake and i 'll be heading back up there tomorrow with my my wife and kids to do a little bit more geology and so i 'll tell you about some of the mysteries of the earthquake and the things that we 're interested in resolving while we 're there thanks very much i think this earthquake is really uh it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the uh the rockfall on the left on the image on the left there and things that didn 't happen that we might have expected would happen uh and this is a uh very high more than eight foot high uh chimney associated with with a cottage in uh in jemisin that was virtually undamaged despite being within 25 kilometers or so of the the epicenter of the event typically for an earthquake of this magnitude we would have expected the shaking to be strong enough that that such structures would be damaged so it 's interesting to think about why they weren 't a bit of contact about context about australian earthquakes we get an earthquake roughly equivalent to the magnitude uh 5.9 woods point earthquake about once every six to ten years so we actually do get these earthquakes reasonably commonly and but they 're they 're happening at the continental scale and so it 's a bit like throwing a dart at a very very large dart board uh the probability that we 're actually going to feel one of these is actually quite low and and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the largest magnitude uh earthquake in the last uh several hundred years recorded history in victoria we get about ten uh magnitude fours a year and about one magnitude five every year and we 've had 11 surface rupturing earthquakes there 's an image here showing what a surface rupturing earthquake looks like since 1960. um we 've been able to map evidence for past earthquake geological evidence across the country and we 've identified at least 230 of these but we see evidence for more and more every every day so we know that we get earthquakes in this setting uh and and just correcting a misconception there that we don 't we 're not seismically active here 's some of the most recent uh large events in in victoria and there 's these magnitudes are approximate um but we 've had several 5.7 5.4 and so on down to fives uh in the last uh century or so so it 's not an uncommon thing the highest rates of seismicity in the probe and the stress leki 's but we certainly have moderate rates of seismicity in these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've experienced important to talk a little bit about how faults in the earth 's crust make earthquakes and so the top cartoon here basically shows you a fault so fault is a big crack in your crust we have millions of them all across our country of all various sizes and shapes and geometries when when we apply tectonic forces to those faults uh in any given one given region the elastic strain builds up on the fault until eventually it it uh it needs to be relieved so it 's it basically the stress that 's been applied to the fault overcomes its frictional strength we have an earthquake uh and then the the fault sort of rebound rebounds back to a position when that earthquake occurs we send out a variety of waves both body waves p and s waves and surface waves rally and love waves there 's a lot of uh importance of understanding earthquake terminology and so this is a cross section in the bottom panel here of a fault and it 's deliberately shown to be a kind of a weird shape thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earthquake begins and the epicenter is the point on the earth 's surface above where the hypersetter begins the epicenter need be in the middle of the fault the epicenter center needn 't be the area where the fault moves the most it needn 't be the place where the most energy is released into the environment but it is our approximation for where the earthquake began if an earthquake is rupture is big enough if the fault ruptures enough it might reach the surface and produce a surface rupture but often they don 't and in the case of this event i 'm going to show you evidence that it probably hasn 't done done that those seismic waves travel out and get recorded at seismometers and they help us understand the magnitude of the earthquake and the location of the earthquake within often within minutes of its occurrence we have a variety of different faults the way that they move in the earth 's crust we have normal faults and one block moves down relative to the other in this kind of sense strike slip faults where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rocks are thrust up over top of one another uh depending on what kind of movement you generate that influences the characteristics of the seismic waves that travel out from that fault source and seismologists can use those characteristics to understand the nature of faulting even if the fault doesn 't break through to the surface when we look at the kind of waves that get generated in the patterns of them they are not simply like a point source which has an ex you know like an explosion for example where the waves radiate outwards with roughly equivalent intensities uh often we can make contours of those those energies and they 're asymmetric and and they have these unusual shapes around the earthquake source and and and that 's these are p waves and these are s waves and these are other types of surface waves that show the kind of patterns we expect in their intensity and so why this is important is this relates to the question of why did i feel the earthquake so differently from someone who lived over here or lived over there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or necessarily the most important reason but one reason is that the earthquake the type of faulting generates asymmetries in the energy released into the environment as those seismic waves travel through the crust they can be amplified as in they can increase in amplitude they can be reduced um and they can slow down uh there 's a variety of things that affect them so if you just look at this cartoon here for example you 've got waves coming in that you know potentially could trigger a landslide in a mountainous environment when they reach soft sediment they might slow down and increase in amplitude which is why often we get stronger shaking felt in soft sediment this was a situation in melbourne for the woods point event um and the extent to which those waves amplify is really conditional upon in part uh the nature of the sediment so the weaker and softer it is the more amplification might occur depending on the dominant frequencies of those waves you might feel them more strongly if you 're in a very tall building or in a very small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being distributed in terms of its spectral components when the seismic waves encounter mountains they tend to funnel and amplify so the tops of mountains tend to shake more than than the bases and there often seems to be just like uh you know a few bits of spaghetti in the bottom of your pasta bowl at the end of your meal there tend to be this is a what we call a particle motion plot and there tends to be asymmetries in the way the ground has moved so you might have noticed for example a bunch of stuff fell off one of your walls but not another one even if the other stuff was more precarious this relates to the fact that earthquake energy is is the waves coming in have certain directions from prominent directions and that influences the damage and certainly after one of the most recent earthquakes and christchurch that i studied back in 2011 i could see rocks that were being displaced in the direction of which the ground was was shaking when the earthquake occurs of course we have this network of seismometers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the audience was was the first seismologist to help locate this with her team a bunch of seismometers around the area and that the the p and s wave arrivals at these seismometers allow both the uh the earthquake to be located and then the spectral um the amplitudes of the waves and the characteristics of the waveform allow a magnitude to be estimated so this is just showing basically that for each one of these stations we know the distance to the earthquake we don 't know where on the circle it occurs but we know it occurring somewhere in that region but when you have enough stations you can actually precisely locate that that earthquake now why do we get us earthquakes in australia while we have on a very dynamic plate the australian plate is moving uh about six centimeters a year towards papua new guinea in the north northeast direction um but we are fringed with a with a plate boundary that is pushing and pulling and and resisting aspects of that motion so that creates what we call an interplay stress field so for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is sort of pushing back on our plate a little bit the subduction zone beneath that sumatra is pulling the plate forward new zealand is pushing uh back on us the southern alps are exerting a bit of a force but there 's also a lot of subduction along that plate boundary as well and of course there 's ridge push as we move away from antarctica so we are able to reconstruct this and think about the stress field in australia and that is is basically the the uh the cause of our earthquakes and if we look at this these rather complicated plots here what they 're showing these lines and that in the black and white image in the middle there and the orange lines in this um one on the left is showing us basically the directions of maximum horizontal compression another way in other words the way that the direction of the rocks are being squeezed and compressed and these blue arrows here on the image on the right show us roughly about how that is situated in various parts around australia the this this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way in which seismologists basically graphically represent the mechanics of faulting during the earthquake and the black line tells us what force is lead what compression forces led to that fault rupturing we don 't we don 't need to know anything about the stress field we can we derive that independently but you 'll see that black line is parallel to the orange lines meaning that this is perfectly well understood as a natural earthquake in response to far-field stresses acting in the australian crust now when we think on the continental scale again we there 's important things to recognize first hazard is not risk but both of them both hazard and risk are heterogeneous in time and in space and this earthquake of ours that occurred at woods point this earthquake occurred in one of these warm areas which is a relatively high seismic hazard area uh in relative to a lot of other areas around australia now in terms of the hazard there 's the occurrence of earthquakes and the magnitude of earthquakes but there 's also something called ground motion models and that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what these show is distance from the fault on the x-axis and pga on the y-axis and pga is a measure of the shaking intensity it stands for peak ground acceleration basically how fast the ground velocity is changing accelerating with time during an earthquake and the higher the peak ground acceleration the stronger the shaking and the more damage that is likely to occur uh within within the close proximity to faults so within one kilometer it is 10 kilometers we accept we expect very high peak ground accelerations for a variety different models and as we move away from the source we expect lower and lower intensities of shaking however uh we noticed that it that there was damage in in melbourne from this event and so one of the one of the aspects of this is considering this this aspect if i just go back to this risk and risk is essentially the product of the hazard in other words the earthquakes times are exposure to those earthquakes for example with a tree falls in the forest and no one is around do we know it fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ australia do we know it occurred and do we feel it well we do know it occurs because we can measure it but we may not actually feel it in any populated area and then finally times our vulnerability and a lot of places around australia have uh buildings like this one this is uh the now famous betty 's burgers in windsor and melbourne and then had this collapse of the infrastructure we have a lot of weak buildings so we have a high vulnerability so if you think about this relative to new zealand our seismic hazard might be comparably low our exposure is highly variable but our vulnerability in a lot of places is actually quite high and what that means is that relatively low levels of ground acceleration as shown here in this plot this is plotted against period relatively low levels of ground acceleration can cause things like this to happen this blue solid line represented in this plot represents a sort of the design spectra for modern buildings that are built to a seismic code in melbourne so in theory if you get ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to perform well from a life safety point of view but if we look at this um this acceleration plot here we see the orange and the gray are east and north components of shaking in a in green veil at a um seismometer there you can see that the minuscule relative to this code and they 're actually quite a bit smaller than what we would typically think of as a damaged threshold to cause buildings to be damaged in this way so it 's highlighting this extreme vulnerability under very low levels of seismic loading it also talks a little bit to the fact that we are soft sediments that can amplify that shaking little bit so back to false uh how do we know about faults well we first locate the earthquake source and understand its faulty mechanics and then we might plot it on geological maps like these ones here uh and and the aftershocks basically delineate where we think the fault is that ruptured the reason is because after that main shock occurs that big fault rupture occurs there 's a lot of smoothing out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fault plane that kind of settle in that first few weeks or so and so the aftershocks will illuminate the fault plane and that 's why we rush out there with seismometers and try to locate these things as quickly and as best we can because they tell us a lot about that that that faulting and importantly we get some faults that rupture the surface in australia but we get other faults that have ruptured the surface and then get buried we get some faults that don 't cause a discrete crack at the surface but just warp the surface in very subtle ways and then sometimes we get faults like this one which don 't appear to have any surface expression at all and we have existing equations to describe these relationships for example uh if a magnitude 6 earthquake is occurred i don 't necessarily need to jump out of bed straight away without knowing that there 's probably somewhere between a 20 and a 40 percent probability that that will have generated a surface rupture in australia at that location these are what we call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a certain magnitude that do and do not generate surface rupture so that 's something that we consider okay so to woods point again uh the the the red dots here show magnitude earthquakes greater than or equal to four so the biggest one there is the main shock and then 15 minutes later there was another magnitude for aftershock uh this is what sequence looked like in the first 24 hours and then in the first four days you can see that the aftershock cloud expands a little bit in time and some of you may have may have felt some of these aftershock events as i said earlier we can plot them up on a variety of different plots to understand where the fault was and at this at the moment if you look at this cross section here we think the fault uh is probably between four and thirteen kilometers below the surface so it 's outlined by a plane that 's quite steeply dipping between those those depths um and is about uh eight kilometers uh long and so eight kilometers by nine kilometers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be generating about 0.3 to 0.4 meters of discrete slip so the ground moves 40 centimeters in one go and it 's that breaking across this whole area rupture area here that generates the motions that we feel the aftershock sequence uh since that big main shock there is shown in this time series plot from the from the src uh like i said the biggest aftershock has been at 4.2 there 's been lots hundreds of smaller aftershocks this is a fairly typical sequence uh the the rate of aftershocks decays in time um 75 of the earthquakes that we we look at around the world have their largest aftershock in the first 24 hours and in the case of woods point that was within the first 15 minutes people often worry a lot about aftershocks so we 'll speak to those a little bit in the q a but typically the largest aftershock we get is around 1.3 plus a minus 0.4 lower than that mean shock magnitude um so in this case in this case with 1.7 below so it 's kind of within that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have that might be a little bit analogous to this 2009 um crombora earthquake sequence uh the the mowi sequence where the largest aftershock was sort of a 3.4 after a 5.7 event so we have a variety of sequences that we can compare this to the important thing of course is that while the rate of aftershocks decreases roughly with the reciprocal of time in other words on the 10th day of the aftershock sequence the probability of an earthquake of a given magnitude is 10 of what it was on the first day even though that happens that the magnitude itself doesn 't actually decrease and you can see in some instances like in kurumbora you can get a subsequent earthquake uh significantly later uh that is roughly the same magnitude of the main shot it 's even statistically possible although very unlikely most the time that you can get an earthquake even bigger than the main shock and then in that case seismologists fuss over terminology and may reassign that a different name and so on uh we also rely on humans to tell us a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we use something called the mortality intensity scale where people have the opportunity to answer a questionnaire do you did you feel it and the warm colors here are people that uh perceive the shaking to be stronger they might have had broken dishes they might have been scared they might have had some furniture moved there might be a variety of things they answer in and as you move further away from the earthquake you can see you 're getting lighter lighter colors uh that suggests that this the shaking is perceived to be a bit lighter and we can plot all that human data on our existing curves that 's that our models for how we expect that shaking to vary to kind of test those models and and see how well they align with the earthquake itself we also can dr quigley you 've dropped out audio 's dropped off for there are listeners here are you with us it looks like dr quigley 's actually dropped off the call so we 'll um we 'll wait for him to jump back in must be an earthquake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we want to take this moment um if you have any questions so far you can use the chat box to start putting them in and as dr quickly finishes his presentation i 'll make sure that i facilitate reading those questions through to him of course you 're welcome to keep them in mind now and wait until the end and you can jump on the video or the mic and ask them yourself at that point that 's no hassle either but for those people who might not want to jump um online on video or on speaker you can take this time to write them down in the chat box and i 'm happy to ask them later and we 'll just give dr quigley a minute to jump back in how 's everyone finding the presentation so far high level but awesome yeah it 's a pretty good summary excuse me tanya hi hello my name is dini nurse i work for the seismology research center um arc just gave me a phone call i 'm a colleague of marx he just gave me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's just going to log back in thank you so much steve thanks for the update people can post their questions i 'm sure we 'll be able to answer them when he 's back online fantastic thank you so much steve thanks the update thanks to those people posting questions is everyone from mansfield shire or a colleague of dr quigley 's we have a holiday house up at maryj we don 't know what shook out of it yeah have you been able to have someone um go and check on it no but um there wasn 't too much mentioned on our facebook groups for that area so we 're just hoping everything is okay i hope so too we certainly didn 't have our building surveyors um asked the community whether anyone had any um thing that they thought might reflect some structural damage and we had very very little reported damage um to our infrastructure so i think you can feel pretty safe and i think of some of the questions that we have for dr quigley tonight center around how we how we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you said you used to work at woods in woods point at the mine and um that 's something i 'm sure that we 'll have some questions about for dr quigley as well with the mines because we were all obviously pretty concerned about um what was happening with the minds and a big sigh of relief when everyone in the mines reported that um reported that they were okay and safe was such a relief um dee if you would answer some questions i think that would be fantastic if you could thanks no trouble sorry i don 't want to hijack mark 's talk i was actually making dinner for the family so i 'm not i 'm not really prepared but i moved into the other room so um how do you want to do this do you want to ask them would you want me to work through them or i 'm happy to ask if it makes it easier so yeah so um our mayor asked the first question actually he sent it in um and he said in 1989 the newcastle earthquake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 160 injured and millions and millions of dollars in infrastructure damage mansfield 's recent earthquake was recorded at 5.9 so higher and fortunately did very little damage and no one was injured or life 's loss why the big difference and did we just dodge a bullet that 's a really good question and in fact that 's one of the things that we were comparing the two events because the newcastle earthquake was slightly smaller and the same depth pretty much as the woods point earthquake so um yeah that 's something that we 've been thinking about the the rupture mechanism so the um the type of uh earthquake that the newcastle earthquake was was a bit different to what we had at woods point and we 're wondering um whether that had something to do with the ground shaking also of course the newcastle earthquake happened right up under newcastle so um if if that is if the woods poor earthquake happened closer to a very populated area we might have seen something different but at the same time we were quite surprised mark actually went out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and just went out there i haven 't been like myself um but they were quite surprised to the damage that they saw just wasn 't as as much as they thought that they would be seeing for that magnitude earthquake so we think it has to do with um the type of rupture that that the woods point earthquake involved so where there was no surface rupture as dr coogler was saying in his true yes there was no surface structure but neither there wasn 't a surface ruptured the newcastle either so it has to do with the um the type of the type of earthquake in terms of fault mechanism so um the woods point earthquake was a strike slip event and that tends to um cause a shadow of deformation right nearby um as in above the hyper center so we think that 's what we 're seeing we also think that um the geology around melbourne may have um may have enhanced some ground shaking which is why there was damaging buildings in melbourne as well yeah right so far away from the epicentre thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said do you think we will ever be able to accurately predict earthquakes i don 't know if we 'll ever be able to but certainly we can 't now and that 's um i don 't really even know anyone in earthquake science who looks at prediction it 's just something not on our radar at the moment it 's been attempted in the past and we 've failed so we we tend to look more at probabilities of earthquakes so we look at what 's happened in the past we look at the historical recorded um seismicity as well as the geological record of ground rupturing earthquakes and we bring that all together and try and work out what 's happened in the past and what we might expect in the future yeah great thank you the second question the next question is also from will and he said i 'm interested to know about the acceleration forces involved in this earthquake also how far did the surface move in the horizontal and was there a significant vertebral vertical component in this case so i don 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue his talk but he 's back i don 't know if you see that thanks i didn 't so i 'm just going to hand it back over it was just thanks so much for rescuing us there dee no trouble it 's a pleasure i 'll hand it back over thank you welcome back dr quigly thank you for jumping back here yeah thanks thank you yeah sorry um interestingly that 's the first time my computer has uh just died like that so um you know i put the curse on you when i asked you how stable your internet was sorry about that yeah no no it 's it 's all good it 's all good um i 'll just answer that that question uh from what i heard of it while my powerpoint loads up and hope for the best um the the earthquake was dominated by um straight slip motion so there was not a lot of vertical motion in terms of the actual faulting in terms of the um vertical ground accelerations uh i don 't have a plot with me at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were at any of the nearby stations they might have jumped back on to finish cooking her dinner she did flag but she was in the middle of a few things okay okay i 'll tell you what we 'll do we 'll finish off with what i 've got which was talking about the aftershock sequence and the various ways in which we i was about to show you some really interesting field photos so i might show you those um and then we 'll um we 'll revisit that question okay so i 'm just going to share share a screen sorry for the disruption everybody it 's a lesson in fortuity and sometimes we 're on the upside of fertility and sometimes sometimes we 're not okay great so as i said to you we went to the um we went we went to the epicentral region and we basically went around and explored a bunch of different sites i 'm just going to scroll through this quickly we expo explored a bunch of different sites and the reason we were doing this is because we actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we didn 't have any seismometers within 50 kilometers or so so we don 't know a lot about what happened in the near field ie in the epicentral area and close to the fall so this image shows where we visited we drove a bunch of roads and we looked at things like the amount of rocks that fell off the cliff as a function of the total cliff area where whether trees fell down whether there were road cracks what sort of damage we might have seen in bridges or in chimneys vulnerable infrastructure we spoke to some people about their experiences and so on and what we 're trying to do here is is use those observations to help us calibrate some of our models for what shaking might have looked like in terms of the intensity shaking and so on and so the red the red star is the epicenter the red line is the fault and these are all the places we went and i 'll be visiting the cola and kind of focusing a little bit down in this other area next time i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we started in jemison and then i 've got amazing got a place in covington so we were there for it as well um and we saw this kind of vulnerable chimneys um rock masses with heaps of loose rocks and stuff the sort of things you could just flick off with your finger and there was virtually no damage and i i would be interested if there 's anybody from jameson who had a different experience but i was just shocked that there was no damage we know that these magnitude events often cause damage at these distances and um really when we when we we can we can plug this information into models for example um that the strength of chimneys in the height of chimneys to work out what sort of ground acceleration might have occurred for the chimneys to still survive and attack the way they have and that gives us independent constraints on this measure i talked about before this peak ground acceleration so these are observations from point from point a if we go to point b where where my mates place is uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his uh one of his benches there they didn 't fall over at all some of his neighbors had brick piles and they hadn 't visited the property they were all still intact we went to this place and we thought oh this just old chimney uh on the on the mansfield woods point road this old chimney has been uh been badly damaged by the earthquake and we actually looked in and we found that there was moss on all the cracks inside the inside the mortar there was dirt and soil particles and roots in there so we know this is actually just a very vulnerable uh chimney setup that didn 't didn 't fall down didn 't damage when we went to point c so c is up in this area here north of the fault we saw a lot of damage so we saw joint control rock failures we had big cracks in the road some of these roads are closed now lots of toppled trees in some places and uh in some cases it 's like shown in the bottom right here we 've cliff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orientations didn 't and so we were fascinated by these observations and then finally when we got right on top of the fault where we expected damage to be the worst in fact we saw a lot of places where rocks had fallen down in the past from say rainfalls and just residual weathering and we had lots of loose rocks on the surfaces but there wasn 't much in the way of damage uh to those rock masses and it was highly variable there are some places where there 's a bit of damage to other places where they 're not this is basically right on top of the fault so i 'll talk you through the hypothesis based on these observations okay so the first thing is we think that the fault moves side to side and as a result of that there was very little up and down motion in the right on top of the fault it meant that the radiated energy was traveling outwards through the rocks it 's kind of like imagine blowing up two balloons from deep beneath the surface they 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the faults and that 's what we 're seeing we 're seeing evidence for damage in the northern area but not not necessarily right on top of the faults themselves also the type of faulting that move we have examples from japan and other countries where the the way that the energy is radiated is a little bit uh variable depending on where you are in the position of the fault so this cross mark here the blue areas is where the shaking is less than expected and the red areas where it 's more than expected this type of fault is analogous to the one that ruptured here and if i overlay it on this image you can see that the red areas uh are areas where we actually did observe a lot of the damage and in some extent the blue areas like in jemisin and so on are areas where we observed lesser less for damage so we 're cutting a picture together that involves the physics of earthquakes and the locations of these these observations and the damage that we see in the environment now the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ models and for the most part they actually seem to perform very well so the the fault um had what we call bilateral rupture eruption in both directions it was strike slip uh there was a lot of low shaking in the epicentral area which i think related to the strikes of motion but the green area the green line here represents the mean of all of our models and for the most part they actually the shaking was pretty much what we would expect uh not so much in the near field but certainly as we get further away melbourne as anticipated had some amplification soft cements which which is why we might have had um acceleration in melbourne that were a little bit higher than they expected okay so i 'm i 'm going to leave it there and i 'm going to i 'm going to answer these questions here did you talk about these already tanya or not we did thank you dr quigley those two questions were answered by first by d and then you jumped in on the second one so thank you um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as i invited people to ask their questions in the um little gap of time that we had while we waited for you so i 'll read them out to you from the chat box um so that you can not have to worry about that too much so this question 's from emma and she says my question would be now that we 've experienced something so big in victoria are we more or less likely to have an experience like this again in the near future we are more likely and the reason we are is because earthquakes make earthquakes and so there is a misconception amongst people in the community that once you have an earthquake it 's good it sort of alleviates stress and everything settles down but what it does is redistribute stress um and it creates both static stress changes that you know increase the stress on some faults and decrease it on others but it also the waves as they 're traveling through the crust shake up other fault zones and allow fluids to seep into areas that they may not have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more earthquakes you 're likely to get statistically what we would expect though and that what we 're seeing in the aftershock pattern is this exponential decay of aftershock rates with time and so as from from all we can tell at the moment it 's a kind of a classical aftershock sequence from what we can tell statistically it 's most probable that we 've had the largest aftershock already but it 's also likely that in this region there 's going to be a higher rate of seismicity over the next um even months to years then there would be as a sort of a background level uh and so i think you know it 's it 's interesting think about what we would do with that information are we scared of that or not and what what would we sort of how we get our head around that and i think it 's just a nudge to be just like when a fire races through our landscapes or anything else to just be able to reevaluate some of our activities the things we do the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can say you know as having two young kids at harm and and and having a lot of experience with earthquakes when the ground starts shaking you don 't necessarily know how big the earthquake is going to get and so you would make rapid quick decisions about finding a place a safe place to be and you will know where there 's some safe places are in your own home because those places are places where we 're not at risk of having things fall on us if we 're worried about that we get underneath the table and we stop dropping holes if we have vulnerably precarious objects in our house that could fall over for example large flat screen tvs on the edge of narrow cabinets lots of big heavy vases or whatever you may have in your home it 's a time to reevaluate some of those things certainly in that short term period after major earthquake um but yeah certainly the the the probability has increased a little bit not very much a little bit in the region and so there 's still a reasonably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel uh in the next few weeks thank you i think that potentially answers claire 's question as well she asked do you think earthquakes will become more common in victoria and is there a way of telling if they will increase in strength in the future yeah so um as i said to you uh earlier we we we are able to use the geological record to put constraints on how big we think an earthquake could be in victoria in a very very low probability but high consequence scenario and so remember that the strength in which we won 't feel an earthquake in any setting is conditional upon the size of the earthquake of course sure but also our distance from that earthquake and so for example a magnitude 6 rate beneath our city is going to feel way worse than a magnitude 7 that 200 kilometers distance from us even though a magnitude 7 will will produce 32 times the the energy of the magnitude 6. uh and so um it is it is something that we know we can get magnitude sevens in in in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the geological record what we see are faults that are long enough and have had enough ground displacement in a single event that they are analogous to earthquakes and other settings around the world that are similar to ours where we actually have been there to witness them and we know what magnitude the those earthquakes produced so in general in australia we think we can get things around seven and even up even higher than that i have a phd student who 's working on faults in another board and she reckons some of them can produce 7.6 7.7 wow and those earthquakes in australia we feel them at greater distances than we do in a lot of plate boundary settings like new zealand and uh papua new guinea and the philippines and japan and the reason is because our crust is stronger and so the seismic energy that 's produced by the sheer rupture of rock is able to travel more effectively through the crust there are there are fewer fractures and heterogeneities and things that can dissipate that energy and so that allows our earthquakes to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of western australia and in central australia thanks dr quickly um jess asked we live within around 20 kilometers of the epicenter is it helpful if i report every time we feel an aftershock we have experienced many well thank you for sharing that uh that 's good to know we so one of the reasons we raced out there in the first sort of 30 hours which was what it took to get our paperwork and get organized and there 's someone in the room who 's with me januka at that time was that the quicker we get a dense network of seismometers out there the more we can learn about the earthquake sequence because those seismometers will allow us to precisely locate earthquakes the aftershocks and also record to much lower magnitudes so we can get very very small magnitude earthquakes so our seismometers just will be feeling we 'll be recording things that you are not feeling and certainly recording all of the ones that you are feeling so it 's helpful if you get one that you want to report and from uh did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the geoscience australia website and do that but um we 've got you covered we 've got instruments out there that are that are doing their jobs and uh we 're getting a pretty steady stream of data coming in thank you um chris asked is the great dividing range more a historically active fault that is no longer active and that the processes mark described are largely separate from the range building tectonics uh it 's a great question and i just noticed d punched in the chat there was just domain at 2 2.8 right now so if you were close enough you might have might have felt that thanks for sharing that d um so so to that question look every time we go and look on uh mountainous areas at the edges of where the mountains have been built for evidence of what we call neo-tectonic faulting so major earthquakes that have ruptured the ground 's surface and uplifted the mountains in the last few million years every time we go look we find it it 's there all of our mountains that i know of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting in and have through the more and more and more earthquakes over time have built those mountains so for example the flinders ranges for those you 'll be familiar with the flinders in south australia we estimate about half of that current elevation has been built by earthquakes in geologically recent times that it 's kind of caught between a vice between a strong craton and a another area of continuous process being squeezed and uplifted the great dividing range is now an exception for that we have plenty of things in the landscape not only that tell us that the rocks are moving upwards and over geological time scales but also the rivers are cutting down through them and so the relief that you see in that landscape is increasing and has increased over the last several million years thank you anne asked does oil drilling cause earthquakes uh any changes that uh affect the hydrological the flood of distribution of fluids in the earth 's crust and the stresses in the earth 's crust have the potential to generate seismicity so let 's say we make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filling up in that catchment is associated with a load and that load influences the crust and can cause earthquakes the fluids that are building up the water that 's building up in that reservoir is leaking through the rocks and can trigger earthquakes as was the case of thompson dam so any of those sort of things uh wastewater injection uh fracking um oil extraction whatever it may be all of them have the potential to to generate earthquakes however the the natural processes and in this earthquake is a natural earthquake the natural processes in the vast majority of cases swamp that anthropogenic signal there are exceptions to that but for the most part they they swamp that signal and so one one thing we can do is we can for example look at the rates of earthquakes in certain areas where we 've recently started to do things to the crust like inject fluids and so on and this is a hot topic in the united states because they have a lot of this wastewater injection processes and going on across across the us and they see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no doubt there 's plenty of evidence for that um in the australian case we have examples for mining induced earthquakes we have a variety of micro earthquakes that are produced through all sorts of processes that relate to humans the question is how big an earthquake could be that was generated by human processes and the way i look at that is i suspect that we could trigger something but that fault would have already been so primed and ready to go that in a sense it may well have happened on our watch anyways if we get a really big earthquake wow this next question is a little longer so time for a sip of wine um from douglas douglas says i live in a solid masonry home my question is is it safer in a masonry home or a timber structure my thought is that a timber home may be more flexible and therefore safer yeah it 's a good question and i don 't want to put the fear of you know what into anybody but um it is a good question to ask so there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bricks are bad um we live in a brick house two-story brick house here uh it 's it 's a very strong house it would be able to survive earthquakes of a variety of strengths and shaky intensities not all brick is is bad but in places where the brick walls are not very well supported where the masonry has fallen into disrepair um where things are not well maintained or perhaps there 's some flaws in the initial structural design they pose a major hazard and we know that when we have very strong shaking it 's the unreinforced masonry buildings that are the most badly hit in the first instance they topple over or they have damage at lower accelerations and a classic timber frame house and all you have to do is go to wellington new zealand or san francisco or variety places around the world and you 'll see that most of a lot of the places there the residential houses in particular are timber framed or the concrete structures are heavily engineered to design to withstand earthquakes i can 't speak specifically about your property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you at some time if you drop me an email but what i could say is when we have a significant earthquake like this one building inspections are a good idea and you will often be the best judge of that you might have noticed cracks where um you didn 't have any before and it 's worth thinking about those and having someone come and look at them who is an expert often these will be cosmetic often you 'll see radiating cracks in the corner of your door frames for example places where the shear stresses were enough to kind of you know create irregularities and cause these things but sometimes you can have structural problems and it 's best that an expert speaks to you about that so that was kind of a highly technical and long-winded way of saying that um brick isn 't always bad but unreinforced masonry structures typically are more vulnerable to damage in earthquakes of this style and magnitude and shaking intensity and council does have building surveyors so for those who live in mansfield child you call us if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if that might be more than cosmetic um and we 'll have the buildings of a come and check it out to make sure it 's safe to inhabit um john asks our dog daisy went ape 10 seconds before the earthquake hit us any idea why do we do we know where john lives uh john where do you live he 's in jameson thanks oh gemma okay good well we may see you there uh john we 'll be we 'll be there in a couple days um look often animals are susceptible to feeling vibrations that we may not be aware of or notice so i was out for a walk with my dog i didn 't even feel the earthquake my dog just stopped and sat down and acted weird and i had no idea why she was doing that but then when i kind of read back calculated my mental clock i was like yeah that was probably about the time of that earthquake coming through um earthquakes sent out p waves for the the p waves uh are fastest traveling they 're faster than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the vibrations generated by these fast-moving compressional waves before we do and act a little bit strange and then the s waves arrive in surface waves and those are the things that we really feel and notice um often there have there have been cases where people argue that microseismicity sort of precedes the the big earthquake and we may not even be aware of that in this instance because we didn 't have a dense size seismic network um that animals may be able to proceed so there 's a it 's a combination of things right seismic waves are being produced at the same time by the fault rapture but then the fastest traveling waves are low amplitude um and the animals might perceive those so um yeah it 's it 's something that is observed almost ubiquitously people describe their pets acting strange birds flying out of a tree or off of a power line before the strong shaking hits we would expect our animals to behave weirdly uh more and more prior and more before the earthquake the further we were away from the source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in before the big ones come in thank you um the next question is from jess and she says i 'm nine years old and is gold generally found near a fault line thanks for your question that 's really that 's really good and oh and and the answer is yes and the reason is is because earthquakes are natural conduits for fluid concentrations in the crust so for example a lot of times when we have a big fault that ruptures and breaks through the crust it sucks fluids into that fault zone that basically come from the rock hot fluids that come from the rock and then they sort of heal up and re-crystallize like a scab on your arm for example they heal the fault and there 's a process by which that fault zone basically recovers from the earthquake and strengthens again from having been broken and if you have you know gold and various other elements are can be soluble at reason geologically low temperatures and so they can be carried in solution and re-precipitated in fault zones and so what you often see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fault that has generated earthquakes in the past is that there 's a lot of quartz veining in there that is associated with hot fluids coming through the rock and recrystallizing and there 's often a lot of mineralization gold and other and other sulfides that gets sucked into there so um so your answer is yes it is what a great visual description um claire asked what are the risks of landslides in the mansfield area and what causes this uh yep so we we observed a variety of what we what we would call incipient landslides meaning that they have commenced activity and we would expect them to continue activity in certain places uh examples of these are where you see these big curvilinear uh like look like bite marks coming out of some of the roads and there 's one actually on the way to woods point um from jammo heading heading heading uh towards woods point um there are a lot of places where roads have been built on fossil landslides so places where cliffs collapsed catastrophically in the past but where it 's been convenient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roads in and so we know that in this landscape there 's been lots of landsliding and you probably even some of you have seen landslides and heavy rains and so on so this is not a surprise to you um the earthquake shaking when it comes in uh the waves amplify when they get near the surface especially in soft sediments and they can cause slips and cracks and so on and basically the depth of those landslides and the size of them tends to scale with the intensity of shaking that the rocks have been put under in this case we didn 't see any big landslides at all either on satellite imagery i had my drone flying around looking for them and we observed lots of areas it just doesn 't seem that the shaking was strong enough in the epicentral region to produce them instantaneously but that doesn 't mean that down the track it has weakened a lot of areas uh that that could potentially fail in the future and so it 's a good idea to keep an observation on those and i 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with tanya who could distribute to you guys um but we 've we 've done some reconnaissance reconnaissance work and we will be revisiting there 's also been lots of road inspections done by various teams and so it 's something we 're going to keep keeping on for sure great well um i think that brings us to the end of the questions that were in the chat box unless i 've missed any if anyone would like to [Music] put up their hand or jump in and and ask a question of dr quigley now is your opportunity before we wrap up hello hi douglas uh i did ask a question in the check box i was concerned about the miners in the a1 sorry i missed that douglas there were a few going on there yep um what would they have been their experience been like mark yeah we did we did speak to them um but how do i put this diplomatically uh we we believe that their accounts were as they said they were and that there was not really it wasn 't a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were lots of rocks falling off of the surfaces and they said no not really um we asked them whether they had more fluids coming out of the rocks and these sort of things they said no not really so but there might be reasons why people might want to downplay their experiences for a whole bunch of reasons um it 's not for me to speculate about that um it 's for me to take take their observations and in their thoughts uh as as they 're communicated to me uh but what i will say in our reiterate is is that um certainly we would have expected a little bit of ground cracking and some rock spalling going on uh during that event in the mines we don 't we don 't have any accounts of that um but we also know that the seismic waves amplify as they get closer to the surface and so on a deep mine perhaps the shaking wasn 't very intense and so we 're going to go with that and suggest that there probably was very minimal that would compromise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in there the next day so you know this is as usual um i just also would like to note for everyone in the chat box that dee 's just given the link to everyone for reporting aftershocks on the uh felt it reported site there on the src site dr quigley so just going back to jess 's original question of how to report and i think you referenced that website so anyone else who would like to help to report aftershocks that 's the place to do that um and anne commented that they had a clock fall off the wall the day before the earthquake could that be related um well we have things fall over all the time so it 's really hard to so okay let 's let 's rocks fall off of those road cuts along the um those roads in the area all the time right sometimes during rain sometimes for re because it 's just residual weathering maybe an animal scampered up the side of a cliff or whatever it may be so we might tend to use heuristics and and sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rocks that fell off of that cliff face a day before the earthquake i wonder if there 's a a connection and so there 's a big distinction between some things that kind of happen close in time versus things that are um linked by causality and so i suspect without knowing anything about your clock and with due respect probably just a random thing that happened that stuck in your head and then when the earthquake happened you said i wonder if those two things were linked probably not before we wrap up will has one last question will did you want to ask that [Music] yeah uh tanya so just um what one interesting thing that happened at the hospital um was a gentleman came from woods point who had actually fallen out of a tree um so he um i thought mark and dean might be interested in that he was doing some tree lopping up at woods point and um obviously his identity is is confidential but if mark if mac and d would like to call him we could certainly give him a joy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other thing just very briefly just for the other participants they might be interested some people know that um i have a personal link to seismology history that my great great uncle john millen invented the seismograph in japan in the 1870s and recorded was the first person to record an earthquake on paper and then set up the world 's first network of seismographs all over the world and founded the seismological society of japan which preceded any other seismological society by 30 years i think so um so it 's sort of an inter the story is interesting to me um if anyone is interested i made a documentary about him and i could uh i could send them the link to it if if if you want it 's just we 'll try across gmail.com i can send you the link if you 're interested in looking at it 's been shown around the world at seismological conferences in most continents in fact but it 's um and also translated into japanese just a little bit of interesting history that 's all i just thought throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mouthful child will people are responding that they would love to see that if you 'd like to put the link in the chat and certainly if you would be happy we 'll we 've recorded this session today and it 'll go on the council website if you would like that documentary to go alongside it would be more than happy to share that as well there 's certainly a lot of interest so if you would like to do that that would be fantastic and you can send that to council mansfield.vic.gov dot a u which does bring us to um neil 's question uh he says that he has pics and video and is there any email that um anyone would like to him to send that to um i don 't know dee or dr quigly if you 've got um an email that you 'd like to see that kind of stuff at yeah very happy to receive that um my email i 'll just put in the chat now so yeah if you can send me that that would be great i 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of the observations as possible and to evaluate those it 's a little bit of what we call citizen science so you guys can help us and we can help you um and we can co-produce something interesting if um we have good observations that have been well documented and we know where things uh happened so yeah please do thanks thank you so much um thanks uh thank you for all of the um people who have joined in we 've got heritage here with will thank you um and thanks dee for jumping in to rescue us when we when we had our little um crash so that there was an expert answering some questions while we waited it was even an interesting point while we waited doctor quickly so i think that speaks to the fact that we 've all had a great time learning from you it was a great presentation and all of our questions got answered and we 're really grateful to have had this opportunity so thank you so much on behalf of the mansfield shy community for giving us that opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing so um we 'll hope to see you around the mansfield community traps while you 've got your size monitors around yes i i hope to be there all look like this so we 'll um we 'll um see you soon thanks for hosting me and thanks for your interest everybody i really appreciate it it 's been nice to spend the evening with you thanks thank you so much thanks everyone for joining us have a lovely night and thanks for your interest and um i 'm sure we 'll see your emails and chats on facebook soon thanks thank you thanks everyone thanks for all your questions everyone bye,"(-37.053645, 146.0869862)"

Highett St, Mansfield VIC 3722, Australia",15485,good afternoon and welcome to the mansfield shire council meeting tuesday the 15th of september 2020. before we commence today 's virtual council meeting i wish to note that this meeting is being conducted online in accordance with the provisions of the covert 19 omnibus emergency measures act 2020 which was passed on the 23rd of april by the victorian parliament this new act introduced provisions into the new local government act 2020 to allow for virtual council meetings such as this one to take place from the 1st of may until the 1st of november 2020 i also remind everyone that local government decision making unlike state and federal government does not afford the benefit of parliamentary privilege and hence no protection is afforded to councillors and council officers for comments made during meetings which are subsequently challenged in a court of law and determined as to be slanderous as with our previous online meetings in order to be recorded as present at the meeting each counsellor must confirm that they can hear the proceedings they can see the other councillors in attendance and be seen by other members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to present and apologies i will ask all councillors to confirm this it is also a requirement that all virtual meetings of council are made accessible to the public by being

@ @ first one is the business and community recovery advisory committee councillor paul sladden thought update please uh thank you madam mayor yes the business and community advisory committee um met last week to discuss the draft report of the um of the recovery plan that draft report will come before council next week we also have a second meeting last one before caretaker scheduled for this coming monday i must say that i 've been very impressed with the innovation that 's been shown by local businesses and also the community in their care um throughout this period and the commitment of the committee members in assisting council to work together with the business community and the community more generally to progress this forward so that that draft plan will be released very shortly thank you madam mayor thank you councillor sladden and i support as chair of that committee i do support your your words there about our community and our businesses the next one is the golden broken greenhouse alliance which i chair i attended my last meeting of the ordinary meeting of the goldman broken greenhouse alliance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plus the cma and delp an amazing group of people who are working tirelessly around the climb climate change the highlights of the meeting were about the business plan advocacy that the alliance puts forward to other alliances but also to government for future funding opportunities is that it is an alliance which allows many things to happen across the sector in those councils in the northeast which would not be possible for any small council to do last week was the agm which highlighted through the annual report the achievements for the 12 months and looking to the future for different things around the electric vehicle charge stations and growing cooler green urban spaces in councils so the next one is the hume region local government network which is made up of the northeast council ceos and mayors and we met recently on strategic planning exercise to look forward to see the constitution the way the operation of the network might be and the purpose and the future so it was very important uh we moved to the audit and risk committee councillor harry westernville will give us a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and risk committee met on the 31st of august and uh with uh full attendance there there was there 's nothing extraordinary to report uh the vego um auditor was there and there was some discussion around the way in which some of our financial transactions are accounted and so the discussion generally is that we will agree to differ with the vago auditor and continue to have our financial reports show more transparency rather than less simply because i think we owe that to the community so things like the reserve for the waste we need to explain that more clearly to the community than would be done through the recommended processes by the auditors the other point that came up was things like grant funding which hasn 't been acquitted yet and there was a discussion about which year that should show up and again vego is um accepts the fact that we want to show it in a way that is more meaningful for our community so the um there were no concerns from vago or no material concerns there are a few cosmetic things on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly good for um for that report in terms of the vago scrutiny of it thank you councillor westendorf we move to the municipal emergency management planning committee councillor paul volkering please thank you madam mayor um yes we had a meeting last tuesday september the 8th a productive meeting [Music] so just a couple of quick things we discussed the new municipal emergency management planning guidelines that all councils are going to have to adopt we also had a really comprehensive update from council officer kevin murphy regarding the pandemic rus the current pandemic say the code 19 response and uh i think it 's appropriate to also mention the fantastic response from the mansfield shire community and adhering to the guidelines for regional victoria um the ses uh pointed out that we are forecast to have a la nina or a strong possibility of um and they are on watch regarding that so possible heavy rains for northeastern victoria through to uh or through uh october november the ses are well placed to respond to that excuse me uh crime levels uh across mansfield as reported by senior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact on that but on a pleasing aspect uh steve was uh commenting that the uh family violence incidents uh don 't seem to have had a spike in mansfield so that 's a really positive thing for our community once again um there was an issue that arose which impacts some of our non-resident rate pay so due to the recurrent restrictions in melbourne some of our non-resident rate are unable to come to mansfield to prepare their properties particularly the larger landowners for the forthcoming summer season so we 're looking to see how we may be able to address that issue goblin valley water also reported on a main in high street mansfield on the corner of high street and hyatt street directly opposite the delta hotel which has been or has burst twice now one of the issues there is uh heavy vehicles uh progressing through that corner heading uh north towards spinella and their weight especially v doubles is causing that main to fracture so they 're proposing some fairly extensive works this time to try and address that particular issue um i think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and uh i think it 's appropriate uh madam mayor your contribution to uh emergency management uh i went to the extent of acknowledging you and i want to make that public through our council meeting uh your contribution to the emergency management uh committee for some period now is uh has been outstanding so thank you on behalf of the community once again and also uh the role of our former community manager community services manager mel houghton whose response during the bushfire period and also the beginning of covert 19 in garnishing the community together and providing support and response both to council offices council laws and the community so thank you to mel and also once again noting your outstanding work madam mayor so that 'll do for me thank you very much for your words councillor walking um councillor olva would you like to just do a short report on the northeast local government waste forum please thanks madam mayor yes we recently had a meeting of the forum and had the normal housekeeping and so on but i guess the standout for the meeting was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the directors owners of a company called blue environment and they 're at the cutting edge of the forefront really of all kind of waste strategies joe is extremely interesting and that blue environment is engaged by the federal department of ag water environment environment to come up with a national waste report every two years so the last one was then this started in 2010 so every two years since then they 've updated and come up with a new strategy or report and so 2018 if you want to anyone wants to to google federal department of ag water and environment and have a look at the national waste report it 's really interesting and what joe joe and his team does is they consult with all the states and private industry and they put together the current picture of what 's happening to waste or happening with the waste space right around australia so very interesting um and so at the moment he 's working on 2020 pretty much almost finalized it and they also incorporate some targets and one of his their interesting one was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of people not compulsory sorry a lot of people sign up have signed up to it um his australian packaging targets and the the target by 2025 is a hundred percent this is for packaging a hundred 100 reusable recycled or compositable so yeah it was really interesting thanks for that thank you councillor oliver any other councillors want to comment on any other of the appointed committees thank you could i have a motion please to note that and read someone to read the actual recognition recommendation please counselor oliver oops we 'll find it sorry i 'm i 'll be there when i 'm just doing my laptop the council note the verbal reports provided by councillors in relation to their representation on external committees i 'd like to move that do i have a second place councillor volckering all in favor thank you the motion is carried number item number 12 is public question time where council welcomes questions from the community a question must be submitted uh by midday monday prior to the council meeting and the ask a question form is available on council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will read the question and then the response if the question has come from dave bennett and the question is please inform us why the mansfield rubbish tip was closed while no other rubbish tips in victoria were shut down under the same covert guidelines this is a service that is funded in part by us rate payers but we will not see a reduction in our rates for our loss of service the response visiting the mansfield resource recovery centre disposal household waste was not considered a valid reason to leave home under the government 's stage three covert restrictions the mansfield resource recovery centre has remained open to essential commercial and trade customers and residents without a curbside collection service this is also in line with other neighbouring councils who acting on the vice provided by the state government introduced restrictions to their resource recovery center operations further to the gov government restrictions council has also had has an obligation to protect staff from exposure to customers while visiting the facility from stage four restricted areas or outside the municipality to avoid any potential transmission of coronavirus therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limiting potential for staff exposure to the virus from visitors in the more heavily restricted areas with the relaxation of restrictions announced by the victorian government today the mansfield resource recovery center will be open to the general public as of 12 noon this friday the 18th of september we will move on to item 13 which is officers report reports and the first one is the departmental reports madam ceo could you lead us with that please thank you madam mayor there 's a number of reports there indicating the activities over the last month or so i 'll take the reports as read and happy to answer any questions counselors any questions or comments please councillor sladen uh thank you madam mayor um i 'd just like to highlight the human resources departmental report and to see that we finally have in my mind a modern and streamlined uh staffing structure at manchester council with the recent appointment of the general manager of community and corporate services in the interim um we have ms jenny mcmahon and i 'd like to welcome mr jenny mcmahon to the position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of november when mr chris snook will take over so it 's pleasing to see that staffing structure finally in place as i said it 's a modern one mansfield shire has finally got on a par with every other council i believe and i 'd like to acknowledge the fantastic work that our ceo ms konrick has done in ensuring the smooth transition to that so thank you madame that 's all i wish to comment upon thank you councillors london council of old green uh yes i uh thank you madame i 'd like to support uh council satan 's comments uh as well i think that 's a great outcome but i 'd also just like to highlight if i could the wonderful work uh of one of our local contractors in completing the path along the bullard uh we know that 's been a particular particularly dangerous area especially for some of our older residents that are having to make their way to and from their caravan park back into town um great to see that outcome uh also want to commend the council officers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the uh the parking signs and what not along that section of road there i think it 's a hell of a lot safer than it used to be we 've had a pretty quiet uh winter this year with thank goodness in some respects um but i 'm sure next season if things get back to any sense of normality uh that 'll be a much safer area for people to move along thank you thank you councillor volkering i 'd just like to compend all the staff with the excellent reporting to council for the month of these department mental reports um i know count the staff are extremely tired but it 's obvious from the reports that it 's work as usual and excellent good well done so counselors any other comments or questions i 'll call on someone to move a motion please on page eight council of western dawg seconder council of old crime councillor westendorf would you like to make a statement as a mover uh madam mayor i move that the council receive and note the departmental reports for the period 19th of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sense i don 't think so the dates are wrong yes i think it should probably be september yes so the fourth of july secondary councillor vulcan you wish to second all that thank you i 'll now move on to infrastructure and planning 13.2.1 application for planning permit number p04620 the use and development of land for service station display of business identification signage and the creation of access to a road zone category 1 25 to 27 malcolm street mansfield and we have presentations this evening and we will just wait we have lorraine bruce who is an objector who will be speaking first each of our speakers have three minutes to speak letting lorraine in now thank you have three hello lorraine can you hear us i can hear you okay madame mayor i thank you and council for giving me the opportunity to speak when undertaking due diligence prying prior to buying our home at 1335 malcolm street can you hear me yes lorraine um were you going to go on video so we can see you or would you prefer just your voice [Music] @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we can ask mrs bruce to please turn her radio off because it is because it 's on delay that he 's coming back through so uh lorraine if you could please turn your radio off that 'd be great thank you okay thank you um i will start when undertaking due diligence prior to buying our home at 1335 malcolm street i contacted council and spoke with amer twarfik i was advised by him that because the land was in a general residential zone although zoned commercial one there could only be a non-invasive development on the land with passive use this developed development does not fit that criteria as the level of the land in the northwest corner is to be raised by 1.2 meters by virtue of fill and a retaining wall ground level will be only 60 centimeters below the top of the western boundary fence with the building 6.92 metres high above that it will certainly cut out light from our east-facing windows the acoustic fence is planned to be 1.8 metres high on the original ground level in this area it will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above the new field level also a concern with raising the ground level is the matter of drainage at present there is a great deal of runoff during heavy rain which causes flooding on the block which is now a car yard from our upstairs window i can clearly see water built up along the northern fence of the car yard that water can remain there for several days if the application is approved the hours of operation during construction must be limited the earthworks proposed are very substantial and will create unavoidable disruption to neighbouring residences the applicant has stated that the convenience store will sell only pre-packaged food drinks etc the plan shows a deep fryer with space for other equipment consistent with the sale of at least hamburgers and chips the light tower proposed for the southeast corner states fast food is available the plan shows indoor and outdoor dining and multiple toilet facilities it is clear they are aiming to sell more than pre-packaged food the proposal is for the business to operate 24 7. this will most definitely have a detrimental impact on our surround @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consideration to the fact that the land is identified as general residential under the mansfield township framework plan and is well away from both the township retail sector and the retail sector on mount buller road this land is not included in the proposed commercial footprint mansfield town centre which forms part of the mansfield commercial and industrial strategy 2020 which is to be considered by council at this meeting the fact that this land was a shell service station 20 plus years ago should have no bearing on this application that business was closed and the premises demolished i was advised at that time that the reason for its closure was traffic congestion on that corner i asked that council reject this application due to the matters i have raised and its detrimental impact on surrounding properties thank you thank you very much mrs bruce councillors are there any questions of mrs bruce please counselor olva um hi lorraine it 's councillor peter oliver here thanks for for your presentation have a question in relation to that the land next to you at the moment i 'm just wondering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the level of smells or fumes or whatever from that site at the moment is there any nuisance from that site no there isn 't so the amenity is good as at the moment yes it is thanks lauren thank you very much councillors any other question thank you very much mrs bruce for joining us this evening and for your presentation thank you thank you madame thank you councillors we 're waiting for andrew field who will be speaking against the proposal are you there andrew you want me to andrew just unmute thank you andrew are you there okay can you hear me we can thank you very much indeed do you have a video or i do indeed and that should be working now that 's fantastic thank you very much indeed thank you sorry thank you you have three minutes mister three minutes right thank you okay um look as i said my name is andrew field i 'm actually speaking on behalf of my mother anfield who is the 82 year old owner of the property known as 60 chenery street which sits on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in other words facing the site in question 25 malcolm this is a property which has been in our family since 1934 when the house there was built by my grandfather george my gran my mother 's objection does not relate so much the application to run a service station because as we 've heard there was one or there has been one operating there for most of the last years the objection relates to the hours of operation and specifically the hours after 8pm running all the way through the night for the early hours of the morning up until uh 6 a.m this is on account of the expected increase noise signage and lighting pollution which will accompany the operation as with most properties in the vicinity of the site my mother 's house is a residential property it 's where people live it 's where they sleep it 's where they eat were the site typically in a commercial zone i don 't know the objection would carry too much weight however the zoning of the site is commercial is clearly an anomaly on the zoning map @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial zone in high street it is in fact the only commercially zoned site in the area and it 's faced on three of its four sides by residential properties and indeed but for the recent subdivision of the foresight by residential properties although the applicant has relied on the close proximity of other commercial facilities the only other visible commercial operation within 300 meters is in fact martin 's garage and i will just say it 's closed every day from 5 30 pm the area is plainly residential and the mansfield township framework reflects this a walk around the site reflects this and residents of mansfield i think would plainly see this as well in relation to the noise during the daytime this intersection is extremely busy but at night time it 's almost dead even at the the applicant has conceded that um there will be additional noise and traffic that 's why it 's been suggested that acoustically treated timber fencing will be put in to protect those residents to the west but nothing 's been provided for for the residents uh on the other side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intends to operate in those later hours the early hours of the morning i 'll be seeking to attract customers and the resulting noise in circumstances where the area is clearly residential where the commercial zoning is out of place and noticeably out of place and such operation will be harmful to the evening amenity of surrounding homes like my mother 's and the necessity of running a 24 hour a day operation at this site at those times has not been established i submit that in fact this part of the application should not be approved that is of course a matter for you the council but that is my mother 's objection and submission thank you thank you andrew mr field councillors are there any questions of andrew please there don 't appear to be any questions thank you andrew very much for the submission thank you very much we now have jane macy who is the applicant to speak hello jane can you hear us you 've just got yourself on mute but you 're in the meeting now thank you jane are you online are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much we can see you um you have three minutes to present the counsellors are on screen okay thank you madam mayor and thank you councils for the opportunity to speak to you this evening my name is jane macey i am a town planner with spire based over in shepparton and we have been assisting with this planning permit application i 'd also like to introduce peter spargo who is online from the spargo group peter is a long time landowner in the mansfield area and has a proven track record of quality developments in the town as well the successful townhouse development at number two malcolm street is well designed and presents attractively to both street frontages there 's no reason that this won 't continue with the new development that peter 's proposing at malcolm street this proposed service station it represents a significant investment into the town an investment of approximately two million dollars which is a significant investment at this time particularly during the covert pandemic and it is an investment that will utilize local trades and services for the construction and lead to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site 's been selected because it is a commercially zoned property it 's in a commercial one zone as per the mansfield planning scheme it also abuts a road in a road zone one its previous use as a petrol station gives it some weight as an existing previous use and it is ideally located for overstation the design has gone through a number of iterations and we feel it 's responsive to the site 's context the main activity areas face away from the immediately abutting residential properties and there 's an acoustically treated fence which is a common uh a common design feature where anything that abuts a residential area is implemented there will be landscaping along all boundaries so the development will present attractively onto both street frontages we 've worked diligently with the council officers and the local authorities to understand the requirements and we 're happy to comply with the requirements and the regulations of those authorities including hours set during any construction period through construction management plans which would be enforced by the council we have had a good look at all the issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those we 've offered to work with adjoining property owners in terms in terms of fence heights fence colors the location and the placement of lightings including sensor lights if that was a desired outcome by the adjoining property owners and of course landscaping with the ability to provide some input into species selection and location we feel at the moment that the site currently presents a security risk because it 's vacant and undeveloped and unsupervised the development proposes an activation of this site thereby increasing the security and surveillance of that area sensor lights can be positioned appropriately and the property will be covered by cctv and surveillance cameras operating 24 7. so there will be a capture of all activity that undertakes on the site the drainage there 's a number of proposed conditions which will address all of those issues to do with drainage there is no there 's no plans to provide fast food fast food is another word for food that 's just readily available when people go in to provide their payment for their petrol there will be the ability to heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's certainly no plans to turn this into a fast food chain type restaurant the number of toilets complies with the building regulations and all other design features comply with the building regulations for what the purpose of that convenience store is uh in terms of traffic circulation we 've had a number of discussions with rrv uh the plan has undergone various iterations to comply with their requirements and regional roads victoria has given approval to the proposal in summary we believe the development provis presents a net community benefit to the mansfield community it represents a significant investment into the town there will be provision for local employment opportunities and the use of all local trades and services during the construction and ongoing employment the development will include attractive landscaping and it will be well presented to all boundaries and all interfaces and importantly it 's a vacant unutilized site on one of the the main roads in mansfield it will be given a new life a new lease on life and a meaningful purpose with an attractive built form so we encourage uh you tonight to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a net community benefit to mansfield in its community i 'd like to thank you all for your time tonight and i 'm happy to respond to any questions thank you very much and councillors do we have any questions councillor volckering please for miss macy uh thank you very much uh miss macy um i guess my uh sensitivity about this applications to the demographic of mansfield being towards older members of our community the older group that are perhaps retired and a lot of them living very close to the centre of town and we 've heard from a couple of those um noise is particularly an issue for those older residents they 've got to get good sleep and i note that the plan is for a 24 7 operation and you may well know that probably between the hours of about 11 00 pm through till about 5am mansfield can be pretty quiet and some might describe it as being dead but um what what 's the rationale behind a 24 7 application for this particular development thank you thanks ken thanks council volckering for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide the ability that if the demand was there that the operator could operate for 24 7 the certainly the operators won 't be continuing operations uh into the night time hours if the demand for the for the use of the state petrol station isn 't there but the application has been made in case the demand does arise that the proponent won 't have to keep coming back to council to seek an extension of those hours but certainly the the operation won 't be looking to operate it 's not going to lose money by running it during the night for the sake of one customer that may or may not turn up but it 's really to give that flexibility in the future thank you very much councillors are there any other questions councillor olva hi jane um thanks for that just um you say it 's not a fast the proposal is not for a fast food and it 's just might have a pie warm or something like that it 's a bit confusing that on the plans there 's obviously a deep fryer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like pies and so on what 's the deep fryer there for um i 'm assuming that that might be used if they heat up some um potato cakes or some jam doughnuts just in the deep fryer for those it 's just heating up food that 's already cooked and probably snap frozen off-site yeah thanks for that thank you councillor vulcan um again uh through you madame to uh miss macy uh if i can call you jane uh yes again the treatment of the western boundary and you 've gone to some length to explain that the applicant is willing to work with the local residents to try and develop uh some sort of landscape buffering there that might be suitable to the residents but a lot of the residents that have put submissions in or objections in elderly and they 're um not necessarily able to be able to afford uh any change to their properties um who 's who 's going to be responsible for works that might encroach on neighbors neighbouring properties i 'll speak specifically about landscaping uh so all the the landscaping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you mean i 'm just not quite too sure i understand that but the existing some of the existing landscaping bamboo in particular that i 've noticed is in abundance there it may be that the applicant chooses to get rid of that stuff um i think the residents that i 've spoken to have been concerned that it 'll take significant time for new landscape uh to establish itself and get to a height where it can provide a similar buffer put it that way yes yep i concerned that the cost to them to rebuild or pick particularly fence lines and so forth yes so fencing and landscaping will be the costs of those will be born by the proponent um but we are quite happy to sit down with the neighbours and work through the staging of the development and if if it can be accommodated but that some of that mature planting can be retained while construction is going on we can work in with um with the the neighbours particularly given that there is quite a wide easement um through there on which no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy to to work through with the neighbor via council processes to see if some of that vegetation could be retained on the boundary during construction thank you councillors any other questions of miss macy please now if there are any questions for our manager of planning environment mr mackay please counselors counselor offline we 've still got miss macy on the screen yep is that fine thank you yeah thanks thanks um and i hope thanks um miss mayor um madame i 've got a question for ben hi ben um so ben even when i asked the question to um miss macy about cooking facilities it 's very vague in the application it 's very vague in the plans as to the extent of the cooking facilities on site and as far as i can see we 've got no condition there that restricts what they could provide in terms of cooking um if this was this proposal was passed went through today what would there be any barrier stopping one of the major fast food providers from buying it and operating that and providing fast food mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fundamental point to this proposal is the um the convenience store of the convenience shop as opposed to a convenience restaurant being proposed um so the convenient shop um is restricted in size uh and defined as being able to sell food drinks and other convenience goods uh as a as opposed to a convenience restaurant um which talks about being able to sell food and drink for immediate consumption and he 's more in line with those ultra processed food organizations that that fall into that sort of category so i i think uh the the approval of the application as a convenient shop as opposed to a convenient or a store as opposed to a convenience restaurant um would give an element of um security to council thank you councillors any other questions sorry thanks ben follow-up question um on the conditions which there 's 54 of um when i see that many conditions that that really worries me um so with that sort of number of conditions um first of all um if if this goes ahead and the conditions are not met how is it monitored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process if the conditions are not met yep through you madam man so the the council 's planning enforcement officer is responsible for uh ensuring that development follows conditions on planning approvals so that would fall into the remit of the planning enforcement officer to follow up uh ensure compliance thank you councillors any other questions of the manager councillor sladden uh thank you madam mayor mr mackay i 'm just uh interested to get your clarification on the site context um as the report uh clearly indicates uh the zoning is commercial one zone in the planning scheme however the mansfield structure plan uh has it classified as general residential now i am aware that a petrol station is permitted within general residential with conditions but i 'm just still not certain how we have this anomaly between the structure plan and our planning scheme could you enlighten me please thank you mr macarthur uh through you madam mayor so it certainly is an anomaly where you wouldn 't i haven 't seen it too often where the framework plan identifies a different zone for the site than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that occurred i i could couldn 't hazard a guess i wouldn 't be able to help in that regard i wasn 't here at the time and i don 't understand how the framework plan um could have i guess uh proposed a different zoning to other than what is is currently zoned only to say that um it it certainly is a mix up and it 's something that needs to be looked at and rectified um and that falling back on the hierarchy that the zoning within the planning scheme takes precedence over any other i guess planning mechanisms that are in place so it is an anomaly but we can only fall back on to the zoning within the planning scheme so just to clarify the planning scheme takes precedence over the um the township framework correct through your matter correct thank you councillors any councillor over um thanks madam mayor another question sorry um ben about about the conditions um condition 24 about the amenity of the area says the use and development must be managed so the immunity of the area is not detrimentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or commodities to or from the land so at the moment we 've got an empty block of land basically some at the back may be different so we ca it can 't be detroit amenity can 't be detrimentally affected through the transport of materials goods or commodities to are from the land or b the appearance of any building works or materials or c the emission of noise artificial light vibration smell fumes smoke vapor steam soot ash dust waste water waste products and so on we 've got we 've got a facility with a deep fryer so we 're going to have smells coming out the stack from the deep fryer the exhaust fan we 've got um vehicles coming on on and off the side or trucks we 've got um we could have loud motorbikes we could you know some of these motorbikes would straight out exhaust come in park and rev up we 've got cars artificial light well if this goes through the thing 's going to be very well lit at the moment it 's not lit at all that site @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the air is not a bit detrimentally affected first of all the compliance officer how they 're going to go about that what base data are they going to start with now how are they going to measure whether the area is detrimentally affected in terms of noise artificial light vibration smell smoke how they 're going to go about that makai through you madam man uh so i guess that that is a tricky one and and something that we as a development services unit grapple with i think um on a on a weekly basis the important thing i think in this case is to i guess first the baseline um as was proposed is the fact that a service station will be operating potentially from the site so that would be the baseline and that any i guess detriment to the amenity above what would be expected from a usual operation of a service station is the measure that you would take um so if the neighboring properties were detrimentally affected and persistently affected then that 's when the investigations would occur and the baseline would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues for want of a better word that might happen on a site as opposed that has a a service station as opposed to a vacant piece of land thank you thank you mr councillors any other questions of the manager if i could ask then do we have a motion please counselor sladden could you let us know what your motion is please certainly uh madam mayor i don 't have to read all the pages well you won 't get me reading all the pages either uh the recommendation as written on pages 19 well that 's of the agenda yeah um i just got to scroll through how many pages it is 19 to [Music] 15 to 22 i have uh yeah well yeah sorry i 'm reading the um the whole agenda i 've got 26 of 134 but um because of the confidential items so uh what did you say 15 to 22 22. oh you 'd rather me if i can it might be better just to say as as on the um in the agenda that because because if you put the page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah thank you as per the agenda thank you thank you do i have a secondary motion counselor volkering do i have anyone opposed to the councillor oliver you 're opposed to it councillor wessendorf opposed madam mayor not opposed but i 'd like to move an amendment to the uh recommendations as proposed by councillor sladden through you madam mayor if cancer sladden needs to speak to his motion first please laden will you speak to the motion please i will madam mayor thank you uh while i acknowledge the anon nominally the anomaly um of the planning scheme and the mansfield township framework uh i do accept that this is an investment that is a significant investment into the town and the shire um i believe the issue of 24 7 will be determined uh by demand and i 'm probably not as confident or as optimistic as maybe what the proponents are to get 24 7 use however given the permit conditions that are put in place i believe that they are sufficient to protect the amenity of the residential areas thank you madam mayor thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh thank you madam mayor yes uh look i concur with councillor sutton 's comments and uh i 'm i 'm i 'm comfortable if you like with the integrity of the submission uh i i 'm also of the view that some of the issues raised by the objectors are going to be sensitively dealt with by the applicant and those working for the applicant so um i think i 've said enough thank you anyone against the motion councillor westendorf do you want to present an alternative motion uh thank you madam mayor no not an alternative motion i 'd like to add one more condition to the um recommendation with the uh and and i i i guess probably just to add it as a complete condition rather than trying to change some of the wording under um the existing conditions it 's to do with acoustic fencing and and my amendment would be along the following lines prior to the commencement of any works a plan demonstrating the design of the acoustic fence must be submitted to and approved by the responsible authority the plan must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the western boundary and b provide the acoustic treatment to the fencing for the outdoor eating area thank you madame there is an anomaly there is an ambiguity in the current conditions that it talks about the acoustic fence applying to the boundary fence but not to that around the dining area do i have an acceptance council sladden that that become the motion so madame mayor you have an amendment on the table it needs a seconder i have a second for the amendment please councillor sladden thank you uh thank you better mayor yes i 'm prepared to accept that amendment thank you and second that amendment sorry thank you is there anyone against the amendment which is now the motion so the amendment amendment is carried madam mayor and yep thank you thank you thank you very much everybody and thank you for our presenters tonight no matter mayor i 'm sorry the amendment 's carried but you have a substantive motion still on the table to vote to so we now have a motion to be voted on so those in favor so so sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a new motion there which is you have the substantive motion so you do need to keep um call for any speakers counsellor westendorf would you like to speak to the motion uh madam mayor now i 'll pass on that i believe that councillor oliver might have opposed the motion and uh i 'll defer to him to speak i 've called for a opposition to speak cancer oliver oliver would you want to speak i 've said i 've asked some questions before thanks madam mayor um my opposition to the development has to do with the position if it was in another area in town appropriate area in town i would think it 'd be fantastic for the town but i 'm really concerned about our residents in town i 'm concerned about the amenity of our residents in town people move to mansfield or live in mansfield because of our natural environment because of our quietness for all those reasons and that gets eroded away um i think is a real shame so i vote against it in that particular position thank you we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those against carried thank you very much everyone we move on to item 13.2.2 the use and development of land as an education center training facility accommodation camping and recreation facility three lot subdivision at 128 of olga views road mansfield council of offering will leave the meeting thank you we have some presenters so we will wait for those to come firstly it is mr skinner who is an objector to the application hello ken thank you for your patience thank you very much thank you mr skinner it 's councillor mark atlee here if you would like to speak you have three minutes to speak thank you um firstly our objection is not about having mass community as neighbours the benefits to the student and community admin media area are obvious but the application is difficult to understand from the lack of detail and the complete the disregard for our enterprise and our property rights as neighbours firstly the the which planning application is still being considered there are initially two for that 's two very the two lots or three lots the council website this afternoon still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought had been withdrawn well well i understand we 're uh considering a three lot subdivision right there the version of the plan which version of the plan of the proposed developments being considered as i 've had three versions of the plan so far and none of them show any of the all the buildings or their size or positions what 's being uh approved how does any of this satisfy the requirement that the development proposal be advertised to all interested parties prior to consideration by council this is not just a holiday camp uses include but not restricted to the medical consultations educational facilities training residential camping and recreation and associated development whatever that includes buildings include but not restricted to an education center for pre and primary age school administration block a range runs on-site facilities for user groups a student is a residential block short-term accommodation for teachers and families family camp residences and facilities that may also be hired out by groups animal therapy facilities sensory gardens recreation facilities by their own assessment up to 190 staff medical cons consultants family and perhaps some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or 40 overnight in the main area and up to 60 in the so-called camping area this is a major development especially in a residential area with no sewage connection the officer 's recommendation includes an extension of the permit from the usual four years to ten years and that all future planning and building applications be considered and approved by the council planning office with no further consideration by mansfield councillors or the community as there is no master plan available what is being approved this app point is highlighted by the application preceding this one on the agenda as you note the conditions on that application do not require further plans as these documents are available as part of their application the same cannot be said for this application it appears the mass has been rushed for approval before the council and community have any idea what the development involves how can it be approved when they it supplies no details of what should be constructed or where it 's to be constructed the contrary the officers report the land capability is marginal without soil remember remediation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an area which has not been formally assessed aman access road runs along the boundary and craig and his letters address the liability issues this raises and we should not have to build the new fence just to continue our existing business operations the british bushfire assessment rates the fire danger category at the third-door highest level out of the four it does not address the danger of a fire starting on the development and not being contained there 's some rough country between the development and the south blue range which is inaccessible and most areas most fire danger conditions are associated with a northerly wind not a southerly the camp and accommodation conference accommodation is on land zone farming well i 'm getting on a bit i can 't do the mantle gymnastics to require to be able to claim a provision in the farm 's owning laws which allows a hobby farmer to stay overnight in a caravan on 40 hectares to justify a 60-bed accommodation complex on a 10-hectare site which is too small for the sig for development under the current zoning laws this along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up after this application is approved by council and then all future approvals be grant granted by council officers alone with no council or public notification let alone input or control adjust a blatant grab for a bit of ability to do whatever they want for the next 10 years due to the amount of in information being required this denies the community and objectives our third party rights with a final product before formally approved yeah i need you to finish as soon as you can please do your three minutes that 's about it just to say that i think the application should be rejected until all this information has provided the council and the community so that the project can be properly assessed thank you thank you for your tolerance mr spinner councillors have you anyone got a question of mr spinner please thank you councillors we now have the applicants simone reeves and judy dixon will be coming in so we 'll have both the applicants in at the one time there 's simone thank you hi thank you and judy hi councillor mayor atlee thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so thank you very much thank you lee councillors submitters and staff thank you for the opportunity to speak to you tonight on behalf of my board regarding mansfield autism statewide services or as we refer to at mass and about our dream of building a new and expanded home in the context of a therapeutic care farm i feel quite emotional at this significant stage in our progress that started as a determination to expand to better meet the demand for our services and do it in a world-class way we know from 50-plus years of experience that nature exercise healthy eating family and early intervention are critical to improving the lives of young people with autism and these principles led us to purchasing the hundred acres just out of mansfield and here we are tonight with our application for planning approval to build what will be a national center for excellence in the way we work with families with autism not only will we be able to provide bespoke educational classrooms complemented by a farm residence for placements and respite we will also be able to provide a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to train teachers and allied health professionals and how to best work with people with autism the incidence of autism is rising and our wraparound model of service provision works and we want to be able to share our knowledge we 've named our project operation game changer because it will not only transform the lives of our students and clients and their families but also because it will help transform mansfield shy 's economy it will build its resilience and its diversity we already employ 20 people and will more than double that figure providing stable year-round employment and jobs from everything from cooking gardening cleaning administration allied health teaching and residential care the media we have generated over the past number of months has been extraordinary and has cast a lens on the attributes mansell brings for education and lifestyle mansfordshire already has a significant education and outdoor education industry and reputation we have the perfect backyard and we expect the investment in our expansion will attract and inspire others it 's a very exciting time for us here at mass the farm has already been of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it 's been wonderful to see the children benefit from it daily we 've made great progress with council support in advocating for our project for funding and we certainly have a huge and diverse community of support i would thank council for recognising the alignment of operation game changer with mansfield child 's community and economic development objectives and for identifying as a project of significance in the economic development strategy and council plan we 're also very appreciative of the council 's in-kind support and waiving the planning fees associated with our application we thank the council officers for the tremendous amount of support of work that has gone into the planning report and we certainly agree with the recommendation of grant to grant notice of decision to grant a planning permit thank you all very much thank you councillors any questions of mrs raves please i don 't think so thank you so much thank you all beauty dixon thank you could you speak to

regarding various funding applications and our fingers eyes toes everything is absolutely crossed thank you to the officers for their work in the detail planning report we understand the work that 's gone into that and we commend their recommendation to you thank you thank you councillors any questions and mistakes and please all right thank you councillors are there any questions of mr mckay our manager do i have a motion counselor sladden i i madame i do have one question yeah so do i mine 's uh mine 's a question that that i wasn 't moving the motion thank you um mr mackay i 'm confused with the um response given by uh global murray water particularly with their noting of the requirement for an epa works permit or works approval can i ask what conversations have been undertaken um with epa regarding the wastewater treatment mr makai um so there 's been uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh council 's health department and golden murray water with the epa and the requirements um for effluent disposal um i guess just probably see clarification around what particular matters um you are relating to that require further conversation well can i be more direct have you had um direct conversations with the epa was this referred to the epa for comment uh my understanding is that the council officer at the time sent this through to the epa for assessment yes okay so normally they would be a referral authority uh yes okay uh but i don 't see any response i see a response from the cfa and from gmw i don 't see a response from the epa um yes i guess that 's noted uh my understanding is that the epa requirements were only for a certain um i guess uh level through the land capability assessment i would have to go back through the the records to see what they were referred to whether they were referred to as a section 52 authority or whether they were referred through uh through to comment i couldn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so my my concern is specifically uh on page 29 of the agenda under the goal of murray water and it 's the second dot point there that says that given that a minimum daily flow of up to 10 800 leaders could be produced by the conference center alone on what three it seems likely that an epa works approval is required an epa works approval is triggered when wastewater production exceeds 5 000 liters per day in accordance with the epa code of practice on-site wastewater management given that um you know that minimum daily flow on one lot only um just to my my biggest belief why this has not gone to the epa unless the lca the land capability assessment was approved by the epa would that be the case through you madame i couldn 't give you certainty in regard to the epa signing off on the lca at this stage um my understanding is that they have seen it but like i said i i can 't provide that certainty at this stage to say that they have definitely seen it they have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um an epa works approval will be sought and would there be any um option for neighboring neighbouring uh properties to be consulted on as part of that process uh i 'm not sure of the epa uh works approval process in regard to the extent of their consultation for that i would assume it was a site-specific requirement um that doesn 't require um i guess broader engagement with neighbouring properties thank you mr mackay thank you councillor western door yeah my my question to mr mckay is we what we 're being asked to do at this point is to approve a three lot subdivision and i 'm wondering what the need is to have the subdivision in the first place when it 's all at this point at least all part of the same operation and does this open the gate for mass at some point to sell off under-sized blocks in a farming area for instance i 'd be interested in the rationale for why they need to subdivide the land into three pieces when they 're operating the whole lot through you madam mayor uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to why they want the three lot subdivision there is a there is a clause in the scheme however 6403 that provides that council is capable of approving subdivisions for lots that are generally of a lower size than what 's normally required if those two lots are in different zoning so we have a zoning anomaly on this site where the site is both rural living and farming zone so there is a clause within the scheme that allows for those sites uh subdivision to be um approved for those lower lot sizes in those uh certain instances thank you i i i still feel very uncomfortable about this um i i it kind of defeats me thank you thank you chancellor oliver um thanks um mrs mackay so rural living which is part of the the area that allows subdivision down to what size through you mad at me i couldn 't tell you if it 's on my head thanks it would allow for the subdivision of that site that 's what i was that 's what i was thinking that there 's more potential there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any further questions oh i 'm already unmuted sorry um madame i am prepared to move the recommendation as detailed on pages thank you in the agenda sorry we won 't mention pages as the last one um i am happy with the permanent condition um particularly uh condition number nine while i do have some reservations about the wastewater disposal condition nine does insist that an epa works approval or a permit to install um is required so therefore i 'm prepared to uh move this recommendation thank you madame councillors do i have a second of the promotion counselor oliver would you like to speak to the motion councilors london uh look this is um a very significant uh development uh for the shire um as the proponents have uh labeled it it is a game changer for the mansfield shire community uh we are well familiar with the excellent reputation and the work that uh mansford autism statewide services has completed over the past 50 years and a therapeutic care farm i believe would be a welcome addition to the shire therefore i do fully support this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you council oliver would you like to speak as a second of the motion just briefly and and i 'll echo the comments from council sladden um the work that they do is absolutely amazing and the potential for this development is enormous thank you do i have anyone against the motion i 'll put the motion to councillors to vote but i have a show of hands please if you 're in favor of the motion the motion is carried thank you and thank you to the presenters this evening we 'll move to item number thirteen points i 'll just get um council volcan back in oh thank you we 'll be moving to item thirteen point two point you want to go i think sure thank you councillor vulcan we 're moving on to item 13.2 13.2.3 amendment to heightened manner development plan councillors are there any questions of mr mckay or do i have a motion counsel i 'm happy to move the recommendation recommendation becomes the motion do i have someone second the motion chancellor sladden would you like to speak to the motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you councillor sladden uh my comment my only comment madam mayor is that uh this is uh an issue or an application that has been uh on the agenda for quite some time and i am pleased that uh to see it finally come to some resolution so i do thank both the proponent and the council um council staff for their work on this because as i say it 's uh it 's been hanging around for a long time thank you thank you councillor sladen anyone against the motion i 'll put the motion those in favor that 's carried thank you we 'll move on to 13.2.4 the draft commercial and industrial land use strategy councillors do i have any questions of our manager of planning and environment mr mackay please councillor sladden uh thank you thank you madam mayor um again i see clarification um with the wording of the recommendation uh in terms of council endorses the draft commercial an industrial land use strategy for public exhibition and feedback um i just want to clarify mr makai that cancel is not adopting this strategy it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public comment is that correct mr mackay uh through you madam mayor that is correct counselor this is a draft strategy purely out for community consultation and feedback thank you councillors do you have any other questions i will call for a motion does someone have a motion please counsellor westendorf councillor sladen councillor wissendorf would you like to speak to it no i we 've had the benefit of seeing some of this beforehand and i think that this is appropriate now and i do note the dates that this is going to happen after the caretaker period thank you councillor fleming would you like to add anything further uh yes i would madame mayor um again um i 'm particularly uh pleased to see uh that the strategy does support the future rezoning of the bonnie dune hotel into a commercial land use zone uh to support long-term development that can only benefit uh the bonnie dune community and certainly fits in with the lake field and master plan but also um again it corrects an anomaly where currently it is zoned in a farmland so anywhere we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly in favor of thank you thank you councillor sladden anyone against the motion if not i 'll put the motion those in favor carrie thank you we move on to 13.2.5 the

like to speak to the motion uh thank you thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all know uh was developed uh with community uh local government that is council uh state government uh in terms of the department of education um it was a fantastic partnership uh 20 years ago um obviously over the the time um of the uh of the operation of the performing arts center it appears that it has been clouded um in terms of the governance of the of the facility uh and this does need to be cleared up and hopefully the um the review of that will will enable that to happen and given that the use um of the facility by the secondary college is likely to diminish quite considerably with the construction of the new dual court uh multi-purpose stadium it 's important that this valuable performing arts facility does get attention and does get the use by the community and hopefully from visiting artists thank you madam mayor thank you councillor volkering would you like to speak to the motion uh thank you madam mayor really just to echo uh council suddenly 's comments once again but i think this uh recommendation has put does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of issues that that we know are not leading to maximum use of this

through the annual budgeting process um individual business cases for all the different projects we 'll go through that process and council will get to make those allocations through the budgeting process thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i call for a motion please and the counsellor read the motion counselor volkering thank you madam mayor the recommendation is that uh council endorse the digital

time however many years it takes that we are that it is resourced and it does come to fruition so i think it 's an exciting opportunity for our shire and our community hopefully we 'll streamline a lot of our operations and we 've seen how they can sometimes go awry you council vulcan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion thanks madam mayor yes i 'm really excited by this strategy the possibilities are

council and its governance and uh was a very good uh session and as it says there um that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the better functioning councils in fact i think you 've been kind on yourself because he actually said that it was the best functioning council meeting that he viewed which was the july meeting that he 'd seen in the state and commented on other councils and how uh how sometimes their meetings were how meetings were deteriorating in general so i 'd just like to uh acknowledge uh your role mr mayor in that for um leading such uh setting such fine example in fact he even went on to say that uh he would like to use mansfield council meetings an example to other councils in the state so i 'd just like to acknowledge your role as mayor in that thank you council term i think you 've been overly kind uh thank you um having said all that uh we 're gonna move we 've got a seconder all those in favor of the motion thank you uh item 11 reports from council appointed representatives um going just down the list of various committee members uh committees and committee members the golden murray climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last month just after our previous council meeting it was our agm um the transition process is currently underway from transitioning from shepparton to murundindi as an auspice which just about wrapped up so while this process has been taken proactive work has sort of paused but this is about to recommence as of the end of this month which is good during the meeting we did have several presentations around our current strategic theme which is environmentally sustainable design which has been sort of spoken about in a few different forms around council i think it 's probably something that most counselors here would be in favor of simon francis who 's the esd officer at the city of bendigo presented presented the casby which is the council alliance of sustainable built environment and there 's currently 29 member councils for this particular working group and their key one of the key projects is what are they calling elevating esd targets so they 're basically submitting a group planning scheme amendment for the 29 councils basically the the aim behind it is to put together an evidence base for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zero net emissions uh manage water and waste better and increase the greening and biodiversity of new developments and also buildings that provide a healthier more comfortable environment for the community improve improve health outcomes they 're going through a technical feasibility analysis cost benefit and then it will move to a stage two the whole idea behind the alliance is that it 's a shared cost model so that obviously they can share resources in terms of putting together the planning scheme amendment share information and obviously share costs around doing things like that mansell char is currently not part of casby i would be interested to see if the officers know all about it and if they do if they can provide any comment on cosby as a whole or if we can get some research and potentially a report given to council around the casper alliance um further to that no that 's about it that 's all i 've got my notes thank you thanks council webb uh with respect to the next item the next um committee there 's the hume regional local government network @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points that came out of that especially the secretariat of that committee was being handled by mansfield shire that 's now moved to mitchell shire for the next two years um and i 'd just like to thank lisa frick and our ceo caitlyn conrad for the work that was done on that because there 's a lot of work been has to be done on the secretariat to organise a fairly large group like that the format is changing going forward so that the mayors and ceos as a forum will meet once per year from now on and the ceo and that will be more at the larger dealing with the larger strategic items and the ceos will meet quarterly uh one of the other points that came out of it was that mark davis who from fb solutions who i think we 've come across before with some work on the long-term financial plan he 's working with three councils in the human region area on a simplified software template for long-term financial plans so i 'll be interested to see how that works out and whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one uh lake hilton land and on water management plan committee uh council said uh thank you mr mayor uh there has been no meeting uh having trouble getting a um a suitable meeting date however in relation to manchester council uh work has been going on in the background and this will be addressed in item 13.2.3 on tonight 's agenda thank you thank you um the mitzvah council order risk committee council web thanks mr mayor um so the performance statements and financial reports and government governance checklists that are slated for tonight 's meeting uh we reviewed these uh in order to put them forward to tonight 's meeting there was a lot of discussion around the risk register and next meeting in november there 's going to be a i think we 're going to spend a bit of time looking at it in detail there 's also an action slated to occur around cyber security risk which i think is quite timely considering there 's been a bit of news in the media recently about other local governments succeeding to some attack so i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the external audit report as well it was circulated for review that 's a lot thank you thank you um the show business and community recovery advisory committee i don 't think it 's met council 's lab uh no cancel the whole uh mr mayor um as reported at the last meeting this uh committee has now been dissolved um the only uh uh action item that uh is awaiting uh implementation is the feedback and the um the review of how that committee operated and i don 't know where that 's at [Music] maybe mr in likeness but um there 's no further meetings of this group mr so mr may yes there 's a draft memo that is being um i 've just reviewed that goes through the the feedback from the committee and uh the uh contribution they 've made so uh that that should be released in the next couple of days thanks mr thank you council said uh there 's no there was no meeting of the mav uh the northeast local government waste forum council writing yeah thanks mr mayor the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at our previous uh council meeting the next uh meeting will be uh in three months time thanks katsurami and there is no rural council 's victoria meeting um councillors do we have a uh a motion regarding 0.11 at council webb thanks mr man uh motion being that council note the verbal reports provided by councillors in relation to their representation on external committees uh second to please council satan thank you those in favor emotion has passed thank you uh public question time we 've had a number of questions um we 've had five questions from mr warren shepherd and one question from ms nola evans um both community members have asked about the bonnie doing rec reserve mr shepard asked five questions our government 's rules allows uh two two questions per person uh some of them are similar and mrs ms evans question also covers the bonnie dude wreck reserve as well so i 'll pick out the three which cover the more varied area if you like of of various areas that they 're looking to get answers to mr shepard asked if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reserve will the facility receive a larger proportion of shire funds than are currently awarded response from council is that council has given due consideration to the funds required to manage the facility and anticipate that additional funds will need to be allocated to this particular facility to support the ongoing management of the site another question asked by mr shepard was if the mansfield show out to be the managers of the bonney dune rec reserve what is to happen to the funds held by bonnie dune reserve committee inc council 's response is that council will work with the existing committee and the department of environment land water and planning to ensure a smooth transition of the management of the site to council and the funds associated with the reserve are part of this uh mr evans asked also to do with the body of generic reserve as i mentioned is there any process in place to ask and inform the broader community of the planned transfer of management from local committee to mansfield shire and the response from council is that council is requesting transfer of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water and planning and intends to seek assistance from the bonded dune dune community in the ongoing management of the rec reserve and would welcome input from all areas of the community so thank you uh to both of you for those questions and i 'm sorry mr sheppard that we are only allowed to answer two of the five that you asked but hopefully that covers the basis that you 're after uh item 13.1 is the chief executive officers report um are there any questions or comments to the ceo counselors uh castle webb thanks mr man um i do have a few questions um to the just the capital works report um the view street roundabouts listed as completed in february but i know there 's a fair bit of work going on may not be exactly on the roundabout but in that area is that related to the roundabout or is that a completely different piece of work i 've just had a few questions asked of me by the community through you mr mayo pass over to the general manager of infrastructure and planning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miss mayor um in terms of the uh works to do the bus bay you know the outside the threat of steiner school um i guess you could say that sort of loosely associated with the roundabout but we were reflecting that the roundabout itself was finished in february and these are ongoing works just to finish off that total project there okay great um as well as the dual court stadium i know we had a pc date at mid-september did that end up happening do you know yes it did there was an expect inspection i think it was the 15th of september but i might have that date wrong not all good um and do you know how this two week construction industry shutdown will obviously it 's going to push everything back by a couple of weeks at least uh yeah through you mr mayor hopefully uh it is only actually affecting the local government areas that are locked down but it potentially will have an impact in terms of the requirement to vaccinate construction workers and just depending on the level of vaccination of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main one would be the re-sheeting program um that we have ongoing at the moment so given it 's relatively small numbers we 'll obviously be reaching out to our contractors just to assess any potential impacts yeah i 'm going to keep you posted beautiful thank you very much uh counselors any other questions at castle10 uh thanks mr mayor through you to the ceo just a couple of questions regarding um in her report on page 20 about the startup shake-up digital literacy program there was i take it thirty thousand dollars from bushfire recovery fund and that project manager has been appointed i was just wondering who that project manager is and at what stage that project 's at and just a brief outline of what it does also on that same page the 50 000 of uh funding to tna from our shire i take it in terms of business development to assist 19 businesses just the process behind that and where that 's at through you mr mayor i 'll refer to our general manager of community and corporate services to answer that question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being delivered by sut up shakeup and the project manager is a startup shakeup contractor um the reason that uh arrangement is in place is not only our startup shakeup a delivery partner of ours but they 've also delivered this same program at a regional level so there was a procurement exemption so that they could be used to deliver this project for for our in our shire region as well does that answer the question counselor uh yeah who is the contractor sorry the the the person that 's the person who individualized i 'm not sure who that that person is but certainly a contractor that works for startup shake-up oh okay it would be good to perhaps find out who that was down the track and um uh also yeah the tna question around tna and that 50 000 of funding and i take that that 's from bushfire funding too coming out of mansfield council uh through you mr mayor that is indeed correct it 's fifty thousand dollars of bushfire funding um the the program initially was available to 25 25 businesses uh we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local businesses that are listed on the next page uh unfortunately only 19 of those took up that offer and you can see that they go through the workshops and deliver that that training that business development training for them okay yeah thank you thank you and if we could uh just probably get updated on those programs as they go along that would be great thank you certainly thanks mr jacob thank you councillor turn any other questions counselors counselors do we have a motion uh council web thanks mr mayor uh the motion being that council receive a note the chief executive officers report for the period 17th of august 2021 to 8th of september 2021 thank you a seconder council turn those in favor of the motion the motion is passed thank you item 13.2.1 demands for

planning services is well underway progressing well and uh looking at the chart on page 20 of the agenda the um activity uh the planning reports determined is coming down the graph 's going in the right direction it 's looking good and the average days is also heading in the right direction so well done to the people involved there thanks for tuning in yeah any other councils like to speak at all to it those in favor of the motion the motion 's passed thank you um the lake hilton uh gmw maintenance license agreement agreement uh item 13.2.3 the manager of operations capital work is christian burchard uh welcome christian um councils do we have any questions councilwebb thanks mr mayor um a couple of questions just about the agreement uh in the miu there 's a lot of sort of good faith and i 'm really happy that this is sort of the arrangement we can come to um is there anything in place just to ensure that everyone 's holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a standard level sort of thing through you mr mayor um i can answer that question um yeah you 're right councillor webber is a good faith agreement um but i think the first page really set out the terms of the agreement as such um i don 't believe there are any provisions where we can take any action against another party or vice versa if one doesn 't hold their end of the agreement it would follow the normal um conflict resolution process in that case um so no that 's not something that we dealt with in great detail in that agreement no worries and if there 's new infrastructure added in the intervening time whose responsibility is it to update i guess the the register which both parties are working off is that council 's responsibility if the uh added resource is within our area um that 's our list area uh then we would update the plan accordingly because we would have the particulars on what that asset contains um if the asset was outside of that area then it would be upon gmw okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in place um i guess what 's the overarching strategy or what 's the what 's the plan going forward in order to draw on this better boating fund which the state government 's put out so that we can start benny benefiting from it as soon as possible yeah the first step in in that we took the first step i guess last week kirsten and i met with better boating victoria we met with um a couple of representatives from golden murray water and we discussed an application that had come in for a boat ramp at halcon and assessed that on its merits and there seemed to be a lot of positive reinforcement behind that idea and the next step is to come up with a more detailed plan on how that ramp would work and then make a submission to better voting voting victoria so that 'll be the first really positive outcome from this agreement excellent thank you very much are castles any other questions uh do we have a motion council sladden uh thank you mr mayor uh the motion is the council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water which is attached and authorizes the ceo to execute the agreement thank you a second just web sudan you wish to speak to the nation uh thank you mr mayor firstly i would like to acknowledge the work of uh previous and current staff uh in getting this agreement uh finalized is certainly something that is well overdue and i would also like to acknowledge the work the goal of murray water has done in facilitating this agreement and it can only benefit both parties and the mansfield shire and wider recreational boating and fishing people across the state so very pleased to see it finally get done thank you mr mayor thanks again sudden uh council whit yes thanks mr mayor um yes echoing council sladdens points there um also this i think this is going to be a very important step as part of the broader lake yield the master plan as well getting this agreement in place just everyone knows where they stand and it just reduces the barrier to entry on a lot of these projects so although it seems like a minor agreement in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone so it 's great to get this locked away thank you uh councillors any other councils wish to speak uh castle slam do you wish to say anything more no thank you okay those in favor of the motion relations past thank you item thirteen point two point four the bonnie doom uh recreation reserve i 'm responsible thank you christian firstly uh the responsible officer 30.2.4 is melissa crane manager of planning and environment councils are there any questions or comments on the report council webb thanks mr mayor um just like a bit of background over how much of the community was consulted during the process uh and if there was any expressions of interest or anything sought from the community to take over the management of the site before council intervene are you mr mayor i 'm happy to take that one um the in because it was this was initiated by the committee of management actually approaching council and uh they did have their agm approaching there was limited time for us to do any board engagement but as you would have heard earlier in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we will absolutely be giving the opportunity for people to give us some feedback and potentially join a community reference group to be involved and we very much welcome you know continuing community involvement in terms of the management of that reserve and giving feedback to council on that great um and in the event a local community group would want to take it back over from council if they can show that they 're uh organized enough to do so will that be an issue or will it be a process to do that what 's what 's the process around that through you mr mayor i think it would be a very similar process um to what we 've taken in this instance where it would require a report to counsel for council to make a decision over that and um yeah and decide on the merits of what 's put in front of them okay thank you any other questions council said yes thank you mr mayor um i don 't know who to direct this to um but in the report in the executive summary it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reserve as a long-term capital works financial commitment and i 'm just wondering does that include the construction of a new netball court at the reserve thank you mr mayor pass over to the general manager infrastructure and planning to answer that question thank you three miss amir i i would anticipate the cost of the nipple court would be on top of that um 290 and the reason i say that is that um there was not we had flagged the opportunity to potentially get some grant funding for the netball court so i would envisage that would be additional to the 290. i guess just bearing in mind that 290 is an estimate and we 'll obviously firm up on those on those estimated costs as we consider each um each annual plan and put it before council as part of the budget process i do uh through you mr mayor i do believe that it 's important that councillors are aware of this because uh that netball court does need replacing it has already had um some black marks against it uh by the uh the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a project that uh is uh imminent that needs to be required uh needs rectifying so we just need to be aware of the costs associated with that and yes hopefully sport rick vick can assist us with some uh some funding on that um the second question follow-up question um again i suppose i 'll give it to ms alexander um and that is in terms of setting a precedent um what happens in terms of we have committees of management on delwood land located at tommy jamison merton other places around the uh the shire um in terms of an equity point of view if council was to put rate payer money into managing uh this facility um yeah so sorry it 's a double-edged question precedent in terms of those other communities and equity in terms of those other communities has that been considered bringing us mayor i 'm not sure i can actually answer that one i think that 's probably something that council will have to weigh up as a policy type type decision in making this decision um in terms of i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merits and i guess in this instance we have a committee that 's approached us and um and has flagged quite clearly that they 're not able to continue that they 've had trouble attracting members um so that is the circumstance for this one as i understand it we haven 't been approached by any of those other committees and i guess council would just have to consider each any any future approach on its merits um and certainly from an equity point of view you know just be considering uh any applications that are made you know from on an objective basis uh madam ceo do you have any comments on that thank you through you mr mayor there 's no doubt about it that council invests more in in its own infrastructure the areas that it controls and that 's always been the case so in taking over the bonnie during recreation reserve i can imagine that council you know in terms of what 's being flagged about the maintenance requirement that would be built into council 's budget council doesn 't tend to invest in infrastructure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an equity issue and that has always been the case and i think that has also that was part of what commenced the conversation with the bonnegen recreation reserve and prompted some of the um the well prompted the the request to council but um i would would also say councillors um you know there is a recommendation before you but obviously there are you know other considerations that you might be well aware of that we are not as officers um to consider the item thank you thanks so much actually the recent president said it already isn 't there with respect to the um the footy ground in town right so through you mr mayor council 's always had control over that football ground so it traditionally has it hasn 't had control over the bonnie june recreation reserve to date so when committees of management were set up they were set up originally in different ways and often communities really appreciate being in the committee of management and having control over their own infrastructure jameson 's a good example and and does very well with its responsibilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phases where it 's difficult to get support and um and committee members sometimes it just feels overwhelming in terms of the size of the facility and bonnie dune reserve is a significant facility if you look at other facilities across the shire thanks adam sir any other questions councils uh councillors do we have a motion councillor slade uh thank you mr mayor um i have an alternative motion to the recommendation that is in the agenda and i will read it as follows uh one the council formally request from the department of environment land water and planning the mansfield shire council is appointed as the public land manager pursuant to section 14 of the crown land reserves act 1978 over the existing reservation known as the bonney dune recreation reserve and two pub meet once it is formally advised that it is the committee of management for the bonnie dune recreation reserve establishes a community reference group to develop a terms of reference for the group to assist council in the ongoing management of the reserve thank you uh do we have a second affirmation counselor 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation ah thank you mr mayor um as is detailed in the uh officers report this has been an issue that 's been ongoing for many many years and again as the ceo mentioned this is a very significant piece of recreation um land uh that is very well utilized by a number of user groups and uh i think in terms of what i believe in terms of uh the future use and uh development of this reserve that this is a positive step and with the assistance of a local community reference group i think the reserve in total will certainly get greater use and will be of greater benefit uh to the entire bonnie dune and mansfield shy communities thank you mr mayor thanks council sudan uh casatan uh yeah thanks mr mayor um i think uh as council slate and highlighted this has been an ongoing issue for a long long time and it 's good to see that uh finally it 's been resolved um i think i 'd just like to acknowledge the uh the the um committee the current committee of management that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and job that they 've done in and also working with their main tenant which is the bonnie dune football netball club as well um so look forward to a bright future there i think it 's also important to note that the uh the community hall was built for the community by the community in 1978 and um it 's very important to note that that is still the community hall will be treated as such um but also that now council can have got control over um have got control uh the committee of management that uh we can aptly fund projects that need to be done there and uh as we can see from this report there are a lot of projects that have needed to be done that haven 't been able to be achieved under delaware so look

council 's response to the application for 53 titan lane mansfield it lacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destruction or lopping of native vegetation is the highest priority under section 52.17 of the planning scheme the significance and importance of the native trees on this site is crucial to the young to the town 's biodiversity which is waning fast due to as of right removal of young and vigorous old and healthy and ancient habitat trees destruction of this patch of vegetation is not in the public interest degrades the amenity of this part of mansfield and fails to address climate change other sites exist to increase the number of dwellings in mansfield that don 't involve killing all the trees in any case no lot on this site if it is developed should be less than four thousand square meters point two of course it 's possible to minimize the impact of the trees here i on the trees here by refusing the subdivision proposal it is a proposal for development not a right to create a virtual desert four thousand square meter lots would still meet the criteria of general residential zone and allow trees to be preserved point three offsetting by paying money for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss of these trees provide wildlife habitat in the town and cannot replace the role this patch of vegetation as has as a reservoir for a nesting and feeding habitat for birds and animals to transition through point four argues to throw the baby out with the bath water it is not necessary or good to let this proposal stand councillors please refuse this application 0.5 is invalid vegetation removal can be avoided or minimised by different land use intensity as my objective as my objection says the arborist report is wrong it must be held as invalid there are perhaps 180 trees on this site over 15 to 20 years old plus several trees 80 to 120 years old that 's not what the consultant report says dwelp must not have relied on this arborist report it is invalid and it 's wrong point six is untrue in my objection i raised the fundamental concerns about this subdivision application lot size environmental impact connectivity with other parts of the town point seven where 's the balance here between nature and development that the consultant firm and arborist provided correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to refuse this application relevance to the council planning planning the council plan 13.25 strategic objective 2.6 it talks about provision of sustainable community infrastructure and services this proposal causes a signature mr mayor for three minutes is up uh mr absolutely three minutes up can you please wrap it up yes uh this proposal causes a significant loss of sustainable community infrastructure a significant community recreation resource trade at no cost to council compared this with the cost of establishing the botanic park thank you thanks mr edison uh councillor any questions for mr adamson hi council robbie yeah through you mr may thank you mr adamson for um coming tonight um can you tell me what date that you you made your uh complaint to council please um it was i think two days before the notice on the fence said it was closed or maybe it was even on the day okay so it was before the objections uh public notice closing time is that correct it was yes okay and thank you council has any other questions uh thank you mr adamson for your presentation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ councillors any other questions on the report accounts arriving yes to through you mr mayor to melissa crane um melissa uh what what is the zoning of that land there please through you mr mayor the zoning in the pro on this property is general residential one zone so am i correcting understanding that 's blocks under 4 000 square meters but through you mr may that is correct there is no specific minimum lot size in the zone but it um there are provisions that allow for lots to go below 300 square meters in this area okay mr adamson mentioned the report by um a report by an arborist and there 's an offset i believe the arborist has declared three of the larger trees which seem to be about 40 years old to be that they can be must be removed i think the the arborist report says due to um danger so what is the offset in monetary value to del whit for the removal of those trees certainly through you mr mayor the um any application that is required must provide a quote to demonstrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quote estimates the cost for offsetting the three large trees and the scattered patches of trees that are on the property that don 't qualify for the large tree section is in the order of approximately thirty two thousand dollars um and i 've got one more question melissa if you wouldn 't mind the three objections did they fall within or outside of the um of the public notice closing date uh through you mr mayor they they all came in through the notice period however i will just as a matter of order qualify that under the planning and environment council is obliged to accept objections right up until the point it meets it makes a decision regardless of the closing of the notification date thank you thanks and one more question does the developer of this proposed subdivision have is there any other problem with this development have they gone through all due process does it meet the planning rules and guidelines of the mount mansfield overlay et cetera et cetera certainly through you mr mayor again um it certainly does it 's been assessed against all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in clause 56 which are quite extensive and it 's been deemed to comply with all of them it also provides for connectivity to blocks further to the west of this site as well so it 's been thought of more strategically in the in the broader area as well thanks very much melissa thank you uh any further questions counselors no castles do we have a motion castle robbie you don 't have to read it out either councilman yeah it 's thank you very much for that um i would like to uh propose the motion uh that uh exists before us in our mansfield shire council meeting minutes are starting at page 35 and [Applause] ending that 's age and help me

second uh council robbie would you like to speak to the nation i would mr may um i see this development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the intent of which is to deliver affordable housing for younger people um i 'd like to to make note that this has been going on for some time and during that time the blocks will most likely increase in value by 50 percent which could be up around the higher two hundred thousand two ninety thousand range which may hinder some young people from entering the market um but i see it as a positive move it 's in an area that uh that has already been developed it 's very close to the high school and uh it has my endorsement thanks constructing castleton uh yeah thanks mr man yeah look i think um that this development 18 lot subdivision is uh in an area which is uh very already well developed and fits in the guidelines of the mansfield planning scheme the developer has done everything right in that respect um so yeah i 'm happy to uh second this motion thanks

aren 't allowed to ask questions i 'm not allowed to ask questions of either the executive or councils or the councillors so those rules in place um the first speaker i think is kylie richards mr welcome kylie and uh over to you hey um thank you mr mayor um i 'm going to outline the key points of history in order to correct a number of inaccuracies in mr dunn 's report in 2002 may state its goal was to assist and encourage and if necessary also the development of new and existing groups during 2002 mace agreed to support the concept of a community mentioned in mansfield as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mou was drawn up in february 2003 between mace and the mansfield community shared steering committee this committee consists of two mace board members and two other members and no longer exists it was established to manage the project to build the community sheds only mace was unsuccessful many times in securing funding for a men 's shed however in 2004 may secured federal and state funding for the construction establishment of two community education buildings now known as the mansfield community sheds maze contributed over fourteen thousand dollars to this project mace paid for the majority of operational outgoings for maintenance and overheads until 2018 when the men 's shed offered to contribute towards the electricity costs mace has always maintained that the mou was in relation to supporting the manslaughter menshed financially by providing enabled house funding until the men 's check could be established and became a stand-alone incorporated entity which it did in 2013. mace has always maintained that the mou was not in relation to the lease of the land or ownership of the community sheds they are two separate issues in 2014 the annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auspices shared through a 12-month period only until the men 's shed become incorporated the report also states that maze maintains its support of the share through the provision of the facility and with administration support we believe this confirms that the auspice arrangement has been fulfilled and that the menshire did not have any claim towards the lease of the land or the ownership of the building in 2018 following a successful application to fund a kitchen refurbishment at the community sheds the menshed requested a formal document to prove that they had security of tenure in order to receive that grant mace offered a enabled house agreement an mou at the time that was rejected by the men 's share to resolve this issue mace the menshid and council met in february 2019 and reached an agreement between all parties that mace would draft a license agreement between mace and the men 's shed all parties also agreed that the lease had been secured for 30 years that was until 2033. in summary may secured the funding to construct a community shed this was not funding free men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's goal was to auspice a steering shed committee for a 12-month only period mace has paid for the majority of outgoing expenses in relation to maintenance and the overheads the men 's shed are one of many community groups that utilize mesa 's community share thank you thanks uh miss richards um counselors there any questions of uh the presentation my castle arriving yeah thanks uh through you mr mayor hi hi there kylie have you carly have you read the mansfordshire council september council meeting um agenda i have okay so you 're aware of the of the um of the of the decision that we have to make tonight then correct thanks thank you my deputation yeah okay thanks any other questions counselors uh mr thank you for that uh that was concise and right on point thank you uh the next speaker i think is uh janine ripley the chairman of mates i 'm sorry the president of mace um welcome janine um thank you mr mayor can you hear me yes we can hear you and uh over to you thank you thank you mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corrections to mr dunn 's report the mansfield men 's shed signed a copy of the licence agreement in november 2020 unfortunately their solicitor sent an incorrect version of the final agreement when the correct version was resent to mace three months later in february 21 the men shed reneged on their decision and chose not to sign the agreement it must be pointed out that the men 's shed continues to enjoy ongoing tenure as was previously the case the community sheds are also used to support neighbourhood house funded groups and learn local programs mesa is a not-for-profit organisation we work on behalf of the community owing to some compliance issues a number of years ago as a previous registered training organisation we had five years of significant deficits after a major business review in 17 we have recorded three years in a row of small surpluses mesa 's based its short and medium-term future business goals on council 's publicly stated decision position in august 2020 in relation to the community sheds which was the lease for the land remains valid and continues to exist with mace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at twenty three and a half thousand the depreciation cost to mace over the past sixteen years has been seventy six thousand we expect the sheds to be fully depreciated by 2026. if mace is forced to hand over the sheds the 23.5 000 sitting on the balance sheet will have to be expensed as part of our profit and loss and will tip mace into a deficit position mace currently has a significant loan that we are servicing and cannot afford to go into deficit again as you indicated at our recent catch up council does not want to see mace go into deficit either the 2003 memorandum of understanding was between the community shed steering committee and mace the steering committee no longer exists and the mansfield men 's shed wasn 't registered until 2005. two years later if council deems the mou to be between the men 's shed and mace and on that basis the community sheds are handed over to the men 's shed mace will expect that item 5 in the mou is enforced that is mace will be recompensed for all outgoings by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the years in both capital and operational funding which would need to be repaid by the men 's shed mace will also expect to be recompensed for the current balance sheet cost of the sheds by either council or the men 's shed in summary the men 's shed has signed a licence agreement albeit the wrong one the men 's shed has ongoing tenure mesa 's future business goals are based on council confirming mesa 's lease was valid mace would incur a deficit if the sheds are handed over and mace would seek recompense of over fifty thousand dollars if the sheds are handed over to the mansfield men 's shed thank you council 's any questions [Music] uh mr lee i think i have a question with respect to the to the lease there 's a lot of things that i don 't understand with this whole process but one of them is the lease uh you 're how i read the lease you 're out of terms with elise um because it wasn 't renewed back in 2000 the option wasn 't taken up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't answer that question mr mayor because i wasn 't on the board at the time but our inquiries have discovered that everyone was under the impression that the lease had been secured for 30 years so to 2033 because a 30 payment was made by mr don hodges back in 2003. but it 's very clear when you read the lease that what the further terms are and how those further terms are enacted and it 's nothing to do with the 30 dollars that 's one of the this is one of the things that i don 't understand about this and i don 't understand why that wasn 't anyone that can read the lease could see that there 's been a breach there and that 's why i don 't understand why it wasn 't well mr mayor if we had have been uh in a position to have done something about it at the time we would have done it we would have done things differently you 've got a different board you 've got a different ceo so all i can say is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get some sort of um document to prove that they had security of tenure we were unaware we had we were under the impression that the lease had been secured until 2033 and we had not had any other um information from council to the contrary and at the february meeting in 2019 with council and the men 's shed all three parties agreed that the lease was secured until 2033. i just wanted to add that no one had read the lease in eight years it had never been an issue until the men 's shed asked to for a document to get their twenty-five thousand dollar grant for the for the kitchen yeah okay um thank you any and any other questions counselors thanks mr ridley thank you for that thank you thank you thank you um mr murray chenery welcome murray um [Music] and uh moser board member of mice so over you murray thanks mark look i 'd like to outline a way forward in this matter we 've clearly shown that the community shed is an asset of mace most respects council 's decision to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we also think we would also like to think that council takes a balanced view of this situation at a recent meeting with the mayor and the actual council ceo mace was assured that the report from mr dunn would be objective however we are very concerned that this report is not objective we 've obtained an email from the mansfield council to mr dundee the 27th of july this year where mr dunn is instructed to and i quote recommend that council provide maize with notice of council 's intention not to renew the lease or terminate this email further states that and i quote a report be presented along these lines to the to the september council meeting and should be scheduled on the agenda planner now a copy of this council email has been sent to councillors last night and i hope that you have read it we are extremely disappointed that the reports outcomes were already predetermined this biased instruction by council shakes the foundation of council and calls into question its core values of integrity and respect council 's core value of integrity states that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transparency and accountability and that you will keep an open mind on all issues council 's core value of respect states that you believe it is important to create a respectful and fair environment to support good decision making and that you believe it is important for increased understanding and trust and emphasize trust and that between council and the community councillors at the start of every council meeting you confirm your commitment to ensuring your behavior meets the standards set by your code of conduct and charter and you will all times faithfully represent and uphold the trust placed in you by the community your code of conduct states that you will at all times act with integrity and openness in the best interests of the community as councillors you should and must question the efficacy of this report now in the spirit of mace being open transparent and cooperative here is a way forward for all parties the first step is council confirms mace has a valid lease over the community shed until you know the actual year of 2033 the second step is that mace sorry the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its original commitment of signing the licensing agreement the right version and the third step is for mace and council to set a date to discuss the community shed lease beyond the year 2033. we thank council for allowing us to speak to this very important community matter we would hope that council recognizes that a solvent mice is fundamentally important and that to mansfield 's success as a diverse and inclusive community councillors we have a very strong view that the community are you mr mayor of the times not be available for just one community group we believe it is the right of every community group to call the community shed their home we trust that publicly seriously consider the facts put forward and apply and apply your core values in taking a balanced view of this situation which is in the in the best interest of the entire community that the community sheds remain a nice asset thank you so much thank you um because there 's any questions today casarati yeah thanks murray for coming and um i i um i 've noted that um you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my question to you is how did you receive an email that is confidential to the council it was given to us by whom i would rather not say that steve but you 're saying to us as part of the investigation yep steve kazurabi will we will take that up don 't worry yep um any other questions counselors uh council tan uh yes mr mayor um thanks murray for reminding us about our offer affirmation of office if i could just remind you that we do renew that oath at the start of each meeting so you have no problems in in knowing that we will make a unbiased and open decision thank you james uh any other questions counselors um murray i just have one question how much of the most revenue what percent what percentage and how many dollars does um the men 's shed represent i 'd have to ask kylie to answer that question she 's a ceo and she would have the finances mark so if kylie could come back into the zoom meeting she might be able to answer that question all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just repeat that question i i 'm just interested to know what percentage of mesa 's revenue uh is represented by the men 's shed um zero it 's just across the community so we don 't actually receive any funding from the men 's shed at the moment there 's no income generation there 's no income from the men 's shed too much no well okay thank you thank you um thank you murray for that uh we 'll move on to the next speaker which is mr ray barker uh welcome ray from the men 's shed and thank you for coming along thank you very much hold on hold on [Music] that 's a great sound sound machine sound effects thank you mr mayor councillors and staff for the council for listening to us um my presentation is more just on where the shed sits at the moment with from one man 's vision which was don we 've grown here for the last 18 years we 've provided a lot of activity for the many of mansfield plus we 've hosted the quilting groups who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our facilities we use and they are part of our group we 've striven to improve the sheds over the years we 've put in the air conditioning we 've built the our office and kitchen concreted the breezeway between the two sheds put a roof on it installed the container for our for our wood and we most of this material we we actually scrounge from the tip a lot of it is secondhand material we have always facilitated a space for the quilting groups and will continue to do so they 've we consider them part of us and the crafting groups the the men 's shed has grown and matured and we 've always done a lot of handyman services for the community of mansfield and personally over the past several years i 've developed lasting friendships here and achieved an enormous sense of satisfaction with the projects that we achieve and i believe that mansfield will be a poorer place if the shed was forced to close thank you that 's all i have to say uh thank you mr barker council is there any questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week ago or two weeks ago in the local paper from an ex mace board member that apparently there have been many many donations to the men 's shed by community members have you got a list and a value of that on hand we can provide yeah we can provide our treasurer is not here but he he could provide it yeah sure thank you but this this all goes a lot of the initial funding donations were given to mace in their role as our hospice since then we 've had donations from various community groups the uh what he called the market the busch market have donated a fridge to us uh there 's been several others and canavans have supported the shed over the years plus we do ongoing work for the bellatite hotel but yes we could provide that information from our treasurer thanks mr actually appreciate that thank you we 'll know uh castle webb thanks mr mayor um and thanks for your presentation right greatly appreciate it just a quick question it may be uh one that you have to supply to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangements arrangements between mason the men 's shed i guess in terms of the uh organization of menshed mansfield going forward do you feel confident you can stand on your own two feet as a sort of independent organization uh if mace wasn 't uh i guess providing the lease yes mace to be honest at the moment mace don 't provide any funding to us at all they generate funding out of the shed through the quilting groups but we we don 't have a financial arrangement with mace and never the only one we did have was in the past it was agreed that mace could run its welding courses here and in return they would cover the electricity bill for the shed rather than actually have a payment to use their facilities and that 's been the arrangement for for quite a few years and again the welding courses are uh are always welcome here and always have been thanks mr parker okay thank you uh if there 's no other questions counselors i 'll move on to mr bill copley from the men 's sheet welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i apologize but i didn 't see mr bender on screen good evening my name is dane bender um i 'm 37 i 've been a member of the men 's shed for approximately two years i 'm also i 'm battling um drug addiction and anxiety and the men 's shed has been critical for my um from my recovery and i 've found it to be found the men 's shed and the people to be very welcome and very very um very helpful in showing me how to use all the machine all the equipment and yeah and there 's always someone to talk to and yeah it gives me a lot of um it gives me um i need to keep motivated and um keep active and the men 's shed is very important for that thank you mr bennett it 's that 's much appreciated thank you and thank you for coming along thank you um mr copley uh sorry um you 're the final speaker for the men 's shirt thank you i mean thank you mr mayor um and thanks dana it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shed being even here i 'm going to do something slightly different one three one two seven eight what 's that anyone someone whispered to me one day hey that guy is about to go off a cliff one three one two seven eight is a crisis assessment team number it 's a psychiatric flying squad for mental health episodes we got wenger at a cat team on site and they arranged a proper psychiatric care for that member 's wife his untreated 20-plus year mental health problem have been pushing him to the limit that 's another untold story of the mental health uh in our community how the menshed fits in ray is right about the shed it 's the men that um make the shed and we disagree completely mace does not own this building as an asset the original uh management of mace signed an mou intended to be respected by honourable parties mr sladden witnessed that mou a month before signing the lease with mace becoming a bear trustee for the land it could only be said that mace acted as an honorable auspicer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be honored now mason 's position has cost our community 18 000 plus dollars in one lapse grant and the eligibility for many more the shed cannot and will not operate under mace their comments about in the press about risks to community groups are completely unfounded it makes because that we don 't communicate directly with them only through lawyers mostly most might be surprised that today our membership is actually 60 up from 41 and that includes 16 ladies quilters crafters or women persons with additional needs our lawyers advised us it 's difficult to see how mace writing off an asset with no result in cash flow implication would jeopardize the solvency of mace particularly particularly when that asset was never beneficially owned by mace in the first place and as a matter of fact we 've been subsidizing the welding classes for the last three years so the shed continues to seek grants and raise its own funds and for example we spent four thousand dollars on tours last year we 've also become a registered charity with dgr status through the ato and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the future community work like our community connection program where we 'll provide especially um set up tablet computers to our members in binary or hospital or at home when we hold the lease the land lease we 'll kick-start our investments with new plans for the kitchen solar leds dust extraction we plan a ladies toilet and a new doorway for the ladies into the kitchen for them we 're also researching a virtual power plant where battery accumulated through our solar power would be made available to the community um people like mansfield radio would be beneficiaries as well as possibly shopkeepers in errol street and we will always tinker with broken chairs and kids toys and christmas trees but none of this is possible until most relinquishes a land lease to mace is not relevant to the men 's shed mr mayor and councillors many folks have asked the shed why is mace doing this at the expense of the men 's shed continually denying the clear intent of the mou the shed is in full support of your recommendations in the agenda and we urge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then this debacle through you estimate that time is finished thank you mr copy you ready to wrap up or you close to wrapping up yep that 's that 's that 's the wrap okay we support the recommendations and we urge that the land lease be terminated the information provided by mace is um often been not the what we 've felt the the whole story and um we don 't you know we weren 't coming here to a kangaroo court to go and uh chase every single point that was raised by uh mace but their position is clearly wrong okay um mr copy we get we very clearly get where you 're coming from we understand so thank you thank you um counselors are there any questions mr copley counselor 10 yeah thanks mr mayor uh mr copley thanks for your presentation i was just wondering you mentioned that uh that the men 's shed uh missed out on an 18 that or was one less grant short of eighteen thousand dollars would you care to reiterate a bit on that or expand on that sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh plan to improve the sustainability of the shed was a kitchen refurbishment solar power and led lighting project we applied for that grant through the department of health and was successful mace provided a letter of support at that stage and that was prior to my knowledge of the the position and the history of the shed it was a thirty thousand dollar project of which the men were putting in eleven thousand and uh the health department was putting in eighteen thousand hundred 703 the mesa 's position with the security of tenure and the drive down to get the this sub license agreement uh caused the two-year period to expire and that eighteen thousand seven hundred and three dollars uh grant was uh lapsed by the health department thank you uh is there any other questions counselors okay uh thank you very much for that uh thank you ms cobley thank you uh thank you henry um and thank you all the other speakers as well sorry council rally yeah i 'm sorry mr mayor i thought um is there any other questions for bill i 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um and madam chair of the mace board collectively and that is do you

uh counselors are there any other questions or comments uh that you 'd like to make on the report that 's before us no nothing at all councils do we have a motion uh council robbie yeah i 'd like to move the motion mr mayor the council one receive and note the status of the lease as legally being in overhauling uh two agrees with the men 's shed incorporated interpretation of the original intent of the auspice agreement between mace and men 's shed incorporated signed on 2003 that being upon the incorporation of the men 's shed community shed as an entity the lease would be handed over to the men 's shed incorporated including the assets and that further lease agreements will be between council and the men 's shed incorporated three rights to mace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the intent of the original auspice agreement and urges mace to honour the intent of the agreement which was to support the men 's shed incorporated in the const in the construction upgrades and maintenance the building and then to hand over the project to the men 's shed incorporated four receives a further report on this matter at its october 2021 council meeting and five takes no further action on the mace council lease until council receives the further report and leave the existing lease in an overhauling arrangement until such time thank you council robbie and do we have the second half council team uh council robbie would you like to speak to the motion yeah i would um mr mayor i find this fairly distasteful basically as a community member but as a councillor having to make an agree you know judge and an agreement between mace and the men 's shed incorporated should have been able to work this out yourselves really it 's it 's look i think that there is a way through this that everyone can benefit uh we are talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been a lot of community effort in this i 've been in mansfield since 1983 so i 've got a fairly good idea of what happened back then um with phil who was the leading instigator of the men 's shed and fortunately they weren 't incorporated back then um i stress to all parties that we can work together to to get an outcome here and i 'm hoping that it will be a beneficial outcome to the whole community uh thank you thanks chance arabic um council team do you wish to speak as a secretary uh yes mr mayor thank you and um thanks for all the uh the speakers uh tonight it 's given a good perspective of both sides of the argument um firstly i 'd just also like to thank mr dunn for his report i think it 's a good report i think it 's very balanced and i think it covers both sides of the argument very well so thank you for that i think that the two organizations should put their heads together again and come up with a solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don 't then then in in two months time uh it will come back to council so i encourage both sides to really get together and to try and find a workable solution thank you thank you uh any other councillors wish to speak for against a motion council web thanks mr mayor um in general i think i mirror both council 10 councillor rabbi 's comments um it 's got completely out of hand this situation in my view and and the fact that it 's it 's come to council in this matter is disappointing we have two community groups in front of us that play an enormous role in our community both as important as each other and what i see is that both parties can 't see the bigger picture and work for the overall benefit of the community there 's a lot of mud in the water and a lot of historical issues and a lot of communication issues which is all in the past and as councillor tien said you 've got the opportunity now to put your heads together and come up with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your organizations because ultimately you both exist for the community as a whole and not a small subsect of it the entire community i really want both organizations here to take a breath take a step back look at the larger picture and just try and come up with a solution that benefits all parties including the community thank you thanks council webb uh katsurabi is the mover of the motion you have the final state yeah just one more thing to add in that mirrors counselor teens um uh comments about mr dunn i know dez dunn and i know he is a man of impeccable integrity and i trust his report and thank you mr dunn for sending a balanced report to council tonight thank you thank you council robbie uh councillors those in favor of the motion thank you the motion is passed uh i 'd just like to wrap up uh by saying thank you to the speakers all for coming in uh i 'd also like to to acknowledge des duns work on this as well because i i 'm i 'm reasonably well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a really balanced view mr dunn so i thought you covered it well and i totally refute the accusations made against the integrity of this council i wish on part and i take it really seriously and the code of conduct any breaches in that i totally refute that as well i think we do have an issue perhaps with leaking of documents and we will follow that up as an organization at whatever lengths necessary to get a result on that because that 's unacceptable thank you let 's move on to item 13.3 is the menswear community division 2040 sorry casserole point of order mr mayor um still got murray chenery in

would be a question don 't notice please through you mr mayor um i 'll i 'll take that what i notice thank you um any other questions counselors oh sorry council said i didn 't see it uh yes i 'd just like um clarification on the unspent working for victoria funding that 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we have received and yet to expend or is that carry over positions due to the extension of the working for victoria program through you mr mayor i can 't comment categorically i 've got got an understanding but i 'm not confident in it but the ceo who are you mr mayor um just to clarify the working for victoria funding extended over the end to the end of financial years so we still had staff under that program so we see had received the money but we needed to to carry it forward because the program didn 't finish at the end of the financial year did i get that question not quite right no i think you 're going to write the question right i just couldn 't quite follow the logic of the answer i think the logic was good i thank you mr mayor my intellect wasn 't up with it right okay councilors could you just repeat your questions so i can get it right thank you okay the question is with the unspent funds to carry over funds from working before victoria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuing and it 's funds that have been unspent or is it well yeah why is there the understand there i suppose yes that 's question so through you mr may it was because it continued beyond the end of the financial year and the funds weren 't spent thank you okay um any other questions castles councils

ben beaver uh saskar 's here um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's okay and welcome thank you councillors is any questions with regards to this report uh castle robbie yeah thanks mr mayor hi there sas here sorry about you having to wait to the end um saskia i like the report i 'm just uh absolutely clarified that there are no solar panels on the roof of the mansfield pool is that correct but the thank you and water from the toddler 's pools runs through some sort of black piping arrangement is that seen to work okay does it i 've never swum in that toddler 's pool for you mr may yes this is actually um a type of heating that is used very commonly in private pools as well so it is um yeah black piping that runs across the roof which is then heated by the sun and it it does heat both uh tolerant and lunar spools oh i see it 's the matting i couldn 't i drove past today i couldn 't see it so understood thank you hi council tent uh hi um saskia just a question regarding uh following up from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that i think the question was asked there was an attendance decrease of 28 and uh but the income for the pool remained the same i think the question was asked as to why that was and that was going to be explored do you have any new lightness on that anymore um i 'm afraid i don 't can we get we did ask that question that 's correct can we get some uh confirmation on that about what what you think 's behind it it was a big drop in attendance and yet the costs were the same it 's costly the same was the boss versus that cost were the same yeah good similar income at 28 decrease and it was perhaps something to do with the type of use of patronage but um anyway yeah if that could uh if you could get that to us that would be fantastic for you mr mayor i actually would have to say that i don 't think we can find that information um unless saskia has another idea the staff have gone through all the records and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get that detail so i i wouldn 't like counsellors to expect it because at this stage we don 't have it so am i correct there um yes you are correct so we can make assumptions regarding um less memberships but then an increase in 10 passes then session passes there 's an increase in maintenance um due to covet but we can 't we can 't find the exact um information council robbie um thank you mr mayor through you so saskia it 's a good segue into the future do you intend to be um having having more of a focus on this in in future and putting in place a spreadsheet for the councillors to to look at at the end of this swim season um yes so we are going we have gone through attendant process so we 're looking at um new ways of managing the pool at the moment and this will be presented to you um i believe in the next couple of weeks um it is due it is noted that a change is required and we are all committed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed thank you saskia i 'm sure it 's in good hands thank you mr mayor uh castle uh thank you mr mayor uh sasuke can you uh tell me when the uh solar blanket was purchased by council oh i will have to check that with the capital works team okay can you also tell me in relation to councillor

conrad are there any questions or comments counselors uh counselor said ah thank you mr mayor um ms conrick in reading the report i see um only one reference to the existing outdoor pool facility and i note that there is no sort of review [Music] um in the recommendation that is before us there 's no review or any mention of the future use of the indoor pool out of the outdoor pool and i 'm just wondering should that not be considered as part of this item on the agenda [Music] um i guess there 's two ways council can approach this one is to look at the feasibility of an indoor facility and should that advance to a particular stage then what 's the implications of the outdoor pool so there 's quite a bit of feasibility work to get through first to determine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to that stage i would expect council meets would need to consider the implications um i 'm sorry mr mayor just realized there are there is speakers to this item i 've overlooked that i just noticed it as well i 'll come back to that if i can thank you yeah my apologies uh sorry uh uh i i didn 't pick that up to the screen can we welcome uh emily dirksen i think first is that correct yeah um can you see me or hear me uh emily we can just see you now so welcome i 'm in my car down in vanilla so i didn 't get home in time are you driving are you driving as well well i 'm trying trying to yes no just kidding no i 'm not um yeah so i 'm one of the local gps at central general practice so thanks for allowing me to speak about um the benefits that an indoor aquatic center would provide our community as far from a medical perspective um i found it interesting when i asked for input from my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to speak that i heard back from almost all of them um whereas usually it takes countless emails and and bribes to get people to respond to things it just so demonstrated how important they feel an indoor pool um would be to our community and the benefits would be just massive um obviously swimming um confers benefits for um health physical and mental health and well-being quality of life and as well as the sense of community um in 2017 england conducted a study on um the health and well-being benefits of swimming and i don 't think there 's one in australia but um i have no doubt the findings should be similar it showed that the economic burden of physical inactivity in terms of healthcare costs productivity losses and disability adjusted life years was over 51 billion dollars a billion euros per year um so it 's tremendous um most of the population failed to meet national recommendations for physical activity ninety percent of two or four-year-olds failed to meet that eighty percent of five to fifteen-year-olds and forty percent of adults um it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recreation or for competition um are our um their um ability to meet physical activity guidelines are tremendously higher um so it 's key to addressing as i said physical and mental health issues the the physical health i think is benefits are um pretty obvious so cardiovascular respiratory um musculoskeletal rehabilitation so it proves heart health it reduces blood pressure improves lung capacity it reduces joint pain increases bone strength the research has identified that any amount of swimming participation compared to none is associated with a 28 and 41 in all cause and cardiovascular disease causing mortality um most common gp presentations that we see are musculoskeletal complaints such as osteoarthritis and back complaints hypertension diabetes cardiovascular disease asthma uh emphysema falls postoperative rehab dementia obesity mental health they all would benefit by a prescription for exercise particularly swimming um aqua based um exercise offers specific advantages compared to land-based exercise and that it reduces weight-bearing stress on joints it has higher humidity levels which decreased heat loads so we have quite extreme temperatures in mansfield um particularly in summer and in winter and so swimming can oftentimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you go swimming um so it has lots of benefits over land-based exercise and um we recently at our practice have started a chronic disease management program which focuses on preventive health and the positive response from our patients has been overwhelming we 've just been so surprised that we didn 't appreciate the need that there was for this preventative medicine and how much benefit it would provide for our patients and one of the most chronic conditions um that we address is um osteoarthritis which the management involves exercise and physiotherapy weight reduction and simple analgesia and swimming in particular hydrotherapy would be the most beneficial treatment for this condition however unfortunately now mansfield has no pools except for in the summer months there 's three months of the year um because the only indoor pool just closed and it was just a small pool but it was um quite important to the community for offering learn to swim classes as well as hypertherapy um that would close in may so we have no pools now available so all these patients that need hydrotherapy have to go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feasible they either can 't transport and drive themselves there or they can 't afford the petrol some of getting vouchers from council to do so which is great but obviously that could be um much better served by an indoor aquatic center in mansfield um the um benefit and then i have chronic pain patients who you know may have chronic pain from post stroke from um chronic medical regional pain syndrome from um uh various other um conditions that report in the summer months when they are able to swim they their analgesia requirement is significantly reduced and many eliminated by being able to swim and so during the winter months they have to then go back to opiates things um you know the morphine or penetrating four i 'm sorry endo and penalty for which has so many side effects um that are impact their quality of life and it all can be prevented by being able to swim um and then as far as misdemeanor the time is yeah so i 'm just going to say um you know as far as the mental health benefits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won 't exercise um can cause the same structural changes to the brain as antidepressants and so the tremendous impact that would have on our community and just the sense of community um would be tremendous having schools and competitions in our community having the ability to host these competitions right now we have some team that um has to train if they want to in the winter outside in juan guerrero or vanilla um and so a lot of them turn to other sports because it 's just not feasible so it would be thank you emily very eloquently so thank you for that okay i think uh and drive safely um are there any questions of did you turn this on okay sorry i 'm sorry cassie uh welcome um welcome tonight uh and thank you for hanging around you 're right at the end of the uh at the end of the at the agenda so uh it 's been a long wait for you okay thank you can you uh please go ahead the there 's a time limit of three minutes and you 'll get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mr mayor um i 've been invited to share my personal experience of when i ran and all year round swim school from my home here in mansfield as well as providing some other important facts um of course in support of an indoor aquatic center um george 's fish swim school ran away around almost nine years um focusing on swimming lessons for children under 14. during this time i 'd teach consistently between 200 and 250 students per week and ran intensive programs during all holidays and the last two years uh aerobics was added to the schedule as an example say term 1 2020 so pre pandemic there were 239 students and 21 acrobatics attendees enrolled and upon closing down at the end of term two of this year there were 202 students and 35 aqua attendees and the reduction was only due to uh covert 19 mitigation procedures that were in place um so therefore wait lists were always there um so for the swim school general generally between 30 and 50 but since term four last year so pre-summer uh between 50 and topping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people almost every day with regard to learn to swim and those needing hydrotherapy as mentioned by emily um i think that was probably the one of the biggest call outside of lewds being with hydrotherapy for those with chronic conditions because i couldn 't quite come to acroaerobics but needed that sort of private um physiotherapist uh lead therapy um and and for me really it was time the pool uh was a capacity i was instructing from nine morning till eight o 'clock at night so it was really just needing that bigger space and that more time um so also private sessions obviously for those with disabilities and people wanting to swim laps um inquiries were from locals but also many from moving to the area um so in saying that my um total swim school numbers comprised 250 comprised of infants toddlers preschoolers and school-aged children so in comparison man still currently has approximately 834 primary age children and 150 students um that 's excluding figures from one kinder so knowing these figures i was only able to serve as a fraction of the children needing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah i also want to share with you that according to an australian study done in 2017 50 of primary school leavers were not reaching uh set benchmarks in stroke development and 68 were unable to tread water for two minutes um it was confirmed to me today by the same body that the figures are still relevant due to the pandemic and there 's also a few other statistics uh showing current trends under the circumstances that i 'd like to share with you tonight uh we 're a life-saving australia 's drowning report from 1 july 2020 to 30 june 2021 including our summer just gone uh 294 deaths 674 new drownings uh which has increased by 20 on the previous year um the most of any age group rivers remain the leading location for drownings um and tragically deaths among children age zero to four years has increased by nine percent compared with the 10-year average but most concerning is 108 compared with last year that 's how much it 's increased um i 've also been advised by autism swim queensland that children and adolescents with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to drown than those without um yeah all factual and morally important reasons for our shire to provide our community with an all year round facility and thank you so much for your time thanks cassie thank you and thanks for being very concise in what you put forward so thank you thank you just one question i 've got and those numbers are quite astounding i i swim a lot at the local pool and that those numbers are really blew me away so why um particularly when the town pool is open why aren 't those why those people going to your pool versus town versus the the main pool do you think absolutely um the because it 's indoor uh indoor and heated so the water temperature is controlled the air temperature is controlled um and so then classes remain consistent week to week so we don 't have any interference with uh inclement weather um children under the three years of age according to the guide for safe pool operation must swim lessons in 32 degree water or more so i say six months old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was able to provide that for them um and parents really value um um swimming lessons in our region i call after call we have dams on our property we have a river frontage um you know we we water ski a lot over the summer and i really want them to know how to um you know behave in open water and what else can i think of um as emily mentioned mental health i see mental health improved in children and physical health and children and i have worked with children with disabilities and the movement and the benefits they get out of aquatics is is just heartwarming so there are quite a few things no thank you thank you uh council lady hi cassian thanks very much for coming along tonight um i 'm astounded at that you 've got 200 and 250 children learning to swim at your facility which is now obviously closing or closed out of those uh just generally don 't give me the specific facts but um how many people in mansfield that have a pool in their backyard still send their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um to be honest never had anyone say um well actually how do i phrase this people call me and say we want to get a backyard we want to get a pool so i want my children to be water familiar and what a safety familiar you know within our classes we talk about you know not breaching the fences and waiting for mum to always watch you so i 'd say more than more than not i would have parents concerned and absolutely having them swimming in lessons um before they get a backyard swimming pool and then of course there is benefits to having a backyard swimming pool because you can they 'll keep swimming they 'll keep having lessons so they 'll keep having that recreation confidence time and that stroke development and um survival skill time in lessons so they definitely complement each other i wouldn 't have people with drawing um especially in the um six months to eight-year-old mark because they have a pool so they 'll be fine uh are there any other questions thank you cassie okay thank you good job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that thank you mr mayor um councillors uh are there any other questions on that at all okay do we have a motion cancel robbie yeah thanks mr me i 'd like to move the motion that one provide an in-principle support for land a8658 at 34 bellevue court to be designated as land for an indoor aquatic facility for a period of up to five years uh two collaborates with year-round aquatic facility for mansfield which is yaffen to undertake an assessment of community need to determine demand and identify facility components as the first step in planning for an indoor aquatic center facility three develops a collaboration agreement with yaffen outlining each party 's commitment roles and responsibilities four notes that collaboration with yaffen means an in-kind council contribution only at this stage understanding that council has not provided a budget amount for an indoor aquatic facility project and fire five receives a report on each stage in the planning process thank you councils do we have a you wish to speak to the motion yeah i would mark uh um mr man i 'd like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's before us that one of the key issues down in the bottom of page 93 says agreeing to the affirm request is likely to create an expectation that planning will progress and the council will be actively involved it may also stimulate increased community interest and involvement and provide momentum to a long planned initiative this recommendation that we 're on i 'm putting before council tonight is only that that we identify the land for yafim to be able to have assurance to go out and create a report that report will be then submitted back to council so that we can look at it and it may be used for you to go out and seek funding for a benefit to the wider community this has been going on for a long long time and i think it 's a great outcome for the community to have to get together and drive this yourselves uh thank you mr mayor thank you uh castle webb do you wish to speak as a second yes thanks mr mayor um just to state that i 'm a very strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how it 's done they 're a very well-run incorporated body very strong at fundraising and have very clear direction in what they need to achieve i think it 's very very easy for council to support an organization such as this who have everything together and can present it to us as a neat little package so i congratulate yafim for getting to the stage i also congratulate councillor rabi for being a very vocal proponent of yafum within council and i 'm really excited to see the next steps in this project thank you um would any other counselor like to speak for or against emotion uh counselor team uh yeah thanks mr mayor um in uh speaking to this motion i 'd just like to make it clear and it 's probably been made clear by council arabi that um this is only an in-kind contribution that council is making at this point there 's a lot of water to go under the bridge before we get to the stage where any council funds would be directed at this it 's to give them the assurance that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project that was able to be financial or to be a project at all for a start but then to be financially viable for the rate players in this town and that will be something that will be scrutinized particularly from my behalf by council i hope so uh anyway well done and uh and uh good well done for yatham who have got a lot of community money there to to uh hopefully bring forward a good thanks again saturn um council arabi would you we should wrap it up yeah i understand times critical tonight um been

mayor of mansfield shire and i as i said i feel very privileged to be part of your journey and also part of this ceremony it 's a shame we can 't do this in person because i 'd much prefer that it 's

ceremony i 'd like to turn to the formal part of this ceremony which is conducted in accordance with australian citizenship act of 2007. as part of the legal requirements for the citizenship ceremony i will read the preamble from schedule 1 of the australian citizenship regulations 2016. australian citizenship requires or represents full and formal membership of the commonwealth of australia and and australian citizenship is a common bond involving reciprocal rights and obligations uniting all australians while respecting their diversity persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undertake to accept these obligations by pledging loyalty to australia and its people by sharing their demographic beliefs by respecting their rights and liberties and by upholding and obeying the laws of australia i now invite you to make the pledge of commitment to australia it is a legal requirement that you say the pledge out loud you may like to make the pledge with the words under god or without in the first line of the pledge the choice of either is entirely up to yourselves i now ask you to repeat the words of the pledge after me one line at a time from from this time forward unto god i pledge my loyalty to australia and whose rights and liberties i respect his rights and whose laws i will uphold and obey and his laws on behalf of everyone in mansfield congratulations you are now australian citizens and i 'm very proud to be part of this i can assure you um i 'd like to invite you all to join me in one of the um important things about being australia is our national anthem this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll give it a go um we 've got a video to play uh and and there 'll be singing of the national anthem and just like you all to join in one of the uh uh strong customs we have in australia is that we all stand out of respect for our national anthem so if you could all stand uh the words i think you 've all got and if you can just sing along as best as we can online as loudly as or softly as you like to our national anthem thanks lisa [Music] oh [Applause] [Music] in [Music] [Music] across the stage [Applause] [Music] ah [Music] [Applause] thank you very much i don 't know if you were able to see on the video but there was some shots there from our backyard from the high country there which were uh quite amazing and i 'm not 100 sure but i think the very last shot on the uh on the video was uh counselor team surfing but i could be wrong on that um i 'd just like to uh go through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have to um be aware of personally your citizenship sorry your citizenship certificate will be ordered and mailed to your postal address by registered posts uh by the department of home affairs uh this will take approximately three weeks as an australian citizen you 'll be required to vote at elections it 's one of the privileges that we all have when you receive your citizenship certificate you 'll receive an enrollment form from the australian electoral commission instructions for how to enroll will be provided on the form you will also receive a tree a native tree that will be delivered to your home address to be planted as you see fit and and where um as advised when you apply to your citizenship your information may be provided to your local member of parliament and they may send you a welcome letter so hopefully they will they should um so that 's about the the formal parts if you like um as i said it 's been an honor for me to preside over your ceremony today at which you 've made a commitment to australia and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for doing this as a member of our community we are proud of our communities growing diversity whether you 've lived in mansfieldshire for a long time or whether you are new to our community most of you 've been here for a long time um we welcome you as our newest citizens to australia into nashville i 'd just like to share a journey with you uh that is somewhat like yourselves in that you 've come to a new country by and it 's a really interesting story um and some of you from scotland this particular guy i 'm going to talk about was born in glasgow scotland in 1953. in 1981 this particular young man from scotland immigrated to australia in 1998 this man became an australian citizenship at a citizenship just like you 've been through today in 19 2006 his boy from scotland his boy from glasgow became the australian of the year his name is in fraser sorry you 're quite emotional readers ian fraser was a scottish born immunologist who developed and patent the technology for a vaccine for cervical cancer while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it came from someone who like you all has made the journey to become an australian citizen for me that speech was really relevant in trying to define what an australian citizen means to different people as you saw in the earlier video it means something different to everyone his comments i thought were really relevant um in his australian of the year acceptance speech in 2006 ian fraser said about australia i 've always felt that what i do in life should be good for the community i think that is the measure of being an australian citizen it 's not so much where you are born it 's what you 're actually doing beyond what people expect of you which is a a definition of australian citizenship which i 've never heard before i 've heard all the ones like you heard on that screen earlier but i thought this was really relevant coming from a guy from scotland who moved here done what a lot of you have done and how he what his perceptions of australia were and what he thought was important and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all live in a small community and we all believe the community is really important so congratulations once again on becoming an australian citizen and thank you for joining us today on what is not only important today but it 's actually a magnificent day and shows off why we all live here so well when you look out the window if you see me in the street and i haven 't recognised you please stop and introduce yourself as i 'd very much like to put a face to a name and meet you personally have a great day today it

2020",ZH2kGiEoEUI,20200904,486.4,"33 Highett St, Mansfield VIC 3722, Australia",1503,today i 'm welcoming dean bell as a committee member of the mansfield district association and long time business operator in our shire dean has been keeping his businesses active during covert 19 and we wanted to find out a bit more welcome dean and thanks for joining us today good afternoon good afternoon from a distance elbow yes how is your business adjusted through october 19. look firstly i 'd like to say that i think every business up and down the uh up and down high street hyatt street and you know whether it 's bonnie dune or out of jameson everyone has adjusted to some extent in some way and it 's everything from signage and sanitizing distancing staff training you know kind of customer traffic uh the management flow of that and i i really kind of would like to kind of tip my lid or yeah i can tip my hat to those uh who have done all that because i think we 've actually done across the board done better than many many businesses in melbourne um then back to our place you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've had to do all of those things and and adjust as well i mean that 's you know at the uh at the potty it 's kind of looking more like a gourmet grocery store than a cafe and uh and we 've been you know packaging up meals and cryovaccing things and delivering and and doing all sorts of hampers and and we 've actually had lots of people from melbourne calling and saying look my mum and dad live up there could you please make up a hamper like this could you send that off could you deliver it to them could you let them know that we love them and we miss them and and all of those things and here at the hotel of course you know our drive-through bottle shop has become the drive-through takeaway with a kind of special food heater and and so on and we 've been doing our um as you know our pony express up to ptolemy and out to perry 's where we um actually take big commercial hot boxes of food out to those rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting it back kind of lukewarm and things like that so there 's been a a lot of work all around i think by anyone else everyone i talk to thanks about that but i i yeah you 've left something out because you really have taught your staff to do tasks that they haven 't learned before so i can see from you behind that painting 's been one of those things oh yes well we we during the close downs we 've um we actually kind of had a professional painter come in and another tradesman and they actually gave lessons to our staff on kind of how to do some of the uh some of the work you can see behind us here and and we 've had people on paint brushes and they 've been learning carpentry skills and we 've had to run some new cables with with the proper guidance and uh and so they 've all been uh learning something new something different and it 's uh there 's been and there 's a lot of staff training as well for when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all the things that we need to do exactly and i 've noticed some of them they 've really stepped up haven 't they and it 's really good for them to be learning different things because it 's gonna they 'll remember this time forever and they 'll remember the skills they learned as well so what have been there 's there 's that and the other part of it interestingly enough as we 've reopened different sections those who 've been involved with the renovations have just had a a stronger bond with the place and said there 's a little bit of what i 've done sitting on that wall or over there or over there and uh and there 's you know which is just great to see that pride in place that 's fantastic do that in their attitude to everybody so what impacts do you think that this has all had on mansfield businesses i mean i mentioned a few things look you know it 's i think to date we have done exceptionally well and and i just kind of and i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if i can just uh jump down there for a moment i was talking with her and as she takes her dog for a walk and uh we were debriefing she said dean it is frightening to see how fast so many shops have become empty and she has sent me photos of one shop after another boarded up papered up four two left four lease and just sitting there empty and uh and one would think that mount eliza and mornington would be areas of quite a bit of money and they have absolutely uh you know kind of felt the pain so i 'm very proud of the fact that um that our shopkeepers here despite the lack of uh of revenue and the changes and all the rest have been able to keep their doors open and that they 're changing and adapting and it and it 's credit as well to our locals who have been making sure they get out there and support the businesses in town and we 've just got to hope that they can just get through this next few weeks because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at its highest since december 18 snow on the mountain still that we are going to be in a very very positive position for some uh you know return to business definitely and we look forward to that when it can happen don 't we and i i do admire everybody and acknowledge the work that 's gone in i i believe that lake miller county is to the top level too so it 's pretty exciting as well so what do you think the business community and local community need to do to keep moving forward well i think we have to you know remember that uh yeah as we get our visitors coming back uh as much as they understand that it 's all been different uh there won 't be you know the um all the sporting activities there won 't be the uh the show the high country festival so many things that were just part of the um the experience that uh that people have had when they 've come through town so on that level we kind of as business people we just need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do what can we do as groups of businesses to still create that good energy in the round uh that 's that 's part of it encouraging making sure that all of our staff know about the best places to go bush walking that they know that lake nellicutty is is full that they know the little spots to go to for picnics and fishing so that when people want to participate and enjoy some socially distanced activities we can guide them to all of those and that they can come back into town you know fill the beds at the motels come around get some takeaway food have a coffee sit in the main area and and do all of that so everybody has to be an ambassador everyone is a is a tourism officer for those that are coming back and making sure that we 're um looking after them that 's exactly what i was thinking when you were speaking that we 'll all be ambassadors for our region won 't we when we all come back together thank you gene and on behalf of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family and all your staff have been doing so thanks very much it 's our pleasure and thank you to all our businesses that are providing goods and services to us all through this difficult time we all know our local community has been hit hard by the effects of the fires and covered nighting both economically and socially and emotionally so please continue to support our businesses whether in the streets or online we know a great we have great local people and their commitment to new ideas and of course our positive future will get us through see you next week,"(-37.053645, 146.0869862)"

regarding the measurables around the council around the plan items uh in my view if we 're going to aim to achieve something we need to measure what we 're trying to achieve um and sort of the on the second last page of the report there 's a handful of items which have made it into the report to measure um in my view it 's not comprehensive and it misses quite a few items within the plan that we should be measuring um not going to i mean it shouldn 't go out to the community for consultation but i think we just need to double check those measurables to make sure that we 're achieving what we set out to achieve you counselor any other questions counselors no questions uh do we have a mover of the motion please cancel i must apologize i am having internet issues uh mr mayor um okay sorry so

down here for you um oh yeah so um on the policies in the available funds uh the forecast uh from 2021 to 2030 to 31 with a low point of 4.1 million in the available funds my reading of this that it indicates that there would be no cash issues um is is that your your your idea as well is that your view mr um sorry can you point me into what page you 're looking at please counseling all right yeah mandy it hasn 't got a high uh in my attachment oh hang on yes it has it 's eight of 48. put in page 48 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ column running from left to right um the low point is 25 26 at 4.1 million but i don 't see any problems there so my my question is that my reading of this 10-year plan indicates that there are no cash issues would you say that that 's correct so based on the data underpinning that long-term financial plan that 's correct that it hasn 't fallen the cash hasn 't fallen before below what we call the three million dollar cash flow yes yeah thank you thanks councilor any other questions do we have a motion please councils that 's the term oh yeah thanks mr mayor um i 'd like to move the council one formally prepare prepare the proposed financial plan

councils mr mayor if i could um come in just now councillor webb early on declared a conflict of interest or it was a little bit unclear so perhaps if um if you could ask councillor webb to clarify whether he does have a conflict material or general um or does not or just just that it 's a mention of the businesses because it is a general report thank you thank you thanks man mr mayor um yeah just it is just a mention in the report uh i don 't believe it is a direct conflict and i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report happy to be to discuss it and be you know proven otherwise but it 's just a very general indication just for everyone 's knowledge thank you council webb so from that councillor mr mayor i 'm taking it that council web is not declaring a conflict of interest thank you right okay um are there any questions on this report council robbie yeah thanks mr mayor um i i understand it is only a report but it 's the workshop with senior leadership group at uh issimo um is is that uh is that for counsellors to attend or and what is the cost for that do we know or is it too early to tell i can talk to that if that 's yes so excuse me men no there 's no intention for counsellors to attend that workshop it 's a it 's a brainstorming workshop with the leadership team to identify um any issues and potential solutions that we can use tech to address um and at this stage has been no discussion or cost thank you is it council 10 uh yes um who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective and efficient ict service delivery section it talks about procurement for a consultant to facilitate the project will commence in 2021 um and it 's referring to the complete role of office 365 but uh um i think that uh from my understanding we 've already um spent 80 000 in the um uh in rolling that out so what 's this procurement um consultant this consultant going to perform there in that role yep um through the mayor so there 's budget in this financial year to do the office 365 rollout which might be the adk you 're referring to um so it 's been adopted for this financial year we have some modules of the 365 suite rolled out but not the full contingent so we will be going out to procurement for a provider to help us we 've got the licensing but we haven 't rolled out the full functionality and to help us assess exactly which modules we should be using um and how best to modify our processes and workflows to then fit with that suite of products okay so i 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be included in the 80 000 or is this going to be additional to that um initial sum it 's all included in the budget that was adopted yeah thank you castle sladen you had your hand up yes thank you mr mayor uh ms kinnesley um reading the report the overarching policy that 's going to be developed i know your report does state that it includes but doesn 't limit the following and then there 's a whole list but um one area that seems to um jump out at me and not being included and that is the area of data breach and how data breach i mean you 've got either security there listed but data breach uh does not necessarily um equate to the same in cyber security uh so i 'm just pointing out that data breach is part of that over arching policy is included certainly councilor i would expect it would be but i 'll make a note of that and make sure that it does get included thank you mr mayor thank you councils any other questions uh do we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mr mayor the motion is the cancel receive and note this report thank you do we have a second council writing would you like to speak to the motion uh we 're only receiving and noting it mr mayor so nothing further to say the um the actual strategy is attached thank you council robbie would you like anything those in favor that sorry those against the motion sorry those against emotion those in favor motion 's passed thank you i 'm 13.3.4 the community recovery plan the responsible officer is the senior coordinator of community economic development saskia van buren welcome to saskatchewan thank you mr mayor um councillors are there any questions council webb thanks mr mayor um just one and understanding there may be uh confidential information around it our community development coordinator recruitment is that underway are we expecting to have somebody on board in that soon yes for you mr may um we have completed the process so the person has been appointed and we 'll be starting in four weeks very good thank you council has any other questions like cancer right yeah i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this plan i can 't understand how the camp plan can be implemented without finance so um is there any money unaccounted for in in the fund for this or saskia i can 't see any detail sorry um sorry it 's for you mr mayor um so all the funding required for these projects actually comes from external funding um so under the financial section um i have outlined um the different funds it will be coming from so um kazi funding has um some some some funding left over so we have um only it 's because we don 't need a lot of funding so just for the community groups workshops um so just for um location fee if there is a fee or some catering and then the um for the event side some minor cost as well so that will be kazi then a partnership with alpine valley community leadership so they have provided us the whole partnership is worth ten thousand dollars but about two thousand dollars of that partnership will be utilized for this for these professional development opportunities um and then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existing funding that they receive every year i believe they have to reapply for it but it 's a yielding fund and um so some of the actions that came out of this plan are actually in line with um actions that fit within that funding so that 's really where all the funding comes from and then the the staff that was employed for the recovery um projects um that came from working for victoria so now it will be handed over to the community development person okay so so three years ago mr med so as uh saskia um you mentioned that there is a surplus left over how much is there three mr may excuse me which surplus in what funding are you inquiring about i think you just said when you started uh answering the question that there was a surplus some funding left over that hadn 't gone out is that correct was it all fully expended so now there 's still some funding left from the different from kazi from alpine valley and from freezer so that is yet not not expended yet oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure what the full amount is for kazi but what we expect to be utilizing for um this project for kazi would be a maximum of fifteen hundred dollars the alpine alpine valley leadership would be two thousand dollars and freezer would be around three thousand dollars thank you council is there any other questions sasuke i just had a question of it following on from council rabbi um i don 't know if it 's the same question but of the money the funding that we 've got the grants that we 've got for community recovery and what we 've expended so far what hasn 't been expended what 's left over out of that total pool of community recovery funds um from the community recovery and resilience funding that is fully expended so that was to two hundred thousand dollars that when all went to um community groups um for events that 's all been expanded now um and then we had two hundred thousands in immediate um exceptional assistance and meet response funding so that has been um so 100 000 has gone to highline events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be reallocated which has been um approved by council in i believe the previous meeting um and so we just we are still awaiting approval from the funding body they have even increased in principal approval but not um full approval yet so i will advise when that is completed um and then there was um we had um 616 000 in council assistance funds so i don 't have the numbers in front of me but um we i did provide a full finance update um i believe again maybe last month on the month before um so i can provide that information to you um where we are actually that yeah thanks that 's it that 'd be great and that 's the full funding when you 're taking that yeah 1.06 million sorry council son ah thank you mr mayor um my understanding and correct me if i 'm um uh incorrect miss van viva and that is that all the funding has been committed but it hasn 't all been expended and that we are awaiting approval from regional development victoria and the other funding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this plan which was endorsed by the business and community recovery committee on the 17th of march um so my understanding is that there is no surplus funds available that it 's been committed but yet to be expended that is correct thank you thank you that that clarifies it thank you because is there any other questions we have a motion council sled ah thank you mr mayor uh when i find it um uh so the motion is the council endorses the community recover and recovery plan as provided in attachment uh one of this agenda thank you i do have a second case of whip would you like to speak to the motion yeah thank you mr mayor um pardon me um as i stated earlier this is a recovery plan that has been developed with the business and community recovery advisory group bcrack and they have had input all through the process while there is some um confirmation we are awaiting uh in terms of um some government funds about how we can expend the uh the unexpended funds as i say they 've been committed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approval from those funding bodies and in terms of i mean this has been a huge amount of money majority of which has come via the state and some from commonwealth government in terms of recovery as a result of the current pandemic the fact that that pandemic is still going on that a number of these projects will have long lasting effects it 's not just um you know that they haven 't been completed there are events to come and activities to come in the future and so it will have that ongoing um well it is hoped that it will have that ongoing uh support for the community and the businesses that have been in receipt of this funding thank you thanks council sudden uh council whip yes thanks mr mayor um mirroring mr oh sorry council sadness comments around this plan um has been a long time coming um i quite in this particular pilot plan i quite enjoy the empowering the communities empowering youth aspects of this um so we 're not just handing out money we 're creating capacity particularly in our outlying regions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take care of their own destiny effectively so i 'm i 'm a big fan of this plan let 's cancel it um anyone like to speak in opposition to the motion anyone like to speak further to the motion castle sudden would you like to sum up ah no i don 't think so mr mayor it 's not necessary those in favor of the motion the cue the motions passed thank you item 13.3 point thank you miss van dijk thank you item 13.3.5 uh covered 19 kazi initiative a quick quick action activation grants the responsible officer is senior coordinator community health and wellbeing jenny lubbick uh welcome jenny um councillors are there any questions on this on this document council team yeah through you um mr mayor um to miss lubbock just um just one question um and i should know this but who 's life 's circle is performance slavic is through mr mayor mislovic is not in the meeting tonight and i think that the general manager of community and corporate can answer that question oh sorry uh mr mayor and i asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask and that wasn 't one that um i thought of so i 'm afraid i 'll have to take that particular question on notice for you mr mayor um i 'm sorry i couldn 't hear counselor team councillor teen 's question so perhaps i might be able to help i may not be able to but if you could ask it again i 'll see what i can do thanks kurt certainly madam ceo um i was just looking at the list of recipients of funds and i wasn 't i 'm not aware of life circle uh which is one of the ten or so recipients so i 'm sorry i can 't answer that in detail i suspected something to do with um that followed on from council 's um in late in life project a couple of years ago there was an organization formed from that i think it 's life circle so council received from funds a couple of years ago to run a program with our older residents around that end of life stage and i recall that a community group then formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life circle but we will confirm it thank you thanks hannah yeah i can confirm that um mr mayor and council team uh that is the group yes um which was born out of that project uh that the ceo did mention thanks council satan any other questions councillors uh mr mayor it 's not a question but i just think for the benefit of those who may be listing we have been using the word or the expression kazi uh quite a few times tonight and i think it 's important to um just elaborate on that and kazi stands for community activation and social isolation so this was a state government program so it was funding made available to all local governments in victoria um to use again in response to the pandemic so when you hear the word kazi that 's what it means community activation and social isolation cessat uh do you have a motion council web thanks mr mayor uh the motion being that uh council endorses the dispersal of kazi quick action activation grant funds to these successful applicants as listed in tonight 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next council web uh do we have a second castle sweden castle webb do you would you like to

2020 i also remind everyone that local government decision making unlike state and federal government does not afford the benefit of parliamentary privilege and hence no protection is afforded to

's public question time where we welcome any questions from the community uh and we have one question this evening it 's a question from ms moira deeming and her question is under victorian law is it legal for local government councils councillors sorry local government councils to provide sex-based targeted services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facilities if not why not can we illegally put signs on a set of public toilets declaring that one is for biological males including males with an intersex condition one is for biological females including biological females with an intersex condition and one is for people with transgender identities of any biological sex if not why not mr mrs deming 's question is the building code of australia contains requirements for braille and tactile signage in commercial class buildings which is what public toilets are classed as currently the building code of australia only considers and regulates male female and unisex sanitary facilities separate sanitary facilities are required by the building code of australia for males and females a unisex facility may be provided instead of separate facilities through each sex in some instances hopefully that answers some steaming 's question which i think item 13. it 's the chief executive officers report are there any questions regarding the support councils council web thanks mr mayor um and through you mr merrill directors towards uh acting ceo ms alexander um i just noticed there 's no statistics on the youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is currently temporarily closed but i 'm curious as to if

services are still running albeit with the center closed and in the current lockdown situation but we will um we will provide a more comprehensive report so we 'll we 'll take that one on notice and uh attempt to provide some better information in next month 's report okay thank you alexander uh councils any other questions council robbie yeah mr mayor through you i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom of information uh required by council in june so i 'm assuming that 's post our last meeting now do you know what that 's for acting ceo please uh through you mr mayor um i 'll ask a coordinator of governance i understand it was a road related issue she 's nodding ahead yes it was it 's it 's still current uh it was received after that last meeting and it is related to rhodes thank you any other questions counselors uh council champ uh yes mr mayor through you to uh the acting ceo just a query regarding the um work on bar white road reconstruction is um is there going to be a um a warranty of sorts on that road when it 's um when it 's completed uh in relation that the here mr mayor they 're um works that are currently being carried out on bar white roads or or about to start out the uh drainage rectification works um so yes there would be a um the usual defects liability periods on those works uh the previous pavement um reconstruction works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period so um that the there was some previous uh rectification work done but as part of that process it was identified that council needed to upgrade uh some drainage uh associated with that work so that 's what 's now being planned and will be actioned thank you any other questions counselors council robbie more of an observation than the question mr mayor that 's um on the ceo 's report building services to the end of um june this year 70 million 563 919 up 10.8 from the same time last year um and the monthly comparison of building permits lodged are up 5.5 percent than last year and i note i 'd like to have

officer is their manager of operation curse capital works christian bertrand and christian we welcome you tonight um are there any questions on this report council webb thanks mr mayor um just a couple so i 'm just referring back to uh the options here and i 'm noting that the recommendation um is to be that the property owner maintains it is that right yes it is um what i guess what guarantees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if for example the property owner fails to maintain the road and if the property changes hands at a later date is this maintenance part of the sale of the property uh yeah through you mr mayor um i can answer that question um [Music] it is a tricky situation uh the 133 agreement that would um enter the title would go with that title if that property was sold so the terms and conditions of that 173 agreement would transfer over to the new owner that 173 agreement would have provisions for enforcement of the maintenance and construction of that road um so that would be the mechanism that would make sure that there was continued access to the property okay thank you councillor webb that 's sorry council robbie oh thanks mr mayor through you too um the question i have is that do you know how long this has been going on for this this problem with getting access to the block christian yeah it 's um it 's a long-running problem it uh began in 2015 i believe the current property owner bought that parcel of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought it up as a concern to council so maybe five six years in the making uh councilman arabic yeah thanks thanks very much and um you 've answered councillors where i had the same question that looks like the um the section 173 the agreement would um enforce any future um owner into maintaining the road if if this uh option three was to be voted on is it that 's that 's thank you council has any other questions do we have a motion cancellation mr mayor like to put the motion forward the council won upon the satisfactory written request of the property owner formally requests the cancellation of a portion of grazing licence 200-8957 from the department of environment land water and planning two notes that the works in road reserve permit will be required for the property owner to construct the access to a standard agreed to by the council officers and three enters into a section 173 agreement with the property owner under the planning and environment act 1987 to require any ongoing maintenance of the new access road to be at no cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crown allotment 61a with this agreement to be prepared by council solicitors at no cost to the council thanks council sarabi uh do we have a second would you like to speak to the motion i would um like to speak to this motion i 'd like to commend the work that 's been done in this it 's been a very difficult quagmire through um it 's been a lot of work done and i think the engineering staff planning staff have done an admirable job to get this as a satisfactory resolution and i 'd like to thank them very much mr mayor thanks katsurabi uh council tune would you like to say uh yeah that i totally agree with uh the comments of uh council arabi um a well designed outcome well done thank you um would any counselors like to speak to this motion would you like to say anything more no thank you i think i 've said enough thank you okay uh those in favor of the motion the motion is passed thank you item 13.2.2 is the local roads and community infrastructure program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comments questions on this proposal thanks mr mayor to the relevant officer should this motion be approved and should the actual project go ahead is it possible to actually see the uh the sighting of such a facility um as opposed to its original sighting on the adopted and endorsed station precinct master plan because i understand it has moved is that correct uh three mr mayor i can probably answer that one and um i need to get some more detail from our manager operations captain work um the there was an indicative location included in the master plan it 's my understanding that this facility is pretty much in the proximate location of where that indicative it was just a rectangle shown on that on a concept plan so my understanding is this is pretty much located where that was but we can certainly get counsellors um some further detail if required i 'll just maybe just check with our manager operations and capital works if there 's anything further he had to add on that one yeah it 's for you mr mayor um just to add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks from the master plan but one thing not considered in the location originally was the size required and alignment between the scar tree and beer light and that 's been addressed with the current plan which is what has led to the current um location and blindness does that answer the question uh sort of i i i look forward to the um uh to the revised plans uh but my concern here is that the uh its sighting does not conflict with any potential commercial activity which may eventuate from the as i say the adopted and endorsed station precinct master plan thank you listen thank you any other questions counselors do we have a motion counselor team all right thanks mr man yeah i 'd like to move the council one notes the information from the proposed on the face and base to the local roads and community infrastructure program and to support the nomination of the heritage village visitor facility project for funding from phase three of the local roads and community infrastructure program with the full funding allocation of 1.183 million allocated to the project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would you like to speak to the recommendation or just a motion well yeah thanks mr mayor just to uh note that um it 's uh it 's uh a great project down there and this will be really good to kick start that whole area get things moving and um congratulations to all those who have really pushed hard for this um heritage uh visited for still facility and um uh yeah that 's all i 'll say for now thanks uh casserati do you would you like to sign in i would mr may um went to one of their meetings down there and um i was very concerned to hear that they couldn 't accept any further donations um to the history of mansfield they 've run out of space and this will alleviate that problem it 's a great outcome and i 'm looking forward to seeing the um to see it to see it 's coming to fruition thank you thanks cancer abby uh any other counselors like to speak to motion thank you mr mayor um i think it 's important that we acknowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they 've done towards this facility and to all the community members who have contributed to that to that fund which uh and their contribution to this project certainly will help the um the final figure um add up so uh just acknowledging uh that um that fundraising effort that the historical society has done thank you mr mayor thanks councillor any other comments councilwood everyone else is having a comment i may as well jump in just to mirror everybody else 's comments that they 've made around this i think we 're all fairly much in agreeance around this project we 're all really excited for this to proceed thanks councilweb there 's no other comments those in favor of the motion motion is passed thank you item 13.2.3 uh it 's a great application for the lord 's reserve community hub uh the responsible officer again is the manager of operation and capital works christian burkha are there any questions regarding regarding this castle thank you mr mayor um mr burkhardt the consultation with the user groups in the development of this um grant application their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far could you elaborate on that please yeah through you mr there thanks a question um there 's been several rounds of consultation the new groups of the current facility there and there input was um right into the design as we have it at the moment um their input was also sorted into any possible um value engineering to be done uh to that design in order to make use of the available funding so um the funding is as you can see in the report um it 's close to where we want it to be we 'll continue to consult with those music groups to um make any [Music] i guess intelligent choices so as to the best use of that funding to get the best outcome for all of those user groups thanks mr burkhart thank you no further questions mr matt thank you any other questions classes council web thank you mr mayor um the there 's if passed or if we choose to to go down this path there will be there 's a co-contribution there of 510 um is that needing to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh slated for further budgets in further years or potentially through you mr mayor there was a previous contribution that was made uh that can be carried forward um at council 's uh discretion uh that was a contra that was an allocation made in the budget from last financial year of 490 000 and they 've also been a range of savings to the capital works program for the 2021 capital works that were not included in the budget forecast for 2122 so we do have some funds available without affecting council 's budget position for 20 for their financial year 21 22 so we 're in a good position to be able to make that contribution okay thank you any other questions do we have a motion castles castle slavin ah thank you mr mayor yes i 'd like to move the recommendation that it 's listed on the agenda under the report uh i won 't read it

proposal is there no footpath in this proposal for down kingston parade this great thank you through you mr mayor um the proposal doesn 't include a footpath because it 's the footpaths on kidston parade so it 's not on the subject land that 's the permit will be applied to however there is a condition there 's two conditions in the planning permit recommendation conditions 11 and 12 that refer to a footpath contingent 12 specifically requires that the concrete footpath be constructed along kidston parade extending from the southernmost extent of kitten kidston parade fronted by baylor village so there is a requirement in the recommendation for that footpath to be constructed thank you thanks for um thanks for that melissa that 's excellent council 's other questions if there 's no other questions do we have a motion council web thanks mr mayor um the motion being the recommendation that is printed uh in tonight 's agenda 13.2.5 thank you do you have a second casatan castle webb

uh it 's a it 's a great plan that 's been um brought together i have one comment and i really like the um the buffer zone that is along um the morinda highway on the northern end of the um of the project and i 'm i 'd love to see it along the uh eastern end of the project uh along kidston parade to some degree in the future but uh that 's entirely up to uh to to the to the master plan so um but yeah uh well done to uh all those at uh the retirement village in organizing this thanks councillor tim uh any other counselors wish to speak to the motion council webb do you wish to wrap it up no thank you mr mayor those in favor of the motion the motion is passed thank you item 13.2.6 is the mansfield resource recovery master plan responsible officer is melissa crane manager of planning environment are there any questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um the question comes from numerous phone calls that i 've had in relation to trucks driving up and down height and lane and i would hope that the master plan could include a uh possible truck route that may intersect our new proposed truck route um i 'm hopeful so everyone that 's watching out there in in watching me that you 've rung me i 've brought it up thanks very much um other than that it 's it 's good to see i think that we have a master plan for our resource recovery um acknowledging that um that we 're going to try and reduce landfill by 95 which in the report thank you thanks council raleigh are there any other comments counselors yeah sorry justin mr may yeah i agree with uh council arabi uh in respect to um the uh landfill going out and the route it takes and i do do recognize that um the uh heavy vehicle bypass will uh could be intersected um uh to the resource recovery via a couple of different uh roads uh i think there 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can 't remember the name of the road but it probably is something that could be explored down the track i think um one other thing i would like to see is i really like for us as a council to go to um some state-of-the-art resource recovery centers prior to um this whole plan being developed just so that we can see how a modern facility works given that down the track there is a likelihood that we may not be shipping um waste out of there to vanilla and it may have to go somewhere else um so yeah i think it would be a great idea to um to to to look at um some different options in terms of these centers thanks counselor tan any other comments counselors do we have a mover for the motion council arriving thanks mr mayor i 'd like to move the nation the council proceed to complete the preparation of a master plan based on the existing resource recovery center site at 163 monkey gully road in mansfield thanks cancer alley seconder that 's a slide council robbie would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very much i 'd like to ask the officers to organise a all councillors uh to have an attendance up in the resource recovery center um as part of this master plan outcome i think we need to go up there and have a look if we haven 't been there yet and i know that i 've mentioned this two or three times so i 'd expect to be going up there with my fellow counselors i 'd also like to acknowledge counselor tien 's comment as well that i think we need to be able to go and have a look at a um benella and wangaratta some or something close to to mansfield some other site that 's been recently developed so that we can get an idea of what we 're looking at in the future thank you thanks councilor council slade uh thanks mr mayor only to say that the preliminary uh briefings the council has had on the master plan uh certainly are very positive and the um the progression to date has been very encouraging so i look forward to the completion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counselors like to make a comment council rabbi would you like to um sum up castle robbing you wouldn 't okay thank you those in favor of the motion council right [Music] can you hear us i can now the whole screen froze and i couldn 't hear anything you look fantastic now i always look good uh okay can we have that vote uh vote again please those in favor of the motion the motion is passed thank you item 13.2.7 destination charging across victoria for electric vehicle fast charging stations the responsible officer is melissa crane manager of planning and environment council is there any comments on this paper no questions council robbie yeah i 've got a question um mr man through you that um the recommendation that we have in front of us is asking for a contribution of 36 000 plus an in-kind contribution of 12 000 which makes up a contribution of 48 000 against a victorian the application is for i think 50 000 for the station charging station um and it doesn 't mean well the first thing is is that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this question um that it 's not in our budget um and the other thing is that uh um there 's been no there 's nothing in the document that said i can 't find anything it 's asking us to donate any land to the charging station where it would go specifically i know there 's this uh comment on there are some areas that it could go but i 'd like to know where it would be going thank you uh yeah ms alexander would you like to comment on that uh yes through you miss mayor um yeah there are a couple of possible uh locations flagged in the report um i think um probably fair to say that we would need to just look at their respective merits on both of those um so there 's a little further work to do um in terms of uh you know what would be the ideal location um mainly because we just need to confirm the availability of power on both of those sites we believe it is that they 're both possible um but we would need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of alternative locations um in relation to the um funding question uh council rabbi is absolutely correct there wasn 't any allocation made in council 's budget for 21 22. um the inclined contribution um proposed was uh to use our field services team to do the um excavation works that would be required to install the power connection um and we would need um if council supports the motion to allocate uh some funding um there is as i mentioned earlier in the meeting there is some savings that have been made from our capital works program this year um so council could do that um without affecting its budget position but i understand um you know we 're in your hands councillors as to whether you wish to support this application or not because it wasn 't included in budget thanks ms alexander any other questions or comments councils i guess thanks mr mayor um i think uh councillor robbie just to clarify i think the the total project is 96 grand so we 're contributing 36 and 12 in kind for 96 grand worth of value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mayor that 's absolutely correct the grant um conditions require a one-to-one contribution so it 's basically half of the 96 000 is what council is required to contribute either directly or in kind and i think it 's a four to one in ratio in that respect too um i just want to make a comment as well this is this um this grant coming from the state government has been a direct result from the um central victorian greenhouse alliance and the work that the gold murray climate alliance have done with their charging the regions projects so they 've been a strong voice and a strong advocate at the state level for the member councils of which mansfield is won so they 've they 've done a lot of work in this preliminary report and identified mansfield as a key area for destination charges so that 's a result of a lot of the hard work that the climate alliance has done and they 've been able to get us listed in this grant which is excellent any other comments counselors sorry counselor turn uh yes mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for miss alexander the um the sighting of uh an ev station is that not taken into account as in kind the land that would be donated for this i imagine it would take up a fair amount of area in any public space uh through you mr mares i understand that the grant conditions um do actually require us to make a financial contribution um as with most grants they that contribution can be made up of a direct contribution and an in-kind but they usually put limits on the in-kind and i think in this one it was 25 but i might have to throw to um ms crane to see if she has the details on that one thank you through you mr mayor um as to the percentage of in-kind it i think yes um ms alexander is correct that the maximum we could do was 25 in that regard so it is a bit limited um yeah and it 's so it 's one of those grants that 's come up fairly late in the face unfortunately so we 've not been able to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determine which site more specifically will be appropriate um before getting to this point with council sorry thanks thank you mr crain uh council robbie i 'd like to know whether the climate alliance uh group and forgive me rowan i can 't remember you keep changing the name all the time so renewable energy mansfield is that correct um that 's a different group councillor have they got any information on how many electric cars come to mansfield what the percentage of mansfield residents are that own electric cars i 'll just see um 96 000 to charge up a few cars as being an exorbitant amount of money um to provide when we 've got a pool i 'm going to mention this later on in in our meeting when we 've got a pool that isn 't hasn 't got any solar heating and it 's got no solar panels for power um i i i understand that uh a co-contribution of twelve thousand dollars for civil works and a contribution for land is acceptable but um for a for something that i can 't see any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i haven 't got any um sorry councillor robbie through you mr mayor i think we might have to have a motion on the table if we 're going to enter debate so i was just about to say steve what 's your question um have we got any information on how many cars that will be getting charged what the percentage of mansfield residents are with these cars and what the percentage of visitors are with electric cars so ms alexander would you have any of that information uh i will just check with miss crane i don 't believe that we do but i 'll just double check thank you through you mr mayor there 's not specific numbers associated with this the um identification of priority towns has been made by partly on access to other sites that have charging facilities distance between those charging facilities and the ability for electric vehicles to even come into the region in the first place so um the fact that we don 't have a charging facility is uh it 's it 's a barrier to getting the electrical vehicle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on a geographic understanding and creating those connections across the region thank you thank you one more question is it true that the della type winery already has a charging station for electric cars that is my understanding if it 's not already there that there is one proposed um through you mr mayor i 'm happy to confirm there is one there it is it 's not a fast charger so it 's a slow charger that just trickles in when people are there for a period of time the charger that 's being proposed here is one where they can get to a reasonable amount of charge in a shorter period of time so whether they 're getting a coffee or having a lunch break rather than being there for a number of hours thank you thanks mr mayor um just to confirm if we don 't uh move forward with the approval of allocation of uh co-contribution in terms of financially will we be eligible for this grant three-year misdemeanor it 's my understanding that we do need to make a finance financial co-contribution so no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our application would be viewed favorably if we made one thank you sorry castle robbie is this the only grant that 's available forever or is there another one coming up um in the future do you know is alexander uh look i i 'm not aware of any others at present this is the the first one that we 've seen be announced to my knowledge um i don 't know if um miss crane has any further information no no i mean it 's not to rule it out that there couldn 't be more in future but that 's the only one that we 're aware of at this point okay guys is there any other questions okay councillors do we have a motion castle webb thanks mr mayor uh motion being that council endorses the submission of a grant application for an electric vehicle charging station to be installed in mansfield through the destination charging across victoria program prior to the application closing date of 23rd july 2021 and 2 approves the allocation of a financial co-contribution of thirty six thousand dollars to the project thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council uh would anyone else like to speak to the national councils no one else likes to speak to motion counselors uh those for the motion point of order mr i think i should be given the option to speak first as the mover my apologies my apologies thank you um just mirroring some of my comments i mentioned earlier about the golden money murray climate alliance so um mansfield is a member of the client alliance and they do a lot of this work in the background and doing a lot of advocacy for smaller shires in our region and part of the contribution we make for the climate alliance is to put forward and do feasibility studies for things just like this as i mentioned uh is it is because of all the advocacy work that the climate alliance have done in conjunction with the central victorian greenhouse alliance to get this grant up off the ground and into a position where we 're able to apply for it so um i think um councillor robbie mentioned earlier yes there is charges at delete winery but they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no charges within townships in mansfield shire if we look at our neighbors strathbergie marindindi alpine indigo mitchell wengerada they all have some sort of charging resource in town and that 's the critical part about this is that we need that infrastructure within the town to make use of what 's called the um the linger time so it takes 20 to 60 minutes for a car to charge and during that time that 's where the economic development comes into it so they 're not just sitting in their cars trillion thumbs they 're out they 're buying coffee they 're going to the shops they 're helping our small businesses so while it is a small contribution from our budget which wasn 't budgeted um noting that the grant was released four days after we endorsed our budget this year um the uh in terms of the development or the potential ev tourism we can gain from it um will outweigh those costs over time um so i 'm in great support to this this particular endeavor thank you thanks again webb uh council side second thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make um just uh repeating what uh councillor webb said uh this is one of those grants that did come in after the budget was passed um these these type of grants will come up from time to time uh it 's an opportunity for us to deliver on a key plank of our environment strategy which this council has adopted and endorsed it also provides another add-on attraction for people to visit mansfield the other point i 'd like to make is that with the uh delete winery my understanding is that is a fee for service um arrangement it 's not a it won 't be free freely available and the one in town will be more publicly available and will be available all hours rather than one that 's in a private enterprise given that the budget did forecast a rather substantial increase in the uh supplementary rate income i believe 36 000 uh is a fantastic investment um and that we should capitalize on this opportunity of the fifty thousand dollars from the state government thank you thanks council satan uh any other councillors wish to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh i have i have problems with this and um i would uh i agree that we need a an electric uh vehicle station in town as uh council webb has said um but i think that um the uh i think the funding of it should come from elsewhere i think that happy for council to donate a site for this but uh i 'm sure and as was mentioned um that there will be plenty of grants around to um to fully fund this and be very supportive of a fully funded grant uh with the site so i don 't think it 's in council 's domain to um the ongoing costs of maintaining it and maintenance [Music] any other comments castles those in favor of the motion oh sorry counselor yeah i wasn 't voting for the motion your honor um sorry been in court looking at court all day um i um i i mirror uh counselor teen 's comments i also understand counselor webs um and and and his uh group 's efforts in this but i do think that there it will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last bastion and i my view is that our 36 thousand dollars on unbudgeted could be better spent to support a larger cohort within the mansfield shire thank you thanks cancer robbie um if there 's no further comment uh we 'll put this uh councilweb did you sorry you 've wrapped up um i 'd like to just wrap up if i could mr may um i acknowledge both council teams councillor arby 's comments um i think council should be a leader in this space i i don 't disagree that there may be more funding in the future for this sort of thing um but we don 't know when that will be it 's an it 's an undetermined period of time um we need to be a leader in the space and in terms of a cohort that this benefits counselor abi it does benefit our small businesses on main street that 's pretty much your benefits because of that linger time as i mentioned um so it 's greater than just topping some cars up there 's greater things which surround that so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could stimulate ev tourism within our town and the fact that we do not have electric vehicle charges within our town puts us at risk of missing out further down the track but i acknowledge your comments thank you thanks council web those in favor of the motion goes against the motion the motion is lapsed thank you mr mayor can i call for a division yes you can uh those in favor of the motion council web council those opposed to the motion council robbie councillor councillor holdem thank you item 13.2.8 uh response to the petition request for public toilets in marriaging excuse me mr mayor councillor robbie has his hand up yeah council robbie yeah mr mayor i 'd like to propose an alternative motion if i may i 'll just uh miss alexander uh is that uh we can do that at this point point of order yeah yeah i 'm i 'm referring to miss alexander council said you um if the emotion is related to this to this report um i believe that we can accept a new motion i 'd be p to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh i beg your pardon i may have jumped the gun i thought councillor ravi was looking for an alternate motion to the previous motion which had already been voted on so no i i wanted a new motion pool with respect to the charging station miss alexander you know ruling on that place that 's my understanding and i might throw to our governance coordinator that because the previous motion uh failed uh we can accept a new motion um in relation to it and given that the previous motion was voted down miss k i 'm just reviewing the governance rules at the moment i can 't nothing 's coming out to me that we can do that so i 'm just double checking if he can give him a minute i can 't see in the governance rules that there is a moving an alternate moment once one motion once the emotion has been um voted on do you agree with me councillor sudden well it 's not council students no i just thought he might have had the rules in front of him that 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the case we 'll let the motion stand as it is and through you miss me happy to um given that we haven 't been able to clarify that i think we 're probably safer to leave it as it is we could always accept a motion at the next council meeting if councillor robbie wishes to put something on notice for the next meeting no we 'll let it stand as it is thank you uh getting back to item 13.2.8 response to petition the request for public toilets in marriaging are there any questions on this paper if there 's no questions counselors do we have a motion uh counselor time uh yes mr mayor thanks um the uh motion being that council notes the information provided in relation to the construction of a public toilet facility in marriage and to refers the project for consideration in the 2022-23 budget development process next house of turn do we have a second uh council robbie casa team would you like to speak to the motion um only to say that um uh the report certainly highlights that uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look forward to seeing the final process in this thanks chancellor cassarabe is the second would you like to add anything to that thank you mr man i would i 'd like to say very simply that the council was on their bus trip came out to mary jig we listened to what you had to say and we 've acted on that tonight thank you uh other counselors any comments you have the right to reply no nothing more to add thanks mr man okay those in favor of motion the motion is passed thank you item 13.2.9 the street tree policy uh responsible officer is the senior coordinator of field services ari cox for demacia who 's joined us now counselors are there any questions on this policy uh i 've just got one question uh harry how are the trees are all these trees deciduous trees or how they what 's the how do these trees determine which which sword we 're using thanks mr mayor yeah there 's a a mix of deciduous based on the location um it 's the main factor that we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um of trees which we 'll treat on a case-by-case basis with the parks and garden supervisor and um and the asset inspector as well just to make sure what we 're putting in place um is suitable for that area um so that yeah there 's a range but typically they 'll be the same type of tree in that area that we 'll plant thanks mr marcie thank you um council has any other questions are you aware of the uh considerable considerable correspondence that 's been coming into council with relationship to um people wanting to put in and see the beautification of the area with deciduous trees to sort of emulate uh bright bright 's view yeah i have seen um a couple of emails regarding that in letters um so i think that um having this in place will definitely help guide that and and um have some framework in place that we can actually move forward with because i think um there 's definitely a bit of work to do to get it up to scratch so yeah council has any other questions do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move the motion that counts that notes the information provided in relation uh sorry that was a public toilet from pacquiao and ahri the council and dorsey updated street street tree policy thank you a second that 's the web uh castle ravi would you like to speak to the motion uh yeah thanks mr may through you um thank you ari um when you came to us and presented this to council at the briefing it was a well set out document um it 's a credit to your work harry that that we 've been able to get this through tonight and uh well done thank you thanks cancer thanks house and robbie um councilwoman no thank you mr man uh any

thank you no thanks miss me thank you councillors those in favor of the motion motion is passed thank you thanks ari thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfaction survey council is there any comments at all on this survey or questions uh castle robbie yeah on page 73 of the survey of the notes in front of us um uh interesting to note that the um overall ratings of maintenance of unsealed roads decisions made in the interest of the community waste management town planning appearance of public areas and le support services have come to the intention and um i just uh it 's a great report i think it 's um indicative of the type of work that the council are doing at the moment i suppose that 's not a question it 's just a something that i 've read in the report thanks chance uh do we have a mover of most of the motion council 10 uh yes mr mayor thank you i 'd like to move the council receive the 2021 local government community satisfaction survey report for mansfield child council and make it publicly available via a council 's website next council turn we have a secondary council robbie casa team would you like to speak to the nation uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um the overall satisfaction was up seven points from the previous year which is a great uh um result an indictment on the um uh the ceo and her team for the job they 've done in particular i 'd like to mention the parks and gardens who have scored a very impressive 82 points for appearance of public areas which you know i 'm sure all the rate payers would agree they the place looks pretty good and um and as the uh the author of this report said it 's really hard to get a score like that but it 's also really hard to maintain it so um just like to congratulate them also areas where there 's been real improvement has been in planning and uh waste management which is good to see um one area i 'd like to comment on which is very low it 's probably one of the i think it 's the lowest score is maintenance of unsealed roads and even though it 's it and it has improved and um and council do acknowledge that and have been and been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years the last two budgets and um i noted that um uh in one of the ceo 's report that um an extra 19 kilometers of unsealed roads were done this year so that was a great event in itself and and hopefully we can move that figure up moving forward because um that sort of infrastructure is the driver of this shire making sure that people have access to get around the place that agriculture is able to function on these roads that in years like this where it gets really wet that we 're it 's not inhibited so overall a very good report next count uh secondary council radio would you like to speak to that i think councillor teams um said everything that i would want to say it 's an excellent report thank you justin other councillors would like to add to that council said uh just to support council attends uh congratulations of the uh the new ceo and and her staff because it really is a reflection of that time so thank you mr mayor next council sudden if there 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sum up no i 've said enough thanks mr mayor uh those in favor of the motion motion is passed i 'd also like to offer my congratulations to the ceo and and all the executive it 's a great result and it 's pretty well across the board um which is excellent it 's a great trend to hopefully pursue from here um so well done uh and i know colleen 's not here tonight but well done to carl and entire team it 's well done item 13.3.2 uh the

responsible officer are there any questions or clarifications required counselor tan uh yeah thanks mr mayor just a um just a question regarding the um the alpine resorts and um uh the capacity um [Music] just the amount of work and the cost uh the cost to the shire in um in um performing these duties um in the alpine resort management area through you mr mayor i think we have a senior coordinator community safety kevin murphy and i 'd like to ask if you 'd like to answer that question thank you madam c acting ceo uh council has been providing services into the mel mountball alpine resorts for the last 50 odd years this agreement and the powers are continuing that current arrangement yeah that 's right so can we just enough sorry for being rude we can see your hand it 's nice that it is yeah can you start again sorry to interrupt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been providing servers into mount baller well prior to the alpine resorts amendment legislation that made it optional for council those agreements have been ongoing um the the council does receive revenue from the provision of those services through the registration fees and there is provision within the draft agreement for council to invoice the resort for any extraordinary costs that we might incur i 'm not sure whether that sufficiently answers councillor tayyin 's query uh yeah partially it does uh thanks um uh mr murphy just uh how much time is spent dealing with the alpine resource what they and yeah what what sort of effort are you up there quite a bit and what 's the main sort of um role up there predominantly the services is in relation to the administration of registration requirements under the food act and public health and well-being act so there are quite a number of registered food premises hotels motels and the like the the club lodges the number of premises is actually increasing with variations to the to the definition of prescribed accommodation so that 's capturing more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are triggering additional requirements and additional effort we tend to be up on the mountain one officer one to two days a week during the snow season rarely for the other periods of the year that service is certainly structured into our current work activities thank you miss smith that 's so well and truly answered my question thanks cancer thanks mr murphy um counselors any other questions do we have a motion council web thanks mr mayor uh the motion as uh being written in the recommendation on tonight 's agenda page 82. thank you uh do we have a second app that 's a

and community recovery resilience advisory committees vcrac recommendation to fund the three proposed projects subject to funding body approval uh the harvest moon event by dela tite winery for fifty thousand dollars upgrades to the jameson memorial hall evacuation center for ten thousand dollars upgrades to the bonnie dune recreation reserve evacuation center for forty thousand dollars and point two right to the funding body seeking approval for the reallocation of funding as outlined in this report thanks council webb do we have a second app council slam do you wish to speak to the motion

excited to see what happens with this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned earlier this is the uh the final recommendation that will come from the um business and community recovery advisory committee uh and uh this has been endorsed by that committee and i 'm happy to second counselor webb 's motion thank you thank you other counselors like a comment there 's no other comment those in favor the motion the motion is passed thank you item 13.3.5 manchester swimming pool end of season report uh again the responsibility officer let 's give any questions or comments counselors guess where case writing thanks mr may got a few questions um i note in the report uh the income for the previous financial year 2020 to 2021 's 94th they are 149 271 with a short for 69 346. there 's been a shortfall in the budget for the last uh three budgets i 'm wondering saskia if you can um enlighten me as to to why that would be or how that 's happened um yes through you mr mayor um unfortunately i actually uh cannot give you an explanation for it it is um being the cost has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't have an answer to why it was not budgeted each year for the last few years because the cost has stayed quite consistent miss alexander can i just ask a question in follow-up to that who is responsible for this budget uh through you mr mayor the um the responsibility for the budget would sit with their respective area um it 's this one sits under the corporate and community services so it would have sat with the previous manager of the area and then the general manager of that area in terms of the responsibility for the budget and ultimately obviously with the ceo so we need to find out why why that 's i noticed it 's noted in the report so we need to find out why that under budgeting has occurred yeah thank you mr mayor we 're happy to take that one on notice and and do a bit more find out a bit more information to see if in terms of how the budget number was derived it was previously a service that was under contract i expect that it has something to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have that information at hand tonight so we 'll have to take that one on notice and get back to you thank you council slade thank you mr mayor there was a report that came to council uh at the end of the 1819 um swimming pool season uh when council made the decision to take over the running of the pool the information that was available to council was very thin in terms of the previous ymca contract and the previous momentum one contract momentum one was a an outsourcing which which fell over when broke um and cancel picked it up cancel did commit additional funds for maintenance that wasn 't undertaken which was the responsibility of the previous contract holders and the council also was responsible for the training of staff particularly well obviously the lifesavers for that and again that was a responsibility of the previous contract holders so i 'm just uh alerting you uh and council laws to the fact that uh if um the current staff uh yes none of them were there uh if you go and hunt out that 1819 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some way uh to answering some of the some of the issues or the questions that are being posed here except the except council said the points there are in the subsequent years the more recent use to that report okay again if you go back and read that report which obviously you you wouldn 't have the 1819 report which was actually delivered to council after the 1920 budget was done and it did recommend within that that amendments needed to be made to the 2021 budget in line with cancelled maintenance and staffing costs casserole yeah i 'd like to ask you a question about page 90 the report pool usage figures um in the report it states that there was approximately um a drop in poor entry numbers by 4800 which is equates to 28 and yet uh in the report it says that there is no decrease in income and it attributes that to a possible increase in swin fees seasons pass passes and group higher fees having used the pool i i didn 't see a increase in in most phase this last year i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report on this pool i 'm very interested in the pool i don 't think we 're going to get another pool for a long time we 've got to make use of what we 've got and i 'd like to see a more detailed report about this pool so i can dig into that i 've got some other questions about why the pool hasn 't got any solar heating why the pool hasn 't got other things so but just getting back to this actual report interesting to to ask you to ask you if i could get a more detailed report please um through you mr bear yes we will try to get as much information as we can we just have been struggling working with the previous contractor because their online systems were not as detailed as we hoped for so we have been digging and working very hard to get as much information but um i will take it back to my team again and we 'll have another look what else we can find and we will look at that report that paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you mr mayor i 'd just like to point out to you councillor ravi that um previous councils uh did fund a new solar blanket for the swimming pool and also funded upwards of one hundred thousand dollars for solar panels for heating as well so um i don 't know maybe you haven 't had a look recently at the solar um upgrades that have been made to the swimming pool but there is solar there thank you councillor slade and i appreciate that councillors um any other comments oh sorry counselor team uh yeah through you mr mayor if i could just ask councillor uh slade news wealth of information on this um the solar panels that were installed on the pool to drive solar heating or perhaps pump usage what sort of um [Music] cost reduction did we receive from installing them and when were they installed uh the cost reduction uh question i can 't answer counselor tian uh but they were installed uh i think it was in the 19 1819 or 1920 budget you 'll have it there in front of you weren 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noting counselor um tn and sladden 's comments on this um it goes back to that my question a request really to have a more comprehensive report on the pool a hot so councillors can understand what 's been going on back there in the past and with it with an idea to what we can do in the future with the pool thank you thank you uh any other questions counselors do we have a move with a notion or do we have a motion council robert yes like to um move the motion that council notes uh the 2020 to 2021 season and

independent directors from one of the terms bruce potgita peter johnston and mo lee ning and my analysis of it is that there is an experienced team of auditors not necessarily orders but with experience in the audit and risk area and i must admit i got a great deal of comfort looking at the analysis that they did and how they operate and so i think from the council point of view it was certainly a an experience for me and a great deal of comfort as i said the municipal sorry the municipal association of victoria has uh hasn 't yet met the northeast local government waste forum

our first meeting on monday of this week uh the implementation plan for the business recovery component and the community recovery component were discussed at the meeting there are two very important uh pieces of information for the public to be aware of and these are there are two funding opportunities the first one is two hundred thousand dollars for community groups throughout the shire who can access uh funding for community events and we do have a relatively short timeline which has been imposed on council by the funding body which is regional development victoria and that expression of interest i understand will be called for if it hasn 't happened today it will be happening very soon and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive uh direct contact and all of cancel socials will also be publicizing that um so we are hoping or we are asking for uh applications to come in uh by the end of january um or even the end of february but um please look out for that uh and get your applications in soon the second one is a an economic um or a stimulus if you like a fund of 100 000 and this is for both um or either business or community groups or it can be a combination of uh to put forward an application for a significant event uh to the tune of one hundred thousand dollars but there is an expectation or there is a requirement that whoever is successful will commit to running that event uh for the subsequent uh two years as well um but again that information uh will be sent out via the business register and through council socials as well um and it has a similar timeline we apologize for the timelines but these timelines have been imposed upon council by the external funding bodies but please look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new year but here 's a wonderful opportunity for both business and community groups to access some funding thank you uh mr mayor thank you councillor sloan and thank you madam ceo for picking me up on that thank you do we have a

moment and we had don 't have a coordinator of plan of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to recruit to it once and we 're recruiting again to try and secure someone into that role so we 've just been down on resourcing internally to to process those applications we do we are quite anxious to get on to this we 've got high volume applications at the moment given the interest in the manswood shire and um so we 're very keen to recruit a planner very good thank you any further questions counselor turn uh through you mr mayor just uh madame ceo i 'd like to just inquire about at what stage is the planning

will develop a policy and have that policy implemented by the first of march 2021. thank you castle webb uh through you mr mayor mr snook um just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time frame um is there any way we can extend that or or put it in a time where traditionally people 's minds aren 't focused on council matters and more focused on their personal lives uh through you mr mayor councillor webb uh i will answer the question in the first instance and then i will pass some of the detail to miss donahey but i think what we 've done um councillor weber 's we have looked at the timeline we have worked backwards we acknowledge the fact that it 's a difficult time to communicate and the strategies we 've developed for that is to ensure we maximize the use of our social media print media advertising and general communication that ms donahue do you want to add to that comment uh thank you mr snook through you mr mayor um yes just to further um clarify that yeah as we 've mentioned the uh policy needs to be endorsed prior to the first of march which requires that it goes to council at the february uh council meeting um so they 're because we couldn 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the first opportunity we have to um provide this to councillors um to endorse it to be released for public consultation so unfortunately we 're limited by this just my clarification is that a a state legislation is that 's fixed in stone is it so that can 't be moved so we have no say in that uh through you mr may yes it 's a requirement um outlined in the local government act right uh any other questions counselors thank you mr no other questions okay do we have a motion for the draft community engagement policy yes mr mayor um i 'd like to move the council endorsed the draft community engagement policy for release for public consultation from the 17th of december 2020 until the 22nd of january 2021. thank you council teaser 10 is there a second of that council web would anyone like to make any further comments that 's the web thank you mr mayor um my only comment would be uh to all those in the community listening that this is a fairly high level policy but uh i think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as part of the local government apologies uh it 's important that we take this seriously and really uh make sure everyone 's aware of it thank you councilwood castle sled ah thanks mr mayor uh ms mcdonough um i 'm assuming that uh this will be well public publicized via cancel 's website and the various socials and that that will commence um shortly uh yes thank you that 's correct um we will endeavor to have a media release um finalised this week we 'll have a consultation page um on council 's have your say platform and we 'll endeavor to get it out as much as we can through social media and um directly to uh council 's databases ratepayers community community groups and business directories thank you very much it 's rather ironic that we have a state government that insists on community engagement policy but then limits the amount of time we can actually uh engage with the community yeah and that comment 's been discussed previously as well cancer slogan thank you thank you uh mr mcdonough um all those in favor motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infrastructure fund um mr snook do you have any comments on that no thank you mr mayor we 'll take that report has read and once again um miss mcdonough is here to assist with any questions the counsellors may have in regard to the report thank you any questions or comment clarification just castle satan you have any thoughts with respect to the outline communities etc uh no mr mayor but i am prepared to move a motion thank you uh the council endorsed the guidelines and assessment process for delivery of the outlying communities infrastructure fund thank you council sudden and your second is castle web any further comment uh yes mr mayor if i may um sorry i was going to say this the mover does need to speak to the most given the opportunity thank you oh it 's just about to do that madam ceo um yes this is uh as a result of uh feedback that the previous council received uh from the previous budget consultation and there was a perception that the outlying communities were being overlooked when it comes to community infrastructure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in the budget and adopted and i thank the community development staff kira and her team uh for developing the assessment guidelines they are pretty straightforward and it is a real opportunity for communities in the outlying areas and that is uh beyond the town the mansfield township boundary to access funding for much needed community infrastructure within their local communities there is no requirement for any matching it 's not like the previous community matching fund obviously any in-kind or cash support that you may have may strengthen your application but that is not required but the the guidelines are pretty uh pretty straightforward and hopefully uh you will not find them onerous thank you mr mayor thank you council suddenly just for further clarification is this sort of fun being in in this sort of nature being done before structures such as this so this is the first first time yeah sorry but i don 't know who you 're addressing the question to mr me uh just just like perhaps mr snook or the ceo sorry probably do you miss the mayor that council slam is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is a new initiative of councils and they have had previously community matching funds and other grant schemes for the community this is the first time council has put in place a significant fund for outlying communities there may be more to add to that thank you the only thing i 'll add madam ceo is that historically council did have what was known as the small towns grant scheme but that was a set amount of money from memory it was about two thousand dollars a year um and that went to the small towns but there were what 's the word difficulties i suppose in that okay so one small town but a small town with numerous community groups where did that two thousand dollars go uh whereas this one um is open to you know the various community groups within those outlying communities and even those places uh such as um max cove or however who would not be considered as a town as such that is they are communities and so they are eligible to apply for that thank you thank you all those in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am 14.3.3 is the community group loan guarantee policy and to the general manager of community corporate services mr steve thank you mr mayor um we 'll take the paper as read and this evening um miss kinnesley manager of business and performance is available to take any questions uh thank you any questions or clarifications required councilweb thank you mr mayor and through you mr mayor um just a clarification matter uh where why has this policy come about is this just a revision and and what was the trigger for uh putting this policy in place so through the american answer that so yes this is just a revision of this policy so all our policies go through a cyclical revision and this one has just come up due this month the original um implication that put the policy into place was a request from a community group um to consider to either guarantee a loan or also auspice arrangements as well so council do have a separate policy that governs auspice arrangements and then this one has been set up to give council a framework to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to guarantee finance thank you ms kennedy and furthermore have we uh used a policy before have we guaranteed many loans in the past through the mayor we 've guaranteed no loans in my time at council which is since 2016. thank you castle uh councillor webb asked my question mr mayor um yes so thanks for clarifying that this is not a statutory requirement that we have such a policy miss that 's correct there 's no statutory requirement um it 's just there so that again so you have a framework to help you make decisions if a request comes in but no not not required by law thank you thank you mrs kennedy um sorry councillor well thank you mr mayor through you um i believe uh ms kinsley is this a loan guarantee to assist community groups that for some other reason or another can 't access any funding any other way threw them there that 's correct yes thank you any other sorry counselor team sorry sorry mr mayor um through you to miss guinness leaders his policy lasts for is its time frame is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year so the policy has a written in review date and i believe without checking that it 'll be four years so we try to make sure that each policy gets reviewed at least once within a council term so four year period however council has the ability to call in any policy for an earlier review so if you wanted to review it in 12 months time you can just call it in and have it reviewed at that time so ms kennedy just how does this reply this when we get loan applications or loan approval approvals if this occurs how 's that reported how does it show up in the accounts so an application would come through to office management and we would address it against the policy assess it against the policy and there all the application criteria are there in the report for you there 's also a bit of a decision tree as well so we would go through that process if it met the requirements within the policy it would then come to council for a decision at a council meeting thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion castle web uh yes thank you mr man i 'd like to put forward the motion that council endorsed the community group loan guarantee policy 2020. and the secondary councillor thank you any more comments from castle webb with respect to the motion i don 't need to speak to the motion thank you mr mayor thank you all those in favor motion is passed thank you on 14.3 14.3.4 the finance report from the 1st of july 2020 to 30th of november 2020. um mr snook thank you mr mayor we 'll take the financial report for the period as read and again miss kinsley is here to support with any questions the counsellors may have counsellors any questions or clarifications required miss kinsley i i have one sorry councilwoman the 18 30 000 emergency emergency management uh bushfire recovery grant have we actually received that that 's been received has it that 's correct we have received some funds um so i think there 's two grants um one of them we 've received partial funding and i think we 've received all of the other one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is this some of the funny that goes into the um the bushfire community recovery that 's that 's correct that 's exactly right so that 's the money that the i forget the name of the committee i 'm sorry the bushfire advisory recovery committee um that 's the money that they are deliberating around the best way to utilize it and all that is that 830 it 's two grants is it or one grand or how many grants there are two grants um and the totals escape me at the minute and the ceo might know them off the top of their head i think there 's a six and a two that i can 't remember one is just over six hundred thousand and the other is a two hundred hundred thousand dollar grant six hundred thousand and two hundred thousand so where 's the other thirty thousand for that come from it might be six thirty i 'm not quite sure exactly it 's come back to me now that you 've said it yeah is that with gst or no i don 't believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 660 and 200 000. um and can i see a copy of the terms of those grants at some stage please absolutely through you um to you mr mayor you 've said you 've have asked for that before and we are getting that information thank you thank you um any other questions sorry guess arabi uh thank you through you mr mayor to ms kinsley um the 41 000 economic development um tourism and events uh is in says the event was events postponed due to covert which uh mandy could you explain which events they were placed through the mayor i actually think councillor slatter will know that better than i that was a council decision to delay particular events okay so this has been discussed by the uh the business and community recovery advisory committee and uh they are the lake eldon festival which will take place on the 20th of february and tiger which will take place on the help me out somebody fifth of february or something that 's when it 's scheduled for a rescheduled four somewhere around there yeah it 's earlier probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'm pretty sure yep yep so it 's those two uh councillor robbie thank you bro castle webb thank you mr mayor um and through you mr mayor um just two t 's out regarding the dashboard the capital expenditure very much well under um expenditure budget year to date just a bit of background on that um as to where the i guess the bottleneck is on that on that expenditure there through you mr meow pass over to the general manager infrastructure and planning ms alexander to to provide council with an overview of that area thank you thank you through you mr mayor i 'm happy to do so the main main issue there has been resourcing in the infrastructure area but also timing of some of the grant funded projects in terms of when council receives the invoices so in relation to the resourcing issue that has been addressed and the capital works team have been appointed and they are working on it working actively and we 'll be having uh some pro some uh reports coming up to council in january for award of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we will be looking to catch it up very good thank you any further questions counselor team uh yeah mr mayor through you um i just got a question of ms guinnessly regarding the work working capital ratio which is um obviously looking really good uh it says here a working capital ratio of one to one is considered healthy or one percent is that where assets equal liabilities or am i just misreading that that 's right so 100 one-to-one so it 's current assets and current liabilities and the definition of current is anything convertible to cash within a 12-month period it tends to be pretty much cash and just accounts payable accounts receivable so if you have full coverage so you have enough in your current assets to fully cover your current liabilities that 's considered a healthy balance and at the moment we have we can cover it eight times over thank you so um miss kinsley part of the reason for that is it is due is it to lots of grant funding arriving earlier than expected is that part of the reason um there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that our cash balances are higher than we would anticipate um that 's probably the major factor here but yes also receiving grant funding ahead of budget would impact that as well yeah the reason i was asked about the grant fund was is that normal for the grants to arrive earlier than expected is that the government getting money out the door so to speak or is is that just normal is that normal that we get get money earlier than expected yeah look it can do and so when we set the budget oftentimes we 're anticipating getting grant funding and so budgeting is a little bit of guesswork in terms of what time of year we think that we might actually get access to that money and then once we actually secure that grant funding sometimes those milestones can shift and therefore they don 't specifically match the timing within the budget but also what you just referred to they 're oftentimes towards the end of a financial year we do tend to get some funding come our way and a good example of that is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been getting them 50 of those early in june instead of in the july august timing so yes we are at the whims of the state and federal budgets as well thank you because there 's any other questions clarification the do we have a motion for the finance report councilweb thank you mr mayor uh i have a motion that council receives a year-to-date finance report for the period first july 2020 to 30th of november 2020. thank you a second up castle sladen thank you casa webb would you like to speak to that any further uh just like that it is a quite a detailed report and very clear and easy to understand and uh good to have that transparency there for the community to to look at thank you any other any further comments uh all those in favor of the motion the motion 's passed thank you i 'm 14.3.5 again part of the community corporate services directorate uh is the name of the sporting feature that our number featured being the sporting precinct um mr snook uh thank you mr mayor um and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the officer supporting uh is mischievously uh again uh available for any questions are there any questions or clarification counselors council slade would you like to um to tell some of the history relating to this uh mr mayor uh perhaps if i uh move a motion first so we can debate it sure please do oh sorry is it no other questions of counsel mr snook first uh thank you mr mayor um i 'd like to move the council resolve to name the new dual court indoor multi-use sports stadium and the associated outdoor courts in mansfield the alex pullen stadium resolve the name to name the turf playing fields at the end of view street mansfield as college park lodge both names with geographic names victoria to be approved by the registrar gazetted and added to vic names issue a public notice to announce the new feature names once they have been gazetted investigate the erection of appropriate signage at both sites and finally to investigate incorporating a naming ceremony as part of the official stadium opening event when it occurs in 2021. thank you mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rabie thank you castle sladen would you like to talk to the motion thank you mr mayor um this project goes back to february of this year where council the previous council initiated a consultation process to name uh the stadium and the um and the precinct uh up at um secondary college uh at the end of uh view street um so a have your say um process on the website was conducted uh that began uh in memory from um yeah from february through to the end of march or middle of march uh as a result of that i think there were about 50 odd names and some of them were odd names were put forward and uh out of that a short list of three names which were college park sports precinct and community sports ground or community sports precinct came forward a paper came to the previous council in august um no no no sorry after that that then those three names went out again and that was conducted from uh for the month of july and as a result of that report came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or just on 73 of people favored college park as the preferred name unfortunately in the interim we had the tragic loss of uh alex chumpy pullen who we all know is a local legend and at the um at that meeting at that august meeting council resolved to go back out consult with the pull and family to acknowledge alex 's name and to see if they would be agreeable to name the stadium after alex was a very sensitive time obviously but um the thankfully the pull and family gave it its full support therefore it went back out to the community but what went out to the community was in two separate um questions and one was do you support the naming of the stadium after chumpy and the um second part was the playing fields to be named college park now the chumpy uh that the alex pullen stadium received a resounding yes um however ironically college park um i think about 60 percent of the people said no um which was odd given the first round of consultation that was the preferred name i suspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i suspect that uh people may have been confused between college park and the alex pullen stadium and they were saying no to the stadium being called college park but that 's just my reading of it mr mayor i don 't know but um this is a process that has been going on for some time as i say since february um given that sometime in 2021 we will be having the official opening and in order to you know do the background work and discuss signage etc appropriate stage i do put forward the motion that we do move on with this mr mayor thanks council satan for that for that summary thank you uh councillor you would you like as a second would you like to speak at all i only respect the fact that um chumpy 's parents and his grandfather and himself were very dear friends of mine and i 'd like to extend our full sympathy on behalf of all the councillors and i am so glad that um that mansfield 's got behind this and and uh honored his name he went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow the great sportsman and uh and a musician as well so um i 'm delighted to to support um councillor sladden in seconding this this um this recommendation mr mayor thank you thank you councillor rabbi council son thank you mr mayor i i just wanted to add and acknowledge um uh the madam ceo ms konrick and the former mayor uh councillor mark atlee um with the sensitive approach that they took in discussing this with the um the pull and family i do know that the pullman family were very appreciative of the way that that was handled so i just like to acknowledge um that thank you mr mayor thank you council satan thank you um all those in favor of the motion the motion is passed thank you item 15 is the assemblies of councillors do we have a motion for the assemblies of councils please that 's the web yeah mr mayor uh a motion that council receives a note the assembly of counsellors report for the period 12th

meeting to members of the public council has the power to close its meeting to the public in certain circumstances pursuant to the provisions of section 66 to the local government act 2020. the circumstances where a meeting can be closed to the public are the meeting is to consider confidential information or these security reasons or c is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an orderly manner the definition of confidential information is provided in section 31 of the local government act do we have a motion for the closing of the meeting to the members of the public thank you council assad a secretary councillor turn thank you uh in the motion please cancel the slide i think you 're on yep no it 's all right uh okay whatever it says on page 36 and that is that the meeting be closed to members of the public under section 662 a of the local government act 2020 to consider confidential information as defined by section 3 1 of the local government act 2020 as canceled business information being information that would prejudice the council 's position in commercial negotiations if prematurely released i think your counselor said which leads into which seems a bit odd is there something missing from that one sorry this is um just a clarification uh madam ceo do we close the meeting at this point we do once council votes on on that um council sladden through you mr mayor council slander is questioning whether the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got the act in front of me but um i think council business information covers it the rest of that sentence might be a bit um a bit broad for the items under consideration but correct because it 's not a commercial in confidence decision no okay that 's just a query but i 'll still put the motion forward thank you thanks council mr may i will refer to the coordinated governance and risk um who has the act probably right in front of her to to talk about the relevant section thank you thank you i was just going to confirm um kaylene 's comments that it 's probably just the best fit council sudden in this case so as opposed to the other options that are available under the definition of confidential information and kayleen is right that council business information is what we decided was the best fit for this item um uh all those in favor emotions passed just one moment and we 'll close confidential just for the public we will go offline at the moment and be back as soon as this matter is dealt with thank you foreign,"(-37.053645, 146.0869862)"

certain era certainly i think the support of the by fast is most important i think we don 't want three doubles and other trucks rumbling through the town i think it 's just a disaster so very briefly i support that and support the loan that you 're going to get to have that completed i think it 's pretty visionary to do that and it will be important for future generations um particularly good at times of low interest rates and i probably support the rate differential especially in the farming area i think it 's most important that farmers are able to live on well produce on productive and good farming land and certain areas of the state farmers have really been uh having to sell their farms because the rates are so high in areas around video uh enormous pressure on farmers there you know you hit a 50 and 60 thousand dollar rate build which i think is just guy walking anyway i 'll congratulate the show on that people get that vision of agriculture and good farming land and just briefly supporting the planning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convenient restaurants out of this town i think they 're a real life they 're just so many things well they 're very little in favor of um i strongly support that heritage facility at the stadium precinct and couldn 't see um the chiron uh looking for grants there i heard them to keep that up and the other thing is rural roads victoria i think and i i know the mayor has signed a letter with the vanilla man on it 's very dangerous in parts and if you watch two blue doubles going either way they 're just about touching mirrors and it needs a one medium pavement petersburg all labour from nashville and our mutt there are a future interesting on the midland island um and the other two areas are icy upgrades people would come to me and say they find it a bit difficult to navigate the trial website and the other thing about the council well where i would be um thank you thank you very much thanks man before i hand over the counselors questions sorry tony i should have warned you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at two minutes every two minutes part of the advantage thank you jackson second question [Music] thank you for coming good night at two minutes and then the developed given that most of us have read uh your report your submission problems it 's a lot longer than what i 'm going to say probably it 's more reading the topics that i upset maybe this new painting councils thank you so much really the cause for paint air being managed within the shire and not outsourced in the 2 2016 census bouncing population is one of the oldest in the state i don 't see that changing i don 't see millions of young people moving in the mansfield national population is 30.3 over the age of 60. the big state average is 22 percent across australia 24 so we 're way ahead of third national budget out of its hundred dollar circle spend on youth family and aged care it 's four dollars 55 out of everything it spends on parks and government parks and gardens is 5.84 so flowers and trees are more important thing aged care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of that in advanced philanthropy what is the show are planning do they know how many residents are on ndis who are on my airplane what is council budget for my aged care services and who are the external providers here if any what servers do that provided outside of the town of master given that 50 percent of the population have been outside of manchester what importance says the shy updates on community center in the future workforce in the aged care business attendees at the recent aged care focus group in bonny dern said that they have little trust and view of suspicion they are self-sorting of those activities to a prop for profit organization they want the services to be local our people our care and establishment of the sound system allows people to stay in their own homes is not only practical but morally correct in the case of boosted employment investment in the caring sector also embedded movements on women 's economic security with workforce that are around 80 percent by fema it need not be across centre to the shire national is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people are going to leave there will be grains of bullying and no man 's skill looked around any of it given that there is moving to green change will mansfield 2040 further consider the occasions the emerging narrative to establish okay we 're looking for solutions that are over mainly practical or not sophisticated let 's move on now to understanding outline there is over 50 percent of child population with outside mansport current point is still not recognized as an area it should be we have post boxes of peppermint but making green has a postcode that has no problem the 50 000 budget is totally unrealistic it can support the services and lifestyle that the majority of the shires residents require budget needs to be rebuilt and greater evidence is given to our parking airports the proposed 1.5 million spend on the tourist station could be better spent on facilities in all towns and region finally let 's review the locations of emergency services particularly our area that takes over 40 minutes for fire station the fire truck to get the body done not good enough after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the buyer 's service and bleeding maybe they should be putting pressure back on to see if they repeat their attitudes is birding with golden murray water improving its expression of interest into land at mitchell bay we support the lake hilton master plan overall my support is planned budget that moved the reviser the required ranking increase is carried through that 's the 1.5 and that means 30 dollars in capital property yeah that 's two bottles of wine so it 's hard packed cigarettes and an improved partnership used for the betterment of society to improve health and welfare services and i don 't you don 't have people who need help involved there 's a lot of people in our car that believe and a much expanded role in increasing the services to the majority of friends living in outlying communities i 'll give you a couple of other things to read from here there 's one from hugh mckay who i worked with the australian foremost futurist and general clinton commentator he helped us run a chain management program that possibly back in the late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's an article today from the age it 's very relevant to health services yeah yeah i think so tom yeah well it 's just what 's the title of the article sorry what 's the title of the article yes in the paper yeah the bright young things have lost interest but the normal state on one of the budget 's very big deals and it is all about aged care and it you know it 's an area that possibly we 're going to need to increase more employment in australia with the right people you need the right people to believe this yeah at 30 to me paying extra in rates it 's incidental i still stopped back at the cigarettes it 's 55 30. okay okay that 's that that 's an average one it would be more for farmers i don 't know probably could redirect your attention to the fact that farmers are paying far from that but they 're possibly the only people in the shower who are [Music] 20 years ago we 're not paying 2 000 at the moment so if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe it or not we survive very well yeah um thanks for your presentation tom good i 'm just getting back to your person i guess your mind wanted the idea of spirit you expressed concern that you [Music] yeah yeah so i think it 's very important and as you know the shire were about to undertake an eye for the world who started the next peer review and that 's one of the highest priorities that was pulled forward to the consultants when they uh i think those consultants were quite amazed with the response they got i 'll be at a very small group of people very good but yeah the video is totaled we need it we don 't want to involve faithful paid people there 's not a lot of trust in private cars actually in any organization sorry this opinion today people it talks about um yeah some of the things that can happen thanks for your stupid i 'll give you that 's fine come back behalf of the dba thanks thank you thank you the zero rate increased as the proposed stance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree with this decision an increased rate of 1 1.5 is long sleeve the average rate increase of a 1.5 uh percent rate investor would be 24 per average problem and then and our members feel that that increased friendly shy will be better utilized by the shire to invest in services the results of not increasing the rates by the 1.5 indicates roughly 890 thousand dollars loss of revenue and annual basis which leads to 2.2 million but over a 10-year broadcast the shine capability to maintain living standards which can impact on future land value business developments employment within australia the shines the proposed zero percent rate increase concern with gamers is using the leadership of the future strategies in the shop around these bands and the infrastructure investment in the development of the child concerns have always been also being raised in rating strategy with our survey responses from the evidence indicating that 70 percent are against the change in this proposed to proposing the budget the greater burden will be based on the commercial properties and also residential the view for the increasing discount um increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sector should be reconsidered and the back that economy uh so fairly concerned he 's raised around differential brain strategy in the fact that there is a request for the review of um areas particularly in around uh accommodation businesses airbnb supply in the town and also commercial lifestyle businesses gyms making sure that those that are operating the presidential premises contributing to the overall uh training the community benefits free rating 70 percent of members responses requests no change to the differential rating strategy um finally the heavy vehicle alternatively grown and its completion concern was raised around the shines inability to complete the heavy vehicle alternative road in full particular 400 meters of gravel road on this lane and with an ask whether or not this is a consequence of the proposed zero percent rating press and so also is and then this could lead to greater jet funding and with the view that if a rate increase was obtained it would assist in actually covering those the position is not members are not indicating not to do the project they actually aren 't in support of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funded and done involved um our submission of our members we asked the councillors to reconsider the zero percent rate increase proposal and not adopt changes in the rating uh differential strategy outlining the proposed budget and revitalization on this to the community for the interests of the community thank you on behalf of our members from that district business association and the time to present submission thank you for your admissions thanks thank you yes uh no questions how many members have you got family members are just shy 100. and how many um responded to yourself uh on numbers and um and how did you come to the conclusion that council is not going to um under the project heavy here will bypass can even come to the conclusion that we weren 't going through the whole um by responses i received by the measurement thank you okay thanks thank you what um yeah yeah i 'm just wondering um when you contacted your members with uh for this survey what information other information could you supply them with for them to be able to come to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate increase we have provided a paper to our members on the current budget proposal um but ultimately the disservice wood paper is provided so that those responses are coming in private providing them okay but just just wondering that um that paper that you did put out to your members did it did it include the table of 4.1.1 c of the rate increases in the shire process for each category uh to be honest i can 't give you an answer no i 'm not sure yeah so you 're talking about terms or even just percentage budget proposed budget that was provided yes okay so is it that time well i don 't know exactly the presents i wouldn 't don 't know if i need to confidently say thanks to sure tools here no worries yeah yeah but just and just one more where 's question two in your submission uh the 70 of the rate rise range from 1 to 1.5 percent i 'm a bit confused where the 70 percent were uh individuals uh the respondents whoever okay that 's 70 percent of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responses to the survey yes okay so that would have been out of the 60 that were against the proposed rate decrease in the question one that 'd be right so it 'd be seventy percent sixty percent that 'll be correct yeah okay that 's fine thank you is there any reason why you didn 't put the document that you presented to the uh members of the nba it 's part of its initiatives but really quickly knowing how to submission was just a one page it 's a survey okay now um where we submitted endeavour just sitting through the portal uh was a lodge for important uh that was the intention um the entire um you know paper so whether it was a formatting issue submission my understanding was that what was lodged in the submission was the actual are you able to send absolutely because it made it hard to work out where you 're coming from we just saw the survey results right but for me you received survivor survey not just a survey result one page which has got a question one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it through that 's all right all right i 'll get goodbye um yeah good thank you thank you okay no more questions yes thanks thank you very good thank you all right elf last speaker is will you block us thanks well it 's [Music] into the way the budget experience so there are big changes happening in society population movement from nowhere and housing which we 're ready to increase from purchase prices today we 've got laboratories especially small business as economically disadvantaged residency they can 't afford to live here or having presidential services so that people who are most at risk their young and disabled patients and single women um these changes are caused by macroeconomic factors beyond council control so the council might be able to control those things better the services that i worry about are um did similar to financial disability that 's been looked into before it 's not going to work to privatize it so you 're good to see what the outcome of new services which always come under scrutiny with the budget stretch small towns projects for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's a lot so if you look at taxation in australia that 's instead of figures of 2009 and 20. uh it 's almost all the federal estate with lga has been on investment percentage about four percent uh so any movement in local rates is actually meaningless in terms of taxation advice and if you actually look at the rise over the last five years you can see that most of them are missing what i 've said and it 's the same uh so really movement in in in open government rates see valuing local government i mean you know really what happened in the state budget last week it 's going to have a much bigger impact on bottom line we shouldn 't devalue local government in favor of the state and federal government because our job is keeping local government strong right so the micro economic data show similar story and synthetic action has been the lowest product so no logic can make you need to know if you just have the next type of science so our rates are lower than neighboring shires with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next fight and you can hear the rural cities they 're very well and you can see the rationale for them actually in one slide now you might think that that 's what might be said that that 's because of highlanders the facts actually don 't support that for you whatever it is so average rate per property assessment and this is where the you know between the 25 dollars comes from the average sort of rate in mansfield 's 1500 so 1.5 and that is about twenty two dollars but you see that the average rate per property assessment is much higher so you know benchmark we 're not benchmarking with other shots we 're falling behind and there 's actually no logic to it so come on then move to the next slide so and you see beside the world cities we 're even further behind we are further behind and we 're going to fall behind if you do what you say you 're going to do you know it 's phrased to be honest it 's close so let 's just have the next slide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure on council services failure to maintain a revenue base pressure on future budgets and this will compromise future council not just this council but councils in the future because that those compounding things into two million dollars and five years are going to get worse and worse as time goes on if you don 't move by 1.5 now and the macroeconomic and microeconomic analysis just perform just show there 's no actual rationale for doing them and then that 's just a funny thing about the commercial that 's i don 't really have a problem the size of benchmark differentials still out of showers i think they 've been doing extremely fine um so freezing rates may seem popular it 's not popular it 's it 's three to three to one against these plural but um the macron micronic economic analysis shows the rate freeze is structured in the budget there 's no underpinning economic logic it doesn 't help an immediate meeting target in any meaningful way and the analysis of social trends indicates freezing rates will lead to future services to vulnerable sessions about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's where the stresses and the stress is in the commercial center so i don 't just don 't follow the budget from that point you know i support the overall mention of the the rate for instance so the groups i 'm worried about is budget impacting the future of the elderly disabled infancy in women disabled to some extent are covered now by ndis from the outer groups in the supper and are worried about future council 's ability to continue to fulfill their social contract which is not my social contract so that 's there 's my opinion about it 's the same you know not moving towards what other size you 're doing just doesn 't make sense we 're going to fall behind um oh no no no i 've only won this by mistake actually but i have had my vaccination and that 's the presentation thanks for your letter as well really well letter very clear no no no thanks yeah thanks understand thanks thank you um i think there 's no more deportations i 'd like to do is move to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibition of budgets that sorry consideration submission proposed budget 21.2 provided revenue and 181.5 yeah yes mr b thanks i 'd like to move that the special committee of the council advising all councillors receive and consider submissions to most budget 2021-22 and proposed revenue and rating plan 2021 to 25. i 'm not sure about the world more though i think bar one he probably perhaps comprising four councils the special committee actually comprises all councils so maybe just remove comprising all counselors it 's not necessary that the special committee in the council will receive and see them [Music] moving the motion i would just advise that comprising all counsellors is removed no yeah that 's there is a recognition okay i 'll read the recommendation again the special committee of council received and considered submissions to the proposed budget of 2021-22 and proposed forever newman racing plan 20 21 25. uh do you think i 'd like to spend information um just really interesting reading a lot of these submissions um very much a division around a couple of 10 topics being the zero accelerating increase uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i mentioned in our meeting when we sent this out for the public comment i suppose my my surprise that there weren 't more submissions in the amount of work that uh councils and lots of putting this out into the community i was um i was surprised that there were fewer than i when i thought i thought you know having said that i am thankful but people would have given the submissions stand by them and some of them become suspected um emotional the last item on the agenda is a community under the community corporate services directorate uh construction submissions for the council and mayor allowances according to our responsible officer he 's away from government to government 's risk for sugar cane should we have any questions or comments on deciding uh just one comment and i guess that 's what i 'm stating in the paper that says there was only one submission received and i 'm not sure who it looks from but i will read it out it says admirable of the councillors to keep their remuneration at last year 's rate in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done much appreciated that would be my only comment sorry did you hear that yeah i suggest you get microphone sorry there was one submission received for the consideration of countable and mayoral allowances and that submission read admiral of the councillors to keep their remuneration at last year 's rate in line with keeping to their zero percent rate rise well then and much appreciate i 'm not sure who wrote that submission thanks chancellor hi councillors do we have a motion thanks for subscribing um uh on that note moving is close short and sweet thank you very much guys for coming in routine uh taking your time to do that it 's much appreciated always good to hear all sorts of views on feedback so thank you very much um thank you very much good afternoon,"(-37.053645, 146.0869862)"

business is fine except in cash and there are no guidelines restricting cash payment the response to mr bennett 's question is that the resource recovery facility has been operating more smoothly since becoming cashless and staff are finding transactions easy to track and manage especially for record-keeping purposes in addition to this banking of cash on a daily basis posed a problem to staff having to physically get the cash to the bank the option of having cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and armed robbery as well as a result of the code of 19 pandemic the community is moving towards cashless society as a whole council is trying to remain cashless across the organisation wherever possible also other resource recovery centers in the surrounding areas for example vanilla are also card only signage our resource recovery center needs an update to reflect the payment terms and this is currently being priced up at the moment hopefully mr bennett that answers the question tonight for which we thank you officer reports i 'm 13 the chief executive officers report are there any questions or comments on this report please counselors yeah thanks mr mayor and uh fellow councillors and i 'd like to bring your attention to uh item five building services i 'm delighted to see that we 're out stripping last year on april this year total 57 million eight hundred and fourteen thousand six hundred and ninety dollars worth of building permits lodged and at the same time last year was 53 million 982 505 so we 're up 3.8 million on that um it 's delightful to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our shire building and the permits lodged um i 'd also like to um on this occasion i see that the permits uh that have been issued it 's really reflective of the well-run building uh sorry um planning department that we have now mr mayor that um the graphs are looking very very good and i 'd like to have a shout out to to those council officers and the ceo of course thank you thanks councilor i 'd also like to endorse that comment as well it 's been a major focus of the ceo and uh executive team so well done that 's a significant change thank you is there any other comments at all on the ceo 's report uh yes mr mayor just on the customer service [Music] management system and i noticed that the majority of the requests that uh with the local laws 41 of them and the majority of those were for uh barking dogs and um i just thought it was probably a good time to note that um that the dog training school um who are looking for another home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're really pushing hard to find them one because we obviously need um a lot of dogs educated in this shire so uh that 's um that 's yeah so hopefully that 'll go smoothly and well done to the team who are handling that your counselor turn i 'd like to um ask a question also of uh exec executive on the uh just the capital works if you look at the capital works of what 's budgeted and what 's forecast there 's significant gaps um and i think there 's only two months left in the year i 'd just like to get a view from the executive about are we going to be able to achieve the forecast figures that are there or is the gaps are the gaps too big thank you mr mayor i 'll pass over to our general manager of infrastructure and planning ms alexander to answer that question thank you thank you mr mayor um i think we 've also got our manager kind of works online but just to give a brief overview yes we are um with the exception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously we haven 't yet was grant dependent and we haven 't yet received grant funding for that so obviously uh that one will not be proceeding until you know we are successful but um in the dual court stadium we 're currently waiting on some invoicing from the victorian school building authority um that 's why we 're not seeing that expenditure come through having said that it is really well on track and the evidence is there for everyone to see in terms of our program more broadly things are progressing well um there will be some very big invoices coming through in the next couple of months um and we are pretty much on track to finish the bulk of the program albeit it will be tight towards the end of the financial year in terms of the forecasting there 's a i guess a couple of things we need to tidy up in the report which we 'll do for next month um with splitting the actual expenditure between the view street car park the view street roadworks and the roundabouts so just to reflect the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the moment the actuals are all against one line thanks uh chris alexander thank you very much um one other question uh is look at those budgets is there any areas there that you think we 're dramatically going to undershoot as we had good problem to have in some ways but where do you think uh we 're not going to achieve uh the team have made some really good savings um one of the savings is against the botanic park toilets um that one 's coming well under budget um and uh they 're about to get started on that work very shortly um that one is going to be pretty tight for end of financial year it might um tail over into the first week or so of july but we 've got a tight program to get that done uh the other big savings as council is already aware are to do with the view street project there 's certainly some significant savings made there i think they 're probably the main ones the kerbin gutter works uh they 're currently evaluating a tinder on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather dependent we are going into a wetter part of the year so um i think if there 's one that 's probably looking um and you know tight at this stage it 's it would be that in the footpaths but we 'll be doing our best to try and get the bulk of the work that was planned for this year done before the end of financial year so a great effort from the team and getting through that program of works in the time that they have thanks mrs alexander is there any other questions counselors uh yes mr may i just have one question in relation to bridge renewal for miss alexander the budget for the bridge renewals is that budget that is forecast solely now for the dead horse lane bridge and what was the nature of the repair there ah the nature of the repair at dead horse lane was um just for some epoxy sealing of cracks there were shrinking cracks in the in the structure there um so that was just in order to maintain the longevity of that bridge to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popping up at a future date um and there were some further works planned at a couple of other bridges donaldson 's road bridge and also the i think it was the ghoulies bridge um removal of some debris in the waterway there okay thank you yeah are there any further questions counselors okay if there 's no more questions do we have a motion regarding the chief executive officer 's report please cancel yeah thanks mr mayor um the motion is that council receive and note the chief executive officers report for the period of the 21st of april 2021 to the 10th of may 2021 do we have a second please cancel the turn those in favour of the motion the motion is carried thank you item 13.2 falls under the area of infrastructure and planning in regards to the c45 stockman 's rise rezoning application do we have any questions or comments on this item please um casarabi yeah mr um may um the plan on 13.2.1 um i 'm assuming is a a plan that 's been given to council the consideration for this rezoning i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended um [Music] uh subdivision plan or or will that change through you mr mayor i 'll direct that question to the general managing infrastructure planning who may direct the traffic to council 's planning man environment manager ms kane crane who 's is on the line but hasn 't got her video showing at the moment thank you yeah she is yes i i certainly will through you mr merrill i 'll direct that question to melissa crane thank you uh through you mr mayor the um proposed plan of subdivision that 's provided in the report has just been submitted with the application for rezoning they will still need to go through the permit process to obtain a development permit itself where we will work fairly closely with them on micrositing particularly with some of the veg that 's on there to try and save somewhere we can they have already been offset which is detailed in the report um but we have spoken with the applicant and there is some there is always some room to move with the final layout of the design um with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh thank you melissa crane thanks for that thank you are there any other questions councillors uh miss crime what 's the uh timing for this how long does it take these applications to go through so um through you mr mayor once we lodge the request to prepare the amendment with the um department of environment land water and planning it gets submitted electronically they get a few weeks to accept it or refuse it they generally would let us know if there was a problem um and we would then have to prepare it for exhibition go through an exhibition process back through to the minister there 's quite a lot of steps in the process but generally it takes a good six to eight months from when it 's lodged with the original amendment tracking system through to getting to a point where it comes back to council for an adoption once it 's adopted by council it goes back to the minister for get gazetto into the planning scheme right so it 's a reasonably long process yes it is it 's not going to solve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay um if there 's no other questions counselors do we have a motion council web thanks mr mayor uh the motion being as written uh the recommendation as written in the agenda uh points one two and three there uh that we will uh request under section eight eight a two and three of the planning and environment act 1987 that the minister for planning authorized mansfield chart council to prepare amendment c-45 to the mansfield planning scheme point two to notify the minister of planning that when it exhibits amendment c-45 mansfield council intends to give full notification of the amendment under section 19 of the planning and environment act 1987 for a minimum statutory exhibition period of one month and point three when authorised by the minister of planning exhibit amendment c-45 to the massive planning scheme under section 19 of the planning and environment act 1987. thank you councilweb do we have a second councillor tan here cancer where

development of the land for a dwelling association axis way in the farming zone a lot less than 40 hectares construction of a building in significant landscape overlay schedule one we have two representations here um first one is mr chuck walk thanks mr merrill just let chuck in now and mr mayor just to remind councillors that mrs kane will will put the timer on for the three years thank you thank you just to walk you there yes i am i 'll just mute the other feed can you see me no i can 't see you we can hear you okay what 's happening where 's the video how about that there there we go now yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um just a bit of housekeeping is to walk the uh uh we have to limit you to three minutes so if you could be as concise as possible and any questions that the councils will ask they 'll ask you at the end of the three minutes that 's fine thank you mr mayor i 'm trying to limit it to two minutes so we 'll see how we go that 's well done thank you mr mayor councils and council officers for the opportunity to speak to this application and respond to the officer 's report sally and i own the property southeast of the applicant 's land adjoining ford creek uh we 've lived here since uh 2017 2014 in fact given we 've previously provided all councillors without comprehensive documentation representation brief having read the officers report in detail we agree with their assessment and are pleased to see the recommendation does not seek to support the application in its current form we do however feel that the grounds of refusal have not addressed other concerns raised in the report itself the decision guidelines under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drafted and adopted by locally by council in recognition of the significance of local and regional landscape character and the importance of citing development to minimise visual impact we believe it is important that councils consider adding the addition of a fifth ground of refusal responding to the concerns raised in the officers report relating to non-compliance of built form on a ridgeline the fifth ground of refusal aligns with concerns raised in the report relating to the protection of the visually exposed bridge line on which the applicant 's proposed dwelling is located we can firmly have corresponded and met with the applicants read this application we have discussed with the applicants our primary concern of the visual dominance of the dwelling on the ridgeline we note the dwelling location in the final amended application remains unchanged thus our request to add a fifth ground for refusal i commend council officers to their attention to detail in the report and again thank you for this opportunity to speak thank you um you 're right you 're about two minutes well done um that was very concise and to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah mr mayor uh through you to um the manager for planning and environment um sorry um through you mr mayor the questions are only to miss the walk at this point um questions will be need to go later to the offices thank you thank you yeah sorry counselor 10 um no no i i don 't have a question for mr walk thank you but i 'll be yeah interested for a response from screen when the appropriate time 's there thank you council team is there any other questions or mr walk thanks mr wolf for your time there i think we very clearly understand your points so thank you very much for for coming thank you and thank you for your attention thank you uh we have another representation from mr robert graves just joining now yeah we have another hello robert you there yes i am here uh we can hear you but we can 't see you i 'm just hanging on a moment i 'll see what i can do with that um start video now you should be able to see me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on um just a couple of housekeeping it 's we limit the presentation to three minutes uh and then the counselors will ask any questions they have at the end of that presentations so thanks for coming along and over to you thank you councillors good evening um i 'm the owner of the land with my wife um we believe that the recommendation from the planning department is not consistent with recent decisions on neighbouring properties within farming zone nor within the history of the area the report claims that a house on the land will increase land value expectations the existing approvals for houses on 17 nearby and adjacent parcels have already done this including a two million dollar house at 382-mah battery road and so land values are already high the report implies that the parcel is an isolated small parcel it 's not the parcel in question is one of only two parcels out of 19 under 40 hectares in farming zone in the immediate area mount battery road and graves road without a house there are two farms larger than 40 hectares on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are five significantly smaller farms while under 40 hectares all the 12 nearby rural living blocks have houses there are houses all along the nearby section of graves road all on land parcels smaller than the subject parcel and all in farming zone all except one of these houses have been constructed over the last 45 years there are no substantial farms further out before ferts ford 's creek the parcel in question was part of the 1889 subdivision of the mount battery estate and is one of a small number of a number of small parcels along that battery road and graves road that were created at the time and has not been subdivided since until recently the mansfield planning scheme reflected that the construction of houses on original subdivision parcels such as these should be allowed this has been the practice of council in the last 12 years four houses have been approved and constructed on these original subdivision parcels of land all in farming zone and all on smaller parcels than the subject land and less than 40 hectares 67 75 and 123 graves road and 262 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the report also seems to involve the council in determining how a farmer should run his or her farm and assessing whether a farmer needs to live near his breeding herd the farm plan put forward has been expertly developed and the floyd criticism from the planners is that in their opinion there 's no need to live on a farm to breed livestock my experience is that if you have carving cows you need to be able to check on them at all hours this is not compatible with living away from the farm the council does not seem to have been restricted with any of the surrounding household approvals none of these properties seem to be practicing agriculture in the more involved way that is proposed in the farm plan associated with the application the only one that has a similar intensity undertakes horse breeding it strains credibility that puts a house on the two remaining blocks it 's not one of the two remaining blocks it 's not within the character of the area all on an unnecessarily fragment farming land given what has already occurred the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i humbly request that the council overruled the recommendations of the planning department but instead be consistent with the previous approvals subject issued subject to normal conditions without restrictions type of famine as the council has done on all the surrounding parcels less than 40 hectares in size thank you thank you mr gross um councillors do you have any questions cancer rabbi yeah through you mr mayor um robert uh thanks for coming in this evening on the um on the plan that i 've got in front of me figure one are you at uh a or b uh wait uh thank you councillor robbie uh we live at um a uh further north east of the subject land right subject whereabouts is your house where about is your house located on that parcel of land um it 's towards the edge of the ridge looking down over ford 's creek so roughly in the middle of the block on the narrow width and within a much closer distance to the um escarpment than the proposed house on the next door block okay another one more question through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the house that 's uh more or less blocked out with trees around it yes yeah and the parcel of land that you have would be what 60 something acres with it but it 's 63 acres two routes and four perches or something like that it is 63 acres and a bit yeah right thank you very much thank you thanks again sarabi counselors any other questions okay thanks mr graves for your time thanks for coming in tonight and you 've given us a bit more background to the whole exercise so thank you very much thank you thank you thank you councillors um are there any questions or comments on the application council web um probably just a general um i guess feedback or comment on some of mr graves 's um points that he raised there does anyone miss crane or ms alexander do you have any comments sort of on some of the points he raised through you mr mayor i 'm happy to talk to that um so there 's two elements that have been raised by the um presentations to council tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ridgeline the other is in relation to council officers assessment of of the house against the decision line guidelines of the farming zone and i might talk to them both a bit separately if that 's okay firstly the farming zone itself um mr graves raised the point of there are a number of houses that have been approved in that area and that 's probably true across the municipality there 's um the planning scheme itself has always been and um and hasn 't changed for probably close to 20 years it 's always discouraged dwellings in our farming zones that perhaps may not have been applied as stringently as it could have been in the past however the decision guidelines of the farming zone don 't particularly say because they don 't talk to precedent they don 't say that because we have allowed houses across to all of these other properties we should continue to do so it talks about further fragmentation it talks about having a house on a property for the purpose of farming so there needs to be a causal link between how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a house on that property to manage that piece of land with due consideration of the fact that this piece of land is actually owned by mr graves himself and it 's currently being run contiguously with another parcel of land the way a lot of farming properties already are the decision to refuse to recommend a refusal of the permit is based on the fact that it is actually being operated as a larger farming enterprise and having another dwelling on this block will further fragment that farming zone land which is discouraged in our planning scheme so that 's where the farming zone issues have come from in this in relation to this application and we don 't make these decisions lightly we do understand that we are talking about somebody 's property and that they are they have a value on on them that will be changed in relation to a decision such as this so we do recognize that this is not made lightly in relation to the significant impact the impacts raised by um mr walk in relation to the landscape and on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we did consider having a refusal ground in relation to that but um before we put this application to council um as we spent a reasonable amount of time on site with the permit applicant um and did discuss citing location landscaping and all of those other issues and believe that it will there will have been a way um to site a house on that property had we supported it under the farming zone in a way that to minimise that impact on the landscape however we didn 't go down the path of requesting them to get full amended plans done to satisfy that element when we weren 't going to be supporting the farming zone element at this point as it felt felt like an unreasonable expectation for them to put more money into something at this point so they are that was a significant consideration however we did believe that there was an there was capacity for those issues in relation to the impacts on the ridgeline that could be addressed had we got past the point of supporting in the farming zone thank you i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's a very comprehensive answer are there any other questions yeah just a question of interest um about that lot if lots a and b were sold as one lot would it be would an application for a second dwelling be appropriate on that block um through you mr mayor anytime we have an application for a second dwelling we would have to consider it again in terms of the purpose of the farming zone so we would have to have somebody demonstrate why you would need two houses and essentially two families on that property to manage that part that section of land so with those two lots together they actually meet the minimum lot size for the farming zone for one house um as they are as separate even though they are on separate titles a separate title doesn 't mean that you get the as of right used for dwelling because we do have that minimum 40 hectare rule um so if they wanted to apply for a second dwelling and we do get applications for second dwellings on farming zone blocks the same the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purposes of farming are applied in that instance yeah thank you yes thank you council is there any other questions counselors do we have a motion please cancel arriving just trying to find it it 's a massive document this isn 't it so um the motion as as printed um read the whole lot out this crane believe you may be able to do it as the motion um move the motion as as submitted in the agenda if you don 't want to read it out thank you yeah it 's a rather large motion so i 'd rather do that if you don 't mind so i removed the motion uh as printed on pai and um 13.2.3 um on the council 's uh agenda this season thank you thank you councillor do you have a second information cancel web okay

um his crane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of view on this and it is interesting to note that the original objection uh this was refused not because of the original objection but because of the farming zone which i support so that 's all i 'd really like to say mr mayor thank you very much thanks councillor um councillor weber 's secretary would you like to come in no thank you mr mayor any other

in that uh on the australia day awards committee thanks council um mansfield show i see a performance and remuneration uh i don 't think there 's been anything on that since the previous meeting as well uh goldman broken greenhouse alliance council yes mr mayor thank you we did meet uh just shortly after our previous council meeting so um i attended and chaired this meeting on 17th of december @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other councillors and to those uh members of the public watching the goldman broken greenhouse alliance it 's a formal alliance of the 13 councils across this region and essentially they 're committed to delivering actions to achieve climate change mitigation and adaptation and sharing projects that support that sustainable low-carbon uh community development um they advocate at a state and federal level on environmental policy and sustainable energy and efficient and affordable housing amongst other things our meeting we did have a guest speaker dr tayana o 'donnell she works from the anu and she works in climate risk and law and she 's recently published a paper around the roles and responsibilities of local government in regards to climate adaptation and essentially his paper contains practical advice to meet the needs of councils and her presentation was just around the liability of councils regarding either action or inaction on climate change which we know is now legislated in the new local government act 2020. the alliance has been working on a number of key projects just in particular interest they 've recently completed they call the main road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led globes which sounds like a minor thing but it actually did pass on significant savings in terms of actual energy costs as well as greenhouse emissions and i understand mansfield participated in that program and i believe they 're looking to start stage two of that project uh start the ball rolling of that sometime soon another interesting project they 're working on they 're calling it charging the hume region which relates to uh setting a network of ev or electric vehicle charges uh in the whole hume region um particularly they 're they 're anticipating and based on the data they have available to them anticipating that electric vehicles are well they are the sales of them are increasing at a rapid rate and they 're expected to reach price parity uh by about 2023 or 2025 so basically what they 're anticipating is that we could actually be at risk of missing a subset of tourism because if we don 't have a suitable ev network people won 't be able to come and visit us because their vehicles won 't be able to be charged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government grant in western victoria which signals that there is uh you know possibility of of eastern victoria having the same um other than that we sort of just ran around some of the other projects which they 've been working on um and an introduction to the team but i 'm very excited to be a part of that particular group and looking forward to doing some good work with them thanks council webb there any questions on other from the other councils um moving on the human regional local government network and it hasn 't met but it will be meeting on friday the fifth of february uh the lake eldon land and on water management plan implementation committee council sweden sorry mr mayor um the committee met on the 17th of december and uh the actions that arose from that or the the agenda items for that meeting included that uh global murray water have uh put up new signage around the dallatite arm to advise the camping uh below the full water line is prohibited uh so they conducted a bit of an education process over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water line is delwp land um however that 's exempt from the goal of murray water bylaws uh under the settlement agreement with tangarang uh this land is uh now jointly managed uh with del woop um and with tongarong however enforcement of camping below the water line will commence next month in february 2021 waste continues to be a problem and an education approach is currently underway um vic parks they can request campers to clean up their waste to move on but unfortunately vic parks have no authority to enforce any of that which is rather unfortunate gobble murray water have gone through a transformation so that what was known as the dams team they 're now known as water storage they basically have the same function uh the intent is for goblet murray water to have more recreation staff and provide backup should one staff member not be available um and hope well they 're saying that there are no services being removed from the recreation space because that was a concern uh that with the restructure of goulburn murray water that that would in fact happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ algae uh alert for lake eelden and for lake nilla cootie um uh according to goulburn murray water uh there 's supposed to be zero percent water contact but as we 're all aware the lake has certainly been extremely busy over the uh christmas period and continues to be getting a lot of use they at goblin murray water also sent out an expression of interest uh for development opportunities uh for um parcels of land around the lake and um i 'm aware that uh the pepin hub community group have actually put in expression of interest for that um and although gold and murray water are not actively seeking or promoting development opportunities uh they have advertised these parcels of land uh for expressions of interest uh that process is still being um being undertaken uh that 's about it mr mayor thank you thank you council any questions at all a uh yes thanks mr mayor councillor sladen just interested about the no camping below the uh full supply level in the deleted arm does that only apply to the deleted arm or does it apply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golden murray water uh bylaw cancellation uh which uh does apply to all around the lake uh but the the delete reserve uh is obviously a very popular spot for campers and so that 's where they have started increasing their uh or improving their signage just one aside with the signage is that they 've actually used some beautiful artwork that 's come from the tangarong land and water council for that signage so that will eventually be rolled out around the lake um uh yeah sorry that 's just an aside um so to answer your question cancellation uh yes it does apply to the whole of the lake the whole 515 kilometers thanks council any other questions welcome mansfield shire moving on manchester council order and risks committee that hasn 't met since um uh the previous meeting uh the mansfield shire business and community recovery advisory committee council student would you like to update that yes certainly mr mayor uh we had our second meeting last night given the uh the holiday period there was not a lot of movement um over the uh the holiday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the committee uh certainly expressed uh their satisfaction with the busy visitor period and obviously very well utilized the town was as we 're all we are all aware um staffing does remain an issue uh for the hospitality not just hospitality but um across the shire um but they uh through the mansfield district business association they are looking at ways to uh come up with solutions for the staffing issue particularly in the um in the hotel and the uh the hospitality area one piece of good news at the last meeting i mentioned that the there are two grant opportunities available uh one for communities and one for either community or business one large grant of a hundred thousand dollars the timeline or the deadline for expressions of interest for that has been extended until march the end of march pardon me however we haven 't heard back yet whether there 's an it 's been an extension for the community grants applications which at the moment close on the 1st of february next week so those community groups who have registered on the community uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been reminded that there is funding out there available and obviously we we do encourage all community groups to put in a submission for that um i believe mr mayor that 's probably the most crucial points unless you wanted to add something that i 've missed no thanks castle said that 's a good summary thank you very much any questions on that at all castleton uh yes councillor sladen or mayor holcomb um what uh has been the uptake of those grants from that fund and can you give us an update on perhaps how much of that money has been allocated thus far okay so for those two particular grant programs no money has been allocated thus far uh because applications are still being received um there is there has certainly been an amount of interest in both programs however this hasn 't resulted in a large number of applications to date for the community one i believe it was only two or three but there was another half a dozen or so ex you know inquiries being made um given that the the large three year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been extended to march uh for applications uh there has been a number of inquiries but there 's no applications have come in for that yet cancellation does that answer your question uh yeah for those grants and um the other part of the um the fund is that um okay yep so there was some other projects yes and i 'm going to there 's no one here i can refer to so that 's okay i 'm going to say that a large proportion of the funds have been committed or spent in terms of the marketing some filming has been done there 's certainly been some photographic stock imagery being taken for businesses to utilize i believe all but one hundred thousand dollars has been uh committed but i may defer here to ceo ms conrick if she can help me out on that one please thank you councillor sladen through you mr mayor um so there 's the three buckets just to to recap on the three buckets the the bucket that council slave was just talking about this is 660 000 and that was um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bushfires really were still unfolding and that was mainly around getting the tourist visitors back into the region given mance which i had shut down so all those um activities around marketing or as um council slavery had said um assisting businesses with their with the attracting tourism tourists so a lot of that is still unfolding given we had coveted straight away afterwards and there was no point in marketing so um most of that fund is still just kicking off the other other two components of 200 thousand and the two hundred thousand three hundred thousand of that is going towards the grants that council sladden spoke about just a moment ago and a hundred thousand is yet unallocated house was still waiting on another application hit it has in and depending on the success or otherwise of that application that will direct council around how to spend the 100 000 thank you miss conrick and if i can just continue just briefly mr mayor and councillor tian another successful funding program that has occurred is the outdoor dining activation funding which council received additional funding from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dining infrastructure that has been extended and that has been very warmly welcomed by the hospitality uh industry within the mansfield shire and has been very well utilized and that will continue um through to the end of march i believe uh madam ceo we are hoping to cover easter with it but um being extended yep you thank you thank you madam ceo uh any further questions there i counsel robbie yeah through you mr mayor um i 'm just uh interested to to know how much of this funding and um has gone to our outlying communities with respect to businesses and jamison and bonnie doon have we got any figures on that [Music] um maybe madam ceo thank you through you mr mayor um all the outlying hospital so this the 250 000 for activating outdoor dining was for hospitality businesses takeaway businesses did not qualify under the government 's um guidelines so it was for hospitality and businesses that needed to could extend their dining so i understand the jamison store took that up so all outlying areas were offered the hospitality businesses were all contacted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the businesses that wants to extend that time and keep it over easter but um bonnie june was we 're in contact with bonnie june told me that all the outlying communities were contacted some some businesses decided not to take up the offer of extending and i understand that we had 70 of our hospitality industry take up the offer yeah if i can just add there councillor raby uh in terms of bonnie dune certainly the bonnie dune hotel was approached uh but given their their existing infrastructure there was they had no requirement for um those marquees etc given their uh wonderful um outdoor outdoor dining area already but i will add here mr mayor is on the events in the event space the lake eldon festival will proceed uh on the 20th of february and also there was funding out of out of this program for the australia day celebrations and the uh movie night uh the night before so that 's all part of this fund as well or all this program and indeed taga as well on the 5th to the 7th of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to to those events occurring thank you thank you thank you council sladden um if there 's no more questions uh the next um association of victoria mov um that hasn 't met us yet in terms of in this council in our

requests for the month on ohs there 's television 34 and 33 pending is that a lot of ohs issues there um no mr mayor that would be reflecting the covert safe environment that we 're currently working within so because as as the government changed its requirements and restrictions we 've had a lot of ohs work done so the request would be coming in from our different facilities and our ohs officer is has developed covert safe plans for all those facilities and there may be some others in that list because i haven 't got it in front of me but i would um i 'm assuming it 's all most of @ @ @ @ @

second council slade thank you there any further questions or comments on that at all those in favor thank you the motion is passed uh we 've reached item 13.2 infrastructure and planning directorate uh responsible officer being general manager of infrastructure planning kirsten alexander welcome kirsten um and the first item there is the application for a planning permit number p096 20 development of land seven dwellings at 1200 street mansfield um and we have three uh representations uh and i think uh michael steenhouse the uh the applicant will be the first um give me the first presentation welcome michael on behalf of the council thank you councillors pronounce your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duchy right welcome um uh michael you could uh approximately three minutes just to give us a rundown on what uh we 've gotta already have a report which uh he 's documented uh look forward to hearing from him thank you very much well firstly good evening councillors thank you for the invitation to speak in in regards to the application for a planning permit for the development of the seven dwellings at 1200 street in mansfield i 'd like to start off by mentioning that the design of these drawings were based around quite a bit of research we spoke to residents of mansfield along with local real estate agents and we learned pretty quickly that there 's a severe lack of quality affordable housing that 's walking distance to mansfield town and infrastructure that in the way of for sale and for rent many young first home buyers we heard about and families that are in mansfield at the moment are encouraged to look further out of town as houses on full blocks are becoming financially out of reach with the significant rise in airbnb and short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properties has been diminishing the local worker for example teacher nurse or vet who may move to mansfield on placement is now forced to rent property further further out of town away from amenities and infrastructure due to there being a lack of quality affordable rental properties available we also believe that the single level dwellings at 1200 street also make the demand of a downsizer who may be looking for sorry guys i 've got a pesky cat that 's just jumped up on the on the desk just in time um for a downsizer maybe looking for low maintenance um accessible property within walking distance of the town uh we 've put a lot of focus particularly on the design and character of the dwellings to being keeping with the local area we see an in-field development a suitable infield development like this avoiding the need for valuable farmland on the outskirts of town continuously subdivided based on our early figures and estimates we expect the dwellings to to achieve between sort of 300 and 350 thousand dollars if sold and we do believe the design development and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand for affordable housing close to town but also provide an attractive stylish and high quality product for those that are currently finding it hard to buy a rent and therefore increasing the livability of mansfield town so that 's it thank you again councillors i 'm happy to answer any questions that you may have if if that 's necessary thanks michael counselors um any questions to michael cassell robert hello michael uh welcome to our council meeting um michael i believe you you 're from melbourne is that correct yep correct um how do you propose to build these these uh this this development are you going to be bringing up uh builders from melbourne or using local tradesmen no certainly not so my the builder for the development will be my father who does live up there in in mansfield um he 's built up there before and uh he 's previously from melbourne but has moved up up to the high country any build that he 's done up there so far has been using local trades local carpenters plumbers uh concreters etc so all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this project uh there 'll be nothing that that will be outsourced if we can avoid it thank you thank you council rally any other questions counselors um michael i have a question if uh if there 's no other questions from councillors no problem are you intending to subdivide this what 's your plans going forward on this uh with uh with the project right uh well our plan is obviously yeah to get the permit and then we 're not quite sure yet depending on what happens at the time whether we do we do sell all of them or whether we we uh retain some of them and rent them out but if we do if we do rent them our our objective of course is to to fill the demand of of long-term rentals and affordable long-term rentals in town so yes uh your question was to subdivide or to sell didn 't quite catch that well if you don 't subdivide and they will be subdivided correct sorry that they said subdivided they will be so they 'll be certainly coming through correct okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counselor side yes counselor sladden uh thanks uh mr mayor and uh thanks michael um this is a question for yourself and probably also the um uh the step planner uh in terms of the clause 55 and the outdoor space yeah can you just uh explain to me how the outdoor space of those buildings comply with clause 55 yeah well thanks for the question council sladden i 'm not the designer so i 'm the developer as far as i 'm i 'm aware the planner hasn 't come to us with any any concerns or or changes or requirements so i 'm happy to answer that but it 's probably best that i speak to the planner and with the draftsman to be able to get you the right answer because i yeah i 'm probably not the right person to be answering that particular question but but as far as i know there hasn 't been anything that 's come to us previously from the plan or any concerns okay thank you so i mean our impression is that it 's compliant without hearing anything mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was just about to say kirsten would you like to take that question thanks mr mayor it uh it is actually confirmed in the report that the proposal complies with all the clause 55 requirements um i can get a further further comment if required yeah i i thank you mrs alexander i did i did note that in the report uh in the section of the objections says all but then further down in the report it says mostly all of clause 55 and uh that just i 'm just looking for confirmation that that does not um [Music] does not uh include the um the outdoor space uh given you know the the the number of uh or the scale of the development on the uh on the land there um granted it is it within the existing residential zone uh but just making sure that we don 't have these smaller buildings with um postage stamped backyards that 's also that 's all i would like to uh check on that 's all happy to get a further comment on that through you mr mayor to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of uh secluded and and other private open space uh each unit is required to have 25 square meters of secluded private open space and a total of 40 square meters of of private open space assisting from secluded and that includes the area because this unit this is now not yet a subdivided area it 's taken as the entire lot so the area within the front nine meter setback is also included in the open space for this development uh i 've checked through those numbers today the only error i found was in a suggestion on the plans to say that there was 110 meters of secluded private open space to the rear unit in fact secluded private wrapped in space has to have a minimum dimension of three metres and for some of that open space the dimension was only uh two point something but not missing that the courtyard area adds up to just over 33 square meters of secluded private open space which meets the requirement excellent thank you for that response acting manager thank you michael my pleasure um is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you very much for your time it 's very good thank you thank you mayor thank you councillors um all the best thank you thank you um the uh we have on the what in the in the waiting room is that right manny um joe 's just coming in now joe are you there yeah i am hello hello hello sorry um joe it 's it 's uh mark holcomb uh speaking as the mayor yes um is so it 's you and gary together presenting yes yes he 's not here at the moment he 's working oh okay um thank you very much for coming on and thank you for your time um so how we work it is you got about three minutes to give us a bit of a rundown on what your concerns um and then uh we 'll throw it open to the counselors for questions if that 's okay with you right yeah the most um we 're worried about is the density of the project um it 's twice the size of travis purcell 's and he 's a pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acre but this one next door is on half an acre so it 's double the density of that one um there 's two story two four two story um units in there um he has the builder hasn 't been able to tell us the distance from the um fence to the we the windows that will look into the block next door um we 've asked him for that um it wasn 't advertised in the paper and nobody in our street i haven 't talked to trab but that were notified we wouldn 't i we were notified we got a letter that was fine but i think something as big as that really needs to be put um out to the open to the public of mansfield because it is a thing that might um keep going on if it happens well you know there 's no um provision that this set of six will be um stop be becoming short-term um rentals aren 't only people buying it for bnbs which makes a high risk of making um rentals affordable in mansfield because it won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondering um will he be using local tradesmen as well being an outside company from mansfield over the last three years we had we 've got three blocks that have been subdivided in this end of mansfield in in the end of high street um hunter street and the three bro blocks if they all get um passed they 'll from three blocks with three houses it will go to 25 houses on those three blocks that were so it 's making it very dense down this end of the road i 'm not i 'm sure the quality of the building will be fine but there 'll be no it 's not high quality for the peop of living for people in such a small area there 's hardly any um outdoor spaces in between them and i have other problems with if they become something like b and b 's the amount of not traffic but cars you know that won 't be able to park in there will be parking along hunt street and causing problems so you know there 's a few things i have we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't come back with the um we 've seen the plans but there was no um what am i saying um he was supposed to come back with the distances and the measurements for from the windows to the to the um to you know so for looking into the property next door it also devalues our block that we 've next door which we would we 're going to sell once it 's subdivided so having so many along the fence line okay um thank you for that for those questions if if you um if we just throw the a few questions uh i throw questions open to the councils and uh yep um councillors uh do you have any questions of joe councillor oh hi joe it 's uh steve robbie here councillor hi steve hi um joe i i note your concern about the car parking in the street um it 's interesting that you brought that up because have you experienced more or less parking in the street down that end of hunter street well not as yet because the units at the end aren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hasn 't happened yet um and there has been out the ones across the road that were in the first lot but not a huge amount as yet but it 's just if you 've got seven units there and if they get you know percentage go to airbnb or something you can imagine the amount of their three-bedroom units how many there could be it up and down the street you know parked out the front because there 's not a lot of room in that block with seven units on it okay um i 've got one more question joe that 's okay um your your block is is must be number 14 is it 14 16 yeah okay so you 're subdividing between your house and the proposed development in that block would i suppose be called 14 then um how how big is that block ours that block that subdivided half an acre so that your the block that you 're intending to subdivide next to the development would be half an acre yeah um is that 2 000 square meters do you know i 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't know meters yeah i know okay all right thanks that 's the right half an acre yeah it 's the same same size as the block he 's building on oh okay exactly yeah okay yeah um oh yeah thanks man um joe james tayyin here um you had one query about whether he would be using local builders and he was on before and he did assure us that he would be using local tradespeople to build yeah the other thing i was just interested in is it is very high density i agree with you and there 's one further down a development further down the street yes on the same side no yeah on the same side but it 's a double the size of what he 's putting that block is double the size of what he 's got next door and he 's putting the same amount of units on it that that will be on that one right okay yeah yeah take that and then obviously you 're planning to subdivide lot number 14. what are your plans for that was how many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into another block okay we 're not going to put anything on it at that stage right yeah yeah no okay sure sure yeah okay so it seems like there will be a fair bit more traffic down there and perhaps even foot traffic yeah couldn 't be any worse than the foot traffic that comes from the units over the back fence because they can come through they jump the fence right yeah so but yeah just a couple of questions um oh sorry uh thank you mr mayor and um good aj i hope you 're going all right um through you mr mayor i 'd like to just um address one of joe 's queries regarding airbnb um and what exactly do we have in place and and i guess what regulations or what compliance protocol do we have in place in council to prevent i guess a uh an influx of of airbnbs taking over our rentals in mansfield we know that affordable housing is really really important at the moment um talk to any almost any resident any real estate agent they 'll tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well so um i guess through you mr mayor to uh madam ceo i guess would be the best to address this question could you give us a bit of an outline there thank you councillor webb and through you mr mayor um yes council is doing some work on affordable housing with some businesses locally but um if if i can sort of intervene at this point please counselor web we probably need to stick to topic because there is a planning application before council and and it 's really not a planning matter um for in terms of the airbnb and i 'm just reluctant to have that conversation for this with this item thank you thank you very soon um yeah see i 'm i think there should be more affordable housing too but there 's so much affordable housing that has been taken off the market with people coming up and there 's about 60 airbnbs in mansfield already and there 's no nobody can get you you 've even got people that are coming into your business the shy that can 't get housing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get housing either so it 's it 's a big thing mansfield 's losing that they 're losing people they 're losing losing community because of sort of things like this that 'll probably turn out to be you know maybe some people will live there but permanently but i can 't see it i can just see it as people that 'll use be used as holiday places or holiday rentals um joe just one question i 'd like to ask um the gm of infrastructure and uh planning um because alexander kristen jose wrote a couple of points about seven on seven buildings on half an acre um four of which are two story does i just want to show us that everything that is been put forward there fits within the planning regulations so is there anything that 's in that number of per that that um that size block that you should be concerned about from a legal perspective uh i will actually ask our acting manager planning to advise on that one because it 's quite a detailed question um i think the results are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could add through you mr mayor council is as a responsible authority required to apply the planning scheme to any application before it michael can you sorry michael can you just turn that your volume up please peter we 're struggling to hear you peter yeah oh sorry sorry that 's all right um i 'm not quite sure how i turn the volume up can i speak speak louder yes um you know the uh the the essence of any planning application is that there be an appropriate site response to the application and a design response that meets the needs of the planning scheme now in this instance no matter that it seems like an excessive number of units on one block of land of this size several of those units are just two bedroom units and to address some of the inquiries about the uh the objector car parking has been provided in accordance with the scheme a two bedroom or one bedroom unit requires one undercover car park and a three-bedroom dwelling requires two car parks one of which must be undercover and they 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when some people park out the front in the street vcat takes the position that the street is a public roadway and anyone is available is able to avail themselves at the car parking that 's on the land on the street and so notwithstanding the concerns of the neighbor we can 't base uh any form of objection to the application based on car parking they 've met the needs of the planning scheme um you might be aware that in melbourne for instance and notwithstanding that this isn 't melbourne the same planning controls in residential one zone applied sorry the general residential saying apply there you might get terrace houses on 180 square meters per block yes they 'll be side to side and they 'll be accessed from a rear lane or something like that so it 's not about the absolute number of dwellings on a lot rather the design response and as per c hedges application assessment this these application with this application for d7 units substantially complies with the with the requirements of the scheme and when i say substantially i say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's out by five percent that i 'm not aware of but it 's uh it meets the needs of the planning scheme and therefore we advise you that we have as officers know no technical reason to offer any form of refusal for the application thank you um just one other point that joe raised also uh miss alexander the um uh the point that wasn 't uh didn 't appear to be advertised in the paper um do you have any comment on that uh that actually it 's through you mr mayor that actually was addressed in the report um and i think the officers there were a number of comments about that in in the report in terms of it was advertised to the neighbours which i think um joe has confirmed i know not but not for seven neighbours no and you probably sent it to me trav and the seven people that live in the units behind we don 't know that 's not that 's not advertising you cannot say to me that the person who wants to build this you leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's for the shy just that give it at the end but people look at that people we look at that all the time people look at that advertisement for um planning things so it should be a shy thing to let people know in mansfield what 's going on we don 't know what the overlay in mansfield is now it 's changed and as the other fellow just said it 's it 's not melbourne but he 's treating her it 's being treated like it 's a melbourne suburb allowing that many units on one block excuse me mr mayor if ms cooper has finished speaking um we need to to move on from there miss cooper can 't respond to council and um offices so i 'm sorry um to cut you off but that 's inappropriate so if this cooper has finished her three minutes and speaking and councillors don 't have any further questions we probably should say goodbye to her as we have done to the applicant okay no worries that 's fine i just had yeah thank you thank you joe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you bye um just moving on uh council says there are any questions or clarifications you want on the uh on the application casserole yeah thank you mr med look um my concern is um i suppose not specifically uh with with this planning application but generally for the shire um i 've done some looked at this application and and mr steinhaus is saying that he 's got a 1.5 million dollar [Music] development which is at odds with my figures [Music] like two and a bit million um and on the market uh generally maybe worth some where in the order of 2.8 to 3.5 million so the the question i suppose i have of the council officers is that given that there are it is a uh seven unit development with the parking under cover as it is i tend to think that there will be probably two cars per unit which is 14 cars coming onto our roads which is a parking issue already we 've got to find more parking i suppose getting drilling down into the question specifically is that um with respect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me some sort of clarification around that it seems to me that there will be more of these developments and um and and we 're struggling at the moment with our infrastructure uh castle coaster uh through you mr mayor i i will ask um our acting planning manager to respond to that i think he has an answer for you through you mr mayor um in terms of uh contributions towards council for a subdivision when it occurs uh a subdivision of of this land would attract a 5 public open space contribution that 's based on the site value of the land not on the capital improved value of the land so from our perspective into in evaluating the land of that time it ignores whatever 's being built on the land and uh so we have no interest in the value of the uh actual improvements um the we are interested in the value of the assessment of the of the application uh construction costs because the fee for the planning application varies depending on the uh predicted costs of the development but it goes in fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a million from a half a million to a million from a million to five million and so once it ticks over a million um you know within reason we 're probably not going to be drilling down too closely to the actual dollar value thank you very much um acting manager peter and some i appreciate you your response thank you um mr mayor so you 've heard it is there any other questions or clarification required in the application uh councils do we have a motion with respect to uh if we if we can take the recommendation as read do we have a motion with respect to that recommendation council satan thank you mr mayor yes uh i would like to move the recommendation as is on pages 13 14 15 [Music] and 16 of the cancel agenda i won 't read it all so cancel having considered all matters required under the section 60 of the planning environment act and under the provisions of the planning scheme issue a notice of decision to grant a planning permit etc etc thank you council sudden do we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to speak to your motion any further ah thank you mr mayor look again as the report does state this is that the land is already within an existing general residential zone so it does fit the relevant components of the state and local planning policy frameworks uh it is an encouraged a development that is encouraged currently by council in terms of in-field development and the uh increase in availability of affordable housing is is a priority for council so i have no hesitation in recommending in moving the recommendation as presented mr mayor thanks castle sudden um kasaravi is seconded would you like to have any further comment yes i totally agree with councillor paul sladden on this matter that um it it ticks all the boxes for for legalities um and we are struggling for affordable housing so thank you any other councillors like to make any further comments castleweb thanks mr mayor um also want to echo the sentiments of uh councillor sladen uh we need as much affordable housing as we can get right now so it 's uh i feel it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ webb if there 's no more comments uh those uh those in favor motion is passed thank you um item 13.2 again is in the area of um for application for planning permit number p double one five twenty building and works at manslaughter steiner school uh responsible officer being uh general manager of instruction planning kirsten alexander there any questions or clarifications required of the application no questions or counselors curse uh mrs alexander is there anything that you 'd like to add at all uh thank you uh mr mayor knight that 's i 'll take the report as read okay that being the case um would someone like to move a amount if we take the recommendation as read would someone like to move the motion accordingly councillorati remove it seconder thank you councillor ravi would you like to uh to speak to the motion yes i would um mr may i 'd like to say that the rudolf steiner school has been a fantastic addition to our community in mansfield although my children have not attended that school there are a lot of people in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that school it 's wonderful to see that they 're growing still and i support this promotion thank you councillor slade in a second would you like to make any further comment uh thank you mr mayor yeah look i agree with uh councillor rabbi um but you know in particular having had a good look at this um well yeah had had a very good look at this uh application um you know the buildings are they 're very well designed uh it 's in keeping with the existing building uh you know they 're the muted materials and colors that steiner use uh it really does fit into the um not only the existing school buildings but also the surrounding landscape so uh i have no hesitation in supporting this application thank you thank you councillor sudan uh would any other councils like my comment okay those uh in favor of the motion okay the motion has passed thank you item 13.2 refers to the infrastructure and planning directorate again with kirsten alexander the lake illidan asset audit is there any questions or clarifications required of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is um to whoever is appropriate is what is the current status of the updated uh memorandum of understanding between council and goulburn murray water as a result of the meeting that was held in september 2020 thanks mr mayor through you i 'm happy to answer that question it is currently under review by our property officer and asset coordinator with a view to catching up with goldman murray water very soon once they 've finished doing the review of the initial document that we 've received from them they immediate so currently under review is a short answer and we expect to have a meeting with them i 'd say over the next month as soon as we can arrange a time so through you mr mayor uh can you give us a bit of a timeline mrs alexander or not i mean other than the proposed meeting you know in terms of signing uh the uh the mou yep so i would expect uh that we would have a you know a draft to review it at the meeting in the next month and then from there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine we would have it back to council by the march meeting just to hazard a guess assuming that all goes well in that second meeting with gmw okay thank you um while i 've got you there i would just like to congratulate yourself and thank yourself and the ceo in um carrying out this audit uh it is long overdue and i 'm pleased that we finally have a clear picture of uh the relevant commitments between council and goulburn murray water goldwa murray water as we all know are the water manager but the lake is a significant asset and natural asset and economic driver for the mansfield shire so it 's important that we do get this right and it does tie in with the laggy old and activation master plan as well so um thank you for uh getting this far with the results of the motion from a couple of years ago and i personally look forward to uh further uh advancement of this um the original motion thank you thank you and i 'd like to thank in particular our asset coordinator john @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information together council there any other questions um miss alexander also um i 've never seen that i didn 't know what assets we had so i also agree with council slade and i thought that order was quite uh quite extensive and to be honest really surprising for someone who 'd never looked at those those assets that the council owned um am i reading correctly that uh and this is just totally diabetes am i ready correctly that uh gmw don 't pay for anything anything there if i got that right or is that um shorter answer is yes that 's a very polite answer mrs alexander i would have said bugger all mr mayor you 're right right and um i was going to ask is there any reason why that is it never been offered or um asked for or what what 's why not look through through you mr mayor i 'm not really sure on the history um having said that uh as we acknowledged in the report that in our discussions with gmw there was an acknowledgement and a willingness to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council on that and they 're acknowledging there is a shared responsibility there so yes it is a work in progress but they are happy to talk to us okay any other questions counselors oh sorry castle webb thanks kirsten too by the way thank you for that thank you mr mayor um just a quick comment uh i understand uh mid last year i think the state government announced that all boating related fees would go back into the infrastructure um from which they were generated will that uh this asset um audit will that tie into that and we 're able to actually make a submission and claim off that now is that correct correct good excellent thank you any other questions counselors okay um do we have emotion counselors for um this item on the agenda council slavin yes mr mayor i 'm uh we 'd like to move the motion the council receive and note the information presented in this report on make yield and assets thank you councillor sloan is it ready to have a second counselor turn um would you like to speak further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i i explained earlier my reasons for getting this done but uh it 's you know it is uh it 's critical that uh council and goulburn murray water uh clearly identified the maintenance requirements of these assets around the lake uh particularly now where we 've got tangarang land and non-water nomura council involvement development involvement to make sure that we are clear who is responsible for what and who is paying for what thank you thanks council satan councillor turn as secretary would you like to say it uh yeah thanks mr mayor i 'd like to commend councillor sladden on the on his uh on his work he 's done in getting this um getting this audit done i think as he says it it 's long overdue and i 'm well aware of the way gold and murray water like to dictate the terms but often are reluctant to contribute in any way um so yeah it 's a it 's a good step forward for the for the future of the lake and tourism around the lake thanks councillor turn any other council like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the motion motion has passed thank you the next item on the agenda is item 13.2 the infrastructure and planning directorate again is responsible for this project mansfield station precinct project update uh is there any questions to or clarification required of the report from the responsible officer castle [Music] padme thank you mr mayor ms alexander i have a couple of questions uh the first being um that when we look at the recommendation uh in your report um it does include alterations to the master plan that was formulated as your report says with extensive community consultation was over more than a 12-month process it had been endorsed well has been endorsed by council we did have consultants work on it and uh we are now looking at what i consider to be a major change with the civic space in the car park areas um a key element of the design um of the of the precinct uh being re-prioritized in uh the language that is in the in the report and i would just like clarification as to why you believe that the current parking location @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civic space which was a key component of the master plan which allows for connectivity from the precinct through to the rest of the town mr alexander thanks through you mr mayor thanks for the question councillor sladden um in terms of the reprioritization i yes that comes up in the context of us applying for a number of grant applications at the moment and needing to decide where we devote councils um the time and resources from an administration point of view um so we have tried to target those on the on the sub projects or the components of the master plan that we think um you know current grant funding opportunities will allow us to progress um in terms of the position or location of the car park the it is functional obviously council has invested money in that in the past it works quite well in terms of allowing people to access into both the visitor information center and also to the station building where the historical society are located and we had feedback from a stakeholder meeting that that the stakeholders like the historical society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as being a high priority compared to the other components of the master plan so that was the reason why we were just highlighting that that 's the feedback we got from the stakeholders um that attended the meeting in october and uh we 'll put it back to council for um your assessment or otherwise of that thank you yeah now um thank you uh mr mayor and thank you ms alexander um this leads me to my next question in terms of uh you talk about stakeholders and you listed three stakeholders there which have um well their own interests uh in this precinct yet when the project steering committee was formed it had wider community involvement and community participation and community membership um you know taking the advice of three organizations which have their own interests at heart without my reading this is this is my interpretation of the value and concept of the entire precinct i believe is short-sighted and to be again my words pandering to special interest groups uh in a project that is designed to promote both the civic and the economic um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you go back to the original master plan and look at that civic space and that car park it is a significant component and is a a real draw card in my mind uh in terms of uh attracting people to that space and allowing that uh through line that connectivity to the rest of the um to the rest of the town otherwise if you leave the car park where it is in my mind you you know you 're putting up a barrier um you know a physical barrier for a pedestrian movement through from the uh precinct to the remainder of the town uh so do you have any further comment or uh yeah one through you miss me happy to address that and it 's probably worth the councillors knowing that the meeting in october was held um in the context of us um finalizing grant application a grant that we had received from regional development victoria so we did need to equip that grant and part of that grant was design of the heritage storage and display building and the all abilities playground which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in particular the heritage storage and display building i mean obviously the mansfield historical society are a key state stakeholder in that building as they will be the user of it and there 's also a display area for um the tongarang as well to wrong uh items so uh that was the focus i guess of that meeting um it was in relation to reviewing those designs um but obviously we got broader comment back from the meeting in terms of the relative priority of the elements of the master plan so i guess that just gives you a bit of context obviously we do need to prioritize which project we approach first and we do that by looking at um you know is the design progress to us to an extent that we could then apply for funding and certainly with those two projects the design has been completed um and we obviously needed uh input from the stakeholders being in particular the mansfield historical society so that was the background to that meeting um yeah sorry can i continue mr may yeah please cassie so sorry thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the heritage display and storage building and the all abilities playground yes they are con you know that they are key components of the master plan as well um i have no issue with that and yes it is expected that you would uh consult with those stakeholders involved but taking the advice i mean as your report your report says um you know after discussions with historical society let 's get rid of the car park well sorry that doesn 't wash with me and that is still a key component getting rid of it can 't we just park it and then look for funding further on yeah just stick with i can 't say that through you and um and chance the council 's flag in this question absolutely you absolutely can park it um the the report and the comments in the report what have come out of those discussions and perhaps the deeper understanding which council swain has from being involved in the previous pro you know in the project of developing the master plan is relevant remember councillors the report has no status @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guide and it says that there have been some conversations council can put a motion forward in any which way it likes and it doesn 't need to include that component if it doesn 't agree with it so thank you thank you um yeah any other counselor other counselors we should like comment just sorry i 'm not i must admit i i don 't know the history of this project um but it appears to be you know i guess a sudden your question appears to be around the car park and who i see parker at the moment in this town it 's it 's a it 's a massive problem um and we just don 't have anywhere near enough i i don 't understand why we would want to i think what you 're saying is we want to get rid of the car park um or i 'm misinterpreting that and why would you get rid of the car part when we have absolutely nowhere near enough parking in this town um it 's my question i 've clearly missed something obviously yeah so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the master plan you 'll see that it 's not removing the car park it is relocating the car park so that car park will be relocated to come in off um early street next to um next to jenkins so it 's not removing it it is relocating it which then opens up as a civic space the what is now the car park um and if you again if you look at the design it 's a very attractive design very welcoming design and um the car park has been relocated to around the corner so we 're really again i 'm just trying to ascertain why we get rid of a car park that 's all um no we 're not getting rid of it we 're relocating it yes but why don 't why can 't we have both car parks think that we 're so short of car parks in this town and i 'm going to answer the question because there 's nowhere in this town to park for at the moment i think that lisa 's some uh caravans slash trailers being parked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure off but it 's not when you 're enough and here we are looking to take a section of car parking out of the town we do have long vehicle um facility uh car parking facility in hyatt street um both ends of hyatt street that is available um again in my mind it compromises the intention of the whole precinct master plan by retaining a car park in the middle of what is intended to be a um social activity pedestrian activity zone and to put a car park in it just does not make sense okay in mind yeah thank you so much webb you 've got a question and so does councillor arabi but uh firstly castle webb thanks mr mayor um i just sort of want to pick apart sort of what 's being said a little bit because i think we 're getting a bit confused over a couple of different topics so um from what i can understand what council saturn 's saying is that the um by retaining the car park in the in its current location it really sort of doesn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master plan which i tend to agree with it certainly separates the whole precinct out whereas it was meant to be one cohesive space prior to that mr mayor your comments in regards to car parking um i personally think the location of the car parking in next to the visitor information center isn 't really applicable to the centre of town it 's a good ten minute walk or five minute walk to the center of town anyway and i don 't see it being over utilized in uh in its current location anyway if anything sort of moving it to early street would bring it closer to things like food works and things and yankings as well to be used better so um i think we need to separate the the car parking um situation uh and sort of bring it back just to the price and the station precinct itself uh and and i tend to agree with uh council sudden that uh by removing the car park uh it would it would definitely sort of fracture the the the master plan as it sits today thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disagree with that quite frankly the problem we 've got at the moment is long vehicles with caravans we 're trying we 've been saying forever you know come to mansfield this is a tourist town and then there 's no parking for them um i would just personally like to have more time to look at the master plan in its entirety given that i 've only been a counsellor for three months this has been going obviously for years and it 's going to require more time needed to make a decision on this and form a well-defined view at the moment um driving into town um i 'm not not fooling that view at the moment so if i could have more time to do this that would be appreciated thanks cancer alley any question oh sorry uh madam ceo so through you mr mayor what i was going to suggest because the car parking is is you know it does not need to be discussed tonight it was just the opportunity to report on those conversations i would suggest that one and two if councillors were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue on the um as a resolution on the car parking it is not essential tonight and i from what i am hearing is the councils would like to appreciate their master plan better and i would actually advise that as well so thank you thank you uh castle said uh thank you mr where uh mr mayor i 'm um prepared to move a motion uh that includes one uh the council notes the update provides on the key elements of the station precinct master plan provided in this report and two progresses applications for funding the elements of the station precinct master plan as opportunities arise i 'm prepared to move that motion uh is is there a secondary to that mission council web thank you uh would you like to speak further to that motion council said i think i 've said enough mr mayor castle uh just just that um it 's obviously uh a topic which which requires a bit more picking apart and and i don 't think we 're the council 's in a position to make a call on on that car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put it to the side and and move with the rest of it as we can any other councils wish to speak yeah i i agree we should park the car parking to another time thank you boom boom okay um okay uh gasoline you want to add anything to that oh yeah thanks mr mayor yeah look i think um obviously the funding for this precinct is going to be ongoing and i think it 's uh that the car park where it is serves a good purpose at the moment and um i uh i can 't see the need to um i can 't see the need for that car park to be removed from the plan as yet until we 've had further time to look at it and um i think that uh overall there was one other question i had on that um on that recommendation it was it was a regarding something different it was regarding the um sorry the all abilities playground um and i just had a question for kirsten about what the cost of that all abilities playground is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another item on the agenda later on um regarding uh the the playground at the other end of town so um i wonder if i could just get an update on that on the or just a question on the cost of it thanks councillor team through you mr mayor um the there was a an initial cost estimate done obviously we haven 't tested the market on it at all yet um because we would need funding confirmed first the initial qs estimate was quite substantial because it 's a big playground i think it was of the order of 1.8 million but i might just throw to our manager operations and capital works and just confirm that then but obviously being a playground you do have some scope to sort of increase or or reduce as desired so yeah thanks uh kirsten through you mr mayor the master plan shows as adopted it shows two separate playgrounds one that they call the all abilities adventure playground and the other is the all abilities playground um and combined uh the order of magnitude that kirsten gave is about right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grant dependent projects ways of being able to move forward uh with pieces of it um if we separated that out we could deliver one of those two playgrounds for around the same budget as the playground we 're also considering at the botanic park so um you know in the order of around six hundred thousand so they 're those two ways of looking at it mr mayor thanks chris thank you um gasoline is that um answer your question yeah thank you okay um if there 's no more questions on that uh those in favor of the motion put forward by council slade motion is passed thank you um item 13.3 um is under the community corporate services directorate with um general manager chris snook uh and firstly an update on the mess for show instrument of appointment and authorization should you do it uh are there any questions or clarifications required from councillors on this report nothing at all uh mr j would you like to add any think further to it or i think it is the only thing we 'll add and it goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been updated in accordance with the recent appointments okay thank you um do we have a motion for this this item uh castle thank you mr mayor um just the motion would be as written page 36 of today 's agenda uh the council in the exercise of the powers conferred by section 188 of the planning environment act 1987 another legislation referred to in schedule 11a instrument of appointment and authorizations uh resolves point one two and three as written okay thank you and do we have a second council slam uh do you would you like to speak further to that castle web no thank you mr mayor castle son no it 's just a process thank you those in favor thank you um on 13.3.2 uh regarding the rates and financial assistance program are there any questions or clarifications of this item report uh yeah just one question through you to the ceo mr mayor regarding the um recommendations that the ceo be empowered to implement temporary rate rate assistance programs in response to pandemic at any time in the future i was just wondering is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or rate payer groups or rate payers in general mr mayor i will refer to our manager of business and performance to answer that because she 'll be able to provide you with some insight into why that might be streamlined and how that would occur thank you thanks kayleen um through the mayor it would be potentially all of the above counsellor so it 's more about having the flexibility for the organization to respond really quickly to changes in the economic environment so if we were to go back into lockdown orders where organizations businesses were expected to shut down people are expected to be stood down from their jobs we could react really quickly without needing to wait potentially for another whole month to get a report up to council or having to call an emergency council meeting generally my advice would be that relief would be applied on a broader basis um to address equity within the community but it would depend on the specific circumstances there may be certain parts of the economy affected there may be others that aren 't which may affect different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either a differential basis or a i don 't know potentially a pensioner versus non-pensioner basis but as a recommendation advisors we would then bring a report to council so that those decisions would be advised to you um after the fact so that you 'll be aware yeah thank you for that uh castlewood thank you mr mayor and through you mr mayor um and probably uh directed towards uh mr snook or the ceo um just in terms of the advertising communication around this particular policy are we planning just to do a bit of a whether it be an ad in the paper or something over facebook or something like that just to sort of make sure everyone 's aware of exactly what 's happening again i will refer to our manager of business and performance to answer the question thank you yeah um we have all ratepayers contact details so any communication would be sent specifically and directly to rate payers whether we have their email addresses we will do an email blast if we have postal addresses it would be postal um i think the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon so we could potentially do it with that mail out um i 'm not sure whether we 've missed the print demo or not but that 's how we would do it okay thank you any other questions castles uh castle sun thank you uh mr mayor um question for ms kinnesley um given that you know the the amount of applications that have come in uh less than well around about one percent of the total number of uh rate payers or rate assessments um i would imagine that this is not having a huge impact on our cash flow would that be correct yeah again through the mayor um i agree with you it 's not having a significant impact on our cash flow you can see in the report there is a graph that shows our arrears are at about 450 which is higher than previous years but we also have a higher rate base so as um overall pool of rates and charges goes up each year so proportionately we 're pretty similar and it 's now it 's not impacting our cash flows at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was given to the state government 's uh or the sorry the ombudsman 's um uh commencement of uh an investigation into how council uh councils around the state are responding to financial hardship was any consideration given to maybe deferring until um that process has been completed yes so my understanding of the ombudsman 's review is that they will be looking at um existing policies in place as well as a response to covert and then providing best practice guidelines as a result of that review um so i believe that our financial hardship policy still provides the avenues for those that need it to be able to access rate relief and i think that that would be a massive part of the ombudsman 's review as well so i think we have those provisions in place and once the ombudsman review comes down we can then tweak that policy if we need to to meet best practice guidelines if it 's not already met fantastic thanks miss kimmers kinnersley the answer i was looking for was that our rate relief policy does continue and you just confirmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i just have one question then um when do when does council classify something as a as a bad debt what level does it get to when you 're at the stage that it 's got to be called in um or written and or written off and are we how many of our debts are at that what amount of money is at that level at the moment that you think we 're gonna have to write off so rates and charges we never write them off so legislation provides that they are secured over the property that they relate to so what that means is if it 's not paid but when that property changes hands whether it 's sold or whether the owner passes away and it goes through an estate process council then recovers the unpaid rates and charges out of the proceeds from the sale of that property so for that reason council never writes them off they just get deferred and they sit there waiting until that transfer happens we have very rare occasions of bad debts in other parts of revenue but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part to your question i 've forgotten yeah when does it get this when when does it get to the stage how how long overdue before you start enforcing pursuit debt collection that 's right um so i don 't have that particular date on me um i 'd say it would be at least 90 days over before it would go to debt collection but i need to refer back to um our debt recovery procedures and i 'm sorry i don 't have that at hand but i can circulate that outside of the meeting in terms of um the volume of the dollars that we have in debt collection at the moment because debt collection has been paused um i don 't have that data on hand at the moment either so right i guess so if you say 90 days roughly how much is over 90 days 450 000. it 's a 450 000 referring there yeah but again i need to check that date i 'm not sure if it is 100 90 days or not okay any other questions counselors uh do we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um just taking the recommendation as written on page 41 of tonight 's agenda um that we that council follows the four dot points as listed there thanks council webb a second for that motion no seconders counsellors cancer robbie uh yeah i 'll second uh the motion by councillor webb thank you thank you uh casa webb would like to add anything further to it um i guess my only comment would be um that it 's it 's it 's time i guess for uh both council business and everyone to sort of recommence their lives and and continue on um i 'm not a fan of uh debt collection or or charging interest by any stretch they imagine but of of the imagination but you know at the end of the day uh we need to get back to our lives and we can see that this this will have a minimal effect on our ratepayer base and it 's it 's time to move on thanks councilwood council robert do you want to add further no thank you those in flavor of the motion the motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the um unless is there any questions on that at all clarification required councils uh take it as being read do we have a motion for the for that um that item uh yes mr mayor i 'll move that council receive a note

2020",yHOmDv7FRdU,20200821,436.0,"33 Highett St, Mansfield VIC 3722, Australia",1168,good afternoon i was hoping to do this outside in the snow but maybe it 'll snow a bit later i know life undercover nighting restrictions is affecting everyone differently so today i want to highlight some of the community groups that have organised initiatives to support and keep our community connected i am sure you may know many individuals and organizations who are keeping spirits up i thank them all and i encourage you to speak up and to reach out and thank them too a few words of thanks means a great deal community spirit is part of what mansfield is known for and these examples that i 'm going to present to you highlight that strength today i 'm going to talk about three community groups initiatives firstly something for parents of young people the community bank is supporting two free online workshops for parents to support young people 's mental health these will be held on wednesday the 26th and friday the 28th of august by local educators and positive psychology consultants kate and joe bell for more information and to book please go to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other one the mansfield high country quilters have made a thousand washable fabric masks that 's some achievement thank you marnie told me that the quilts for children with cancer is one aspect of the communica quilts project they donate them to the monash children 's centre in clayton the quilters have also brightened up the lives of residents at rosehaven hospice by donating quilts cath said as quilters sewers and knitters the group can share these skills and welcomes new members you can email them for more information at highcountryquilters gmail.com so if you 're looking for something to get involved in to meet new friends or help out this is one group where you can be contributing while staying at home as we must do during our stage three restrictions and last but not least today i 'm speaking to karen perry from mansfield musical and drama society or months that we all know it muds is one of those groups that helps define the character of mansfield in normal times and during the pandemic in the first part of this year mud staged a children 's online @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do something completely different it was the first of its kind and 12 local young people took part the show is now permanently on youtube and can be viewed any time i recommend you watch it it highlights the talent of our local people if you weren 't already aware of that muds was planning also to present black adder a play that has been written for the stage but now will be done as a radio play it is my pleasure to welcome karen perry to join us today karen is the last member of mugs an amazing contribution to the arts in mansfield hi karen hi max can you please tell me can you please tell me what your group has been doing to remain connected through this time of current restrictions well we 've done a an online musical with a whole lot of kids as you 've already mentioned which is fantastic we were any shows that were planned for the stage this year being postponed to next year and and so black adam which was already cast we decided to start rehearsing and so we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio station mansfield radio to do it as a radio play later on in the year in october that 's our plan how many people would be involved in that in blackadder yeah well we 've got a cast of 12 and there 's uh probably about six or seven people involved in the technical side of things directing fantastic that 's great yeah so what do you believe the benefits are of a community group such as yours well i think that people like to be involved where they 're part of something bigger and have a unified goal and i think it also with months when we 're doing a show it 's a project so you have a beginning a middle and an end and i think that 's always quite fun and every show is different so different people can be involved and contribute in a different way so it 's uh it 's unifying i think that 's right and at this stage also you don 't know what next year might bring i know you have shows planned but they may be in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're a community group we can adapt really quickly and because there is so much opportunity in mansfield to be able to shift and work with people 's ideas where we 're in a good position to be able to adapt and that word pivot as much as possible that 's fantastic how can the community join in and find out more about muds and the things you 're doing oh well we 're always always keen to get new people because that 's what keeps us going since 1982 it 's the involvement of different people so good question in the initial initially i would say go to our website which is muds mmuds.org.iu because then we have a link to you can join a newsletter so you 'll get first information to your email uh on anything that 's going or you can join the facebook now some people prefer email or facebook doesn 't really matter but you 'll be able to get all the information there and then when we 've got a show coming up or we 've got uh initiatives or projects or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communicate that 's fantastic and it 's a really good outlet for people like i 've mentioned the other things that are happening in the in the community so thank you so much and i hope you get some new members and all the best with all of that and bring culture to mansfield during this pandemic time and we look forward to see what the group ends up doing thank you if you want to be part of a community group that has a project underway to support mansfield residents or keep connected let me know i 'd love to share with our community all the other events and things that businesses all community groups are doing so thank you everyone for your efforts and as i 've said before i 'm so proud of our community and what we 're doing and thank you so much for what you

motion is passed item 12 uh public question time we have two questions um that have been received both questions from mr brent taylor the first question is may the council please advise on the ongoing maintenance schedule for the unsealed section of buttercup road there are often potholes and ruts that aren 't rectified for an unreasonable time posing risk of damage to vehicles uh council 's response to mr taylor 's question is that council 's road management plan list buttercup road has been graded once annually with drainage maintenance works also undertaken annually council 's road management plan can be found on council 's website under road management and this plan guides council 's work schedule and commitment on roads however despite the annual grade outline in the plan due to the increasing traffic volumes in 2020 council graded the unsealed section of buttercup road three times on the 12th of january the 20th of april and the 8th of december council also plans to grade the road again in may with a grading crew currently working in merging all these extra grades are above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management plan grading is only part of maintaining the roads in appropriate condition resheeting is also important other gut road was last re-shooted during the 2018-2019 program and council 's operations and capital works team will be reviewing and prior prioritizing future capital works on this road for inclusion in the 10-year asset management road plan question 2 from mr brent taylor is would the council consider improving line markings and signage at the intersection of malcolm and chenery street i understand this may fall into dick road 's jurisdiction response from the executive regarding that question mr taylor is chenery street and the eastern portion of malcolm street is the responsibility of regional roads victoria formerly known as vic roads council meets regularly with regional roads victoria to discuss roads within the shire council will review the line marking and signage and discuss further with regional roads victoria council 's operation and capital works team support the need for improvements to the signage and line marking at the intersection of these roads to avoid driving confusion and we 'll raise this with the department of transport representatives at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need review and relocation if possible the line marking also needs to be updated for drivers turning into cherry chinnery street from malcolm street so thank you mr taylor for both those questions uh hopefully that gives a response that meets the question item 13 is the chief executive officer officers report are there any questions from councillors regarding the ceo 's report uh thank you uh mr mayor uh ms uh ceo i 'm just wondering why under the building services section of your report um we do not have the march uh figures for the value of permanence lodge nor the monthly comparison of tournaments lodged uh for the month of march is there a reason for that through you mr mayor i 'll pass over to our general manager of infrastructure and planning maybe to respond to that it may have been an oversight but i 'll just pass it over to see if there 's anything in addition to that thank you yes i think that was an oversight um they should have been included and we will make sure they 're included in the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alexander that 's all thank you mr matt thanks councillor sladen um uh yes mr mayor just um madame ceo on page 20 of your report the figures which show the resignation of 20 volunteers for meals on wheels is there an explanation for that other than the obvious um through you mr mayor i will pass over to the general manager of community and corporate services to see if if he would like to answer that question i do have something to add perhaps but i 'll pass it over at the moment thank you um thank you madam ceo um uh councillor tien i 'm other than timing i 'm not aware of any particular occurrence that has brought that about i suspect it 's reporting timing thank you mr mayor and just to add to that last year saw the exit of a number of volunteers as we went through covert and particularly in the meals on wheels area and when we started back with volunteers we had to add the additional requirement of additional training so all our volunteers now have to go through a covet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of our volunteers that were delivering meals were in that age bracket in their 80s so i think it was about the realization of of the extra requirement that council um has now in place with covert and the code of safe delivery so a number of volunteers i do know resigned over that that type of environment which was hard hard for us to see but absolutely necessary with the covet environment thank you thank you ceo uh sorry so does that have any effect on service as such we have um through you mr mayor we have been doing a volunteer drive there 's been some media in our um in the career we 've put into media during a couple of weeks in a row and we 've also had to use staff on occasion so there has been a number of occasions where we 've had to pull staff from the office to deliver meals so we are doing a recruitment drive at the moment thank you mayor ceo there any further questions i ask for someone to move a motion regarding the ceo 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council will receive a note the chief executive officers report for the period 17th of march 21 to 13th of april 21. thank you councilwood do we have a second castle sled those in favor the motion is passed item 13.2 and 13.2.1 he 's under the jurisdiction of general manager infrastructure planning kirsten alexander and we have a guest joining us to speak on behalf of the recommendation we 're going to issue a notice of refusal to grant an amendment to the planning permit and that is ellen hogan um ellen is ellen can you hear us ellen okay welcome ellen thank you and thanks for thanks for joining us um you 'd like to speak to the to the notice i would um um thank you mr mayor and madam ceo uh just a bit of background on this application and thank you for the opportunity to just to talk to the application firstly um and it 's probably been mentioned to you but i haven 't been privy to your previous discussions if if you 've already addressed some of this application the wrong planning permit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permit was issued on the 5th of november 2020 i must say that condition 8 is still the same though on that amended permit my clients are undertaking a three-stage subdivision located on the eastern end of dead horse lane stages one and two were completed by a different developer who constructed the storm water detention basin adjacent to the mansfield whitfield road it was our belief that this detention basin was constructed to cater for all three stages of the subdivision as stage three of the subdivision progressed various emails were sent back and forth to council to ascertain what items in the permit needed finalizing so that a statement of compliance could be issued emails to ask by council 's engineering representative who was signing off on compliance advised support for an application to amend the permit to remove the condition relating to the bond and we have that in an email we understood that this was because we submitted our site environmental management plan or assemp this plan was drawn up by earthworks contractors to indicate how we would protect the site during subdivision construction phase every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been placed on the developers who had completed stages one and two and constructed the detention basin in february we therefore applied for an amendment to remove the condition relating to the bond following this consultation with council and in good faith we are now advised that our amendment has not been supported we also read in the agenda report paragraph 6 on page 12. it is noted that the accompanied semp does not properly indicate the location of settlement controls which needs to be amended and resubmitted we also lodged our cem to council in february we have written advice from council that our semp was satisfactory and we believe so also my clients met on site a few weeks ago with council engineering representatives and nurse moving contractors pre-commencement of works meeting there was no mention of changes to the them on behalf of my clients who wish me to let you know it is disappointing that we now find that the same needs amending through the offices report in a public document the agenda why have we not been formally advised weeks ago that our needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8 was submitted to council on the 24th of february based on advice from council engineering staff and is now being refused the development industry requires certainty when commencing projects of this scale it also needs a coordinated approach between various council departments so that the developer can proceed with certain certainty and definitely without any further delay thank you for the opportunity to speak to this application thanks alan thank you um counselors are there any questions of misogyny and just out of a couple questions oh sorry the castle went so i didn 't see that no that 's right thanks mr man um thank you alan for presenting that to us that 's that 's really informative um i guess from my point of view um very interesting hearing your side of the story um i 'd like more information and copies of emails and things like that to be circulated i think through the executive if that 's okay that 's probably my only comment thank you any other questions questions um just uh uh in terms of the the bond how much do you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work we 've been trying to find out from the previous developers how much they paid for it and how much their um portion was for um i think it 's about resetting replanting how much would that cost we haven 't got that information at the moment so i 'll have to engage a another engineer to give us that advice i think the bond is 1.5 times that cost and just it 's not sure the cost no we just have we have to sort that out we we have to sort that out um we hadn 't really got into that side of it um mainly because we we 'd applied for the amendment to have the bond removed so that 's something we need to go back to and ellen if there 's no bond what guarantees we have that there 's no um repercussions at all on council what protection has council got well as far as the subdivision itself goes the council 's got a site environmental management plan which should be in place to protect any downstream um sediment runoff that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pipelines connecting sewerage that 's to protect that but it 's something how do we protect it when we have say a bit of a rogue building um person that goes on there and decides not to do their own individual sediment so one of our queries was too is how do we protect our bond from somebody else who we 've got no control over we can control the site environmental management plan while we 're doing construction but we can 't control individual landowners you know they 're therefore to protect the bond but normally in place when you do a development like that you 'll put your hay bales or your sentiment controls um you know in place so that they can 't run off into the stormwater drains or end up um into this detention basin which is there to capture any sediment that runs off we 're not saying we want to we 're going to we 're going to be trying our hardest not to pollute it at all but that 's there to catch up any to catch any soup through the sediment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sites developed um which there shouldn 't be any sediment after the site to develop because they all have their lawns there so it 's just another measure to protect water quality so we can put something in place initially to protect the the sub construction stage of the subdivision but the bond appears to be there the 1.5 probably more so to protect individual when individual land owners construct on their site um council robbie thank you bro mr mayor uh ms hogan um steve robbie here how are you thank you steve um can you tell me you just mentioned in your um in your speech to us or your proposal to us that um this is stage three and i think you said that it 's a different developer is that correct it 's not the same developer yes different developers to stage one and two right so um [Music] okay thank you very much that 's that 's it 's um that 's thanks with the developer of stage 102 who put the detention basin in and i believe it was put in to cater for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council is there any other questions um now i just one quick point i have and it 's just regards say a question in the recommendation was um i 'll just read this the removal of condition a to the permit would mean that council would have to bear the cost of any works necessary to remediate the bioretention swale where it become less efficient due to discharge from the subdivision site and any later construction of dwellings in that subdivision that 's the cause that really concerns me and how does not getting a pain that bond get around and i can understand being in the development industry having guarantees as well you know for um council 's assets um i suppose what got lost in this thing was that we were advised to remove it because we had our semp in place and we did that in good faith in february put in the amendment and since then we 've been told that it 's been refused um it 's up to council to make that decision too with the bond um and if anything was to end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to be a lot of sediment for resent and replant i agree which we 're not going to put any in there because we 've got a very good well-constructed site environmental management plan to make sure that sediment doesn 't get in there during construction stage of the subdivision but as we stated in council 's agenda it 's now saying that that 's not hasn 't been supported and we we don 't know what that means so we haven 't had a formal letter from council telling us what how we have to amend our um site environmental management plan we 've only read it tonight in the agenda so we have to go back now and have that amended but we 're not sure what what we need to amend right okay counsel uh sorry any other questions sorry because uh thank you mr mayor my understanding is that um the semp that you submitted in november has been accepted um ms hogan we submitted in february yes and we have an email the february yes yes and we have an email in february that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that 's you do not need to go back and resubmit yourself because that has the the february one has been accepted is my understanding perhaps ms alexander can clarify that we 're just unsure of that because of what 's in the agenda right yes i can sorry through you mr mara can confirm that that simp has been uh accepted and that that comment in the report is not correct so just to be just to be sure ms hogan the um we are councillors are aware that the incorrect planning permit has been attached to this report and we 're also aware of the oversight in the report that refers to the november and not the february sem however my understanding is regardless of uh those two oversights it does not um allay the the officers concerns regarding um any potential um disruption to the detention basin yes yes we we 've seen that in the agenda that that 's what the conclusion was you know after everything 's been in yep yes we probably would not have applied for an amendment though if we 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves some time finna since february but moving on um yes i agree what you said cancel sudden okay is there any more questions or comments thank you alan for your time there and you made your points very clearly so thank you for that um do we revert back to the council meeting now through you mr mayor we 're still in the council meeting yes and ms hogan can go off video and off mute on mute and listen to the rest of the council meeting thank you okay thank you there you are mr mayor well good thank you uh counselor team uh yes mr may just let you know i 'm having some unstable internet problems so uh yeah i 'm not sure i have been losing a little bit of it but then i come back in so if i seem to be inactive that 's why right okay thanks cancer team um do we have any further discussion questions um that 's yeah i 'd like to ask the question through you mr mayor that uh if this if if the stage three of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would this requirement still be requested or are we or not um miss alexander would you want to comment on that uh yes i i don 't think that would change things my understanding is on the stage one and two the the basin was constructed at that time but it 's now been handed over to council so whether it was the same developer or a new developer i would anticipate that our response you know the condition would still stand thank you um can i just go sorry council team uh yeah i just had a question just regarding um miss hogan 's comment about the um the emails sent to her on the 24th of the second from um council staff regarding the um uh the the need for section eight have we got um clear direction on that of of whether that was sent or not through you mr mayor um i 'm looking at ms alexander i 'd probably pass over to i 'm our manager of planning yes that 'd be a that response um noting that ms crane has only recently joined council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear can you hear me now this might have to speak up a little bit okay so sorry i have to lean in because the microphone 's not awesome um through you mr mayor the um planning permit so the advice was from one of the development engineers to apply for an amendment to the planning permission the amendment to the planning permit has to be assessed under the provisions of the planning and environment act and the intent of the provisions that apply to the land at the time so whilst the advice was to apply for an amendment to remove the condition and that is advice that you know like i mean i wasn 't here at the time and perhaps that is a conversation we can take offline certainly with the engineering department going forward but certainly from a planning perspective we have to assess it under the relevant provisions of the planning and environment act which is where the recommendation is sitting in terms of the refusal under the provisions of that legislation not necessarily and that 's not necessarily an area of expertise for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sure i hope that answers this direct question i 'm i 'm happy to provide a bit more information in relation to some of the commentary that um ms hogan has made if you 'd like yep um um in terms of this application yes uh so we acknowledge that there 's an error in the attachment in that the incorrect permits in there but um we made i did speak to council and let you know about that earlier in relation to the semp um i have actually emailed ms hogan today to confirm that that cent is acceptable and we won 't be looking to have it amended the um the question we have is that certainly whilst the stem is a big part of protection of council assets in the short term while they 're doing the construction it doesn 't it doesn 't give us enough protection to remove the condition because if the works aren 't undertaken in accordance with that cent so say the developer change the development changes hands again and the people that take it over don 't start working in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation where the where the retardation basin is damaged and we do need to try and find a way to avoid that um the comments earlier about the previous developer who were the ones that constructed it if it was the same developer now it 's a council asset they would definitely have the same condition for a bond because it 's our asset and we need to maintain that the other thing that 's important to to note and i and i understand how that could feel unfair and i and i respect ms hogan 's position on that but it would have happened if it had been the same developer um the other thing worth noting that i do take on board that there is some concern about the permit applicant having some surety that they 're not going to be protecting the basin and other people will create damage to it and i understand their concern in that regard however what we 've uh we 're more than happy as council officers to do the community protection um local law number one at 26.2 has a requirement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroy damage or interfere with a council asset so we 're more than happy to provide advice to people downstream of this development so between the retardation basin and this development site giving them some general advice about their obligations under our community local law to try and make sure there 's more surety for this developer in relation to any potential impacts on the basin that they may not cause so we certainly want it happy to try and work with them in that in that respect outside of the um recommendation that we would still like to retain that condition in relation to the bond on the asset thank you ms crain um just with respect to um some questions uh good um miss hogan if we um don 't go ahead with this bond do is council financially exposed there is a risk so while the planning permit says they have to operate in accordance with the site environmental management plan because it 's not on the land that they own if there is damage um after the subdivision has been completed so this bond is refunded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be the development and it will take some time for those blocks to be individually developed out after that point it will have all settled down enough so no silt will be running off anymore but there is a risk that if once a statement of compliance issues there 's no longer an obligation on the developer to do any remediation works because a planning permit for subdivision is considered spent once the statement of compliance has been issued and we don 't have any real grounds in relation to enforcement past that point the main rate why we have bonds for subdivisions is for that exact reason we we do maintenance bonds when we have road construction to make sure that the road that it is constructed is also maintained for a period of time post statement of compliance and this is a similar thing but it 's about protecting a retardation basin in this instance and is this bond and the terms of the bond fairly common for this sort of development yes they are okay council has any other questions council really i 'd like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monetary value of this bond is it hundreds of thousands of dollars or is it are we talking i don 't know five ten grand what what are we talking at 1.5 doesn 't make any sense for me yeah thank you mr mayor i certainly understand that we they would need to get a quote essentially the quote would need to be to um just to desilt and to reset with um replay and replant the existing basin so i don 't imagine it would be within the hundreds of thousands i couldn 't give you an uh an estimate but um ms hogan had mentioned some prices that were um under twenty thousand dollars based on some of the information she had had and i imagine that they would be less than that in this instance but certainly um if there 's no damage to the basin and with the proper retardation the proper works on the site post development with some hay bales as um ms hogan was mentioning and on top of us making sure we work with the other landowners to know their obligations it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're also more than happy to do um post statement of compliance inspections to have an agreed position as to which state that the um basin will be accepted back in and the bond refunded on through that process to try and provide them a little bit more surety there too thank you thank you any other questions counselors okay counselors do we have a motion to move excuse me mr mayor i 'm sorry to interrupt we 've just lost councillor 10 in terms of governance rules um we do need to make sure councillors are present that um that have agreed to be present tonight so just waiting to see if council team can come back online great thank you thanks james thanks council too sorry i 'm just

are there any questions counselors on what 's before us sorry castle webb sorry thanks mr man um just one comment regarding the community consultation i know we 've passed a policy around community consultation but i don 't think we 've actually seen the uh i guess the full procedure behind it will this consultation schedule this engagement will that be suitable to meet the requirements of the new local government act through you mr man um madame ceo or miss alexander whatever you like to address that through you mr mayor could that could um the question please be repeated i was chatting to our administration then just to get some stuff happening behind the scenes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that uh the community consultation side of this uh particular strategy i know we 've passed a policy for new community consultation but i don 't think we 've seen the full procedure or the method how that 's going to happen so the consultation that we 're proposing in this particular strategy is that going to be sufficient for deliberative engagement for the new local government act thank you through you mr mayor thank you councillor webb um council is only required to undertake deliberative engagement through for a couple of elements so one being your community vision project your financial plan and asset management um and i think there 's a couple others so yes to answer your questions yes this does meet the requirements of the local government act thank you thank you very much you made himself uh cancer team quezadine john mute um sorry mr mayor just a question regarding the report up in the report updates and it it states that the agricultural employment numbers have been reviewed from the previous draft of the strategy and also a reference for climate change has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is well first the question agricultural employment um what 's changed there in terms of uh the report we 're looking at now through you mr meow pass over to our general manager instruction planning to answer that question thank you thanks through you mr mayor um in relation to the detail on the numbers um i don 't have that at hand but as i understand it they basically did a refresh um because it had been probably about you know some time since the first paper was put together um so we might have to take that one on notice in terms of any um specific change that came about but we did ask them to go back and respond to questions that were arose from the council of briefing um and that was one of the things that they just reviewed refreshed and updated but we can get you some more specifics on that i 'm i i 'm not sure if um our manager planning would have anything to add to that i 'll just check in with her just in case she 's got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional details other than they 've been based on the abs data so i imagine it 's because the data in the abs has been updated but we can certainly confirm that and get back to counsellors explicit um thank you yeah listen you may have to speak up just next time and speak just hear you we got the message just here thank you any other questions councils do we have a motion to move castle sled uh

consent rezoning of land under the government land planning service with his line at withers lane the responsible officer general manager infrastructure planning kirsten alexander um alexander would you like to speak at all to this through you mr mayor now i think this one 's fairly straightforward um but happy to take any questions that counselors have council is there any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one and it has been touched on in the report already um regarding that a little overlap there between the township approaches zone and the um the requested rezoning land in terms of uh what levers or controls we have over the use of that land um do we see any potential issues in unsightly infrastructure or things being built in that area on that approach through you mr mayor um i in terms of what they 're proposing to do my understanding it 's a buffer zone um so i wouldn 't expect so um but i might just if i could throw you mr may just ask our manager of planning um if she has anything further to add on there thanks for saying that 's correct um through you mr may uh i don 't generally these buffers are kept clear because they are about providing buffers from the um for the wastewater facilities however um we can include some commentary in our response to them that outlines our concerns and reiterates that we would like that to be maintained and when we put a response back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other questions counselors castle side uh thank you mr mayor uh my question uh whoever wants to answer it is what impact this may have on the alternate route or sometimes referred to as the heavy vehicle bypass thanks for you mr mayor um i i do not think there will be any impact on that route based on what is proposed given that it is a buffer zone yep no worries so we 're allowed to do that within the buffer zone yeah it at the sorry three items the um the land that 's in question um it 's not obviously on the road corridor so the road corridor we would still it won 't have any impact on that right okay thank you thank you any other questions do we have a motion castle robbie thank you mr mayor i 'd like to make the recommendation that council having

2021 uh are there any ques under the auspices of mr chris snook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comments i just got one question if i could have um oh sorry that 's right so sorry mr nick i was flipping through my pages to get to the question that i 've um written down here um and sorry about that and it 's um a question i suppose for mr snook at um 13.3.5 and page 42 i see that we 've overspent 110 000 in legal expenses to date um i 'd like to know where where that overspend has occurred and uh i may have another question after that yeah through you mr mayor thank you for the question counselor um i will give just a quick um uh response and then i will pass to ms alexandra to talk um as the overspend as stated 110 000 relates to vcat proceedings um the three mr mayor passed in this alexander to elaborate on the activity related to those v cap the cases sorry you missed me um yes that is correct we have a number of cases that are ongoing um there was approximately uh 80 000 that was spent on the convenience restaurant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh it is and there 's still a case on going for the service station um on high street directly alongside that site um that 's estimated to end up around 40 000 um in relation to supporting council 's decision there and we 're estimating so that makes a a total of 120 and we 're estimating about another 40 000 um in order to defend council 's decision um in relation to the other service station which is on the corner of malcolm and chenery um obviously that depends on whether those cases that haven 't been finished whether they go the full duration but that 's based on our best guess at this point in time my best estimate thanks miss alexander uh casarati yeah thanks thanks for that um ms alexander i 've got a further question i suppose in relation to these ongoing legal costs have we got an estimate and i suppose it 's a ball up in the air estimate really that any idea as to what the the expected cost all up is going to be please yes through you mr mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent for those three cases is around 160 000 um it may if the final case is shortened and doesn 't go for you know the anticipated length of time we expect the cost to be less than that but that 's our upper end estimate thank you just a um what percentage of our legal budget would that be i joined sorry three men i might hand to mr snook for that one yeah sorry mr mayor i would need to say that question unnoticed it would be a large portion of our um legal um our legal budget that would be an extraordinary amount an extraordinary amount yeah thanks mrs uh ms kingsley did you want to add anything there and welcome sorry just working the mute button um we don 't budget legal expenses so in terms of the percentage of legal because legal is always unknown unless there 's a case already in existence at budget date um so we don 't actually put legal fees into the budget so they typically come in as unbudgeted so in terms of answering the percentage we couldn 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budget right thank you it 's disappointing it 's got to such a large amount of money councils any questions any further questions on that well casserole yeah um mr may probably not a question as such but it may be a comment that um council were asked to support the community um on one of these vcat hearings and i think we should say that we have done that we are supporting the community that 's what they wanted um and uh and so i 'll leave it there thanks mr man thanks cancer rally any other questions or comments counselors do we have a motion for the finance report thanks mr mayor uh motion being that council receives the you today finance report for the period first july 2020 to 31st march 2021 a second at council ravi thank you we like to speak to the motion or second we 'll speak to the second in the notion those in favor questions passed thank you item 13.3.6 the proposed budget 21.22 um again under the also says mr krishna would you like like to speak to the report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report as read that obviously it 's the proposed 21-22 budget which is being presented this evening for endorsement um the draft be made available for public exhibition for 28 days and public submissions will be received and considered by council prior to the budget being formally adopted in june are there any other questions mr so can you just um just for anyone watching when is the public meetings to be held um you know off the top of your head uh um yeah you missed in the local and for non-residents grimster we do have a schedule of dates that we 'll make public um i don 't think i can recite them off the top of my head i can ask mr kennedy if she has an information available however they will be published on our website and due at social media and other forums so the public will certainly have adequate notice of the forums and the dates are spread between now and the end of the submission so um it will be a thorough process but um i haven 't got the dates off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a motion regarding the 2122 budget council return uh yes mr mayor um recommendation is that council formerly prepare the proposed budget 2021 for the purpose of section 94 of the local government act 2020 give public notice in the mansfield courier on council 's website and facebook page for the preparation the proposed budget 2122 and make available copies of the proposed budget 2122 for public inspection purposes and three in accordance with section 223 of the local government act 1989 establishes a special committee of council consisting of all councils with a quorum of three councillors to hear submissions in relation to the proposed budget 2021-22 on tuesday the 25th of may 2021 at the council chamber or held remotely via electronic means thanks considering and that answers the question sorry chris of uh mr snook of uh when the date is in mansfield uh castle robbie second question the second the motion thanks thank you uh those in favor of motion uh excuse me mr mayor yes sorry mr mayor the opportunity for the mover to speak please and then the secondary and any other councillors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak uh yes mr mayor yeah yeah yes mr mayor thanks yeah i 'd just like to um to firstly thank all the staff and the officers for uh preparing this budget it was a it was a very challenging budget i think it took two or three or four more sessions than uh was initially proposed because there was a lot of debate there was a lot of conversations around different parts of the budget and i 'd like to thank the other councillors too for for that robust debate and as people will see ratepayers we 'll see we 've we 've settled for a zero percent rate increase which is basically giving back to the community in acknowledging the uh the hard times that we 've had over the last 12 months and the challenges that we still may face in the future and uh it 's it 's definitely a response to that it 's a fairly back to basics budget there 's a lot of money going into infrastructure we 're available and it 's uh so it is a very solid financial document @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to speak to the nation yes thanks mr mayor um just touching on councillor teen 's point that um there was robust debate in the end um i 'd like to say that that from my point of view this budget took into consideration how many people have done it pretty tough in the last year um i know that there are a lot of people in mansfield that are that are struggling and this reflects um that view also shows the community that we are looking this whole council is looking at uh recovery of roads as well so um i 'm uh i would have liked to see more money you know but there is no none so we have to do the best with what we 've got thank you mr man that 's concerned is there anyone else want to speak to the motion council thank you mr mayor um as cancer arabia just said there is no more money the reason there is no moral money is that the propose and keep in mind this is just that proposed budget and what we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on public exhibition and seek community input and i strongly encourage that community input while appreciating councillor tian and councillor ravi 's sentiment for a rate holiday given the the challenges that many people have experienced over the past 12 months to my thinking this is a naive short-sighted and financially irresponsible proposed budget what we are doing is we are reducing our revenue and a reduction in revenue leads to a reduction in services so i say to the community have a look and if a reduction in revenue via a rate holiday where the state government has said set the rate cap at 1.5 which would mean for mansfield shire council uh an increase in revenue of 189 000 uh in the next 12 months over a 10-year period this compounds to a loss of 2.2 million dollars on top of that there will be three million dollars of debt 2.6 million with a loan so we 're increasing our debt by a hundred and fifty percent it 'll cost us three billion dollars all up by the time we pay it back that 's both principal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduction in services and just yesterday this council embarked on a consultation on the home and community care age services um a review and as we 've seen in tonight 's uh agenda in the ceo 's report the number of hours the council provides for community care not only in mansfield but in the outlying communities if we want to see that continue and not be privatized as one member of public who was at the bonnie dune meeting yesterday said once you privatize these things it becomes profit before people and my concern is with this proposed budget that is what we 'll be looking at so i do ask the community to make sure you read this carefully and that you make a submission thank you mr mayor can you castle sudden any other comments thank you mr mayor um just a couple of points i do mirror a lot of councillor sladden 's concerns um the draft budget and and again reinforcing that it is a draft out for community consultation and feedback which we need um seeking to borrow up to three million dollars uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currently cheap uh the costs alone for the borrowing will be about three hundred thousand dollars um just to put that in a bit of perspective our current entire borrowings for the council is only at one point nine million um so over the next 10 years we 're going to be paying that off at about 288 000 per year um so for a bit of perspective again on that our new initiatives council-funded initiatives and this draft budget was about four hundred thousand so by the time you take 288 thousand dollars of repayments in future budgets out of that it leaves us with about a hundred and twelve thousand dollars for any new initiatives council funded for the next 10 years it essentially means we 're fully reliant on state and federal grants to offer anything new in our community anything new and a hundred and twelve thousand dollars it would barely leave us enough money to develop any plans to shovel ready stage for us to even apply for these grants you know we 're experiencing unprecedented growth we 've all seen it and we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expectations in the services that we deliver i really fear that having little to no new initiatives over the next 10 years will really put us in a really undesirable position we 'll have a brand new truck bypass that 'll be completely unused because there 'll be a completely no desire to live work or start a new business here in mansfield so it does lead me to my next point regarding uh the rate cap increase again mirroring council sladden 's points regarding our concerns over not increasing the rates for this year i do understand 2020 was a very difficult year for everybody um in perspective passing on a one point five percent increase to the rate cut would imp would impact on average residential people about twenty dollars a year twenty dollars a year by not passing that on multiplies out to about 2.2 million over 10 years and that 's 2.2 million dollars of services that we can 't provide so new initiatives supporting our outlying communities supporting our businesses our elderly our young people it 's support that we will not be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be really interesting to see what the community has to say about some of these points be very interesting to say i agree parts of this budget represent poor judgment irresponsible financial management and to be honest almost contempt of the greater community in some aspects really interested to hear what happens thank you thank you councilwoman um is there any other comments i think rather than some of this there 's a slight degree of scaremongering going amongst some of those comments i think rather than a continue some of those the community will give us their feedback on what they think about the whole budget and uh we look forward to hearing that but i certainly look forward to hearing that and i think the council does as well are there any other comments mr mayor the mover has the right to reply should he wish to take that up mr councillor thanks uh excuse me point of order thank you mr sorry madam ceo um there is no right of reply because there was nobody voting um or speaking against the motion i 'm i 'm sorry @

i misinterpreted the comments made that we 're against the motion to no thank you but um the right the writer reply still sits with the mover council sladden because at this stage there isn 't an

@ @ @ @ mayor i object to the use of the term scaremongering by yourself and the deputy mayor they 're facts not scary yeah well it 's rhetoric the council said it 's not electric facts we should just

ongoing tenure for the men 's shed in errol street given that grant monies allocated cannot be spent nor can other grants be applied for council has a lease agreement with mace for the land on which the men 's shed operates the men 's shed has operated since its inception under the auspice of mace it is council 's understanding that this auspice arrangement articulated in an auspice agreement and an mou signed in february 2003 between mace and the men 's shed was established to enable the community shed program to happen as the men 's shed was not an incorporators association at the time council also understands that the relationship between mace and the men 's shed has deteriorated and that the men 's shed seeks to separate from mace however there continues to be a disagreement on the ownership of the assets and on the spirit and intent of the original agreements council has been working with both parties without success council 's advice to the men 's shed is to finalise a lease agreement with mates and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to continue continue to provide excellent community programs council has also written to mace expressing its disappointment that this matter has not been resolved council has no inter intention to intervene any further the lease for the land remains valid and continues to exist with mace we 'll move on to item number 13 which is officers report 13.1 the departmental reports madam ceo thank you madam mayor the departmental reports are presented for council 's consideration there 's lots of good um news in there and activities over the last month um i present it for council 's consideration thank you thank you very much councillors there is a recommendation there would anyone like to speak to any item or ask any questions about that councillor sladden uh thank you madam mayor uh not specifically related uh to the content of the reports but there is a very uh informative department report there from the community services department and i would just like to acknowledge ms melanie hotten who has left council and left the community services department to go and work with bushfire recovery victoria and i would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you for her contribution to manchester in that role uh she 's certainly um not only in that role but in other areas within council uh played a um fantastic role and uh wish you all the best thank you madame thank you i support your words there 's also counsellors any other comments council over thanks madam mayor yes in the reports i 'd like to highlight the um the report that the defibrillator has been installed and actually noticed that which is fantastic on the steps external steps of the shire building leading up to the council chambers and thanks for that initiative it 's actually a friend of mine involved in another town recently where they saved a life of the chat because there was a defibrillator available so great initiative thank you thank you councillors good to have someone move in motion there councillor volckering seconder councillor olva all in favor thank you we 'll move on to item 13.2.1 the mansfield township approaches planning controls and guidelines study report to commence planning scheme amendment and seek authorisation from the minister of planning with our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be there for their report councillors if there are we have a recommendation on page 21 that if someone would like to move a motion and so moving the motion councilor slavin would you like to read it out please uh not just yet madam mayor i have a question for our general manager if that 's okay that 's perfectly right um general manager um so yeah just forgot your favorite moment terribly sorry um in terms of the timing of this uh amendment uh or proposed amendment i 'm just unclear in terms of why the urgency to do it now given that uh council is uh reviewing its uh planning strategy which will result in um well may result in further uh amendments and just from a cost point of view would it not be wiser to do them all at once instead of a more piecemeal approach thanks councillor um that is an excellent question the uh the reason for why now is as i understand there 's been quite a bit of work undertaken to get to this point um the and without a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough you won 't have controls in place over or on um you know controls in place over those approaches um i don 't in terms of the background to it um i think that 's obviously been a matter of concern to council uh there 's been quite a bit of work put in at this point it 's a notification to their minister and then it 'll go out on public exhibition once the approval comes back from the department so i guess i 'm hoping that answers your question but um the broader strategy i think um you know can continue on um but i think this is something that obviously has been identified as being of concern to council in the past so that 's why it 's been progressed in advance of the broader strategy thank you councillor uh thank you thank you miss alexander um second question is has um has any preliminary discussions with the relevant department uh regarding the likelihood of the minister looking at this amendment uh in its um in its current form um through you madam mayor i understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the department has been quite favorable thank you thank you for that so in doing so i 'm happy to move the recommendation to council one confirm resolution four of item 10.4.1 of the ordinary meeting of council held on 26th of june 2018 stating use the mansfield township approaches planning controls and guidelines study june 2018 to inform the preparation of an amendment to review schedule 1 to the design and development overlay alpine approaches and township gateways two endorse the draft mansfield planning scheme ordinance associated with the mansfield township approaches as the basis to prepare an application for authorization from the minister of planning three write to the minister of planning requesting authorization to amend the manslaughter planning scheme under section eight a uh two of the planning and environment act 1987 four upon receipt of authorization make any changes necessary to comply with conditions of authorization and five upon satisfaction of any conditions of authorization exhibit the proposed amendment pursuant to section 19 of the planning and environment act 1987. thanks ken thank you council sladden do i have a second er of the motion council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move on to item 13.2.2 the amendment to the heightened manner development plan and we have the general manager again um supporting us through this and very remiss of me i welcome the general manager to her new position and also to your first council meeting so that 's remiss of me so sorry about that um any questions counsellors in relation to the recommendation on page 27 do i have someone move a motion that 's larva i 'd better put off mute and a mirror yes look i have a motion and the proposed motion is i 'll read it that council defer consideration of the amendment to heightened manner development plan first of all to allow advertising the proposed amendment to the wider community for council to consider their feedback and secondly to provide council with further information that presents an overview of the reasons why the design guideline lines need to be removed and any potential impact their removal may have thank you do i have a seconder for the motion counselor anyone against the motion all those in favor carried thank you move on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have a recommendation on page 32 do i have someone move that as a motion please counselor oliver do we have a seconder thank you councillor oliver would you like to read the motion as it stands please recommendation that council adopt the mansfield show council waste management strategy 2020 2025. thank you and a seconder councillor sorry western dog those in favor thank you that is carried we move on to 13.3.1 council managed events um madam ceo if you lead us on that and we have a recommendation on page 37 do i have anyone move that as a motion please counselor oliver do i have a seconder anyone sorry you 're second of councillor london no we have no second or do we i have an alternative motion thank you madam mayor yes i do um my recommendation is cancel one due to the current corona virus pandemic and the restrictions on the number of people permitted to gather and the likely prolonged nature of this environment cancel the mansfield high country festival for spring 2020 and two continue to plan to hold a modified lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that may exist in november 2020 and three contact all key stakeholders about this decision to avoid unnecessary planning and expense thank you do we have a second for that motion councillor western door anyone against councillor oliver councillor sladden would you like to speak to the motion please certainly thank you madam there um as the alternate notion could uh put forward uh does acknowledge the current coronavirus pandemic however to cancel um an event as far as way at the end of november at this stage i personally feel is premature now i i don 't have a crystal ball nobody has a crystal ball we don 't know what 's going to happen in um in november we may still be in lockdown however my reason my main reason for asking for this festival to continue is i am aware of the timelines that is uh required in planning such an event now the event may not be in the form that we currently know it but a modified event i believe will uh provide a focus particularly for lakeside communities in terms of a celebration and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ festival will also go a long way to furthering um and keeping the momentum of the lake yielding activation plan which cancel has adopted and endorsed the lake is currently at 53 the forecast for rain is good over spring and i just would like to give lakeside communities in particular in particular an opportunity to garner some of the economic benefit uh that such an event may bring thank you madame thank you councillor western dawg would you like to speak for the motion thank you madam mayor um i i do so with some misgiving and that is you know echoing councillor starting 's comments we don 't know where we 're going to be in november but i i do think that the nature of the events held on the lakeside are probably going to be able to be held within some of the constraints of things like social distancing and and some of the other restrictions that we operate under so i 'd like to leave my options open for that um i i think somewhere somewhere between now and then we 're going to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i i share councillor sladden 's view that it 's probably a little premature to say right now we don 't do this in november when there could be options that allow it to happen thank you council oliver would you speak against the motion please thank you madam mayor um look i 'd really like to be able to um to see the festival happen but unfortunately i have some concerns um firstly i think the risk of it not being able to take a place and the risk of us wasting the rate payers money wasting council staff time in preparing for it the risk is that it doesn 't go ahead i think it 's really important that we take seriously um the spending of that money in that time secondly i think there 's been a lot of concern expressed in our community about attracting visitors particularly from out of the shire into our area if there 's any any chance of their communities well-being and health being affected as we know people were not meant to be going to mount bula when it was open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mount bula it was happening and i had many community people contact me with concerns of that happening i think it 's what 's happening elsewhere um if we just look in mansfield the mansfield show has been cancelled in late october sorry november um further afield we can look at western australia who 've got a fantastic record at the moment with the with the virus control they 've cancelled the perth show so if you look at the events in other states and in our states most of them have been postponed from 2020 and the experts are saying the second wave of this pandemic will take a lot longer to clear than the first wave so that 's my concerns and i don 't want to see us preparing and wasting time and money thank you anyone wish to speak for or against councillor bulgarian uh thank you madam yeah look um i think uh councillor sladen said that within i think he 's an uh amendment motion was something along the lines of uh within this restrictions applying at the time and i didn 't quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my uh volume here i 'm just wondering if we can get the recommendation again countless latin could you read the motion please certainly okay that cancels one due to the current coronavirus pandemic restrictions on the number of people permitted to gather and the likely prolonged nature of this environment cancel the mansfield high country festival for spring 2020 two council continues to plan to hold a modified lake eldon festival within the existing budget and any restrictions that may exist in november 2020 and three contact all key stakeholders about this decision to avoid unnecessary planning and expense thank you very much councillor volkering did you want to speak to anything no that 's uh thank you madam mayor that 's clarified it for me i just wasn 't quite sure about point two three and four and i think i understand the motion now that point two becomes actually point three so that 's fine thank you very much and i i suppose sorry i 'm just sorry what sorry councillor dawg sorry madame i 'm i 'm just wondering about the logistics of this kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a decision um at some point we have one more council meeting to go before we go into caretaker mode and once we 're in caretaker mode we won 't be in a position to make a decision one way or the other can i suggest that we defer the decision until the september meeting and then decide whether in the remaining two months it 's worth persevering with this and i 'm wondering where the council is latin would be prepared to move that amendment your comments with that i think we 're talking about a really short time frame in that leaving it till the end of september to do any work either way um i 'll ask the ceo to speak on this please thank you madam mayor it was seen as really important to get this item up before um in front of council now given the planning that would need to commence immediately um in terms of council making a decision in caretaker period now i might refer to our governance coordinator but i don 't see this as qualifying as a decision council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think the high country festival which is a bigger festival needs there needs to be a decision on that immediately because of the planning involved in that and certainly with the lake ildon won a much smaller festival that perhaps could wait i haven 't got the events coordinated with me tonight but that perhaps could wait another meeting but i certainly wouldn 't advise um you two to wait with the high country festival because the planning does need to start immediately i 'll go back to councillor sladden because you put the motion uh thank you madam mayor um i just would like to address uh some of councillor olga 's concerns we just have an answer to that first because i 'll be coming back to you for your right of reply in a minute oh thank you i thought you 'd forgotten about that um uh no i i want to proceed as for the alternate motion thank you so anyone else i would like to actually just add to councillor oliver 's statements i think it 's really important for council to continue our really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state government but also i am concerned about the resources of our council staff who are already extremely stretched so i will go to you councillor sladen for your right to reply uh thank you madam mayor for the opportunity um firstly council has an existing events coordinator so that person given there 's no events happening at the moment that person i know she 's heavily involved in the business and community uh recovery advisory uh recovery committee but that is her role so we 've got somebody there we 've got a person on the ground who has done this festival many many times and we 've already got the budget that 's already in the budget so we 're not wasting money we 're not spending money we 'll only spend money when and if such an event occurs but we need to plan for it and so we have the staff to do it and we have the necessary budget because my concern is that we cancel this and those funds get redirected elsewhere or end up backing general revenue and i 'm concerned that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah i clearly acknowledge the uh concerns around corona virus et cetera but as councillor westender said you know we 've got a very creative events person and there are ways that some modified form of the event could possibly proceed which is why we need to make a decision now so that that planning can be undertaken thank you madame thank you councillors laden we have all seen the motion could i have those in favor those against the motion is carried madam mayor sorry could i have my opposition recorded please we will have to have a another vote for that can we have a vision division please and we 'll record the vote those in favor councillor western dawg councillor sladden council vulcan those against councillor atlee and councillor oliver the motion is carried thank you everyone we move to item 13.4.1 and i will leave the meeting given the conflict of interest and i call on the deputy mayor councillor peter oliver to take the chair for this item thank you thank you madam mayor um i think we have two presentations so andrew grimwade and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you welcome jeff thank you welcome mr andrew hello welcome to andrew can you hear me we can hear you councillor oliver here uh could i thank you councillor and your other councillors for the opportunity to talk to you about the beer light matter yes at the outset can i say i understand the council 's desire to keep costs down and we 're grateful for the 400 discount on the community centre but it is in the context of rates that residents pay now in the region of 80 000 a year and so i 'm speaking for 70 residents who feel like unlike other rate payers who pay their rates they don 't get their streets swept their point of view they feel it 's the principle they think it 's unfair and inequitable and from their point of view they don 't think that ownership of the roads is the issue it 's not much money but from their point of view they feel that sweeping of the streets should meet the pub test and so uh we urge the councillors to vote for option one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doyle uh thank you chairman um i would like to reiterate what andrew has said and just point out a few other little interesting facts about our village just be alive uh i 'm on the board there i 'm not a resident there but the residents are independent living environment this is not aged care in the strict sense of the word these are very well run and and very vibrant people in these in these uh homes that we have there as andrew said we have approximately 70 odd residents at the moment in 50 odd homes those 50 odd homes in the next year to year and a half will be in excess of 60 homes thereby increasing the rates that we pay to the council by approximately twenty thousand dollars on today 's terms of rates so our rating situation at the moment is eighty thousand dollars or thereabouts and uh within the next year or so it 'll be about a hundred thousand dollars so we think it 's very reasonable to ask you for a very small involvement uh the street sweeper we understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweep the streets in our village so it won 't be the whole 60 dollars an hour that they charge you at this stage so we 'd certainly appreciate you rejecting the recommendation that you have before you and voting on option one on our behalf thank you for your time thank you jeff um have any counsellors got questions of jeff or sir andrew here council sladen uh thank you um cancer over um andrew or jeff uh could either of you uh acknowledge that currently council provides a discount on rates uh for the um the block the community hall uh at the allite would you like me to answer andrew yes um yes that is correct paul we get a 400 or thereabouts discount on a rate of approximately four thousand dollars on the community center so that 's included that four thousand dollars is included in the total value of rates independently charged to each unit which totals approximately eighty thousand dollars right would you be prepared to compromise there i certainly would love to hear you say yes you 'd love to give us what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ split the difference between 400 and 720 well i 'm not sure it 'll be 720 in the end anyway uh paul could i answer that uh question councillor uh i think it 's the principle that counts here yes that is that they pay their full rates as if they were a normal rate payer in mansfield and they feel that part of those rates should go towards this very minimal cost of sweeping the streets yes and my reply to that andrew would be that there are many people who pay their rates who live on dirt roads and don 't get their uh their road swept because they don 't have uh curb and channeling because it 's only curb and channeled roads to get the street sweeping service be that as it may at councillor it is still the the principle they 're concerned about thanks for andrew and um thanks council sladden has anyone else got a question any other counsellors well i 'd like to thank you jeff and sir andrew for your time and presenting thank you very much counselor thank you thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone that would like to move the motion please yes counselor western door i 'm gonna move the motion as as recommended that the council offers to include a monthly street cleaning for the private roads in belight village as part of council 's street sweeping program at full cost recovery thanks council western door have we got a second now i will second the motion have we got anyone to speak against councillor vulcan uh thank you uh deputy mayor um yeah i 'd like to speak against it and i think it 's somewhat unfortunate that the focus has been on rates i 'm taking a slightly broader view about uh the broader benefit to our community in terms of what beer light brings to mansfield this coronavirus has highlighted a number of things but you know the impact on the older residents across australia has been uh significant and somewhat tragic especially to those uh much much older but um here in mansfield we 're really fortunate not only do the residents of bayli pay their rates but they bring significant economic value to our community and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large sector of the community i think we 're really fortunate that we 've got a number of uh people who reside at their life village who provide a lot of social connection uh they provide a lot of support for a range of organizations across town both private organizations and also charitable organizations i think we 're really penny-pinching to some extent and we 're saying to these people who bring significant benefit to our community that we can 't sweep their streets i mean really what has the world come to uh you know what these are people who 've paid rights not just in our shy but across there i say numerous shires and and lgas across perhaps victoria and australia and probably even beyond that contributed thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars and here we are saying oh we can 't we can 't sweep the streets i understand where we 're coming from can i interrupt sorry really i guess it 's just panty pinching in my view sorry counselor welcoming what was your motion um castle western door the motion was that council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the for the private roads in beerlight village as part of council 's street sweeping program at full cost recovery so you 're really speaking in favor of that council vulcan is that right well i 'm speaking against it i 'd like to read it i 'd like to propose that we leave off that last phrase at full cost recovery okay so if i could interrupt i 'm sorry um through the chair just the the person moving the motion hasn 't spoken to the motion yet in terms of process and it might be worthwhile hearing that so you can understand the motion thank you thanks sir miss ceo mr harry westernville council at western would you like to speak to the motion i i guess i 'm coming at it from a principal point of view these are private streets we have a number of them in the shire if we if we sweep be a light streets the private streets in beer light then anyone that 's living on a private road has the precedent that they want their roads swept as well um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me here 's cancer sledding uh thank you councillor olva um i certainly hear both um councillors uh volkering and western dorp um now i know that we 've got a motion um before us uh but i would just like to flag an alternate notion um and that is that sorry through the chair councillor sladden um you can flag an alternative motion but not say it at this point in time no no no no i wasn 't going to say it the ceo i wasn 't at this point in time um but i i just want to say that i believe that

particular project the main roads street lights project this is an expansion of the previous project which is rolled out which is converting halogen street lights to led stage one business cases are complete and several councils intend to progress and complete their designs with a view to apply for vic roads to fund the projects i don 't believe mansfield is in a position at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greening project is fully developed uh and a grant application for sixty thousand has been submitted to develop um and strathbergy is the lead shire on this project uh and the environmental environmentally sustainable design in planning scheme for subdivisions project stage two has been completed uh which is a framework tool for assessing esd elements uh during the planning permit stage

complete uh which is basically a business plan for collective procurement of renewable energy uh stage two uh the tender is developed and at the process the alliance is in the process of running a

cheap uh renewable energy um as part of the meeting we do do a regional wrap-around uh from all of the shires all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things happening in this space lots of money flying around

acceptance of these reports council robbie the emotion that uh we recommend that council note the verbal reports provided by councillors in relation to their representation on external committees thank you council rally your second to please no further questions those in favor the motion is carried item 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public which is from mrs rebecca mills and the question from mrs mills mrs mills is i would love to see the council spend money on recreating some atmosphere and ambiance in the main street um being fairy lights for christmas decorations etc is the council interested in investing in this the response to mrs mills question is that council understands how important decorations are to creating a sense of community and celebration at christmas uh castle also provides christmas decorations to the town centre of mansfield and these include a nine metre tall decorated christmas tree uh christmas decorations installed on the waste and recycling bins and christmas flags at the roundabout council also provides provides the labor to install and remove the decorations and their upkeep during the christmas season castle has a budget of 3 500 allocated to the installation and dismantling of the christmas decorations last christmas uh bendigo bank generously funded the purchases of the ferry lights which were installed in the trees along the high street medium strip and council has accepted the ongoing responsibility to maintain these lights and we expect that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strip for some years to come so thank you mrs mills for the question and hopefully that addresses uh what you 've asked are there any questions at all any further questions madam ceo thank you mr mayor um in terms of the ceo 's report the monthly report it 's there and i will take it as read i will point out though on page 10 of the report we have included this this time for the first time a comparison to other years for planning applications lodged and issued because um our report has been a point in time and we thought it was important to to provide a picture over time so that i point that out that that 's a new report on two new graphs there on that page this report thank you mr mayor thank you madam ceo are there any questions at all or comments on the ceo 's report council web thanks mr mayor um a couple of comments i do have um just first up just with the customer service report um a summary their total performance of the organization is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan in place to lift that number because that is probably uncomfortably low i would say venom ceo who you mr mayor um councillor webb is referring to the first report is that correct the customer request management system so we also use that management system and it 's a bit tricky with this report because it 's actually an internal system as well for passing on information internally but yes 58 is is quite low and yes over time we would expect to lift that of course yes and there 's there 's uh a plan or i guess it 's on on executives radar that there 's something going to happen to address that i 'm just i just sort of again it 's good to measure things but if there 's nothing being put in place to make sure that things are being amended there 's no point in measuring them in the first place so as long as it 's on on the radar and there 's there 's something in place there too to increase that number that 's that would satisfy me well um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time the last couple of months so it 's it 's a relatively new report that we 're tracking and i agree with you that um if something 's tracked or measured um it it can be improved so yes we will as an executive be discussing this report in more detail and trying to delve down so it 's unclear right at this level now exactly where the blockages are and yes we will be exploring that further thank you mr mayor thank you very much madam ceo um if i could mr mayor i do have a couple more questions if that 's all right please thank you very much and through you mr mayor um so 0.5 uh the building services on page 12. skipping forward a little bit just a bit of clarity over this uh the lower table with the title of monthly comparison of permits lodge for dwellings uh under each year section you have two rows but there 's no distinction of twitch row what row means what um can i have a bit of clarity over that sorry do you miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at please um um so page 12 of the ceo 's report and uh it 's point uh item five building services and there 's a table with the name of monthly comparison of permits lodged for dwellings so i 'm not too sure of your question either yes um so we we have a table here and we have uh a year 2020 to 2021 and we have two columns uh for example july is 14 and 14 and august is 10 and 24. what do these columns uh what what 's the distinction between the two columns what is it comparing sorry lodged lodged and not lost and granted and granted i would assume that that 's what it is and i apologize for the headings not being clear i 'm wondering if the general manager of infrastructure and planning 's alexandra has any further insight otherwise we 'll take that on notice counsellors okay we 'll take that on notice to clarify that but i 'm assuming that there has been a line that 's dropped off there thank you beautiful thank you and just one final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uh is that i just want to comment on the community health and wellbeing report and what a tremendous effort it is for 2020 uh the maternal child health hours delivering 875 hours recorded despite being 0.6 of a full-time employee i think that 's a tremendous definite should be congratulated that 's all my comments thank you thanks chancellor webb council robbie uh thanks mr mayor um i 'd like to make a comment on uh number five building services page 12. um it 's noted that uh from 2020 to 2021 the value of the building permits lodged uh this year 20 to 21 the value is 40 million 824 thousand 000 oh sorry 40 million 529 000. sorry about that which is comparable apples to apples to last year last year 's was 40 million 824. so it does lag behind by 300 000. and that is interesting to note that uh given that the the way that manchester real estate has jumped ahead this year we 're still down on building permits lodged so i 'll be interested to see the next next month 's figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in kaileen i found it of tremendous value castle uh thank you mr mayor yes look um i 'd like to um comment on councillor robbie 's uh interpretation um my reading of it is that for the month of february uh the value of permit uh building permit applications was uh over six million dollars at the same time last year it was only four million the year before was only five million the 40 million the councillor rarbie refers to is year to date keeping in mind you know we 're only we 're not even halfway through the financial year well we 're more than halfway through the financial year so we 're well on track to exceed both last year and the year before the six million dollars that uh came in through february uh is second only to last november where it was seven million dollars for the month so um i take a different view from cancer from my fellow councillor and i 'm very pleased to see that the confidence in mansfield and manfield real estate uh continues to grow and it certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a an economic recovery that is being led by our retail and construction industry thank you mr mayor thank you council sudden is there any other comments at all casa rabbi yeah three mr mayor i 'll have to agree to disagree but i 'm happy to give um councillor sladden a maths lesson uh next time i 've seen it 's uh comparing apples to apples on month or month that 's what my point was thank you thank you councillor cancer um still accumulative raby but anyway um i 'd just like to acknowledge uh some of the capital works that has been done um and there 's a couple of areas which really stand out in terms of coming well under the budget cost uh so uh mrs alexander in your area uh congratulations to the toilet box there 's a couple of big numbers there that um are always haunting to read when you read a capital then under the capital project the results of the capital project so well done no other comments then sorry councillor webb yeah just a quick on apologies mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's report there 's an issue there just with a percentage i just wanted to draw attention to the year-to-date percentage variance updated budget that 's out by two decimal places thank you councillor webb we 'll uh take that on um thank you um mr mayor i am extremely pleased that how well that report has been

are on the agenda okay so there 's a recommendation there on the agenda and when you asked if anybody wanted to move it i did raise my hand however counselor team has come in with an amendment sorry i didn 't see your hand raised at all paul council said well it was yeah i missed that can 't say it so through you mr mayor just so um so counselors are clear there is a recommendation there so there 's no motion on the table until a counsellor puts a motion on the table thank you and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct that is correct mr mayor the council team has put a motion on the table um as far as who had their hand up first i 'm sorry i i didn 't see that either no i didn 't see paul 's i counsel students and either convenient um is there any questions at all so through you mr mayor that doesn 't stop an amendment at this stage um from a councillor though i just want to be clear thank you thank you council said uh yes mr mayor i would like to move the resolution as uh tabled in the agenda thank you so that 's an amendment to cancelations mr mayor if i can just be clear the difference that i gathered from councillor tien 's motion was the inclusion of remain as a word um proposed meryl allowances remain at 62 884 and in the second dot point proposed counselor allowance remain at 21. so just a point of clarification please mr mayor for the minutes um the allowances are remaining at last year 's current amount that 's been set by the minister and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is there an intention that it goes beyond this next 12 months just to be clear thank you thank you guys no the intention is that it remains the same um until the uh tribunal uh determines differently thank you counselor today so through you mr mayor so counselor salad in terms of um wanting to put an amendment forward it 's a virtually the same wording if that makes sense the intent sounds like it 's the same unless councillor sladen wants to read out a different motion uh madam ceo i do not see the word remain there now that is correct but counselor team has put that motion forward and the intent is exactly the same as the recommendation is my understanding it 's the same outcome just a different word in councillor sladden okay thank you for clarifying that counsellor tian the so do we have a second for the motion i will withdraw my uh uh motion thank you mr mayor thank you council

VIC 3722, Australia",2388,hi everyone my name is sasuke van biever and i 'm the community recovery coordinator mental track council has several funding streams available at the moment and we will be releasing more opportunities in the new year so we wanted to put this video together with some tips and tricks to help you prepare for any current or future grant opportunities now we are aware that each grant has their specific guidelines and their requirements an increase when grants get bigger but this will give you an overall idea on what will help you to create a successful application now as mentioned mansfield has a few grants available at the moment but there are a whole heap of other opportunities available online so we have compiled a list which is available on our website for both businesses and commun community groups and not-for-profits but more come online all the time so it 's important that you get ready and prepared to get the most out of these opportunities so tips on how to keep up to date on new available funds are at the end of this video now if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best chance to be successful is to prepare business case for your project you can also call this a project plan so you need to show that the planning has been done and that you are ready to go once you have a business case or a project plan applications will be so much easier now what to put in this business case first of all obviously the concept overview so what is the project what are you trying to achieve also rationale so highlight why a project should be undertaken and how will um the funding provide value and success to your project so why should someone invest also why does it represent a worthy expenditure of public funds because often obviously funding comes from government local government so it is public funds expected outcome so bigly um what you want to achieve so think beyond your own beyond your own borders beyond your own um business organization so even what does it mean for other community groups around you for your local area even sometimes for the bigger ones look at regional or state then numbers make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little bit further but it 's very important you spend time on your finance financial part then establish credibility to deliver the project and sustain it so grants are not going to be available every year to keep you running so what are you going to do to prove that you can keep on writing that you are sustainable and how will you measure success how is it aligning with strategic business plans you want so obviously your own business plan but also um maybe your council or any other supporting organizations or associations um around you like the more groups you can align with their um strategic business plans the bigger the support and the bigger your chance for success now it is a comprehensive document and there 's a lot of information in there but like i said at the start if you prepare this early it will it pretty much answers the majority of the questions in your application so it will make your life easier so if the funding amount is small obviously you don 't need very big document but the the idea behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared and have thought through things is still relevant like i said it just won 't be a big document also a good tip plain english a big comprehensive document doesn 't mean you have to start using big words and and long sentences it is best to keep it simple short sentences grab the grant maker 's attention and be specific now some of these things seem like such basic things but it 's the little things that people overlook that make a difference to your funding applications so really read the guidelines and objectives several times so you really get it so it takes time because often a lot of information in there um so really i 'm trying to understand the objectives what does the grand maker want because it 's a it 's about them it 's not about you so it 's not about you trying to fit a project your project in funding criteria because that will actually waste time if you 're not really eligible it 's you need to find the right funding to suit your projects so make sure that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all or you want to confirm eligibility and even sometimes even after reading guidelines and criteria things still don 't make sense so really don 't be afraid to call the provider it 's really great to be able to ask questions clarify points ask tips and advice because in the end they want to help you because they want to receive good applications also don 't be afraid to keep calling them when you are working through the application another benefit is that your project or event will become top of mind they will know you put a lot of work in it and they are aware you you are keen there is a fine line though so don 't become a test make sure you have valid questions each time when you reach out now once you know you are eligible scan through the application and find out what the supporting documents are that you need you don 't think can be quite time consuming to collect them then gather as many letters of support you can but try to get people that don 't directly benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the broader outcomes of your project so attack letters from your council tourism organizations committees businesses associations so anyone really around you that you can align with their strategic business plan another seem to be simple tip but it is keep it organized in one folder it will get messy when you need to attach it to your application so just save them all together and then when it comes to the application you can just all find them very easily now mentioned before spend time on finances it is very important to get the budget right so really spend time on this section the application will usually up now some of these things uh seem like such basic things but it 's the little things that people overlook that make a difference to your funding applications so really read the guidelines and objectives several times so you really get it so it it takes time and there 's often a lot of information in there um so really and try to understand the objectives what does the grand maker want because it 's a it 's about them it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to fit a project your project in funding criteria because that will actually waste time if you 're not really eligible it 's you need to find the right funding to suit your projects so make sure that it 's a win-win situation now if you have any questions at all or you want to confirm eligibility and even sometimes even after reading guidelines and criteria things still don 't make sense so really don 't be afraid to call the provider it 's really great to be able to ask questions clarify points ask tips and advice because in the end they want to help you because they want to receive good applications also don 't be afraid to keep calling them when you are working through the application another benefit is that your project or event will become top of mind they will know you put a lot of work in it and they are aware you you are keen there is a fun line though so don 't become a test make sure you have valid questions each time when you reach out now once you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out what the support and documents are that you need you know thing can be quite time consuming to collect them then gather as many letters of support you can but try to get people that don 't directly benefit from your project because that will show broader appeal and the broader outcomes of your project so it 's like letters from your council tourism organizations committees businesses associations so anyone really around you that you can align with their strategic business plan another seem to be simple tip but it is keep it organized in one folder it will get messy when you need to attach it to your application so just save them all together and then when it comes to the application you can just all find them very easily now i mentioned this before it is important to spend time on the finances you need to get the budget right the application will usually ask to specify what elements will be using the funding so you need to make sure these budget items actually match the project intent so make sure also make sure your budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different and some have different so they have different requirements so some need income contributions others not so if needed again go back to the provider and gain clarity so an example is in kind so in kind is donated labor materials and equipment so check the guidelines for the rates and percentages of in-kind allowed and the funding ratio is not a one to look out for so it tells you how much money you need to contribute for every dollar that you ask for we 're on to the assessment questions often when you go to see town and start writing answers for these questions you come to a blank so it 's really important sit down and brainstorm some points with some people from your team so even if you don 't have a team and it 's only one person or someone outside your organization it really helps to brainstorm think about how you 're gonna answer each of the questions also always assume that the team assessing your application doesn 't know your community your project your event your area they don 't know anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prove um to give evidence so make sure you always answer the questions what when why who and how so another very simple tip is make sure you answer all assessment questions and if you know the weighting pay more attention to us with higher weighting now this one again you might say you know that but this is where time comes in you need to become a thorough editor so ask yourself have i answered the question keep the always keep the funding objectives in mind so also check spelling and grammar and pay attention to detail there 's nothing worse than to receive a clumsy application so there 's usually simple things that can be fixed by just reading through your application a few times now our last tip complete your final draft early enough so you can send it to people to get feedback and send it to as many as possible we get so consumed by our own project that we can 't even see our own mistakes or where we could enhance our response so it 's really a beauty find a few people it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization outside your organization or like even again committees and associations just keep in mind that you need time for this as well now you 've submitted your application you got unfortunately the news back you haven 't been successful well don 't be scared to seek feedback because sometimes it 's just because there were just too many very strong applications and not enough funding or sometimes it 's something that you could easily work on for the next time so getting that clarification is just very valuable so you just learn from it and make sure you strengthen it for next your application for next time okay even better you 've been successful so now what first step is really get the funding agreement signed really read the detail and know what the conditions are you can even talk to the grant maker to get clarification again also understand the critical process often there will be funding in several stages so know what you need to provide invoices receipts and all of that often grind makers like um proof photo proof uh above reporting so it 's always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's an event um take on the day photos now if you keep in mind all these tips and tricks it really will help you help you to create a successful application so i told you at the start i would give you some hints on where to find more grants so we have some available grants from mansfield child cancer but also external government bodies in a list on available on our website but here are a few other tips um on how to find it so take a screenshot or something um and keep this on you and just it 's really important just keep on looking there 's so many um available grants at the moment bushfire covet related or even just specific niche markets funding so yeah just have a look here um also make sure council knows about your project so we can keep an eye out for suitable funding opportunities for you now i hope this has been beneficial for you so if you have any more questions you can always always contact the community development team at the shire thank you,"(-37.053645, 146.0869862)"

been an extreme honor to be a councillor in the mansfield shire council but also be mayor through one of the most difficult years i think for councils across victoria as a council we 've worked together to support our communities particularly this year through the fires and through covert 19. i want to mention again how our staff and the ceo led by kaylene conrad it 's just been an exceptional year and i just commend you all for the work you 've done all the best to my colleagues in our team of councillors who we have shown extreme respect for one another as we 've worked through the last four years and also the staff and our residents and i hope a really good future for all could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be received councillor olva and a seconder thank you councillor

i actually wanted to um comment on the recommendation it 's too late we 've already moved it isn 't it okay look i just wanted to um acknowledge and thank you for the work that you have put in and your dedication to the whole of mansfield shire over the past 15 years it is no small effort and the time and the commitment that you have put in is acknowledged and also thanks to rolf for putting up with you during that time as well thank you i appreciate those words thanks very much we 'll move on to item number 11 which is reports from council appointed representative representative sorry representatives um the first one i have is the likelihood and land on water management plan count implementation committee council of paulsland uh thank you madam mayor while this committee has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large amount of um correspondence and information sharing continuing the most recent amount of correspondence has come from a variety of interest groups surrounding the introduction of the parks and crown land legislation amendment bill for those people who are not aware of that this is uh a bill that was introduced to the into the lower house of the victorian parliament in november last year it is currently before the upper house and it relates to the allowing of camping and other recreational activities on licensed or leased land around waterways this will have a huge impact on um our community given our um number of lakes and uh the lake and number of rivers around the uh within the shire and i just want to assure people the council is aware of this and our ceo uh kailyn conrad is communicating with her um fellow uh ceos of neighbouring shires and um is working on a response to this thank you madam mayor madam ceo would you like to add to that i thank you madam mayor i think council slammers covered it all the only thing i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mav to see if they our peak body would represent council on this matter thank you thank you very much um counselor harry westendalk do you want to speak to the audit and risk advisory committee or will you leave it to when the minutes are on the agenda uh i don 't think i think we 've already covered that uh madam mayor in in the verbal response at the last meeting and the minute simply confirm those things thank you very much um councillor volkering did you want to speak in relation to the municipal emergency management planning committee uh thank you madam mayor and i will also address an issue i think that was uh discussed the integrated fire management planning committee as well as the municipal emergency management planning committee uh and there 's uh certainly heightened concern uh that i 'm aware of through uh both local sources and also through some of the social media platforms uh about our non-resident rate payers being able to access their properties to carry out you know hazard reduction tasks uh on their properties uh many of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbours so forth so i am somewhat concerned i know there was some discussion at the mc meeting the municipal emergency management planning committee and kevin murphy council officer kevin murphy i think was going to take that up so i think it is becoming far more urgent since our meeting and i might ask you through you madam mayor to maybe our ceo and or gm kirsten alexander infrastructure to just perhaps update us on the latest that they 're aware of because i know it 's going to possibly cause a hell of a lot of extra work and on i know there 's some work going on in the background but if they could perhaps uh just update us thank you councillor volkering um madam ceo or our general manager thank you madam may i will pass to our general manager um ms alexander to answer that question thank you thank you thank you madame um yes i do have an update on that as of midnight on wednesday a residents will be able to apply to council to obtain a formal written approval to undertake hazard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large volume of inquiries currently so um uh it will involve uh residents providing council with some details about their property type of work and there will be an online form that they 'll need to fill in on the council website that should be available shortly and they 'll need to complete and lodge that so as to have their request for approval considered important thing to remember for residents from metropolitan melbourne that the restrictions that they are required to comply with in melbourne will also need to be complied with and we 're expecting some information through from local government victoria from lgb on that um so we should have that out very shortly but i guess um just conscious that there is a large volume so we 'll just work our way through and try and get those responses back as quickly as possible thank you thank you very much and thank you madam mayor and also uh ms alexander um just just perhaps to not heighten awareness but um uh the cfa uh expecting that the likelihood of grass fires as distinct from bushfires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of you will be aware that we 're heading into our la nina we 're already seeing to some extent the impact of that already with some heavy rain last week and the likelihood of more forecast so that just signals the importance i guess of our non-residents and also our residents for that matter uh attending to uh the uh slashing so thank you council offering any other reports verbal reports from councillors on any of those committees please if not could i have a motion that the verbal report provided by council in relation to their representation on external committees be noted could someone please move that thank you councillor sladden second councillor westendorf all in favour thank you

think it 's well presented i think it 's full of very very useful information but what 's more important i think is that that information has been presented in a very readable and very you know digestible way that encourages people to delve into it so uh full credit to all of those who have been involved in it thank you before we put the motion counsellor of pulping has his hand up council vulcan uh thank you madam mayor just a query i guess um the ward map in the report shows all awards obviously but it also it shows uh bulla mount sterling as a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eldon isn 't within it given that our boundary uh i think is on the murandi side like all just just purely for curiosity who would like to speak to that let me have a go then madame if i can um look i i think councillor bulking it would have been just a matter of um illustrating that the rna particularly mount bullet and mount sterling do not sit within the authority of council even though they 're geographically within the shire boundary so i don 't think it was about not showing like it would have more about illustrating mount bulla and matt sterling and where that sits so um we will look to

president of one of our community 's most popular sports i 'm going to be talking about the impact on the clubs locally creative pursuits and arts have been a strong theme during long-term lockdown particularly here in mansfield we all heard about people doing jigsaws photography crafts and art and even creations on footpaths so i am particularly pleased to tell you about an initiative of arts mansfield and the mansfield and district community bank they are inviting you to collect a free canvas on which to express your creativity for inclusion in arts mansfield online exhibition @ @ @ @ @ @

we were about to run our domestic finals and of course haven 't been able to get back into it we did have a little window in july when we were able to run a couple of try out sessions and things before the latest lockdown so it 's been a bit of a roller coaster and um you know our members are feeling it the kids just want to get out on the court they want to have fun they want to be with their friends so so they 're they 're affected and they want to be active don 't they absolutely absolutely so how have you kept connected between the club sure we 've um well we 've run some social

going into our tournament season and with crowds the way they are we can 't do that this year so regional associations have partnered together with basketball big country and we 're setting up a home and a away series of associations in the northeast so the kids can continue to play so that 's pretty exciting and um on a domestic level just to keep the girls involved we 're running a three-on-three comp which we 've never done before it 's just trying to re-engage and get numbers back up because we 've seen a a reduction of 31 in our junior membership how do you think moving

this season and and waving the court high fees that will really help us when we can eventually get back into the stadium that is so important isn 't it it 's really important that everybody gets together and it 's not just your sport but you know it 's really important that we can keep our clubs going and it 's been a really hard year and it 's a hard year because the volunteers aren 't

evening we 'll move to seven the presentation of reports and the first one is 7.1 the rating strategy 2020 to 21. on page six i have a recommendation counsellors do i have a motion counselor sladden you move uh madam mayor i recommend that council endorse the mansfield shire council rating strategy 2020 21. thank you do i have a second off councillor westendale anyone against are therefore councillor volkering are you against the motion i am thank you well moved to councillor sladden would you speak to the motion please uh thank you madam mayor um as per the report there is no change to the rating strategy um from the 1920 to the 2021 uh as we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed the necessary statutory guidelines for the uh compilation of this strategy i will add that while we wait for the state government to announce the findings of their review into the rating structure for all victorian councils uh it is safe to i believe that it is safe to continue with the current uh or the existing rating strategy thank you madam mayor thank you councillor westondorf would you like to speak as second uh no i i would simply be echoing councillor saladin 's words i believe thank you counselor bulkering would you like to speak against the motion please uh thank you madam mayor um look as fellow councillors will know and council officers you know we 're in uh uncharted waters at the moment and we 've had significant bushfires across the nation and fired a worldwide pandemic and it 's brought havoc pretty much across the nation um but at a local level yeah we know for sure that we 've got individual families struggling we 've got individual businesses struggling uh our farming sector seems to be holding up reasonably well um and i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impossible a rate increase on our community at this time the front page of the age on the weekend followed by an article on page 10 of the age referred to our big city cousins who are quite different to small rural councils like us but nonetheless we have to consider things at a local level i 've been grappling with this for the last several months and it gets down to what my conscience says is the right thing or the wrong thing and i 'm not comfortable uh supporting a recommendation that we should adopt this council rating strategy thank you thank you anyone wish to speak for or against the motion i 'll come to cancer sledden you have right of reply would you like to speak please counselor sladden uh thank you madam mayor uh i 'd just like to point out to councillor volkering that the recommendation is to endorse the strategy the actual two percent rate increases in the budget cancel the volkering therefore you may want to hold your fire for the next item but this is just endorsing the strategy as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have a mover and a seconder and someone against i 'll call for those in favor the motion is carried we 'll move on to 7.2 which is the budget for 20 20 21 we have a recommendation a very long recommendation and i was wondering if we have emotion counsellors counselor western door uh madam mayor i 've craved the indulgence of the uh the current members and anyone listening uh but i would in this instance not want to read out the whole motion i 'm working on the assumption that people who have an interest in this have access to the full document and also would have had access to the full wording of the the motion that i 'm about to move so my motion is that having considered written and verbal submissions pursuant to section 223 of the local government act 1989 we adopt the budget 2020 to 2021 as attached including the schedule of fees and charges for the financial year ending 30th of june 2021. point two that we formally declare the following rates and charges for the 2020-21 rating year and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i think um probably people are better off reading at their own leisure rather than listening to me recite all of that thank you very much do i have anyone um second that motion please counselor sladden anyone against council vulcan councillor oliver thank you i 'll call on councillor westendorf to speak to the motion thank you madam mayor um we we are certainly in unchartered waters here um we are trying to develop a financial document to see us through for the next 12 months and we aren 't really sure how the pandemic is going to pan out or what the impact of that is going to be on our community we have to do what we can with the best knowledge that we have and understanding that if there are significant changes we can adjust this budget through something like a mid-term budget review process and i believe that the current the current budget as presented is the best starting point for us to build a financial plan for the coming year that allows us to manage the delivery of the services that our communities deserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak a second or please ah thank you madam mayor yes i 'm pleased to second this recommendation firstly i 'd like to highlight the capital spend and the investment in infrastructure across the mansfield shire as detailed in the budget another area i 'd like to highlight is and as councillor western dawg did refer to and that is in our fees and charges and the waiving of significant amount of money of fees and charges to assist local businesses and the community groups in fact all sectors of the community will benefit from the waiving of those fees they cover all sectors so it is equitable across all sectors the final point i want to make is the i mean is the inclusion uh in this budget people will notice um from the uh budget that was presented at the last meeting the inclusion of a community infrastructure fund which is specifically for the outlying communities we heard in the submissions to the budget that many of the outlying communities are feeling unloved and not feeling that they are getting their fair share of the rate high and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those major capital infrastructure projects are in the township of mansfield this is in some way i 'm just sorry it couldn 't be more but this in some way goes towards alleviating those concerns of the outlying communities in ensuring that they give their fair share as i say of the rate high thank you madam mayor thank you councillors laden councillor oliver would you like to speak against the motion your unmute counsellor thanks uh mayor eckley um i would like to speak against it but procedurally i 'd like to foreshadow emotion um can i read out that measurement amendment to the motion an amendment to the motion yes would you like to read that for us please first of all i 'd like to to say um i 'd like to thank kinsley all the officers ms conrick and other fellow councils for all the hard work that 's gone into this this budget and i think it 's a very good budget um it 's a surplus budget which should prepare us well for well as we know we don 't know what 's happening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a really fantastic hard-working staff do you want me to foreshadow the emotion thank you amendment so it 's very there 's only one change to uh councillor western dawg and that is under number 0.1 that council won having considered written and verbal submissions pursuant to section 223 of the local government act 1989 adopt the budget 202021 as attached including the fees schedule of fees and charges for the financial year ended the 30th of june 2021-22 with the following amendment the amendment is a that staff salaries do not increase the financial year meaning that the two per cent anticipated staff salary increase built into the budget is removed then to formally declare so the rest of that goes on as is suggested in the um agenda thank you very much do i have a seconder for that amendment to the motion we don 't have a seconder for the motion so we will return to the original motion we have a move and a seconder anyone want to speak against the motion counselor volkering um thank you madam mayor i don 't necessarily want to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comments about uh the rating strategy i appreciate those and thank councillor sladen for doing so mike i guess the reason for raising it at the time was based on the nature of our meeting and that there may be those within the community that aren 't aware of the process so thank you council sutton for for raising that point i 'd also just like to acknowledge also in uh in my comments the complexities of a budget and i do thank both councillor western dorfan councillor sladen for pointing out uh some of the things that have been done in the budget to address uh particular issues that were raised at different times by the community so thank you to them for doing that uh i particularly want to acknowledge councillor sutton for his drawing attention to the fact that our outlying communities are an important part of the overall shire and the uh the fun to address capital works small capital works uh in those outlying communities is something that i think he 's argued long and hard for and i acknowledge that thank you thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come back to councillor western off with your right of reply thank you madam mayor um i don 't think i need to say much more but i i will just make the point that um while we are budgeting for a an increase in the rates as per government um regulated increases i think the community needs to be aware of the fact that we are cognizant of the hardship that exists in our community at the moment as a result of both the bushfires and the pandemic and there are mechanisms within our processes to make provision for people who are suffering hardship so i think that if there 's anyone that is really in trouble out there they need to talk to the council about how do i get myself out of this and how can i work with the council to minimize the impact of that hardship so while the budget is a formal document the execution and the implementation of it is something that needs to be handled with understanding and compassion for our rate players thank you councillor westendorf i have a mover and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried three two thank you we 'll move on to 7.3 which is the adoption of the council plan 2017-21 the 2020 review and the strategic point of order madam mayor sorry sorry your hand didn 't go up in the in the fours i 'll do it again those in those four the emotion okay we have four and those against one thank you thank you council vulcan move on to 7.3 the adoption of the council plan 2017 to 21 the 2020 review and the strategic resource plan 2020 to 24. we have uh recommendation on page 27. do i have a motion counselors please councillor sladden has moved we have a seconder councillor bulk ring those are anyone against okay i 'll call for for those in favor of the motion thank you that 's carried thank you very much that is the end of our agenda for this evening and on closing our meeting this evening i want to thank as has already happened with our councillors before the staff and particularly mrs kennedy in her finance department obviously the community for their work since november @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been able to add things to the budget that have been brought up by the community and also obviously the councillors who have worked tirelessly over that time really

Highett St, Mansfield VIC 3722, Australia",1802,good afternoon today i 'm speaking to senior sergeant steve carden our new senior sergeant at mansfield police station and we 're talking about covert 19 and of course we have all got a role to play but with metropolitan lockdown we know people in our community are interested in how the police are checking our community isn 't getting visitors from the lockdown zone i know that some people are still confused about what are legitimate reasons for visitors to be in our shire can you please explain this and the regulations sure down silently thanks for having me um first i 'd just like to point out that um this uh pandemic response is led by dhhs dhhs i 've got an extremely valuable website and there 's a phone number that you can contact for advice for all these rules and regulations our chief commissioner has agreed with the chief health officer health officer to assist the authorising officers with the enforcement of the chief health officer 's restrictions so in melbourne at the moment the lockdown zone there are four reasons that people can leave their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are only three reasons and those reasons are to shop for essential items to give care medical assistance on compassionate grounds and to work or go to school if they can 't do it from home so you might get truck drivers coming in people working in the industries here they are able to come in here it 's very difficult to check all of those people some of them have residential addresses in melbourne however they 're legitimately up here at this stage which we 'll go into after yeah um how do you think given what you 've just said how do you think people are behaving around this i think they 're behaving quite well on the whole with the enforcement that we 're doing um by and large people are doing the right thing but it 's not time to put foot on the brake at the moment we need to all keep on with it and we 'll be keeping up our enforcement strategies i know in melbourne and people would have seen on television that there 's still airbnb parties going on there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not seeing that reflected in the regions at the moment that 's good to hear isn 't it yeah and i think it 's really important that i 'm hearing from residents about the trips that they legitimately are making to melbourne to go to medical appointments but they 're driving back or going through and then not going through any um checks checking can you just explain what might be happening with that and the resources of police yeah sure um obviously all resources in every situation are finite um what we 're doing at the moment is a multi-pronged approach we have four different operations only five different operations now running to try and control those lock down areas and for checking people in the regional areas so at the moment the main one that pertains to us is operation sentinel so that actually has police actively going around checking on people who should be self quarantining so we have the roadblocks run 24 hours a day seven days a week down at broadford and a cold stream we 've got rolling stops that you 'll see around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and just setting up blocks on the way into mansfield on the benella road at bonnie dune just to try and pick up anybody who isn 't in the response zone the other thing that we 're doing is responding to the reporting online the police assistance line which is the one three one triple four number residents in mansfield have been fantastic using that and we 've been able to get some good enforcement around that so any information people can give to us we 're also acting upon that i think that 's really important to keep everybody healthy and safe and some people might think it 's a difficult thing to do to well not dub someone in but ring that number and um let you know that there 's someone here that probably shouldn 't be here someone in their um holiday house yeah absolutely i think you 're just reaffirming that it 's really helping the police definitely and around helping the police in a way some of the businesses are just questioning what would their role be in checking visitors yep um once again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's actually got a position for you 'll see a a button to hit for regional and rural areas then it 'll come up with business owner responsibilities but i can tell you that business owners do have a responsibility to bring to our notice if they believe that there 's people there that are from outside or sorry from inside the lockdown zone um they have a responsibility to collect the phone numbers and names of anyone that stays in their establishment for more than 15 minutes so as far as identification goes they can check driver licenses if they hear someone talking oh we just come up from such and such they can ring that one three one triple four that gets triaged out and gets sent to the closest unit oh it doesn 't that makes and that 's helpful to people to know that isn 't it yes it is yeah and it 's been very effective um uh within the mansfield our mansfield response zone um we are giving out penalty notices and by and large they 're coming from community information that 's excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to ask what could manceville shire residents do to assist the police well you really highlighted that but is there anything else that we can do um there is and that 's to stay safe so we 've got to all we i know we focus on the lockdown zone there we still need to maintain our own vigilance the 1.5 metres apart if you 're going into an uber or something similar or where you can 't distance the premier just requested that even people in regional areas wear a mask if you can 't maintain that 1.5 meter distance gatherings of more than five people at your home that 's still out in a regional area you can 't do it gatherings of more than 10 people outdoors still can 't do it in a regional area and gatherings of more than 50 people at a funeral 20 people at a wedding those things are still in there those rules are still in place for the regions for the regions by and large i think we 're tracking quite well in the regions and people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving us that information we 'll be able to keep on enforcing and targeting our enforcement i 'm really pleased to hear that you um reiterating those regulations in relation i think people probably don 't think that the region should be looking at those things but that is important so what 's your idea around the region traveling regionally i mean the premier 's really saying to people don 't travel if you don 't have to 100 and i agree with that if you don 't have to don 't travel don 't try and look for loopholes there are loopholes that can become evident about being able to travel to go to melbourne and come back for whatever reason i 'm urging you please don 't do that i myself had an appointment in melbourne for next week i 've reassessed it um i can do it another way i 've cancelled it so if you don 't have to travel don 't find a loophole and try and do it and i think mostly the comments that i 'm getting from people is that they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for medical reasons so i mean that 's really important that that continues because there is evidence that people aren 't following up on their medical appointments and they need to do that for their own health yes well the 100 you can 't you can 't neglect your own other health issues because of covert um the best thing to do is to get a um confirmation from the doctor that you 're going to see um and if you 're a legitimate resident that was in residence in the mansfield area prior to july the 8th that would also be and you intend to return to where you 're staying it would be good to get a statutory declaration signed up here to say that you are a resident up here well that 's really good information i think it 'd be good to touch base with you when things change so we can reaffirm for the community what 's what your police service is doing and what the community can do to help you yep that would be great so thank you are there any other things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we continue to work together as a community the way we have been we should all be able to keep each other safe that 's right and locally we know mansfield and district residents will continue to be kind as i 've always said and respectful and support each other to do our part for the minimization of covert 19 numbers we need to keep washing our hands keep our social distancing as we 're doing today and looking out for each other people within lockdown areas must now stay at home and only leave to shop for food and supplies care and caregiving exercise in their local suburb and study all and work if they can 't do that at home exactly of what just steve 's just said people within restricted areas cannot leave the area for exercise or travel and the stay-at-home direction applies to a principal place of residence meaning people that own more than one property cannot move between properties we look forward to welcoming them back when the lockdown ends and the coronavis numbers are again under control in victoria we all look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you,"(-37.053645, 146.0869862)"

of that just acknowledging the passing of veronica mccormick OAM and her commitment to the organizations and groups across mansfield demonstrating such a strong example to hurt this community of how to live a caring and giving life all the best to their family I have a motion that count or a recommendation could I have a motion that council received the masks report for the period 20th of May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you madam mayor just before I support your report I think it would be remiss of us as counselors if we didn 't acknowledge the power of work that you 've been doing over the last little while I know you 've been on every available media outlet you 're a bit of a megastar I think in the making but in all seriousness you 've been a strong advocate for our community you 've been advocating and working hard to ensure that our pushed by recovery victoria 10,000 grant was available to a small businesses which i 'm sure they are appreciative of plus a range of other things that you 've been engaged in and so I think it is appropriate that and I 'm sure I speak for the our fellow councillors who are unable to be here tonight in acknowledging the power of work you 've been doing so thank you for that and I 'm now happy to put the recommendation thank you appreciate that thank you counselor all green madam mayor certainly like to second that motion and endorsed Council of welcomes comments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it you do but it 's certainly been appreciated by fellow councillors and the community so thank you thank you can solver those in favor Harry thank you we move on to item number 11 reports from council appointed representatives so I just call on any councillors who have been at any of the meetings that they are representatives of in the last month or so maybe I 'll just quickly start on the chair of the Goulburn broken greenhouse alliance which move meets quarterly the Alliance is made up of 13 northeast local government areas sustainability Victoria Delp and the Northeast CMA which is the catchment Management Authority and together we work tirelessly around advert advocating and working on projects together that not one of those councils could do individually so it 's an amazing group of people made up obviously of councillors from each of those councils but also their offices and it 's just amazing to see the work that they do the humor and all local government network hasn 't met across the Kovan time counselors are there any other reports back from your various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mayor the on on a number of emergency management and committees and fire committees with you and although we haven 't met in the last month I just want to acknowledge again through you if I may I know a number of Co SES and also some start from Mansfield autistics statewide services were engaged in supporting a range of other emergency services personnel in locating the young boy that went missing down in Marin dindi so I just want to once again acknowledge the wonderful support that various groups in Mansfield but in this particular case I know that Mansfield autistic statewide services personnel played a pivotal role in advising the rescue staff police and Casillas and other volunteers down there and I think it certainly made a bit of a difference according to various ones that I 've spoken to so I just wanted to acknowledge that for an emergency management point of view thank you Matt in there Thank You counsel I 'll cream we 've got a new group added on this which everyone 's heard about the business and community recovery Advisory Committee and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report back to the next council meeting so we 're looking forward to bring those community representatives together to work on a recovery plan for Matt 's wiltshire so I have a recommendation sorry council over um thanks Merritt Lee I have got a little bit to say about the northeast live commit waste form waste and curbside collection and so on is coming it 's going to become a really big issue for councils it bigger than it is at the moment because as we know state government and the federal government have given timelines to closing overseas markets for our recycling products so it 's just going to get tighter and tighter so there 's issues there that was discussed quite some time at the at the forum but I 'll just mention a couple of things because it doesn 't go Council on the localized it 's been doing quite a bit of work on collaborative procurement involved with the Alpine resort Commission 's and the cat 'll member councils and there 's there 's a the moment there 's a there 's a strategy which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to councils to see the interest in taking it up but the strategy outlined the following recommended priorities for collaborative cubed in the Northeast the first one was a future materials receivable and processing of commingled recyclables community and stakeholder engagement and education programs future curbside collection contacts all college arrangements from transfer stations for organics then filled waste and materials from transfer stations and recycle recovery centers and future e seaville and processing of organics so in the past there 's been quite some advantage or collaboratively together to work in these areas so that 's a really good work that 's been done by the waste group so that was the main issue that 's probably worth reporting okay thank you very much and thank you councillors for the work you do on those committees it 's a great extension to the work we do in the community as well I have a recommendation could I call a motion that counsel notice the verbal reports provided by councillors in relation to their representation on external committees Oh a tie that time Council of altering and ii can 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move to item number 12 which is officers reports 12.1 departmental thoughts Madame CEO Thank You men amid the department reports are presented for councils consideration with the recommendation on the on page Thank You counselors do we have any comments or questions about the reports from the government of the departments please council of all kering sorry I 'm being unneeded as I am it therefore mute myself thank you madam CEO and also madam iya I 'm great to see the boy from Mansfield slogan ecommerce online project up and running I think that 's great also great to see the naming process for the sports precinct adjacent to Mansfield Secondary College underway and appreciate the input there from those people were charged with responsibility to bring that to a conclusion which I 'm sure will help in people 's knowing where to go some stage down the track I also have a couple of other questions but I 'm not sure they 're appropriate for lco may well be a little bit further down the track when we come to the Echo dev strategy I did also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I thought I 'd made some notes to myself about this particular matter and I 'm just frantically trying to find them but I think my memory serves me correctly we 've got another months to go before the completion of the financial year and the building approvals value of building of hurdles in Mansfield and I think we were about 600 short if I 'm not wrong on another record from last year which again is a really positive sign for our community generally as all those that are listening to this or watching this answer meaning will appreciate mates with a very diverse economy in one sector particularly or their economy the jurist sector between thousands and thousands and thousands of people through our community every year it has been hit significantly so to have the others they 've all suffered the other sectors of our community but the building and construction industry seems to be going really well so it 's really pleasing to see that trigger almost set a milestone with still another month of values to be input to be considered so that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to I 'm not sure again if this I think it comes into the meeting a little further on and that 's the TNA report I think until then thank you madam so you know and better me thank you very much can I have a motion then on that recommendation are you a nurse thank you and a seconder council over all in favor passed thank you we 'll move to item 12 point 2.1 mansfield shire council economic development strategy 20 22 25 our Community Services Manager Mel Hutton thank you thank you councillors we have you have read the economic development strategy and you have it before you and there are any questions of miss Hutton before I call for a motion place council val creepy i think i think the community if they 're tuned in tonight they got a kid sick of hearing my voice in certainly certainly mine and maybe council irrelevant or lesser extent that in the last two or three standing so we can help to bear with us miss Haughton can you hear me yes I can good good to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the just really for my clarity on the echoed their strategy and possibly for members of the community under the banner of strengthen and diversify the economy objective three number a talks about inclusive planning can you just kind of explain a little bit I think I understand that that phrase but can you just explain that a little bit more to me it may be beneficial to those that are in the community listening tonight this may be a more appropriate question for our development services manager but I I believe that that statement to mean planning around the connectivity and the accessibility of our planning decisions in our local in infrastructure nature like to and anything to that thank you madam mayor no I think I think the Community Service has many do some good I think it 's about inclusive planning as far as involving the the different sectors of our community within that planning that the community themselves the residents the the business owners so it 's just strengthening and having that broad cross section across those matters so thank you any other comments councillor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please do to miss Haughton or or been in the community engagement the state 's the strategy has been developed partnership with local business community members in council staff could you explain maybe how that like some examples of how it 's been developed in partnership with local businesses and community yeah we ran a series of workshops that some West business specific and some where a mix of community and business owners so there are I think there 's a series of three or four workshops that were held over various times of the day to make sure that those were accessible to people that operate at all different types of businesses that was successful it was it was very successful yes yeah yeah thank you councilors any other questions before I call for a motion please counsel for cream yeah sorry to miss Hoffman mr. Kay the development services manager the reason I asked that question about planning because planning actually comes in further down as well and under another objective so that was the reason for my question but can I just also commend that appears to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategy I understand the key objectives but the strategies I think with a focus on business and engaging in a proactive manner with businesses is something I just want to highlight and again for those members of the community that might be listening it 's I think really important especially given what our local businesses have been through that cafes our hotels our accommodation places in particular which sometimes tend to get lost left out they 've really been struggling I was talking to a local accommodation only just recently and things pretty much just shut down and I also want to reach out to all those businesses so they 're out there and listening and to encourage them to if they haven 't already become aware of it that 10,000 grant if they 're eligible even if you don 't know if you 're eligible again just make contact to find out if you can tap into that available funding it may support your business in some way shape or form so thank you again Thank You counselors the motion is that council endorsed the mansfield Shire Council Mansfield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move that counselor over second counsel Volk ring all in favor carried thank you we move on to 12.2.2 the lake Eldon master plan Community Services Manager they 'll happen again please three met a barrel take the report before you is rich and happy to answer any questions you may have Thank You counselors any questions or clarifications councillor barking thank you again madam mayor first of all I 'm sure well we should acknowledge the work of fellow council other council slidin in ensuring that the lake hills and master plan has a right finally arrived to council for decision and adoption he 's put in a pair of work to ensure that but so two of you in fairness and your team so also want to acknowledge that my question relates to the Skyline Road precinct and I think you put I think I read somewhere in the detail that part of the recommendation is to pull part of the detail is to seal part of or all of Skyline Road is that correct yes three three madam mayor um the the the initial component of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between Bani Doolin and building it 's not all called Skyline Road but it 's called the skyline precinct and that will allow a completely sealed route around the lake again that a marathon no yeah driven that road a couple of times and managed to survive so I think it referred 12 either in kilometres so is it only a 10 kilometers unsealed correct is that correct I thought it might have been closer to 40 but any here that 's why I don 't thank you very much counselor Oliver thanks miss Haddon for all the work with this and I 'd like to comment about the in terms of the money its cost of this fantastic tab partnership between those organizations metal show round indicia god mary water and our DV r DV put in a lot of money so that 's terrific to have that partnership is there any sort of an indicates and ownership as well so thank you Thank You counselors could I have someone move the motion and read it out please counselor Volk ring thank you madam mayor the recommendation that council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business plans namely premier nature-based precincts pride by nature based precinct cirrage system investment at Goss pay the skyline road Crescent Road sealing project and poor the accommodation investment the integrated Golf Resort at Mountain Bay and to continue to advocate for public and private investment for the Planning development and realization of these projects thank you could I have some one second that motion please counselor over I was in favor Thank You harried move on to twelve point two point three tourism northeast quarterly report twenty nineteen to twenty quarter three Community Services Manager Mel Hutton again thank you very much thank you through you madam me I 'll take this report also as reg and happy to answer any questions that you may have thank you I think counselor offering you may have had a question about the T&E report no I 'm having trouble keeping up with the muting and unmuting it 's not so much a question I guess it 's more an observation and again I do this for the sake of those members of the broader community that might be listening or watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact of the bush fires over the 2019 summer period 2020 summer period I first caught a loss of approximately 200 million but then on top of that as we all know the cove at 19 in further impacting lost the sport that tourism northeastern I think I 've heard reports that that figure including both the bush fires and covered plus a number of other emergency events storms and etc etc power outages in our case here in Maysville are approximately 430 million now that 's spread across tourism northeast so that 's a much broader area and just Mansfield I think it 's important for the community to realize that the impacts are significant across the new region you know northeast Victoria is a premier part of Victoria probably premier part of Australia if anything probably premier part of the world we all know that but I 'm you know that that 's not an insignificant figure it 's round around pretty easily 430 million by it 's those businesses I referred to before those tourism operators our cafes our coffee shops out good food eateries restaurants you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves and to define a way to keep their doors open but the losses are staggering to be honest so it is something that is continuing to unfolds to unfold and we as counselors are charged with trying to make decisions and it 's in a time when I don 't think we 're ever going to see anything like this again in our lifetime let 's hope not anyhow I just wanted it 's an observation it 's not a question then probably speak too much thank you thank you very much that 's over I want an observation as well and continuing on from Council that welcomes observation is that basically the devastating effect of telling businesses but right through our community where people have lost a lot of their income from there may be part-time jobs that they had in in the tourism industry or as it is now lots of other industries and even the snow has started light with a very Scout staff so I think we just acknowledge again here everybody is really hurting through this time and hadn 't been hurting since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to change the routine a bit here and I 'm going to move the motion that council receive and note the tourism northeast Mets will show council 20 1920 quarter 3 report could I have a second to place Thank You councillor Walgreen all in favor carried thank you CEO is leaving the room with a conflict of interest 12-point 3.1 terms of reference for the chief executive office of performance and remuneration reference and advisory group corporate and organizational development manager Sharon Scott thank you sure thank you through you madam mayor I 'll take the terms of references read copy of the terms of reference is provided in the recommendation is for its endorsement together with its review date these can be found on page 23 of the agenda are there any questions Thank You counselors any questions or clarification on the terms of reference counselor thank you again madam mayor and miss Scott I just wanted to acknowledge the work of miss Scott in ensuring that this came before council I know our CEO is going to undergo regular communication with council ensuring that we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be held accountable so it 's a really positive sign from her I think and just want to commend miss Scott on they 've seen this before us so thanks again thank you you can 't lose any more questions council of all green would you like to move that motion and read it out please thank you madam mayor the recommendation is that council 1 endorsed the terms of reference for the chief executive officer performance and remuneration reference and advisory group and to undertake a review of the terms of reference for the advisory group within three months of the local government council elections the next council election is scheduled for 24th of October 2020 later this year thank you please counselor over all in favor thank you and thank you Miss Scott move on to twelve point four point one natesville shire council instruments of delegation and authorization just for a couple of minutes Mandy our finance manager while CEO returns to the room thank you so if you could lead us with that Mandy please thank you madam mayor I 'll take this reporter 's read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the delegations and authorizations place councillor for green thank you madam there and thank you Miss kinda see mr. Curtis Lee this delegation these delegations I should say they 're a normal part of council business aren 't they so again I 'm just mindful of maybe more members of the community listening in as we get used to these virtual meetings and I think it 's worthwhile if we 've got a moment just very quickly and I don 't want to add too too much to tonight 's agenda but if you could just give us a brief understanding of how this works sure um through the mayor yes they are just an ordinary part of council business the what the delegations do is the Local Government Act both the 89 and the 2020 act at the moment give council and the CEO particular powers the council can delegate some powers to the CEO and the CEO can also delegate powers and staff they 're done through various different instruments and these two particular instruments one is under the Planning Act one is under the Local Government Act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces of legislation we have a recommendation on page 26 I 'll read that out and then good sorry cats are over I just had an ongoing question from miss Kinsley just to clarify this for people listening it was because of the pandemic wasn 't it and the risk of maybe not having a quorum for council meetings that this had to come about is that right no there was a previous amendment to the CEOs delegation that yes was yes yeah this particular amendment is due to changes in the legislation but for the same sort of reason in case we don 't have a quorum no these are the actual powers have changed so delegate an axe a power that didn 't exist at that point in

is carried move on to item number twelve point four point two maxvill Shire Council rating system strategy 2021 that 's right sorry Merritt Lee yeah certainly yeah I just have something to say about this twelve point four point two and twelve point four point three and twelve point four point four I have a proposal that council considered where am i excuse me for a moment I 've got written here so I get the right thing the council having considered the current and ongoing Coe good night and environment its resulting impact on the economy which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still unfolding and shifting daily and the stimulus opportunities presenting from both the federal and state governments so considering all that one that we defer consideration of items twelve point four went to twelve point four point three and twelve point four point four all being related to the adoption of the council 's 2000 2021 budget rating strategy and council plan the second part of the proposal is that we consider the proposed twenty 2021 budget had a meeting to be called on Tuesday the 4th of August 2020 providing a further opportunity to revisit the proposed budget in light of impacts and opportunities thank you that 's my proposal that we could hit in that direction do I have a seconder for the motion Council vulgrim councillor Oliver would you like to speak to the motion yes I would we know that the government has in their wisdom state government in their wisdom has given councils until the end of August to pass and adopt budgets and I think mr. Kinsey the date is 31st of August is it correct yes and as the motion or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes we 're hearing about things that a week previously or a day previously we wouldn 't have considered would be state of play in Victoria in Australia in the world so it 's a very uncertain times and also we 're getting money coming in to help in our economy and to help mence with community and this money comes we don 't really know when some of its going to come but we have an extended period of time that we can actually learn more so that we might have hopefully a better understanding of what situation is that when we adopt the budget if we can put it off until that day the 4th of August Thank You councillor Valkyrie would you like to second the motion I think I 've already seconded the motion would you like just speak a second so yes thank you for the opportunity look I have been giving this a great deal of thought as obviously counselor older has as well and I concur broadly with the sentiment cities put the things seem to be changing daily and you know trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that basis I want to commend miss Kennedy because of her fastidious preparation she seems to be able to just you know go with the punches if you like so we know that the federal government and the state government are concerned about the nation 's economy and at a local Victorian level the same and throughout Victoria the local government sector is also responding accordingly and as I mentioned before in one of the other items on our agenda tonight we 're almost at record levels with our building approvals in Mansfield which is fantastic but speaking to a couple of local builders as an example they 're concerned that later on down the track that current momentum if you like may run out of steam sort of around December January February now may as well we as we know it 's a very robust economy but we 've had one particular sector of our economy impacted significantly that is the tourism sector as we 've already identified so the federal government is trying to and the state government to their credit both both are to be commended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintain people in jobs and here in Mansfield it 's hard to get a gauge on exactly who is impacted most but I 'm certainly cautious so I do think that buying a bit of time as Miss kinases pointed out that it 's probably putting a bit of work on her shoulders and once again fully appreciate that but excuse me I think it does buy us a couple of months to see how things begin to unfold we 've seen a bit of a spike in the Cova the infections in Victoria no other state wants to know us no other state wants to let Victorians into their state we 're more than happy to have them come here and spend their dollars in Mansfield but in all seriousness you know I think it does behold us to move cautiously and judiciously because we 're making decisions on behalf of our ratepayers and our ratepayers are constantly saying to assert you know the weed we as counselors need to be cognizant of the fact that this is a very challenging time for everybody there 's no one that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's got a long long way to go yet I saw the former treasurer Peter Costello and I think the former governor of the Reserve Bank Bernie Bernie Bernie welcomed your second name maybe he 'll know who I 'm talking about Bernie Bernie oh no good mates but in all seriousness once again there 's talking about this recession that we 're now technically in has been a fairly long one and that interest rates are going to be low for interest rates to be low that 's good for some businesses but you know there 's so many unpredictables here and we had a local government here in Mansfield our vibrant community now we 're trying to make decisions around a budget it 's had a lot of work going to it and I want to acknowledge the input from the community as well and Miskin is Lee 's role in ensuring that everybody 's had an opportunity to see and participate in the budgetary process but we began you know late last year and here we are six months into this year and no one could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I 'm happy to support counselor sled oh sorry counselor Alba and I do think that in view of this all the circumstances that we 're facing not just tonight but have been facing for the last number of months that we need to try and make the most judicious decisions possible and I think by if you like for one of the better description buying two months is not going to impact too severely and it gives us the opportunity to adjust things depending on what other stimulus measures may come our way so I want to commend counselor over for for his motion this recommendation Thank You counselor both green counselor although right of reply would you like to speak thank you I 'd just like to acknowledge a part of what caps revolting said about the work that 's been done since December last year by mr. Kinsley her department and our community all the council staff and I think they 've worked tirelessly on on the budget and we commend the community for their comments as well so so thank you counselors for your decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you that it 's carried move to twelve point five point one the Mansfield heavy vehicle vehicle bypassed status in interim infrastructure manager Aundrey Kampala Thank You Andre thanks Andre no I think I just have to speak a bit louder cuz you 're off mute not really right again how 's that fantastic thank you very clear I can 't hear you but I 'll just pull the pull the pin on the earplugs so will on the headphones we 'll see here we go look by way of introduction this project has its Genesis back to 2010 as you will know there was budget in the current year 1920 to support this project but that hasn 't been proceeded with and we all know that projects that are that are large they are often that will they 're always founded on assumptions and it 's right and proper to challenge those assumptions over time to see how how we 're tracking as to whether we should be continuing with the investment or not you are aware of the community I 'm sure is aware that there has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past like on Green Bay Road dead horse lane with as Lane etc but where we are at is that in around March of this year there was a review done of this project specifically the traffic assumptions through traffic works and that 's what this report is partially addressing it 's bringing to your attention the the updated traffic data which really really revalidate s-- the the reason for this particular project is being needed over the long term for mansfield and also it spells out what is needed going forward if we are going to tap into grants that are available from time to time we already have two grants on our plate potentially we can tap those but I really do need some endorsement of care towards this project before I go talking to the federal government about extending grants so well that 's basically where it 's at in terms of the project and the resolution spells out the way forward so I 'm open to your question thank you that 's lose any questions we have a motion there would someone like to move the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you madam mayor there with me for a second if you in my I 'm just having a bit of a thought bubble I know you have asked if we have any questions and you know it 's say that 's great they we 're juggling so many different things in here at the moment so I 'll be going didn 't I got a bit of a problem with mr. complet actually hearing is that correct Andre thank you and a seconder all those in favor thank you we 'll move on to item 12 point five point two mates Ville Shire Council Road

statement but I felt very reassured I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just there 's a trip along the heavy vibe so many people by passing this this adoption of the roads road management plan is not directly related to that but what well I learned from that experience along with the CEO is your knowledge of roads and how they might be playing for scoped put out contender and so on and so forth is fantastic so it really just gives me some reassurance in supporting this motion and I want to commend you for the work you 've obviously done to bring it before us because it 's really important I

responded to them already and advise them just where you know the answers are and that we are seeking to address the bigger picture issues if it 's not appropriate in the road management plan it 's in the asset management plan so one way or another we are addressing people 's issues thank you very much so the motion is that council endorsed the mats will show road management plan 2020 submitted to
