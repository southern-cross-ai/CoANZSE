New Zealand",1203,I 'd like to invite and welcome commotion from totally creative spaces thank you now we needed we need your microphone on so there should be a button that you can yes now screen really very much perfect kyon Cotto I 'm Kim Morton from auto to a period of spaces thank you very much for this opportunity to address the council about our work about the partnerships we have with the council and to invite your future support we are working in neighborhood creation stations and these are create these are creativity groups and local communities building social connections and resilience we 're now running for creation stations in Illinois New Brighton Peterborough and Phillips Town and these are being run in partnership with the Christchurch City Libraries they 're successful because we 're activating community spaces which are the living rooms of our communities we have the total support and commitment of library staff and we work with local groups such as actors to maximize participation we 're seeing boosted resilience a real increase in social capital social connection stronger families and relationships that bridge culture age and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other no in Creation Station the fact that one of them a police uniform really makes no difference when you 're both working together and creating a woodcut trying hard not to UM cut your fingers and the process so we 've seen I guess they 're good example our creation stations are a good example of communities leading their own recovery and having a lot of control how about how that happens the other aspect of our work is room five creativity groups these are creativity groups for people with mental illness we run six at the Philips town community hub two of those groups are cope up on Modi through these groups were providing tailored intensive support in a small group environment we 're now supporting 48 artists to reach their aspirations and the artists are achieving great things and that that 's best summed up by one artist who said arch saved my life again we 're seeing a reduction in social isolation so people who formerly didn 't leave their houses have got the bravery to come regularly and weekly to these um creativity groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a reduction in their encounters with the formal mental health system and a reduction in medication we 've seen motivation and hope there 's a real sense of belonging and that the artists are part of something in the wider community people are taking up volunteer jobs at eastside gallery we 've had artists taking up scholarships for the learning connexion and achieving qualifications and and people are also getting paid work and generating income from the sale of their art this picture also I guess depicts how artists are expressing the feelings about the earthquakes through their art so here 's a drawing by Carmen Brown of the Christchurch Cathedral the balloons represent the people who died in the earthquakes it 's the most beautiful work she sold us an Auckland recently and she said I want people in Auckland to understand what we 've gone through in Christchurch creativity is also giving people a reason to reconnect with the central city so um excuse me a moment will recently wind on a group visit to Coca and saw David Shirley 's exhibition then our artists were invited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 85 drawings to Koko which will be displayed in the gallery in the cafe gallery gallery cafe dance did and what struck me though that was that for some of the artists that was the first time they 'd been back in the city since the earthquakes and it was quite confronting for them but they overcame their fears and now they have the honor of having their work exhibited alongside an artist of Wrigley 's and international standing so creativity opens doors offers hope and a place of belonging and provides a way for people to use their voice but most importantly it builds resilience in social connection with like-minded people our work this year has been funded by earthquake recovery grants from Red Cross and MSD the Sundering won 't be continued we don 't receive any funding at the moment from the district health board we 've succeeded in the face of adversity excuse me in an environment of reduced funding streams high-need and I guess an environment where the connection between creativity and well-being is not always well understood we have a strong track record and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long term we 've focused our work in the East where the needs of the greatest and our partnership with the Christchurch City Libraries and Maxime 's maximizers engagement and activates community spaces so we invite your help to continue our work we 're excited about the council 's commitment to resilience and well-being through the establishment of the community resilience fund although announced in February there 's still no information about the how this fund will be used and how it may be accessed and so we 'd appreciate your advice on this and how we can partner with the council and future to continue our work we urge the council to keep up the momentum and prioritize support to build the resilience of the citizens of Christchurch and to focus on the most vulnerable and least engaged we also ask the council to support the long term use of the closed schools as community gathering spaces our base at the Philips Town hub and the old school New Brighton both being very valuable assets for the community and ones that we hope can be available long to we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've given an information sheet about our programs without my contact details and we would love to have you to visit if you 'd like to contact me for further information my details are there thank you thank you very much I 'm really pleased that you came and made that presentation because it just it 's very grounding and it reminds us of what creativity and innovation can do and the wake of a experience that we 've actually we 've actually shared it collectively you know there 's just nobody that 's been unaffected but people who may have had pre-existing vulnerabilities have been made even more vulnerable and I just know what you 're doing is awesome so thank you very much thank you very much but this is just the public participation part it 's just a five minute okay

park,PJloxhJFsnI,20170413,1644.99,"Christchurch, New Zealand",4038,um do apologize for being four minutes late the memorial trees qet pack and the staff have come to the table that would be great so um Dave are you happy to move this and I know that there 'll be questions and you want to comment as well and Glenn are you happy to second it ok so that 's its moved and seconded so I 'll open it up for questions to staff Sarah oh and I 'm also doing mindful of the fact that there are counselors that are new to account yet and haven 't been part of the original decision and therefore the paper looks a little bit empty in terms of some of the advice that we were given with the original questions around yeah it 's also and the first time i 'd heard the word memorial was with the title of the paper but the paper itself didn 't explain the reason that these trees were initially decided to be required trees and this isn 't a memorial status in as it affected and as there anything we can do to to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well I the two memorial more fits and keeping with the groupings of the trees and some of those trees were planted over a number of years but the main groupings or clusters were planted at the time of qe2 being established as a sports stadium for the games it 's not so much trees planted by individuals so to speak you are some within that so it 's a bit of a mixture yeah I certainly there are some that are specific and clearly identified and we can contact those groups but some are much more general memorials yeah but those ones the ones that are affected here for this decision the three trees proposed to be removed note in the not memorial in terms of individuals or groups but they 're part of a cluster yes but done you know planted as a memorial yeah significant to them memorials and in Kobe to park tell them sit right by the entrance to the old entrance to the park one of them commemorates the fact that the park was the venue for the 1974 Commonwealth Games the other when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment I believe it 's and storage needs to go hacking in and to my reckoning that actually commemorates that it was the site of the original site of the new brighton trotting club going way back what was the third memorial that sits in the Enclave the trees that are further in the park that were labeled trees that would desire to be retained and under this proposal half of them would be and there 's 11 plaque and near that commemorates the local residents group that planted a tree around about the Commonwealth Games time as well unfortunately where the plaque is currently cited as a beside a tree that will go so I 've had assurances that that plaque would be uplifted and repositioned in the remaining trees that are are there okay quite like the idea of memorial trees and memorial groupings of trees is there a chance of while the young liner this is for the school site that we were able to do maybe it 's not another small grouping or individual tree they 've probably the community board in recognition of the opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're certainly space and amongst where the two primary memorials are to actually put another one in there and in fact it was something I yes but we going to suggest shortly the term yep Oh Mike thanks i just also had a question on the trees because i was reading through some I guess older submissions and there 's one that 's that talked about the Queen plant in one of the trees is it corrected is that any other hmm think that true may have been up close to the old stadium so I think I saw there 's a proposal to have some replanting is down on the trees right is it well it 's a scope for their memory project has extensive landscaping and planting a tree so their project includes an additional 340 trees within the campus development so that that 's what mo you 're doing lobby delete something okay think singers any more questions yeah um I still a little bit concerned about the fitness track and the public access but that was one of the key hearing panel recommendations and um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water that one down or is it something that we 're having discussions with the humans panel recommendation or the council resolution reflected the wording in the hair on his panel recommendation and that was a decision delegated to myself which I 've made a judgment call on in terms of the overall development of the school land where the interconnectivity and walking tracks and parts are within the school that that satisfies the intent of the council resolution so just in terms of the public perception though I mean the key thing from the hearings panel and the press ways that we put out set in irving a publicly accessible walking track to be that circles the entire park governor land owned by the ministry and alone returned by council so a you confident that that 's still wet oh I 'm confident we have given a feat to the council resolution I think you 'll find a council resolution does not say that okay second question is in terms of the numbers of trees that have been lost over the qe2 site you know what the what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well except these amateur some of it a lot of these are mature trees so I 'm just trying to understand I guess um you know the public submissions were really quite quite keen to protect the memorial trees so in terms of I guess the public perception the frontage will look quite it looks quite barren in terms of trees that most the mature trees along the front being removed as part of this development well the council decision was to sell the majority of the site for a development for buildings and playgrounds so implicitly than that is that existing trees on the site would go and the healings panel decision and council decision was really only specific and related and concerned about two groups of trees which this was report speaks to in the requirement to lose three advised to enable the development to take place in its current form you accept those are the mature trees at the front of the site so I 'm just trying to understand the visual impact of losing all the maturities another front if we approve this basement sir well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fly three for the Streeter site which showed the street frontage along Travis road and the landscape and is going to occur here and the seat back from the road of the buildings behind it okay and just um two final questions later so my understanding is one of the main issues is that the school wanted separate sports fields for each school which was led to this problem have we discussed with the school as an alternative actually utilizing one of the I think seven or eleven fields that we 're building as part of a joint sort of video we 're talking about trees here not playgrounds know the reason for the trees being being the reason we 're having this debate today is because the trees that are proposed to be removed in the middle of what 's proposed to be a sports field when we 've got something like a liminal seven sports fields being built next door by council so I just wanted to know whether or not we 've talked to the Ministry about instead of changing this by actually utilizing one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thought for one of the school the school want to deliver the optimum curriculum for these students which involves keeping on site all their activities supporting an educational they also want to long term anticipate that they will be utilizing the council grounds in the long term there 's a school development school develops and they get these sports teams they 'll be using more than just their on-site fields and just a final question around process were the people that made submissions to the hearings panel have they been notified that we 're considering this today and as the community would also be notified and asked for of you know there were some 380 submissions I think the issue around consultation is of course that the purpose of consultation is to elicit to the views and preferences of the community the advice that we 've given is those views and preferences are very well known because we had 381 submissions through the process and there is no need to engage with the community further because those views are known given that the board 's doing a master plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but this whole decision-making process has been dealt with by council and in versus a matter of planning for the school not not the whole of qe2 this is site-specific each other school on from yana d look I know if this was approved and we didn 't go back to the submitters who had specifically commented on the trees I think that would be a bad look that we need to do there even though you 're saying we 've received their consultation but I mean this is people are starting to get angsty that they say well they submitted on a consultation on a plane and then after that was closed in a decision made then a new decisions made that wasn 't consulted on and and three trees could make a difference to how somebody commented on rotation and I just think if it 's possible we should well the proposal of course was not around trees that was around the disposal of the land to enable the schools to be built the trees were issues that arose out of the consultation process the count the purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the community those views and preferences are well known we had 381 submit as I think there 's no legal reason why we would need to consult further because we know the views and preferences of the community yeah consultant in it you know contacting them person you 'd be injecting him for what purpose ricin that we 'd made a variation on what we consulted on well what we didn 't consult on the trees as such we consulted on despising of the land it means to talking the lane yeah some trees the solutions were not specific about specific trees that was the interpretation of the earrings panel based on the submissions protect our important trees we do so I mean this is a big ask I 'm not trying to minimize that and because we went through we went through it tree Bochy pretty sad leaf leaf but if we 'd if no stick on dude Steve yep I don 't know what speak you 've met that 's right maybe I 'm didn 't I 'm just blocking all your names I don 't know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the submissions with a fool or against the biggest issue was over the Travis road medical car park now I can 't remember the exact percentage so Fitz is that your information as well it was a significant issue here more than any other issue being the fitness tract or the trees yeah yeah okay and I just like to kick oh and by the way in the in your report which says those in favor of those against a lot of those submissions included in the against were kind of like conditional they said no but if you retain the car park we 're happy to support so important you know that just a nine-point 11.1 over the three required trees I think it is that it says that they 're in port of air conditioners that I just wanted to check that 11.19 point 11.1 in the report page for 21 the three required trees in Port of fear condition that 's at the end of that power is one of them one of them has done an hour Boston 's check the trees one is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a loser season these are the requires that are set aside from that these are the three were that are the subject of this report that are in the required area right and which a thing to have the higher status although it also notes the heritage and species status actually doesn 't make them top drawer trees either no they 're not um you know particularly large role trees and are the relatively common trees okay thank you alright so I 'll put the magnet understand in order spectra and David yeah I like to speak to the motion and I 'm in favor of the motion however I would like to point out that I do think the hearings panel were were not particularly well supported with accurate information about the trees in the first place I went down there last night and had a look and and we 're shown the three trees that are to be removed but well the report doesn 't tell you is that there 's probably another ten trees on top of that they 're going to go in that same area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't believe actually got accurate information on the trees in the first place along there but all of us at may I am in support of the emotion what what the motion the report also talks to us the fact that the other stand of trees which was termed trees that are desirable to retain and an actual fact had no encumbrance on them and under another development plan there 's 11 of those trees there by the way will bar one of those would have would have gone and they are all quite mature trees under this plan we we actually get to retain seven of those trees and one of them has that memorial that will be shifted along into the remaining remaining stand of trees so I think in the overall context of the request there is a positive outcome in that we do retain some quite mature trees the ones that we are losing our court in terms of comparison are are a lot less in stature I do take a wee bit of issue with arborists and their analysis of trees and it 's always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three trees of lesser value in terms of heritage and species and poor to fair condition well I can assure you one of them is actually in my humble opinion and very good condition but be that as it may so I think looking at the the overall impact that these this development will have on the eastern suburbs and the fact that yes we are losing three of the trees that we actually asked her be retained and retaining seven trees that we would have lost otherwise is caught quite a good compromise the the loss of those three trees really doesn 't impact at all on the area where the memorial stones are or rocks are and in fact most of that memorial area does actually fool and council own land or reasonable percentage of it I would actually like to suggest that in recognition of the Commonwealth Games and former uses of qe2 park though does receive a bit more of a landscaping plan and as up SPECT and and it could be quite a focal point of of memory to the former qe2 stadium the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be there before so to spot some reservations and some misgivings about the information we got in the hearing hearings panel I will support version thank you thank you um I to have some reservations about this and I think it 's beholden upon those who wish to use leaned that the council hairs or head to you know take note of the those the decisions of counsel in actually designer around those and it should be very clear about those but in this circumstance you know I think that the two local councillors Davis officially have a much better hold on that the communities used in preferences and and so I will be sort of deferring to the the local knowledge on this one in because it is a local and so I 'll be supporting it thank you well as you know I feel very strongly about trees in the city I just sent you around the arborist report so for those that are critical of not having the information take the time to read that because that report was actually really clear it was clear on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a number of different things that you can see trees that have been identified memorial trees and trees worthy of protection and it 's a real shame that actually most of those trees are going to be gone if we approve this today and I appreciate that there 's another group of trees the council didn 't put an encumbrance on which I voted against at the hearings panel and at the council because i thought they also should have been retained but there are significant amount of trees that will be worthy I just want to read you one of the quotes and because I think it 's really important I consider this is from the arborist I consider that collectively these trees on the landscape context of the gently sloping mullins to be worthy of being protected and retained in the redevelopment of the entry to the park they are complemented by trees of similar stature immediately to the west of the existing entry together they all have botanical interest and contribute to the pleasantness of the chaves Road streetscape so there 's a number of comments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't on every tree that iris that she looked at the trees that were worthy the trees that were memorial and the ones that win and so I just think it 's a real shown basically this comes down to the Ministry of Education having their own sports fields in an area where we 've got extensive sports fields being proposed that is the only reason that you have been asked to take off this incumbents and allow these trees to be demolished and these are a huge number of trees that are going from this site if you look at or removed if you look at the overall plan I encourage you to think about the huge number of mature trees that are going to be removed from the site kirito is a very special site the consultation was full of people that came and said we actually really think that it 's great that the schools are going here but that some were critical of the school going in the southeast quadrant and one of them going further up to the northwest so the public access around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be retained and unfortunately as a hearings better we weren 't able to change the location of where the school I could go in terms of the footprint that we were consulting on but actually we were able to try and protect some of the trees that were memorial and so I feel very strongly that we should not be removing healthy mature significant trees in the city when we 've already losing so much on this qe2 site we 're losing so much across the city simply for the sake of the ministry that wants to have a decatur sports world for a school when we 've got extensive extensive sports fields going back in this place which i personally think we could utilize with the school well done well are now rather than waiting for for later on so to me it just doesn 't make any sense this highlights i think the problem with going out for a consultation without any details about what 's being proposed in the impact that that will have and when people are asked if they want council to dispose of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be removed I think it 's hard for people to comment and I think again as I 've said many times hopefully there can be a lesson learned for the future decisions we have to make but today I 'm not supporting this I take exception to the fact that hearing spell didn 't receive good arborist advice we did get arborist advice that was very clear and it said that these trees should be protected thank you I was on the hearings panel is well with councillors Yanni and David and the main issue that came through for residents both in written form and Beverly was the retaining the medical centre car park so that that 's what matters for local residents their trees were one of the items submitted on as well along with the fitness trail and also the proceeds actually from the sale to the ministry but by far in a way the main issue was retaining the medical centre car park that came through very clearly we had a former deputy mayor and a counselor approached us about that and they also they 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is with the community when we drill down to this report essentially aside from the desired trees it comes down to a three required trees in poor fair condition so for me I mean when I look at the bigger picture and I stand back it 's about a luxury as a case of not losing sight of the wood for the trees and the big picture here really is the revitalization of the east so if you think about the overall project these two schools and joe scott has provided a marvelous vimeo on this along with CSG and the aquatic center that which we are building this is terrific and I my vision is to re kind of I want the city to be united and I think this will really help this will go a long way towards and kind of rebalance the investment so that 's what I 'm holding onto in this decision so those poor three trees and put a fair condition ready you know without being smart about it is kind of no contest in this debate so I hope you really will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the east of Christ reach those opposed they know okay so that one abstention dr swags and n you back abstain and beyond EO hints and pouring coffee vote against right let 's carry it thank you,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

order in that there was a request from the development forum for some are limits to be placed on total livi by catchment and so this takes this into account it still comes back to us in May and Kevin can answer any questions that you have yep and Jamie would like to Second Earth we 've got questions Yanni yeah so the committee didn 't make any change to the original policy around the whole issue of the peninsula the committee allowed for um I kept on the catchment to be enabled which was what came through from the development forum this is not the final we get to see this year again it comes back to us and may slowly just so it incorporated the changes that were sought by the developer forum right I 'm just one understand what I would be really useful staff could just explain what the impact is of that in terms of the policy the issue of the cat came up as a result of the possible impact of going to catchments for water and wastewater and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development contributions and the development forums suggested that having the council able to apply a cap if one of those figures was unrealistically high might be a good thing for the council to have I won 't be able to to him to invoke so once the proposed cares there is no proposed care it 's just an ability to cap if the council considers that the figure is high enough that it will have consequences that the council doesn 't want to see happen so if it is for example seen as a detriment to development the council may decide to impose a cap at a certain rate there is no prescribed or intended prescribed rate to cap but it would be a decision on a case-by-case basis for the council to make and sorry just so I 'm clear so if you kept at you effectively put a higher charge across other catchments or what old see the right player now you can 't put a charge across other catchments but they would be the difference would need to be funded from their rates component of the K @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the division of cost so you have your growth your renewals your increasing level of service and your unallocated it so that it would effectively become unallocated okay I mean it just seems to me a lot of uncertainty about what transfer of course we 're putting on there is and it 's a an unfortunate consequence of needing to go to catchments and but that 's a direction the government have given quite clearly through the local government act and one that we are looking to further give a fit to it 's always going to be an issue for the bank sponsor is enough yeah anyway I 'm Tim so if we put a careful cuz we have issues obviously and exponential with water and wastewater so you saying that if we put a cap on the on this then there would be a targeted rate in this area to make up fruit no um so therefore there is a cost to the right players of course it 's because a relevant of where it goes and their budgets the budgets are always paid by the right powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ targeted rate for water and wastewater that is targeted to all properties able to connect to a council service so that 's corrective it would be funded by those ratepayers that get that particular service that you 've kept across the district because it would become as if it was unfunded so therefore if it is a net particular catchment which would be banks peninsula if for that the rates would be then higher because of the cap on the development contribution which we 're talking about here or possibly talking about here no because you don 't have a geographic targeted rate for those services so the goddess of where you are in the district you pay this aim for water waste water based on your capital value so district meaning whether you 're in Bellwood Pendleton Kashmir or pigeon valley or whatever yep although the cost could be higher and that certain areas correct so be yeah okay so therefore that is actually being paid for by everybody i 'm just-just on 6.8 the fourth point and at the end of point for a little entire could potentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the letters and wastewater network what crisis I confirmed with regards to our budgets at citra because what what what 's the time frame to that or a zero time frame I don 't know you you would need to ask someone from the asset area about but it was being used as a point as a nap time it 's there to alert you to the fact that at some point we may need to change the catchment for Littleton or we made look at changing it now to pre him that happening later on I guess we wouldn 't when that information we would need to know the odds of the evening the reality of it and its 1 front correct thank you thank you Andrew my understanding is the planning for that little some waste water changes is reasonably well progressed the consenting issue that we thought there might be has turned out not to be the problem that we perhaps thought it could be so plans are well underway for that to be rolled out and it 's worth noting that that Littleton waste water scheme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so it 's not just little some that we 're talking about but where we 've got to here really is the difference between the cost of provision of these type of services to rural areas versus the cost of provision to established urban areas such as littleton and I mean one of the ways I thought we might get through that would be by way of sub catchments within what is actually a huge geographical catchment of the whole of banks peninsula an area bigger than the rest to see put together so middleton paying for a Corot wastewater treatment why new wastewater treatment whatever it may be you know geographically Littleton 's as far away from a corolla as and sumner would be away from harewood for argument 's sake so it 's because of the the size of the single catchment for a process point of view clearly that hasn 't been raised to date and we 've raised this issue of Littleton potentially for wastewater purposes going with the the rest of the sitting but are we really now from a process point of view relying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make changes because on I still remain a little bit uncomfortable that we 're going out with a document for consultation which is inherently unfair to people that are in rural in urban areas of banks peninsula and the catchments we 're still working on the most appropriate way to treat the catchments and banks peninsula but you 're quite right we wouldn 't be looking to have a single catchment for banks peninsula for water or wastewater and we 'll come back with a draft policy that proposes an approach to catchments that you can debate at that time which is so that 's not what we 're going out for consultation to the community with all of us reporters asking you for is the agreement for us to look at an approach to catchments yes there are most some of the feedback that we might expect from the peninsula would feed into the piece of work that you 're talking about at this stage it 'll be a more of a I guess a desktop exercise but we will be looking to make it as fear and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draft policy you 're able to clearly see something that is able to be presented to the people of banks peninsula that looks as in a rational and defendable yeah no that 's all right noting where we 're at in the process that that makes some sense thank you very good I 'll put motion okay and also I just wasn 't I 'm just China again sorry I understand in the cat with this fitting in because I don 't see hey we 're going out for consultation so why don 't you just vote against it it 's much easier from from the point of view that you oppose that going out because finally agree with the form data doesn 't no no I agree with the catch ones what I don 't agree with us to specific things which is the central city contribution rebate continuing in the cat right but I don 't know where the cappers were quite so can you move an amendment which is to remove item 5 and to remove which 1i close provision for council to keep a development contribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but secretly yeah no yeah there 's probably not a need for an amendment if he doesn 't agree with you can just buy yes sir yeah well 5 i 'm happy to move that um that the central series of our own contribution rebates screen this was drawn from a middle price you 're a mingling is Nigel evening far I 'd be I mean I 'm conniving I can do it two ways one is that you get a seconder and we put the amendment it sounded oh ok look ok so I 'll just it 's been done okay look all right I say I 'm gonna I 'm gonna go through them one at a time yeah ok so now I 'm just wish to speak ok or just very quickly I support the idea that we move to a catchment basis I think the cost of providing infrastructure particularly in greenfield development are where it 's very expensive the true costs of that development i think falling more on the people that are benefiting from it makes a lot of sense and the reason that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually i think the use of ratepayers money to fund that sort of development is not the right approach the right approach in my view is to reduce the development contribution charges for development in the central city rather than to provide a subsidy and subsidize it from the to a more direct cost to those in the greenfield areas that with a costly infrastructure is a huge burden so if you think about the the huge money being spent in terms of the peninsula on things like waste water and water treatment I think it 's entirely appropriate that the people in those areas actually contribute to the cost of putting their infrastructure own so I 'm very concerned about a cat because I believe it puts an uncertainty on the financial situation that we 're in and I just think that that 's not the right approach and I think it makes it very hard on council staff because it will also open up I think a can of worms that many other people will come to us and say I want to cap on my development charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does that end up so personally support the catchments don 't support ratepayers money going into central city developers with much rather feed at subsidized through the catchment scheme rather than the way in which we 're currently doing noting that i think there 's greater calls on ratepayers funds in terms of other priorities and noting that we 're not putting great power money into other things like for example provision of social housing we 've been very clear about that so to me the priority for number five is to look at the rates generally being reduced through that rhetoric net scheme so i will vote against continuing Andy in terms of item one if we put that into context of a karai I would encourage counselors to remember that a large amount of the burden which is placed on a corolla particularly on a Kairos infrastructure so water reticulation waste water reticulation isn 't just from the relatively small number of people that live there it 's also from the relatively large number of people that visit there so not only local people visiting for day trips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large numbers of the moment cruise ship passengers coming through and we expect that to continue and also large numbers of international visitors that 's one of the reasons why we need fit-for-purpose water reticulation and wish water disposal in a corolla and there 's an economic benefit not only to a corolla but to the city and the region from those visitors so I think looking at a Corot adjust in the context of the relatively small number of people that live there and I give this just as an example wouldn 't be the correct approach and also bearing in mind that one allows that to be considered doesn 't necessarily mean that that 's what we 're going to do Jamie um ok so just um I know yannis raised specifically one in five what i would say in relation to one is completely agree with everything Andrew said but this is there 's really just giving me a start our staff the ability to camp it 's to provide a tool to mitigate against the unintended consequences so NS 45 you know I certainly don 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ August 2015 to do this our commitment was out until 2020 or until the funders exhausted its tracking well it 's not exhausted yet we 've had 42 developments and the cvd that have fallen under this policy with 6.3 million of the 10 million already committed I 'm glad we made this commitment because we actually showed that we were a council that had some commercial understanding and some commercial mouse we were told that by the property council that seemed to us a leader to the fire the mirror that was very complimentary saying that we 're actually thinking proactively and outside of the square to really encourage something we desperately needed you know you only need to look at the likes of yep G&R John beggin from the verve development which is an apartment complex on the oldest establishment site where they said that if that policy didn 't exist the rebate scheme they wouldn 't have done it they would have done the development in Auckland that was the tipping point for them grant mckennon who is one of the most experienced residential developers in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartments starting with a 4 and not a five so something in the four hundred thousand dollar regions into the 500,000 region is not a handout to developers it would be if there was one developer in Christchurch but there 's not and because of commercial pressures they 're competing against each other and the beneficiary is the residence of Christchurch it 's the potential homeowner at someone that 's going to be buying a house because those savings are passed on just simply because of the competition so not only does it benefit someone that 's keen to buy a house all the research suggests that if you want to have a city that thrives Christchurch on the whole thriving that you need to have a strong central city and all that research also suggests that to do that whilst there 's no silver bullet bringing residents and their an encouraging resident residential population is the way to achieve that so this is an incredibly this with elegant way to achieve it because it 's it 's virtually virtually cost neutral and yes this policy encourages development but at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way I see it as a 11 is really because we 're putting our money where our mouth is and encouraging what exactly what we want to happen and by doing that we increase the capital value so it actually increases the council 's right take anyway I 'd far rather us be collecting rates on a brand-new beautiful central city residential development than a patch of dusty twisted metal setting in the central city so it has worked the property Council of New Zealand has told us worked it 's come from the horse 's mouth from the people that are actually on the ground doing it telling us it 's worked our staff have told us it works the development forum is unanimously endorsed it so I think we 've been incredibly poor moved to backtrack on it and from someone that 's had a background in this industry I can tell you that it does work so I 'm asking you to take my opinion over yannis on this and beckoned okay now look item number two agrees to the preliminary amendments to the dr contribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a kind of a i rather capture who wants to vote against certain elements so if if I can take so item one you 'd like to it doesn 't matter okay and but so item one you want to do separately okay so can we record yannis vote against item 1 and item 5 yep are there any others that people want to add into that so i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much so yani opposes the items one in five right years so but we 're going to go to a break","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

for people that have got busy lives okay thank you well i 'll teleport has read just with four points to draw your attention to thank you first of all 2 million and in the team and also from the record and won 't be rules will area for the culture the law very successful event about 3-4 weeks ago we are kin doing consultation on the LTP is what we expected with a successful day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being raised for obviously their intersection in our ward that 's under discussion and also around the annual general charge and how that 's applied and if it is at all updated since it hasn 't been done for a while I believe good news story on the lines BBQ you may recall from last meeting there has been a location found in the Burnside park which is in agreement with the local landscape and the very hippy about it so that I believe it 's the 100 year and gift to the city for that particular Club and also just any will see in the report antisocial behavior at Lake rotor which is in behind the back of the airport significant amount of vandalizing and damage the council profit out there when we don 't believe that we can walk there 's no record of anybody been trespassed out there by council enforcement so it 's something which we want him to sort of see and there 's obviously a lot of ratepayers money going into fixing fences and wasted time start a staff time thank you I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the initiative of taking the annual plan out to supermarkets and malls you know what a what a brilliant way to engage the public and a process that peeps they wouldn 't otherwise get involved in so I just want to give you big ups today that 's fentanyl hospital yeah not so just a great move and I 'd encourage others to do the same you don 't you don 't need to wait to be invited to do this you can just go ahead and do it as what you 've proved and really appreciate it Glen Pauline and Andrew thank you thank you David thank you I 've attended the March meetings over the proposed stock transfer thesis 8.2 page 263 including the one and Brent work and obviously when someone 's security of tenure as there 's threaded there is anxiety as reported there so I I just as a week heads up the council there there will be you know that as you 'd expect a political expression of that in the coming weeks by various curious people in the community and I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you there is local public ownership around housing so there is a preference by many to ensure that the state keeps up an ownership but if they transfer goes ahead I think yeah we will need to ensure that it is kept in local public I initially and you 'll notice this is an issue that well forefront our war does have the second largest state housing in the city and a point which is often overlooked in of it obviously it 's been dealt with by central government and innocent it 's in process so as it goes on we 'll keep monitoring it okay hauling Andrew info you look my one is some just taking the opportunity to ask you a question about the bishop Dale documentary project yes so they obviously came to the board of the ship 's crew and and I just want to ask you if you might be able to seduce something and Ray Homer I which is now in your jurisdiction if they would be interested in having look there because I 've been to a I was lucky enough to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the most amazingly eloquent tip terminology the whole history of every meaning of all those weavings and things up there and I would love that to the documented and recorded nothing that would fit really well into what they 're doing here so I 'm wondering if you may be able to we can pass it I talked to them about their um he 's getting on now someone needs to really move on getting him documented an MRI because the history of satmar I was the original moderator shutting programs here spent easter note that i 'd love to see that record and i love to see him recorded live doing that because he 's absolutely spell burning to listen to it I can see Marianne nodding so yeah there will be done thank you it 's a can I just a slip on here and I 'm sorry to do this because as I can and and is there the multicultural strategy is going to be launched a tray her MRI on the 13th of may and the morning so you all get your invitations I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to be it now how far for a number of reasons but the four ones represents very well the multicultural strategy but it 's going under a restoration at the moment so there 's a lot of work going on there so it 's not available but rare hua tells another story which is about Marty trade training and bringing Marty from other parts of New Zealand so in fact it tells a very similar story but it 's it might be an opportunity to you know colleagues to engage with the Mariah in the context of the release of the multicultural strategy just a free advertisement that I hit I 'm Andrew and then Phil thank you I 'm good to see the piece in here at 6.5 on the bishop Dale Men 's Shed I 'm familiar with the Men 's Shed from the work that they did creating the social housing planter boxes caught up with a number of members of this group at the various social housing openings over the last couple of years and on a big supporter of men 's sheds not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do socially good to see that they 've managed to resolve their accommodation at you has that move now taken place I don 't believe it here 's part of the new library no in there in kindle so they 've already moved really now that 's fantastic guys thank you it felt my questions also about the success of the mainsheet at Bishop Dahl and also though I 'm we 're like Andrew there 's a number of men shoes and different parts of the city and clearly there are a community development with blokes wanna establish men 's heads and it 's great it 's just help in fact can we sort of how can council support filling the gaps really weird a lot of areas where we don 't have them and yet the would-be books you might go wrong Lazzara is bloody suggestion spectrum your hand too is the health counselor might further support early Christian be stricter to the men cheat I mean we can do what we can to help them and but their long-term growth strategy is probably best answered by then this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion all those in favor say aye aye those opposed say no that 's carried or do I not have a mover in a seconder so Jamie aimed Aaron yes good the Grouch have useful thank you the next one is the innovation and sustainable development committee

long our deputy chair of the board there but the presentations from the community board have been absolutely amazing fantastic great teamwork Queen people was leading away so come on council to do counselor make sure I 'm gonna expect all the committee 's to follow so it 's good to hear um we 've got no port part is to report at this in this report so that 's there I 'd like to highlight a few things here the systems made as you can see on the report just a couple of things i 'll highlight well as the lake terrace will she let reserved there was a car park there that 's totally munted sorry we having a picture for you you can hardly get into it let alone get out of it so we 've met with staff and had our site meeting and so we 're given the go-ahead as a county board to put car parking on to the other side with the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that resolution there was a staff had requested that a little footbridge be and removed in sidetracked so we 've actually as a board decided that needed to go out to community consultation that part of it because these little assets are quite important to community so we just want to make sure that we made the right decision on that little footbridge there it 's part of that another thing that we attended and got approved would go to him since it 's David East myself was the coastal divers coastal environments seminar which was really good but all the free community one at night and one of the speakers that they had there was Jim dumb and we were actually really surprised and encouraged by him because at one point they put it and a picture up we got a lot of genes in that area so it was really informative for us to be dia one of the pictures i put up was of a house and the sand dune had virtually food at the house at the front had all disappeared and you could hear a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not a problem and he showed us the next few years and how they had worked with that and restored that so it was really encouraging and very refreshing to see how they approached some solutions there the other thing that I 'd like to the significant projects and initiatives that we have a new brighton your broken regeneration so development christchurch and now working are underway with the design of the beach playground and the whale pool as you can see that much loved well pull on that aiming for the completion of it by summer the summer and the community have i read i 'm going to be involved in the concept designs i 've already had a play space workshop last week with some key stakeholders in the community so that was really good and so they are still able to provide feedback and they will be getting things underway next couple months really important to keep the community involved and informed on that so alongside that as you know development christchurch are working on the implementation plan for the commercial core and incorporating the key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of work has been done as you know behind the scenes would be sort of saying that it 's a little bit like you look at the picture of a nice piece the community are able to see this sort of tip of it but there 's a lot of work actually going on underneath the ground so we do as a community board very much appreciate that and are very grateful a progress update we the South Brighton GT an hour last time we came that was on the agenda so at the moment as we speak it has been deconstructed in reconstructed and is even going to be a little fancy floating plastic pontoon at the end of it which is going to rise on forward the tide and it 's expected be completed by July also a little bit of a progress update on the South frightened boardwalk it was mentioned last time it possibly the student army volunteer army could get involved but the council project team have been working really really hard on this to keep the cost down and to meet the community expectations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit of an update that they 've indicated that it could be a possibility even a copy repaired so I mean I really were expecting it report on the first of me and so it could become a really good outcome for the community that one there we have the regeneration Christchurch regeneration Christchurch should be as you know doing huge amount of consultation in the community around an OG Kyrie Irving river corridor and so they 've had engagement days and the latest one that they had was a committee day at high tech community college and there was about 600 people that fit onto that so that was outstanding there and this next issue there as you can see up on my screen south shore we put it in read involved because just diluting the south shore and South Brighton but we had the South Shore residents association coming to a deputation to us on the twentieth of March and that 's another significant community issue and this community has been through so much with the lack of protection on the eastern edge and I just was sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benin they 've all gathered together and come up with a solution now that really is resilience as far as I 'm concerned but this community has just been outstanding their consultation sort of put a proposal together and got on board I sell consultants and they have come up with a proposal for the Easter II edge there in the South Shore residents associations have put this report together and the litter box drop to the entire south shore and with an explanation report and gotten feedback they had 340 they had 348 come back and 343 of that in favor of this actual report they also dawn up to those that hadn 't come back they were just making sure they covered everything they had community meetings and they also had a drop-in centre and watch they found and what is unique about this proposal that has catered for and has brought agreement across bearing environmental desires and it 's really something that has a great outcome community-led so we listened to this at our community board and I 'm totally wanting to support social residents wherever we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organize a workshop between regenerate Christchurch OSL consultants this council staff and the South Shore residents association to see how we can help this community progress with this rather major issue because they love other than a daily basis so really good to have them come and ask for a support there again we are working on our board plan with a really good few hours last night working on the on them on that so that was we 're making progress there of course significant methods of interest we 've got the annual plan and of course as you know the hot side woulda pulls a hot at the moment in the community board and the community a very eager to see that confirm the budget there confirmed in the annual plan it was actually both of them were really well attended we were very glad I think pizza really helped so that was a good thing yeah the other thing we 've got here bring to your attention as the qe2 part management we 've got the Qt recreational sports getting underway now as you know and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development of a management plan around the rest of the qe2 site which is really important thing we 've had the sale on some pictures agreement signed by the Ministry of Education this will also obviously include the proposal for how the funds for the sale will be managed so the board is going to have stuff going to come back to the board and we 're going to have a workshop on that and go from there it 's very important see the whole picture and the other thing that 's important to us is the development of the civil defense emergency plans now that we have the review of the tsunami evacuation that was an important document for us to have to help feed them to what we do so we 're going to meet with civil defense with that and other motion that we have end start that process and that 's coming weeks community events well of course as you know we 've got we 've had a huge amount i set them all last time and polytheists one was actually at standing several thousands competitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outstanding and we also had the the the surf lifesaving national was down our area and on the next one you can see there should have put your name on an errand because apparently didn 't want to be on the surfboard last time I want to actually being a surf candy so you 're actually on that picture and that was a really good event so just fantastic to see you know that the area buzzing and also unfortunately for the ray white surf festival the weather wasn 't so good but the atmosphere and the event actually made up for the weather so that wasn 't a problem the only thing that a casualty of that was that the youth gem event which was a shame that couldn 't go heat because of the weather so that was a shown the next picture that we have here we have the tiny Hut now look at that doesn 't let a romantic spot who wouldn 't want to go and visit there so like to see you dear they close to my wife on it oh yes so romantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could be okay go beyond festival yeah so it 's bit some there so what we 've got that up before what we 've got there up there for is that the community have been asked by counsel as to what they wanted to have done 45 tiny hats and the community spoke and said they 'd like them to remain so that was very exciting for us dear so there 's another for dotted around you brighten which you can come and visit a lime and touch and all sorts of things with the other things got a few pictures up here had a few things we 've got along just down the bottom there as we this weekend the bridge building community trust you know that you very generously donated to 325,000 to has an amazing painting date on the side of the building so that 's not the actual picture but it 's very much like that so that as I sit on their website Facebook posts on putting some more love into the bridge building so it 's been really well looked after and really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carnival coming up this weekend and Easter Bunny is going to be there so why wouldn 't you want to be there and they 're going to have an easter egg hunt great see these things and also at the market seaside market because we have that every Saturday come down have a locked in till two and there 's going to be a bubble day yep got some bubbles up there so there 's going to be a lot of fun for the kids there and we also have the bus tour now we keep postponing that because we want to create more momentum and anticipation so it would love to see you there on the twenty-second of money so and I think that 's us thank you excellent so I presume that um councillor Easter day and counselor Livingston would like to move in sick and dirt are there any questions Yanni qet you just talked about a management plan is there a spatial plan that 's been developed as well so that we can see how everything can fit in place that 's a really good question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah thank you i don 't anyhow so sorry young Josh will include that and we know we likely to see that this will be discussed with the board and the board will agree a time frame and what will luck will meet that so it 's really bored lad as soon as possible that as soon as you 've received that report will find it coming through and this report I made the comment to someone else that it 's really good to have these reporting processes because it just brings us up to speed on what 's going on that 's great John good good news our Phil thanks so much and can I just you meet the different projects along self draw in new brighton so in but it 's really great gibbeh to be done the area which was red zone alike Anderson regeneration Christchurch you 're attending to is it work that they 're doing all being joined up with the other work that 's been done playa council and you people involved directly she thank you i 'm going to hand over the term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reason sociation and myself were working with regenerate and we 've discussed plans that we 've had shown to us by gary tier from 0 cell so we are we are actually at the moment working with them thanks to move been one coastline is clearly the different processes all and it is a big helping we generate bertino obviously agencies always the big question so but they do what they have to do so see what happens well i think i think the regeneration process offers great opportunities for actually engaging the community and it sounds like a lot of engagements already pepin and that will help feed into the process so i think it 's a great model it agreed it 's very good best hope yep good clean think you and i think is a sense in which that you know the regeneration as far as the use of the red zone is already happening so the formal planning may be Suzie put in place but these are seats in which the whole area is kind of being bit if you like so we 've had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a road and with the stock bank work the temporary work underway at the moment is going to be a tip recycle puppet warp way on top so there 's already underway yeah I 'd election forget to say sorry and I had written the board have actually called for a workshop with region ourselves council staff and guarantee our social yeah and I 'm suggesting that you you would add the a hoot I trust to their because so that you make sure you 've got a real flavor of the ambition for RAM size status in the history and also the history each master plan because that it 's got its got to work with that it looks fine to me but I 'm not an experiment it 's yeah David thank you look I just like to add my commendation to the work that South Shore community have done in progressing their own plan on how they feel that the ester is down there should evolve and the i believe the cooperation going forward with regenerate will bring a great outcome there that 's been quite interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intention of participation and a number of projects particularly the likes of the boardwalk restoration where we 've had a lot of community interest in being involved the student army have expressed an interest in being involved and come touched on the sand dune restoration conference that was held in new brighton recently with the coastal engineer jim Dom has done a lot of work in the coromandel and the message that came out from him very clear he had done a lot of restaurateurs work up there but the underlying message was that you had to take the community with you when you were on these projects and so many of them had come to to fruition with great result because a plan had been evolved that involved the community not only in the discussion about hair it may eventuate but at the end part of that there were a lot of works that would be undertaken particularly plantings in having the community buy-in and the first place lead to a great community participation in the end part of the process which then meant that the community actually owned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking forward to a lot of that soil engagement in cooperation and some of the projects that need to be undertaken in the south shore south near an area I just I did actually wonder myself with a part of the good attendance at your engagements around the annual plan hadn 't just been sparked off by pizza but by pepsin misunderstanding about the consultation on the hot salt water falls I read facebook pages from time to time and there was certainly a view that came through from a small group of people that somehow this was revisiting a decision that had already been made the decision we 've made was to put five million dollars on the budget but that 's not enough to build the hot salt water pools we hope that we could bring under sponsorship external support partnership private sector and it hasn 't happened but in order to make you bright and the destination that it has to be at the end of that journey from the city to the sea it requires investment so that 's what we 're consulting on we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West recently and i said i want you to support what we want to do in the eighth and we have to get community support for that so i don 't want people to be angry or frustrated or anything this is an opportunity that I believe is a gift of the earthquakes and we 've got to take advantage of it and so you think to me anyway I shall put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much great work and","(-43.5320214,

NZ,NZ,Christchurch City Council,Christchurch City Council,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZETwErnCvvgbvBbnnHfyxA,13.04.17 - Item 14 - Lyttelton Historical Museum Society - request for gift of land,82QtfrlKH3I,20170413,369.81,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1131,yeah Andrew so the reports reasonably clear as to what 's required but what we 've got here in Christine alluded to this in her commentary a really well resourced group they 've done a huge amount of work having lost the original museum building as a result of the earthquakes I 've done a huge amount of work in the meantime cataloging the whole collection obviously planning the next stages to get to the point of the resolution that 's in front of us today and really taking a very well thought out strategic approach to the future of the museum so what we 've got in front of us here is not only an opportunity for the Middleton museum to be reinstated but an opportunity for a brand new community owned building to be built on London Street in Littleton in partnership with the council the proposal obviously is that we would gift the land the building will be built with funds raised by the museum society and held by the museum society and I think there 's something quite resonating about the fact that the the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a community-owned building and I was at the meeting of the museum society where they made the decision to pursue this particular option and it 's fair to say that the meeting that was held at the local church was attended by more than what you would think of as the museum community there 's a really strong interest across across the whole of the Littleton community in this project going ahead and it was great to see Littleton in all its colors at that meeting supporting the museum society in making their decision and starting to look forward to to this project actually coming to fruition on London Street so I 'm hugely encouraged by this I think the group is very capable of delivering on the on the project I 'm very aware of a huge amount of work that 's gone into it so far and would love to see this progressive progress to the next stage so um certainly would hope that my colleagues would support this today tell if you 're not an Audi supporter but I just want to make sure that time on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaned then 5 + 6.5 now if things did go on hope in real other they don 't that once libraries expenses have been uncleared will be visited jointly with the crushed to the council and Canberra Museum other buildings and the land would come back to the council but if the at the point where the liabilities in excess of the land in the buildings with this would be initially so I 'm presuming that our property team or the gifting there would be an agreement dear debt would ensure that it would not happen so I 'm just wanting to do cost I 'm just crossing the T 's and dotting the i 's this all but now we do have to be responsible for all of our cars across huge we had moved into debate so what question sir yeah but I mean we 're supporting on principle going out for consultation so I think that all those questions will be answered answered by the time I mean it this makes it clear about the lane coming back of if there I know I know but but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be wanting to know the answer to that question Annie I 'm thinking I 'm very supportive of this um I just wanted to again just I guess make it a bit of a note that we have seen some community groups try and project manager builds things can get out of hand quite quickly and to no fault of their own but you know I think one of the really positive things we did with Mel pleasant as we provided some project management expertise from a council one of you that I think really helped that group and again I 'm not saying that this group would need that but I think if the offer could be made or indicated I think that would be a good thing to do just because i think you know often people don 't know what they don 't know and particularly for building a new building it can be quite complex so just one that i guess just encouragement um you know to the community water to council staff if it was an opportunity to provide that support then i think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just wanted to make was just around the importance of our cultural well-being and I think actually telling the story and you know particularly around the port and around Littleton that 's just such a fantastic story and I think that is those things that we need and you know it 's happening to see that in some that we 've also got the Summoner request oryxes started having a museum space in the new build there so I think it 's really important that we do support this facility in this building and and then just the final the final thing um just again a a kind of a lesson learned from previously but it would be really good when the consultation happens we could just consult on the square piece of land but actually if there was a design that was able to be accompanied that just helps the public when they make submissions if there is any issues that they can see clearly what 's being proposed and again we 've got killer to coming back to us today one of the issues there was the absence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really hard for the community to give feedback because there were so many unknowns and again we 're coming back to that decision now so if it can be done that there can be some sort of designed in the consultation I think that would be really helpful very simple immortals very good all right so but ever say this is going out for consultation so I think staff have made a note that that would be something to report back on as well in terms of whether the organization needs project management assistance if they if the agreement is made to transmit early so i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know it 's carried thank you very much thank you very much,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

over and should be good from here purim it 's all very well for you to be in praise of those people who 've got pictures very stressful especially when someone starts to introduce moving things early right away and we 've got a pate and hats big community center lease renewal I just want to briefly mention hansberry and which used to be Goodson hansberry on the hill had to be on the hill sorry what ends at Matins on the hill is coming up to its centenary and we asked I asked and heritage people on council and they came back with some really interesting remarks about the history of Han Suri hunt spree but this is the community seem to renewal which is halfway up the hill and it 's used so much that we had a meeting Tim and I yesterday with other community board members in residence at the stir place which is at the top of hunts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propensity to be in cars and played AB and they the local residents wanted to have a meeting at the Hutt 's brief community center and couldn 't find the time to get one because it 's so packed day out with events and with community interests so and we 've got the pate you move report that follows yeah yeah okay Mel and I are going to share this honor in the decisions made there 's a couple of things like events that aren 't there which I 'm going to briefly mention but you 'll see that these requests for staff to look into the possibility of a plaque in in memory of Christine loughton and many of you will be aware of Christina and the work that she 's done in the community and her self effacing an absolute commitment to people and the community and we 're asking staff for comment about placing a plaque on a bus stop because that was one of her many many interests and we also had our garden awards and organized by the redoubtable Wendy gun sir she managed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prizes for our gardeners at the end of their presentation of awards and we had the biggest number of people at our awards ceremony that we move ahead and it 's just much-loved occasion even though the area are smaller we had more people getting Awards and it 's a much-loved occasion and we all attend and it 's fantastic and also not mentioned is the fact that we 're undergoing a series of school visits to the boards of trustees of our schools the primary issue that 's come up on the visits that we 've done thus far as safer travel to school we are really embarrassed at our first visit when the staff said when the boards of trustees said how much they value the work of the safer travel advisors we didn 't know they existed so we 're asking for them we 're asking them to come and present to us and tell them what they do but this was that this has been the primary issue that has been raised by our boards of trustees as the safer routes to school and their fears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and and the last group the last visit this week was sprayed on school and they are losing their school pool in shifting to the old meaning intermediate sight in hoon hay and the loss of a school pool is always extremely sad not just for the swimming but because of the community involvement that occurs in the summer when people get their school keys and set with other parents in the community and look at their kids playing in the water so we are that 's a loss to our community the factor pet school ball Paul is going to be closed mel we 're only do we move nothing why is it no we haven 't are there we go excellent um so I was going to talk with got just mention of the hoenn a community center and we 've got quite a few photos of us lots of things have been happening there at the moment there 's a steering committee that sort of been running for the last sort of nine months under the umbrella of rally house so Donna Mike alia has been instrumental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that steering committee and I 've organized the lease that we 've got at the moment with the council insurance and all sorts of other things and a whole bunch of improvements have happened on the inside of the building was painted by students from era which one of the local residents organized because he works there the new sign was put at the front there had been at one donated that got damaged so nearly a new one was put in by Carol the cava from rally house so it 's absolutely beautiful respecting other things such as the curtains were fixed up and they put apple trees around the back and all sorts of other things so there 's a whole lot of community stuff going on there and in the hoenn a community associations got a whole series of events planned for the CSO there 's being VG swaps and christmas carol singing and recipe events and all sorts of things where every time you go you meet someone new from the area which is kind of the point of having a community facility like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left is when they had it was the first community association meeting that they had last year and this is just the high rates form in this Carolyn ma 'am that was the opening last with the cake that got made by a lady in the community who wanted to remain anonymous blended up door knocking new trainee election and figured out who she was where she lived which is quite cool and yeah and this is one of our other cottages center of the community this is manuka cottage and they have been in some areas beautiful the beautiful church of st. Mary 's for four or five five years before that that shifted a couple of times since they 're building went post-earthquake there now they 've now been waiting for six years the staff are working very hard to replace manuka cottage and to establish themselves on Cornelius Park wrong okay so there 's a lot of the church of San Mary 's it 's absolutely gorgeous it was a wonderful congregation and it was the fear that they had recently as well on the left yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run a lot of joint functions with them or friend functions that the all the community board members tune up to and in consultation cycleway consultations and so on and walk and held in the in the church and will be held in the future at Manuka cottage in its new location not far from the church at Cornelius O 'Connor reserve just to embarrass yelling she won 't save it as her dressed up as to-read or down or Tweedledee and amid all there and she does it every year and our fear I 'm always with EFE I 'm actually trivial this camellia so Connor we briefly want to mention the port hills fires and the staff I just want to make what I want to mention about that is the staff the staff has been absolutely amazing yet again because they 've been clued upon so often in the last year was the Kaikoura earthquakes and so on and pull diddlin in particular in a plane wildfires went on for those days Paul Devlin up in the plane directing the traffic and the helicopters and last time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes because he has worked so hard but also the staff of the big and I 'm supercenter who yet in have been working in an emergency situation and all the other staff many of whom I don 't know the pack range is the people behind the scenes the people organizing the staff and grace is now and doing the hitting leading the social welfare side of it and we just want to thank the staff we think they 've been doing wonderful wonderful things we 've had a couple of resolutions on replanting etc but I think the staff have been ahead of us on those resolutions and we certainly what don 't want to tell grandma 's decades we want to say how much dad down and how much we respect the work that they 've done and then and think that this I think that moved especially quickly on the issue of replanting etc mella means their boards delegate to the summit road society and I 'm the board 's delegate to the portals trust so we 've got some idea of what 's happening behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does it trust own land yeah they 're skipping over the page which will assume that you will have read this and the school 's speeds and that 's what I 've discussed briefly about that that concerned that the school 's head and now you 're going to talk about also here 's another picture that is similar to work um thats Sarah show before despair wealth and fear because because it moved out of spray tan Heath get into the new limud central whatever they called now and so it was a bit sad for us to hear need buttocks I guess it 's exciting for them at the same time so we I did a speech on behalf of Carol and just to do a bit of a hand over because Waltham 's always been a place in the heart of spray tan heathcott board and um yeah so and we 've lost our memorial gates to have our NZ so a shoe there so we 've been swerving around for another area in the last thing which we haven 't got a fight or but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the young people who 'd won um if the achievement awards come back and we haven 't had a huge number of them come and talk to us so imma pavey has been doing a really good job of asking them to come back and tell us about the places have been to and the amazing international gymnasts of meat and all sorts of other things so we were just really really pleased to see what our funding have been oj for them and this year we 're going on ends up day to pseudonym great to signum cemetery where there are two graves next door to each other of soldiers that died one of whom died six or seven days before the anistar someone died six or seven days after the anestis and when you look at the grave the of the young man who died six or seven days before the anestis you look below and you see a plaque in recognition of his other of his brother who also died in World War one so when you look at these two graves you 're not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the families at home that received the news that our members to members of the family had died in the same warm probably in the same battles so the and we know we 're also having a race this year upon the kashmir hills at the ridge mental ceremony on victoria park mitza thanks karen right now there 's also a very good report and informative for all councillors i 'm sure just and i just want to comment briefly about that the great work that 's been done around the the new home bit so they own hey community center that and having come from having been at a children 's library no it 's getting excellent results in terms of community development and i just want to ask you about this the your comments about the loss of a school pool and you recall carolyn that the the teaching stars concern was that all children learn to swim and just prep some suggestions that you might have for us either user board as to how we direct there in public transport might be one but otherwise preps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're quite right the board of trustees raised with great concern not not so much about the positive entering the pool though that for a school like theirs is that is a major concern going to pioneer i mean for lessons but they raised specifically the issue of transporting kids to and swimming pools and it costs to dollar sixty a kid as well on top of entry into the pool and I think this is worthy of some discussion amongst ourselves about how we work there as it happened while we were talking we realized that we could probably get those kids to school from their new location to pioneer believe it or not on public transport on buses just for once the buses may appear to be going the right way but that doesn 't stop the problem for everybody else who hasn 't got school pool anymore who are trying to get their children into school into swimming lessons because of safety it was it it 's an easier right to grow up knowing how to swim and I think this is an issue that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be discussing this with the other agencies that may be involved including the Ministry of you and thank you for raising that um Phil um I just I looked at the map and spreyton is really close to many and the polls there and it 's a great hole so have you talked to the ministry about actually just leaving the pool there and actually being able to turn it into a bit of a community well we haven 't but we thought we have always been told that that school go straight night our who and we can see a real issue there that school was in almost a dangerous location people coming off cool electrode and the most way in other words are coming down hoon a story down lincoln road in hallsville road which is increasingly busy and it 's almost and the parents were increasingly finding themselves it too had to pack to drop their kids off and even to had to get near kids to school we gave her community award three or four years ago to the bloke who got the kids across that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly have done without him getting the kids across the road and so I 'm not sure that the location would be an appropriate one to retain a pool it 's a point and I think we should raise it and you did right Yanni but I can see it going straight to 90 who may be housing and maybe motorway development movie talks in I Tahoe yeah that 's right I think Karen 's rose the single most important point which has as its if we feel it 's too dangerous to have a school there why would you have a pole here when the kids at times we 'll try and get there on their own is you know that curr let 's ride lincoln road and under horse wall etc it was absolutely just that 's getting worse and worse or busier and busier so you have a pull on its own I just don 't sit okay um full community boards that I 'm aware of have now made comment about the slowness of getting speed restriction signs outside schools it seems to me a really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made submission obviously we 're not doing enough of them each year have you made submissions in your boards missions on annual plan regarding this little discussion about the annual clear yesterday we haven 't written it yet but we are in the process of writing it and it will be in there I also write to the other community board cheers at the time of initial discussions about the annual plan in house here I wrote to all the other community board cheers and asked if we wanted to put this on the top of all our priority lists because I do think and it 's an extraordinary issue there is some concern that some schools actually don 't want them but in the main our schools not not only want those things that they also very much want that the comments that were made to us were about the safer treble turning in it yet Jim and we 're and the ones we didn 't know about and that they had had remarkably good discussions with them notwithstanding that as you say Vicki it was still top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information there are only three planned each year and the other obviously that 's got to at least double you know just intuitive if you want to know what yes glad to be on your bandwagon on networking so and so you would like to move at term singing to by Phil I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye as opposed to know this really in what wait wait wait we 've got your,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

we started a trend comes this is all down to me don 't you think this is better you get and we 're quite proud of our new signage we 've got up in our boardroom and people now know who we are and who they 're talking to and I 'll just run through we 've got a couple of significant propo projects underway yes photo is coming on the other wall so now we 've got this in ovens community center rebuild which is now proceeding to fall design and resource consent stage got some pictures coming up I probably can 't work it I normally no I can 't that 's right everyone and again alright so I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community center working party has been done which has been a great way we 've found and to get the community and put into it and the building 's expected to start around August and tandem with that as the reallocation of the Lions transitional facility which is currently on site are we working with and the community group to get that building move to McFarland park and surely we there 's a dire need for some facilities I 'm off directly in our children 's day which was obviously great event some of you went to that we 've also got we had a meeting with our school principals very much as well in one of the big issues which they brought up again for not the first time was issues with psychosocial problems and children at school and we 've got one group in area the neighborhood trust all been doing some great work with Mota ho primary and don 't know where that boy and that they we managed to get them some and here time on the radio and get some stuff out in there in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for more money to do that and we as a board have also been trying to follow up on the community resilience partnership front and how we as a board and our community groups connects is that so that 's something we were waiting for answers on as well or you just saw there are we here garden pride Awards welcome past it now which is it another another great event and those 10 from our motor home community day which was run by neighborhood trust unfortunately the weather was fairly poor but we had our sandy with information on the annual plan and the people that did come along enjoyed it the other thing that came out from our school principals meeting that we had was issues around school zones and school crossings and we as a board are going to be putting our submissions the annual plan that we would like to send increase in funding for the 40 kilometer in our school zones and I 'm sure we won 't be the only board doing that as well and we also had a request from principals to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school crossings work they have been saying that when the lollipop goes down people on the opposite side of the road aren 't stopping so maybe there could be something that we as a council could look at I 'm running a bit of your campaign around that and I think that 's pretty much s-somebody see if it 's some photos of the gardens from a gun and pride Awards the reason that childrens days of mirrors even though its metropolitan the vita now it was actually started in the old city family ward and i think that 's probably why and I think you do our stuff it 's primarily co-ordinated by our start with yet in partnership with other staff around the city and the Kashmir sprayed in Kashmir recreation officer was heavily involved this year as well right and I just like to add a little bit to the picture the other send Albans swim club that are operating at the Shirley Intermediate School and because of course they used to operate at the edge we pull which hit a sad demise it won 't go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 've got a partnership with the spoon 50 50 members at least but they have a very very efficient membership fee if you like and like the kids get to least two swimming lesson days a week if they want to and there 's also a free family day on Friday that they help they hold with the permitting and the kids also a lot of them get a one-on-one if they need it which is a really for no extra cost so it 's that they 're doing brilliantly well and they 're also training lifeguards nu done training coaches and they also use a lot of volunteers so I just want to give them a really big plug they 're doing a fabulous job there in the community and also to Shirley intermediate for sharing their pool because that 's a very generous offer of them and I know that what they get in the higher fee doesn 't cover the cost of using it so I think that there have been very generous to offer that pool to the Swim Club it 's a great partnership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the school yeah but don 't move the chains day back in to your patch though I loved it in the red zone it was a great location and you know and invited people basically back into this amazing public space that was good you know and I people can see the potential when they go there so can 't give it back which one Peter oh yeah and there 's been testing here yet nobody moves around the city doesn 't it because of that time but this mighty media video be designed to be going to you yep all right um it is great to see life back in the red zone especially children 's day it was great so pulling would you like to move this and seeking it by mike and i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know that 's carried thanks

Council,BgV7EUVMGo8,20170412,1292.669,"Christchurch, New Zealand",3434,"and now could we have another page then with central hip-hop community board morningside personally to take it ya sali coastal no ship hires a ship is gone off sick right answer me okay all right okay good yeah it 's great and so I guess good morning mayor and councillors and just to let you know I didn 't choose to flex is only sort of night last night and I knew this was I knew I knew that this was going to spac of a competition because this is all down to Kim 's fantastic fierce report from coastal Gaelic I don 't do it I don 't think I 'll me I knew something like that aside said they may not mix that it 's a lovely I love a photo and it 's a great environment to take and I can under guard and exploitable service center yeah um there 's no tarde recommendations as time and so just run through our significant projects and initiatives and their cortex facility in the Moonwood woolston area the current status as project is that the board meet with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aquatic facility and funding for this project is available in long-term plan and as a community board we all agree that it should not just be a poor but a really fun place for the whole family to go with lots of water fun equipment and associated outdoor area with picnic places and a lot mixed put their places and barbecues and things like that and the expecting stuff to connect with us to us within the next two weeks for an update on this and is we must do one this week [Music] the second one is the lunar regolith is flood mitigation base and landscape which is a really boring name for the moist and urban forest in actual fact you know this is an amazing project it 's a drainage project on steroids I suppose you could call it because they you know staff have really outdone themselves here in terms of you know i 'm thinking of drainage project or falling over tension basin and here we 've got an urban forest and a lot of us land he will not be around to see this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but i think here we 're creating a legacy a legacy for a for christchurch for this eastern side of city and in the next generation it 's a it 's a new record and borgia Walston bush or lynnwood bushes will be known i guess um amazing project remember that slowly the Boston library and community facility and the consultation clothes on Cydia for mites and the first working group meeting was held in a 24th and March we we 've got a report coming to the first of May to approve the design and construction sue to start and the second half of the year having to around there and our significant community issues yeah this one our biggest community issue is the problem we have on some of the parks in the area and one of these parks as a doll ask park on standalone and other possible answers and a lot of antisocial behavior there and the issues are loosely associated with homeless people some of them have addictions spend the day on the reserve drinking and this has caused residents and others visiting the park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earthquake street team provide a place for the homeless has been done during the day and they 're able to spend time with others on a single situation access support from community workers cut mammals do the washing etc in a warm environment so we feel that the situation is not getting any better and we were very keen to work alongside other groups to work on getting a drop-in center and in this area and we 'll be talking more about this with you people are now requesting like a ban be put in place but we feel that and this will just move the problem to another place so we want to do both things maybe or just get the drop-in center for start the world had problems for tafari why matter about this this issue to get them talking about it and we want to go to bring a proposal to the council any plan hearings to get to try and get some money move the cost to get the project started but it will be a joint venture the second significant community issue is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is on really from the first on a wee bit because a bit the board heard from the 400-meter about the ongoing pre-engagement was residents in the Undercity East and Lynwood village a very commanding lead revitalization plan for the area information collected so far shows that those who live in the area have lived there for a long period of time and have noted an ongoing decline in the area and there 's a perception that the area is very unsafe and this is also has to do with the dialogical reserve they 're also concerned about the maintenance issues in the area this this process was begun by the heavy ferry me to me to board in 2016 so we will continue to liaise with safari voy motor on how this process can be supported including through the annual plan process the third issue is the Latimer community housing trust and the trust this trust wants to build six units for low-income earners and barbados street units a primarily meant for single older adults and low-income who lived in the area before the earthquakes most of these men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly demolished now the trust is determined to build in a way that navels tenants to age in place in Philadelphia long term home funding of 290,000 was granted to the trust from capital endowment fund in 2013 but there 's been extensive delays and they 've had a wreck austin of the project so now they 're working to try and get further funding for the project but one of the interesting things that they said when they came to see us at the most meetings was when they when they apply for funding and they 're that most people weren 't giving funding they have a criteria that you have to provide for the whole of the city as opposed to one area whereas this trust is particularly concentrating on that and the city east in what 's happened there so they sometimes they don 't meet the criteria of a funder so I 'm just wondering you know I 'm saying it open to our Housing Committee here and seen whether this an opportunity to work with them or whether we need to take it back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first tranche of money from letters of interest and we 've held several community events in march from on the third and fourth of march the board supported the lynnwood college festival of nations and this was a huge success and 34 nations participated in this multicultural festival and it 's going to rival culture galore and then would call it a very keen to make this an annual event on the first in March the board supported and funded the life festival lynnwood youth festival experience and this is this is an amazing one because it 's actually organized by the young people themselves and they get a lot of experience from the organization and can you know go into those other jobs and with that experience it was attended about 5,000 people on the sixth month we had a breakfast meeting with the board area members of parliament and discussion included flood mitigation and cycleways s team update draft in Japan some of the bus stockport of littleton dredging operations and reckless school vehicles park and we 've also held two workshops and some neighborhood meetings on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make submissions and the board will be supporting a lot of the submissions the public have made for example we 've had a lot of submissions about the lynnwood east area and the problems we 've got there it 's also the questions Yacht Club words money to complete the suction of the coastal pathway near where they are and they 've raised the road among themselves to help that process so yeah I think we 're still another one of those meetings night mummy said on the fourteenth of most was community consultation drop-in session for the Walston library as I think the Moon Street a breakfast meeting with school principals 15 school principals attended and they talked about a lot of them talked about the congested parking outside their schools and the need for a positive police presence and their schools and one thing they did talk about which is could be something that council could come back to us in terms of giving us some clarity as they wanted clarity on the list of school speed zone priority works so then you actually how long they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and those type of things so would be quite keen to know that for the sake of our schools in the area and then 18th so much community born and council staff used wealth and fear as an opportunity to raise awareness of the interplan process and its importance 25th in March Walston garner was also used as an opportunity to raise their importance of annual plan and on the 31st to march we hold our garden fried awards recognizing the efforts of those who contribute to the enhancing the overall image of crisis of the garner city and like all other parts of the city we have people there we 've been winning these awards since this whole these garden Awards started about 19 years ago I think we had someone there who 's 17 10 awards so there we all are at the back of the Mount Pleasant Community Center after the awards having afternoon tea really great event that one was anyone I just want to say thank you very much and next month Jake will be here instead of me because I 'm going on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we got a video okay well done so thank you very much for your reports sellers in a quick video can we did it fished oh yeah sure sorry yeah we are we 're really up mark down um I think I 've got sound remember oh I see so you know that 's me jumping up this this is a company this is a combination or would you do you a nice one without the place thank you being that hey right we 're gonna get you sound enabled the next time they look great any questions yeah Phil and then Glenn thanks Ellie and I think your whole report shows just how much is being done within the different ward areas of our city it 's great there 's a couple of years I particularly want to ask you about in terms of how we coordinate these and one is I guess starting with the issue of the alcohol related issues at doris the spark that yeah Kenny that we have these issues in other parts of the city too so it 's really I guess just to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all coordinated as you were asking for to the social and community development committee as a way of making sure that we are you know we have the best coordination from the council resources and and the other part to an actual game will ask about the stew was the Latimer Community Housing Trust there are also a group perhaps who clearly because of the delays it might be really good if they come to talk with the housing task force and the social and community development committee too so it 's just a way to I guess coordinate all the excellent work that you 're bored of doing it 's an excellent suggestion that we you know steer them in that direction because um I think you know they 've got a project and they trying to do this and it 's an interesting way in which they 're trying to get funding given that they 've got a certain amount but in power the criteria stopping them of funders and stopping them to get the extra money so um I will take that back to staff to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task force in and thank you for that thing cuz I realized who you get there are problems and Eddington as well when thank you is just following on from Phil obviously is an identified issue or series of issues sitting beneath one and you know that proposed solution with their house trust so you 'd obviously be happy if we work together with not only the you and Jake bring to everyone on the board the whole board is a whole is behind this project has that of course in the mezz welfare subgroup on Houmas no no I mean the subgroup no no no not not not me as welfare fun but the emergency housing subgroup which is just at its first meeting with all the agencies and need to be coordinated and I think mr. is going to help organize that coordination just your new it big job down here and we 've got a year to the LTP so if we are going to do something over a built-in domaine de facilities can do you think we need to signal anything yeah I 'm all adjusting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the council on community board on a joined up approach to addressing the issues raised in the report regarding Doris the spark and the need for dropping facilities because they opened it I mean the homelessness one and the task force has got to be involved in this yep so and maybe it 's better to can you just note the interests of the housing task force because it often it 's it you know yannis just sent around the report that he sent us before and you 'll keep sending it to us until we actually take notice of it and it 's his right he 's absolutely right the housing first approach group it 's proven overseas as it 's been proven in New Zealand 's through Hamilton and it needs to be seriously looked at here that you can 't get underneath all of the underlying issues until somebody 's gotta secure roof over the head and you know will seattle 's our sister city and we 'll have an opportunity to talk to them this year I 'm hoping so that will be an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the council at last yani we will get somewhere thank you for just one point I wanted to make two though there is actually quite urgent is that housing New Zealand are building huge amounts of intensive housing social housing in some of these areas and I 'm not saying that there 's a link between it but actually when you think about what 's happening with social housing the intensification of social housing without the wraparound support services for people with needs can be quite damaging to local communities so I do think it 's important that we involve if we can housing in zeeland in this because actually um there is concern being raised quite me as and others local to like the local councils i think around just a huge intensity of smaller houses and in certain areas and the lack of support around what can be very complex issues for for some of the tenants so i just i do think we need to get yeah we do need to get housing is and agreed to join up process and the other thing i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that the housing first actually saves the city money whether it 's health police justice or welfare yea orsa day it saves money so it 's actually a good economic thing to do as much as a social yeah but it requires an of an upfront investment which and the savings are not found in terms of council funding the savings are found and the police budget and the health budget you know which is why we 've got a good thing if the government would just delegate earth all of that and then we could get the benefits from the investment that we would make in those areas let me know we bring those people together for the solution ya know we will and most wanted yes that 's a very good outcome so thank you very much I and to put stuff on the housing but I see you had some deputations on the glenwood lower fields flood mitigation basically landscape plane plane aka the urban forest yeah I 'm did you get answers to those questions about the city and lighting in the stagnancy concerns yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answers were there but we did ask the staff to engage regularly with residents during the project and provide reports back to the board and monitoring the program around antisocial behavior dogs stagnation and all the issues that they had raised at the time right so you 're comfortable with it yeah that 's good thank you thank you awesome right would you like to move it do want to move it there was one point on that oh that um you 'll be aware that we did go gly so fate free as a council and this it was special circumstance and one issue on the law of fields is that unbeknownst to the board it was sprayed with glass of fate before the residents could be informed and so there was a lot of concern from the residence after the board meeting that that had happened and it did raise I guess an interesting wider question which i have sent through which is it would be good to get an update on how we approaching that glass of fate free policy and how many exemptions have been granted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of community understanding and also our understanding as liquid members that we must be good to get that clarified but minus thing is the people from that project you know I really came to get on and do the work and obviously with the flooding that we 're experiencing I think everyone can understand why there is a religion need to get look there is a classic community board issue and and and you know I mean I 'm hearing you say that you 've seen through a request for information can I just encourage the community boards to lead those requests for information because then you can report it back in your reports I just think it would be a much more much more open and effective way of doing things is that when these issues are raised in your local community areas that that that you put on the information request through your governance structure and then that report and can come back through the community board and end up in these reports which makes it a very public process I 'm really happy with these reports so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so move by yanni second it by Dion I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried that 's lovely thank you very much silly","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

goons I 'll Garrett the author of the report anyway so he 's right there so there you go and right here all right so um Pauline question oh and you see that these when the sovereign Paul was demolished it was a promise to build a new one mm-hmm do you know was that a formal resolution no it was probably watch staff she felt at the time of course we had the big earthquake in 2010 so it 's probably been on hold at that point i don 't i just i don 't recall because that was the age where Paul days as well anywhere no promises to build new falls I 'm not a poster no no no you 're wrong it just something to be careful nope no gate and it 's like that no it definitely was i think it went into the plan back be i think i think it was a bit different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we need to press what I don 't we why don 't we just acknowledge that there was an expectation in the community that the Paul will be replaced hmm so that and I think that 's a fair assessment of of what we can agree was definitely the case there was definitely an expectation that they would be appalled and to replace it I think this discussion document is very good I 'm very impressed with that it goes through all of the pros and cons of each of the sites and they all have challenges and they all have advantages it 's just it 's it 's excellent I 'm really really impressed thank you so so I 'd like to move that we endorse the commencement of consultation on this oh no no no no that 's not fair Jimmy chin they can do by Becky back i 'll put that motion in the husband anyway because of it i just want to share with all the main counselors hids the kind of facility is one of counsel key in her pocket give me back to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know just the 30 40 foot but anywhere today i 'm very happy you know this one we are put to the kind of a public consultation and also we in we in toast this one actually is amendment from the community pool meeting on the thirty-first or much there is a kind of recited difference from the original stock they have a kind of 15 the small area have wording a mandamus osito but are not impacted the original staff the information this just want to the reminder the mail in a consonant in otherwise this public consultation where we will be crucial because whether we 're screening from 11 possible options to show these the three of them so encourage the community and also individually during the consultation time period from the 26 april theater nice jun there 's crucial time period make the submission some is always amazing to us the overall picture then make the proper decision that 's important but the star were integral all those the free vector will rather the reasonable report report back to the council again so this is the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remind me encantas thank you okay thank you I dokie I want to join in the fact that this is finally happening this has been a very long time coming as you know because we 've debated at every budget time and it 's slightly ahead I understand is the limit booster one which we look forward to doing very soon but I think what it does is that for a community that community we know needs those sort of facilities where they feel like they are valued where they have fun where they can actually have a swim a book 3d printing whatever that 's fantastic and what we 've tried to do in the options is look at the pros and cons of each site the pros and cons of co-locating which saves two and a half million dollars and if you in capital and an ongoing operational costs as well and put all of the issues that we know about each site out for the community to tell us where they want this to happen in the southwest so finally this is going out that people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'm sure that the feedback from them will be very major because they 've been waiting for us to come out for at least three and a bit years that I 'm aware of and probably substantially longer some delighted that this is on the agenda yani yet the draft acorda strategy in 2005 actually clearly identified that the west-southwest was a priority for a swim pool so when they closed softburn that was actually very much when they consulted on the closure of soccer in that was very much commitment that I think was made and interesting enough at the time they West or Southwest is quoted as saying one site with superior meeting the key attributes and it 's described in the table below and that is basically the golden reserve near that will be library and community center so you know I know things have changed since then but actually the work done back then actually identified a site in the Humvee area and near the main hornbeam always been one of the ones that made a lot of sense so appreciate we 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this consultation but I do want to say that you know I think this is part of honoring that commitment as we made was Walston as well that we would replace those facilities when they were closed the same commitment was not made around each where and people will note that actually grown condom was built in pepper nuit and that was August seen as catering for that demand so I 'm really supportive of us going up for consultation on this I think to me there 's still a question around the benefit of colocation of libraries and swing pools and maybe hopefully the community can have a chance to give feedback on whether they want that or not again I 'm open-minded on it but I think it is an interesting conversation to have with people so I really look forward to this happening I think I concur with the comments that are made by the local councillors for the air and I think it 's great that we 're going out and consulting on on this night thank you you know I guess I 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was revolting and but in terms of the 2006 what about the South Weston 's that whiskey 's was identified there was a need for a replacement but also think I won their series of aquatic center and so I think if you 've got to make statements from a previous aquatics plan you should get it right look I have no problem of this going out for consultation I think it 's really important for people actually do feedback and I find it interesting and quite informative to actually show some of the savings but at the same time why do we not actually put in the operating costs of what this quite significant building it actually go into to cost the ratepayers on it ongoing basis we really need to look at what we are doing without aquatics facility these are the big big projects 20 million dollars is a book all and we continually hear that pepper Nui got a fifty-million-dollar one we need to look at this as a city level not just a suburb level and make sure we can actually afford the ongoing impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aquatic facility in New Zealand and we can 't be competing against Air Station I just defect in this consultation I know there 's a for other comments really the community actually need to actually have a look at them potentially say we don 't need a 20 million dollar perhaps a ten-million-dollar Paul would actually meet the requirements in need of that community thank you right I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye opposed say no that 's carried thank you,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

2017,MOX9Y_Kdnws,20170412,1791.36,"Christchurch, New Zealand",4699,"thank you the next item on the agenda is the chief executives monthly report and I 'd like to hand over to Mary Richardson to take a creer unit so i 'll take the reporters route but just highlight a couple of meters i first of all i would like to open the report by noting that Christ your City Council won the excellence and transforming and services award at the sorghum Awards last night and that was for the partnership consenting so congratulations Buster to you and the recipient and the council also won another award with one of our officers winning the British Columbian overseas management exchange so that was to Liam Nolan so just as far as the reports concerned you 'll notice a net forward the key issues around the recovery plan and I know that the counselors have got a particular interest in the portholes fire recovery plan and just assuring you that the plan and if your financials will come back to you in time for consideration around the in your plan and that will be continued to give regular updates to you the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report with costumes will be back on time for the in your plan also noting that in the next few weeks there will be the austere month sorry there is the wide down in transition of a screw-up program back into Council and we will be keeping you briefed of that as well the rest of and the report and the financials just noting that capital expenditures checking well particularly with the scope program ask Ben now largely complete and also noting that operation operational operating sorry expenditure is three million higher than budget and it 's due to the savings targets not being meeting we 've previously signaled that to us Council they saw the financial port will open to questions and we have our CFO here who can answer those and through the rest of the reports from the other years pets if I just take that has weed and open to open up to any questions that you might have with Anjali chain foundation on page 12 regarding to the project the Phoenix that 's a principle very good but I just want to know because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or when I just want to know how to criteria they got into leads large the capital program is based on the budget Stevie 's hall or is based on the kinda or multifunctional multi-purpose the facility it 's my question so a bit of a headless to and Dave to answer that the project Phoenix transition and integrating that across our capital program so that we can get better align procedures we can get not sure whether we 've talked to counsel about pro map which is a system we 've got running that locsin and documents those processes so that we get uniformity of approach across it and then we get better report so it 's going right across our capital program at this point in time in my sub question is whether a Mormon the council the key a major cycle of facility also summer Council you know where the crucial the community the facility like a library service in the community hall also put in this release your senegalese so the community facilities do and with their own asset management program is scheduled and actually that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refining that work and it will be our particularly ready for the consideration during the long term plan so we 're doing comprehensive asset management plans around our community facilities and time for the in your OTP process clean Livingston thank you Mary um I have an interest page 15 on the big agenda but page 8 in your report under civil defense and the planning for the 0 point falls just it 's with regard to what next so obviously that the council 's working together but it 's that next phase and we seeing this with other events around the country Kyoto cetera you know probably not convinced that insurance license for instance have been learned so is there is there any work being undertaken on the next on what might be considered the next phase after that that response yep so there 's work that 's happening both at a national regional level and then also within Council so the seed in goodnight also know the visit resilience officer Jefferson it 's also doing some work on that and then tint will be to bring a briefing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how those mitigations on what we 're planning and making sure also that the sufficient information up on the websites and communicated out to communities particular building around some of those community resilience plans okay can I ask is that an identifiable next phase or you know the insurance phase or is that part of the the urgent response so I 'm on exactly what 's in there them come back to you I 'm actually I can answered it so that the 88 is actually about response planning in the response space so that the will come a time around the recovery conversation too and then what that recovery plan might look like for the south island in the loan or Thailand but we haven 't even got there yet because we 're still trying to understand what it means for the whole of the South Island in Wellington around a response plan and I 'm heating up to Wellington and a fortnight 's time to hear how Wellington going to have this conversation and then once we get this response plan to injure Daniel bigger next phase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 'll be a big piece of work I just think we need some sort of insurance template pips it 's pie-in-the-sky thinking but you know yeah we I think that what Glenn 's raising is as justifiable concern about some of the lessons learned out of our experience of the earthquakes and some of some of the you know some of the elements of it that won 't crystallize for some time so there 's as we 're as property sales for example and you know that the sort of that the lack of any really real thinking from a central government point of view around how you would monitor that market in terms of the potential future ownership issues that will arise so I mean people say oh why don 't you just put it on the lump how do you know we only put stuff on the limb when we know it so where is the requirement for people to notify the transfer of an ass as whereas properly recovery thing going to look like and what they roll will be taken around managing insurance issues and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one friend more than positive government programs program with and also that we really came to see that income what makes yeah cool yep I 'm deal um just on just on that point I do know that Sarah was doing a lot of work with them with the insurance companies to actually map the users whereas sales tools people that were cashed out but just only just on the report can we get some information on the general maintenance as well because I was just reading through the report last night nerves I couldn 't find any information just because of the issues that we 've been having wrenchingly maintenance to the city could we get it may be a monthly update on that as well just on where things are at from the contractors and things thank you yep yani thank you i see that the road maintenance contracts are going out for tendra as well are they going via a committee or threw passes at a governance level um previously my understand as we had thing we have had reports around things like the parks contracts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case that 's an update it 's going to be a briefing on the Lakers contracts when they 're ready to go out as they are Peter Peter breathing really what the council 's just around that it was a freak after giving through the fire to the former 's committee but in terms of like previously one of the questions that we 've considered as whether we go out for tinder on certain contracts is that a question that we 're going to be as part of that report is going to be able to be determined by us or is that already determined the Chateauguay opportunity because ta criteria so we have to leave the area to save the question was around the final decision does the final decision where I whist with officers or with counsel can you circulate to counsel as the provision of the NZTA requirements for us to go at tinder yeah I mean that 's a bit was the question that Jonnie was asking for no I want the NZTA requirements because you just said that we have to go out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be accurate rules procurement so i 'll see if I 'm extract the Easter well is it a new legislation because it used to be in the alleged station thank you okay that 's it that 's what we want is just that resolution very useful and my understanding tour is that the team during now for in GTA has changed and we actually a part of a WTO agreement where we have to go internationally and there 's a whole bunch of issues around possibly around that you 'll note that some of the the contracts up north I think are looking at overseas countries coming in so it would be really good just to get a bit of a snapshot around what what the current entity a process is around procurement and what that means for us in terms of decision-making thanks Aaron you just had a question around the first bullet point of the capital projects watch list the top 10 and it 's the Metro sports facility and I see the developed design phase as we were is concluded um is there potentially any changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this isn 't due for completion until 2020 that there may be the option for a parking building to be started and completed well before noon on that site that can be used to alleviate the issues and the area around squishy the hospital I 'm I 'm not you can you answer it is Benton they will surely be executed for mutual sports and includes the version of a train so flat and 550 carfax whether through the 95 car parks i think it is on a temporary basis in all of the information recording the model ad indicates it 's sufficient provision of car parks to make the demand for the mixture of sports and the question of whether these opportunities to use some of the metro sports car parking at eight times for mutual sports for other users is something that will consider alberta net and about three 650 car parks and at this point of time though there 's no pains for a multi-storey car park building on which transports site and predominant use for their city actually right so the purpose but raising it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both not just the cdhb but to get their car park but because of cutbacks it really quick to build special yet grade that that would be open well before the rest of the facility given that there 's so many other car parts loss in the area and oxford terrace is about to go same with Jones I thought that I thought that the comment was made yesterday there Oh taco but they said publicly that they 've put some projects on hold I wasn 't there no and so we can was as the any further advice wouldn 't give today about that breed others there 's my understanding is that the development agreement phases the capital bailed out and it will be negotiation if we wanted to move but Mine Christians were around that we are a partner in this facility and it would be good if we could ever say in its potential but we don 't we don 't own the land and the building the facility is being built by otakar oh there is a separate process going on in terms of consideration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don 't own any land in that area but that 's a process that I 'm that involves the private sector the health precinct the DHB the council o-tar crow and dcl so there is a strong desire to get resolution in their area but there was a private sector car park building in their area before the earthquakes as well so there are a number of things that need to be taken into account but that it 's easy to go to a solution but not when we don 't own the site so but i 'd simply at that my chakra are working very closely with the city actually about whether there is any possibility of neutralizing any of the mutual sports construction site in the car ha yeah on a temporary basis and while the constructions going on but it is complicated and maybe not at the stage yet of knowing their construction staging to know whether or not they can kind of reasonably release any of the land and the mutual escorts going to be built on for a temporary basis but they are working with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a range of other options across the city in we should be aware the cattles removed itself from the and klingon gulberg barracks flatly indeedly you know the city HP scared of them weird bus of awkward leaned and the city actually about a lean across the city that we also we 're looking park and watch us on a teaspoon yeah terms because is another key here the relationship with cdh be an attacker oh is that you know we will not be supported but as sec DHBs responsibility with attack oh so i think the east we can be supportive but which i think those two other key players or the city HP is the key part play and we can just be supported yeah but this is the chief executives report highlights the capital projects watched us and we are watching us in terms of the budget and the timing of the payment of that but we are not constructing the building and we don 't own the land and I think sometimes people go to a solution I mean there is not walking distance at night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to be a shuttle site I think they 're looking for a car park solution much closer to the hospital itself yes I had Tim there was somebody over here as well as it fell and then yani was it n visit you know mother miners and Christians morikami around cycleways which is on page 4 of the report it 's really starting to adjust given the challenges that have that we as a council of head I think these achievements are really quite remarkable and I want to thank staff for the perseverance and it means some of the consultations lead to some pretty robust discussions but I think the key thing about there is that the the council are open to making changes and would continue to be around around the planning but I think it 's particularly that the staff I want to thank for all excellent work they 've done and these are really as I say I think terrific achievements pepperoni parallel little rubber unicycle and the first stage of rap and Rishi Rapa Nui that section that they 're well on well on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yonni yeah I 'm thank you just in relation to the Metro sports so my understanding was that the car parking was going to be subject to a joint business case between the crown and counselling parking strategies for the wider area and that 's how the ownership of the lamb was going to be determined so what I 'm interested in is whether or not that work is going to keep a complete before we sign off on the development agreement because in the report when we signed up to the Metro sports it was really clear that our assessment as counsel of the number of car parks provided was insufficient and I 'm interested to also understand given that we also heard that the assessment has shown apparently that it 's now okay in the quantum of car parking hasn 't changed so that 's quite different advice to what we had previously so do you want for medication that 's going out to councillors so the cost rate agreement 2013 provides for the project ownership on completion to be councils it 's councils expectation that project ownership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the actors the timber cancer was off to delegate to the chief executive authority to negotiate and execute a development agreement what 's the Korean covering amongst other things what will be transferred to cancel ownership upon completion if there are any matters and the development agreement that are materially different from decision on the metro sports facility to date there now referred back to Council for consideration the draft development agreement that is very close to completion we saw and by the chief executive includes the provision of the facility the car parking in the lamed underneath the facility to be transferred to council ownership upon practical completion which is before the development agreement and fits well within the delegation that council have made to the chief executive if there was anything materially different and the development agreement such is that the council did knowing the facility or did knowing the land although no car parks unified that then we obviously come back to council with confident though the development agreement sees the upon practical completion the fall transfer of the lane facility in car parking to Catholics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the report that when council signed off on the on the design the preliminary design it was studied very clearly that would be a development agreement the report assumes that a development agreement dead hung our calcium crowns or a chuckle work together that 's point one point to the quantum of parking on the metra site and all the quantum of parking available to customers of the facilities will be finalized by a separate joint business case between council and the crown including parking strategies for the wider area and all through the report it talks about their concern at the insufficient car parking of the 550 and that will have a separate process to work out the level of car parking including the future of the car parking lead ownership so what my question is is there a joint business case being prepared and if so when is it going to be ready and will it be ready and time to inform the development agreement so my understandings are present yeah yes so so when are we able to see that so so yeah I think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that it wasn 't that wasn 't coming back to council that it was a measure of the as part of the development agreement and that the business case is being developed informed that it wasn 't coming back to council was in the series delegations well that 's not clear for as long it was sufficient mean that was I think the issue was around the sufficiency of the car parts because they owned the key two verses that they have to be available for free the Metro sports users so I 'm and I 'm pretty sure that there 's a there 's this is actually a decision with something about there not being a car park building on on Lanza it 's on grade parking to be available for free for Metro sports users now Metro sports won 't be open 24-7 but it will be open seven and for the additional hours are those parks available for additional use and that 's what we 're looking at other water past available and will do diffusers after hours yes and they will su teacher and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for use with the recharge for other users not using the pro sports facility what we had and we want to ensure that we are sufficient a fax and Jason to the Metro sports facility for Metro sports facility users and not for parking that shoppers or commuters yeah there are opportunities with the peak time we 'll reach our sports facility users in fifth time with other users to potentially en guides so can we get a copy of the business case that 's being prepared around the car parking and also can we just I don 't know that it 's clearly lies well I don 't know that as the business case completed it and also can we just be advised around with a the assessment of 550 car parks as still as still considered and sufficient or if it 's considered sufficient how have we come to that consideration so so the operator jobs back of the room Z and was satisfied that there are sufficient car packs for our for the Metro sports but do you want to speak to this message on the business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an area of land on the site that will accommodate a further 80 car parks should they be needed the and the council has the right to use that land and those car parks if they 're needed in our opinion this is considered sufficient they are ideal total when we did the calculations was about 620 so were both sides are aligned we believe it 's sufficient very good thank you Erin yeah just I 'm like to make a couple of points and was refreshing to hear miss cheer that you said the car parking at the Metro sports facility would be free because it 's the first time I hear that and there original reason why didn 't vote for it to leave the qe2 site because we couldn 't be told whether it would be free and its condition sorry so we 're going to have to update some new members you know and maybe that 's our learning from this yeah I 've asked that question several times so it was good to hear it from you today some but we all know you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a number years and didn 't know and had asked the question and hadn 't been told but you 've been asking why you 've been a counselor and you haven 't you started yeah I don 't know how you 're asking that and then the other point says health boards aren 't funded to provide parking they get no money for that from the government and as many people will be aware that cdhb is already underfunded anyway on the funding model so that isn 't in their mandate to provide parking and it 's not part of their rod but we need to joined up approach between all parties and I think the council has a responsibility especially given that we will in here the Metro sports facility site to look can that be part of the solution for what basically the entire city degrees is a major problem that the most that the city the building that should be the most accessible and Christchurch is probably the least accessible right now and I think that is a major issue so if part if we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be and I know I can 't use the number because it 's a px report but I 've seen the number of car parks needed in the area and the 550 certainly would not be adding any help to that area so you said oh that we can give you assurance as that there is working i think builded that laid some of it work on trying to find a party solution and net area so we can be social part of it if it could be it will be part of it but can be it is so so we can come back at some later date with some later public record that the cdhb best mated there are quite proximately 1,400 long stay car packs and around the ear again it 's been a matter of public record for some years and the Metro sports car parking is predominantly for the mutual sports we have collaborated in shared information with the cdhb on what we think the opportunities for sharing some of that car parking is but ultimately it 's up to the CHP to undertake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the chief executives previous advice that we 've shared some of our parking expertise with the cdhb following the meeting between the chief executives last Friday so we are working very closely with theme but there are challenges that we appreciate for the hospital given the construction going on in and around leader but equally the Metro sports and won 't be available until 2020 song we 've still got a number of years to get through before we use the Metro sports is a solution to the CHP car parking issue around hospitals I 'm just also very mindful of the fact that in terms of the work that 's been done by DC 0 and others on the on the parking issue they will be commercially sensitive information contained within that document so it may well be that we need to receive it in a public excluded and Saruman is in order to protect those their commercial elements of it because i know that this private sector some involvement and car park buildings that are much closer to the hospital then the Metro sports facility so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think we should say about the matter now but I think we need to arrange a public excluded formal reporting on the business case if that 's appropriate I 'd rather not have it circulated in an environment where it could be and efficiently passed on and create problems that don 't need to be created great all right so I would like to move that the chief executives monthly report be received Jimmy chin would like to second that I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know that 's carried um","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Bodies,Ll1cYhc5F0w,20170412,502.099,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1267,us that we deal with the elected member appointments report to allow for agendas to be published and I understand that that is because the canopy Regional Landfill joint committee has its meeting next week I think of something that it 's very close so they have to publish the agendas so at the point that we got to last week on this we had counselors gotta Davidson and Livingston moved and seconded who were they moved and seconded by Andrew and N and so that 's been moved and seconded so i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you years that some of the new counselors have not had a background briefing on the nature of the organizations but that 's that 's fine so that 's abstention for Aaron killer yeah sorry and and then we had a second recommendation that had was carried over from last week as well can you move through quick can you move the screen they 're trying to see the recommendation yeah so and the second recommendation well I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separate measure and we did go through these one by one last time so I 'd like to move that we appoint counsel east as its representative to the stadium trust and seconded by Andrew Turner so i 'll put that motion it was on last week 's agenda it was it was at hair carried over from last week 's paper so it is on largely no gender it was um it said note that the elected member appointments to external bodies report including the stadium trust was carried over from the previous council meeting so it 's the only agenda of the previous council meeting well how can we make a decision on something that 's on the previous agenda of the last council meeting because we held it over to this meeting and it was an oversight that the recommendation didn 't appear on on the page okay and the second question is this consistent with our appointments policy well not with the appointments policy of the stadium trust because the last appointment was made without any reference to counsel at all we appointed us the council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mayor of Christchurch and that staff member was replaced by another staff member when he left and we are now asking that our council law goes on to the stadium truck I 'd like to understand why why council appoints someone to the trust and what like the prices is run gross being able to get counselors to counsel to a point to trust we 've had no report on as far as I 'm aware are pointing to the stadium trust that 's true because previous appoint could not come to counsel and I have suggested that this one come to counsel and that council action makes it so in the past the appointments have been made via a letter from the trust of the Cee and a letter back from the sea to the trust I think of this instance because it has always been traditionally been a staff person its appointed because the suggestion this time was that a council be appointed I think the mayor to tend that it would be better to consult here councillors about so is but in terms of an organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our trust it 's on the trans Dara in the trustee was established look this is all before my time the tribe when the trust deed was established it had a provision in it for two appointments from the council and there has been a view that you can 't have a staff member and a counselor but what we have been advised since is that is not how they interpret the date the date just means that you can 't have two counselors so a jamba cell will stay on as the council staff member of the representing the chief executive on the trust and and we are moving so I 'll in seconding that we are that David East take the other position so I just think it would be good for us that you get a report about what the stadium trust is we 've had nothing as counselors and yet we 're pointing to an organization we don 't have any outline of the process or the skills required for the trust or and I think that 's a shame because actually we want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs out of the trust and we have no information about that and creeped em casa do so the the trust we have a meeting but Bertha trust and but that it 's obviously following this but I think it would be a really good idea for the trust to come meet with counselors and have a really good discussion and in an outline what they do John was board the chief executives made a request that the trust attained Amity a meeting of a the new strategy and Finance Committee to explain their content strategy and Finance Committee so is it strategic capability or finance and performance strategic capability thinking pardon me the young are to do exactly what Tim has counselor standard has suggested to explain it its rationale its direction and answer any questions the committee may have so the chief executives already requested that so I 'm a bit puffed her yeah it might have to be financed and performance that might actually be the better commercially for it to ya a beer in front of ya exerted okay looking into the future what will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of their own formals a meeting with them rather than going to a committee which doesn 't take all councillors or there may be Christian I don 't know minutes justice yeah I think both I mean that there is actually it is probably a lot of public interest and and the work of the trustees and so giving them an opportunity to appear enter committees you know probably quite helpful both ways but I agree you know in terms of an informal meeting that might be a good opportunity to to also little counselors have that direct input forget all right yep yani yeah um I don 't support making this appointment today I actually think that several reasons one we haven 't had an open nomination process to we haven 't actually had a report on the agenda and I appreciate you say its hold over from last meeting but if it was held over it should be on formally have a report on the agenda the issue was raised around the whole conflict of interest issue with the relationship between V base Council in the trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice but I would feel much more comfortable having a proper report over what the stadium trust does what the relationships are and what the skills are required before we make an appointment so I won 't be supporting that appointment today thank you i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know that 's carried yani you 're handsome no,"(-43.5320214,

Bodies,YXs2SemBkws,20170406,1150.69,"Christchurch, New Zealand",2421,hold of the conference there is the conference we 're all together all right okay thank you very much now the next item on the agenda is the elected member appointments to external bodies now I think we 've got agreement on most of them I think there 's a contested vote on [Music] right okay so um notes that appointments will be made to the sister city committees as as I said that 's something that doesn 't get signed off by counsel and I want to number three appoint counsel asked andrew is a trustee of the Christchurch stadium trust there was another expression of interest and if if if council wants to put that to a vote on mom but I can 't stop that from occurring but I just sort of kind of look this way and say it 's not necessary and we 'll just yeah in like at Finance Committee yesterday we had a bit of an unusual situation where the churn the deputy were part of something and in regards the same trust in what we also learned about V base was around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the chair and deputy chair would part of something of the transitional holdings board at the committee so we were discussing the statement of intention yeah so just this whole idea of conflicts in particularly with v base in the stadium trust um like there 's nothing around the individual it 's just around that relationship of having someone who 's on be base also on the stadium trust given the contractual arrangements between the two and that does make me feel a little bit uneasy given that it is quite a significant financial relationship that is true and this has really been more in relation to the to the work that the Christchurch stadium trust will be asked to do and the base is currently part of that family and census almost 19 or organisation at the moment yeah as opposed to an external motivation but it does have a contract with it does the trust well in that case is a better to give that a face omnia on the next to thing I mean would it be a bit as examina- careful on earth but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know how that I don 't agree yeah it 's a going through crises yeah but the point is not to hit just a counselor there is a reason for this I counselor there for some of the expertise and fallen right no no it 's not a question of pulling it to a vote rihanna 's raised a question that nobody 's raised with me before yannis raised it in the context of a perception I mean I don 't doubt that Tim would be perfectly capable if there were issues that were discussed at the stadium trust that were directly related to V base yeah he 's a baby soon there 's a clear conflict night so I mean the reality is it would work but is the issue a perception issue yeah I think I think so but you you accept that you would not be able to enter into any discussions or be privy to the discussions at their trust in relation to the V based contrary the public just in a sec I think the question there is quite a close relationship as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operate the stadium on this should they do well I think I think your comment about it being a perception of bias is quite relevant I think there 's a conflict between the interests of V base and the interests of the trust that could get in the way of good decision-making could you just point Tim as I representative on I don 't know some working group that the trust puts together for the stadium what does you have to be on the trust itself yeah I was it you know get on the trust for the stadium trust it is for going on there as a stallion Trust is a tote a specific task which that report that also the discussion or the thoughts were and it 's tied up to be night that 's whether they have a working patent but they have a separate working party is the answers to the trust ok so that was made more sense but it 's not a point so we we we haven 't greatest council reason to stop around the stadium I mean hey we haven 't actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in the business case with the stadium the new stadium no he purpose arena so yeah that 's it yeah so until that time it 's a bit hard to I personally think too um and it 's no disrespect to Thomas just it only occurred to me yesterday when that was quite a awkward situation around statement of intense you know people having to leave or just and given what we had yesterday around V base and the stadium trust relationship being such a significant relationship yeah i just had considered on it I always thought it was more the understanding at the declaration and that it didn 't necessarily rule you out taking part it 's more their awareness and just declaring that at the front question is do we want someone who doesn 't have to declare a conflict who can achieve a part in that decision-making if it isn 't decision making it that they 're not going on there for the purposes of that they will be making some sodium the area but we do want those interests represented horrible calls yeah we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have issues around these things that 's just really helpful to let me know Delia cuz I mean it 's just a complete oversight I just came out yesterday yah and I rode it was yesterday and was it would have really helped if i 'd known yesterday so even today that 's fine now only two members here only two members have put an interest forward for the creative communities assessment committee and they are counselors Galloway and Templeton so thank you recommendations 10-11 that 's are the three councillors to the Canterbury Regional Landfill joint committee and the Canterbury waste joint committee but is it the Canterbury regional lend for joint committee that appoints counselors to the counselor to the Canterbury waste joint committee or is it three council reps from Christ you city yep sorry I can avail myself of years three members and those three mins it 's question city 's role to determine the chair yep right but do all seven people vote sorry you all 70 devote that was that they can only vote for Christchurch for the chair and the other other councils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and structured up by Dennis I walk when it was yes put together so the Christchurch City component is that the controlling share of the fifty percent share yet overall does that mean them that if one crate if the Christchurch people weren 't united in their view obviously one Christchurch person could have the support of the others we could end up with an outcome that may not be the majority view of the three Christchurch people is that right or do they will get a vote yeah okay all right well we 've got four people interested for three positions so I 'm not sure how do we run a vote when you 've got four names for three positions just put it to the vote those who are each candidate who is standing won 't obviously be able to vote for him or herself but you can vote for the others you just put them to the boat put the names I presume you 've got the 917 yeah I 've got four names so but councillor Davidson cotta eastern livingston and cotter eastern livingston other current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Livingston the same ones Plus accounts the day with them can I just point out that we are in public still yes I know okay can I make this easier by moving something yep so I 'll move Cotter livingstone and Davidson just to keep things moving do I have a seconder for that um yeah um yeah those three nominated shouldn 't find you okay three goes to video yeah David the season appointment committee and looking at prices that each so he experiences I guess the distinct opinion that puts as an opportunity to essentially directors face I would really was what was I have followed a resolution as Parsons Council has had the opportunity to reduce their situations at any stage clinically loser this situation was supposedly being resolved Eden high and and I have absolutely no oh my jeebus need guarantees for the last three years developed very knowledgeable and conversing breakfast it was about a great value to Atlanta Fulton area and I 'll don 't you can either work today I see a real name for Falcon jersey which two exterior appears to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look I 'm not going to have this debated right now and I do apologize to David that wasn 't appropriate and the way that I 've handled this so I 'll just accept that and I do apologize I will come back to this later in the afternoon that this particular item after we 've completed the rest of the agenda I 'd like to get the rest of the reason resolutions resolve but this one can we just we do available via this decision tool tool to later in the afternoon and I want us to have a bonfire is a nice yeah very good to get this clarified whether we 're doing this in PX or in public because other I know we 're gonna with that we 're going to have a vote in public but I would like to take some time given the sensitivities of the session situation just to reflect on what 's been said so I can I just just a process question in terms of art I mean that is quite different to how we 've done it for other council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the committee is it as that basically good the different right all I 'm saying is that I 'm just a little bit concerned about how how I 've got allowed a sitting member of this council to feel and and and i 'm feeling very concerned about that and i would like to take some time to reflect on that and i would like to deal with this issue you later in the afternoon so if we could just leave that measure tool later on and there 's one other counselor Livingston to the know how far we 've got is there any other all of the other names written up all right now we 've got a means the membership of the district plan review subcommittee as net necessary I think that is simply delegating to the district plan review subcommittee the ability to co-opt other members as voting members and the council resolutions required okay okay so what we wanted to do was to let the new counselors have the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to join the district plan review subcommittee which meets not every week but it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's and it 's to update as we go through the final stages of the district plan so Sarah Templeton 's already indicated that she would like to be included on that committee soon hey you would like to go on it as well and you would as well Wow do it that well but what does that make the quorum though because I mean seriously you have to come up to it so all this all right that 's okay the subcommittee 's too so right okay so i will move thats Sarah Templeton mike davidson and down swags join the district plan review subcommittee okay so that 's all in there so we 've gotta have we got them i 'll sort of move them on block and sickened up by andrew and block so join it like there 's a number of people who had a Jewish names are down for the previous one who haven 't been really part of it so can we clarify what the other members to know that the other members are the other members that are on the agenda you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their whether they turn up or not you know that 's that 's down to them it 's their obligation to turn up when they can and what we agreed at the subcommittee meeting that ah that new council members hadn 't been given the opportunity to join it it was the one subcommittee that was carried over from the previous counsel so now we 've done that all right okay yep I was just looking at the the the Mirage of the trusted I 've just wanted to understand what it was because obviously being molded heritage myself yes cleanness the existing representative on now how far and they were keen for that relationship to continue yep but but but the gleam will be talking to you folks that UK someone yeah anyway I just look good for me it 's on us Lord and it 's a it is a it 's kind of been award representative going for sometimes cuz the connection they have requested that he stay and we took it through the time don 't wanna know is closer than alright yeah it is then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the left-hand side oh I know exactly where those boundaries they 're called electoral boundaries as well alright so I 'll,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

you thank you um thank you in elected members appointments to external bodies well let 's just do the local government you see on 2017 conference and awards first because I am I had some advice from Joe and that 's how many people biocon sex right christchurch city councillors entitled to full members around the table at the AG in with no limit on the number of observers who sit at the back of the room and do not have speaking rights there you go just saying so um so I 've already registered so you have to see me in any way I 'm speaking at the conference and I don 't think they 're paying might I don 't think they 're paying for my ear via ya know and other elite de members so a you are you asking to be one of them that question because previously minus ten was that we kind of adopted that with the we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year rather than send the same people every year and that enabled other people to go you know as counselors but yeah but was quite good so we don 't send 10 people at all at once but we actually just you know have a better location but the only other question I had was that um and I appreciate that Melanie coca as the zone five community would representative we 've also got Alexander David 's who is on our community board who 's part that feel they caught the young local government elected members group yeah and I just thought given our commitment to a community boards and be to young people I wondered whether she could be considered for approval or whether you 'd want someone coming from the community board but no I think that 's perfectly acceptable it 's she was at last year 's year and we 've heard a lot of thought her soul I know it was very expensive yeah yeah and this is all come out and it was Dunedin yeah so no I 'm very happy what 's your name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but epic if you 're doing it secret just just copy copy authorized Melanie Copa cocos one that should recover a copy number item three it 's better and create a new power and then change Melanie kota to Alexandra David 's awful it was and then put that as the say but she 's she 's a it 's not part of the community board executive committee so it can take out that whole thing until you get to tour teen so leave to attend lutely deeply bit okay authorized it as a member of the young elected as the young elected group or something I mean do we know the name of it yawns 33 news and we 'll add the appropriate phrase you 're crazy okay oh yeah members group as a member of the unelected members and group to attend the local government his own and that accounts will pay for her conference travel and accommodation costly and I 'm not keen to go so just okay if she 's a little bit all right so we 've got so can I just have an indication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to the conference Sarah bill Mike oh yeah I 'm overthrew very different hey oh well actually given that um who doesn 't well should we do through so we include Dion as well he does not is busted no no it 's cool man while he doesn 't know what is idioms and deon swags add that to add him to the list so we 've got Sarah Sarah Templeton mike davidson Phil Clearwater and Dion swags the point me is the presiding voting delegate your alternate delegate and the other delegates to attend authorized they all put their hands up no let 's go Erin 's email written all over he pulls that one before yeah to really notice all right now do we want to we do want to submit a Remus on renewable electricity procurement don 't we but restrictions on single-use plastic bags given was the one last year but it 's wasn 't it about asking the government is that I didn 't know I 've got no idea what local didn 't easy on us voted on yeah but we have actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the next one be completely renewable electricity so that should already be happening yeah that 's no reason why it shouldn 't be with readers as well yeah I don 't know what the museum investor conferences yeah not much oh um restrictions on single-use plastic bags well they thought I don 't know what they currently done what was the wedding that we had from our resolution today yeah that 's fair we can decipher it is ok we can work on that I mean the thing is is that is the end of there anything else that people want to want to raise and because there is one thing that I want to raise and it may not be that arraignment the way to do it because it 's requires a rule change to LG and Zed but I think it 's appalling that neither Christchurch nor any Canterbury council is represented on the National Council of local government New Zealand only as important you know I just don 't think that you can have a representative organization without christchurch all Canterbury having a voice and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other things that when it 's raised well can I can I put that on the list so see if it 's it may not be that our emits the appropriate way but to ensure representation on LG and z decision-making No 2 on on LG and Zeke National Council to ensure representation on national council for Christchurch I don 't need to speak for can 't agree but I cut port Canterbury also avoid those own fibers represented there are two people from zone 5 the mirror of Nelson and the mayor of Tasman yeah one represents the the rural sector and that you know that the as opposed to the Metro sector and one represents the the zone yeah but you know I take your point it 's just I don 't think in terms of the metros yeah I personally think that Auckland Wellington and Christchurch should automatically be on and beyond and it should be another position that then is available across the other metros yeah hey deneve you weldon edens no longer than main might tell Ronis bigger well I know but you could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah no I don 't know so I 'm just I meanness or you could put put and records bet the Auckland Wellington Christchurch that 's just that yeah yeah yeah well ain 't are you roaming with the second-biggest cottage and the capital of the south island yeah should be automatically on the National Council yeah well we should they should put Auckland and Christchurch should be automatically should be automatically representives should should be automatically included yeah anyway so that 's that 's that 's fine so um yeah what did I just going to ask if we were going to put a bed forward for the algae 's and conference yeah and when does it have to be n by I 'm not sure they call the that 's a towards innovate from yeah but we are submitting our way really to the next year right okay so may decide that recruit happy invited weekend on our proposal yeah and the other one is um around Legion ears so there 's a real issue with Legionnaires in terms of we really good for algae and said to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole way in which Legion is as in the soil is not a session in the water cooling tanks and there 's been I know our staff are doing some work and let 's know I 'm getting see if you 're going we 're going to do something call it but I think it 's an issue that needs to be raised with algae and said because it 's around local powers to monitor and to record where water cooling towers are so just want two diff like that okay we 'll just put it on the list because we 're going to have to come back with the actual wedding the remnants have to be in by the 31st of may so we 're going to have to get staff to do some work on on the wording so you 're happy to work with stone on that one so just put ad Legionnaires Ridge Mall disease in relation to water cooling towers because I mean what you 're saying is is that we should be recording their location has no record of a requirement for them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know this is a little bit to do with a in the sense in which like when we call our government to do things it 's kind of about our own house in order so I 'm thinking of that council in trouble over the cake decorating search thing but we talk about procurement from government but I think many councils actually have their own tender or procurement policies full stop so we 'll retire to the yeah they may have to a well dunno yeah it Raquelle so what is your Jesus thing I don 't we leave it we never had one until just a few years ago so we will have one and doing everything with you is hard to include environmental and social comes don 't know it 's not that one I don 't think that they do yeah and I mean the colcheans it needs to make it mandatory no no there 's ll jeans it can or general can so no I thought councils to adopt their own policy I hey I mean I would not want to go to another council and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know whether every council okay you know i right it 's not really up to us to be well under the criteria for Remus they have to apply across the hall signal so I think you know but we 've got one said why are we moving this well its reputation also know Camille Xizor 's view would be when one council does something like that it really affects the whole sector but but why wouldn 't in the in the best interests of the whole yeah but yeah I mean his Malcolm suggested that we do though okay then what I 'm just struggling to understand why we would want to move that as a what you stick to a reservation without night do you know how many councils don 't have one nor does right find out the answer to that question door or 31st now I 'm not ruling it out but I 'm not writing it on the last year so you know wonder if we should raise the issue of the amount of the number of things that central government put onto local government my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than making central government decisions I don 't think there 's a direct result of a remit maybe I 'll come you came in me a list yeah because or we were one of the few councils for Globes against the resolution so there there is an overwhelming desire for people to take the decision-making away from something that affects their ability to get reelected or did I say that out but there is the other issue in terms of things like Easter trading and others like that where it 's been sighted their local decisions for posting national decisions and I think there 's probably feel few others on the council yeah anyway we 've got I 'm trying to do this say look if people people people feel free to not regardless as an exclusive lust you know it 's not the end of the discussion we 've got and remember we 've got to find another council to support the remote and yes so you need to do it we need to do a bit of homework before we get to counsel in July at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll move that resolution to have a second round yes i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye opposed say no the excuse me sorry just um resolution number two is to appoint the mirror as the presiding voting delegate but also seeks to have you the counselor point the alternate delegate and the other delegates to attend the annual general meeting oh so that um yourself as the presiding delegate and an alternate into ever members to attend all that could just be delegated to you to make that decision oh can we just delegate that to me I 'm sure that 's what the that you resolved yep appoint the mirror is the Posada ng2 worth worth worth full and authority to appoint unfortunate delegate and other delegates to attend the annual general meeting so no he recalled us y 'all wasn 't another yep that 's right because Colleen wasn 't allowed to come on last time because it 's just ridiculous that 's ridiculous but it just means that during the annual general meeting we we can only have three people sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could be an elected member or a council staff member you and that 's usually Carlene sixy with me and two others so two of you get to sit at the table you can beat each other up about it until you get to sit down the back with each other and just see what 's going on but that 's just the annual general meeting that 's not the whole of the conference,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

about 23 people sorry at least three people who are available to investigate and report on alleged breaches of the code of conduct and we 're also following on from Council Templeton suggested in this morning we 're going to add into cruel as 12 of the code if a member believes this code has been breached he will she is encouraged to first resolve the matter by discussion with the member alleged to have committed the breach yeah so can can you just provide that wording to the yep yep so that it can be just including nope okay and a clause 12 providing for a breach to be dealt with between I mean that ought to be raised directly with the member concerned is a first step okay yep give ya and courage okay and encouraging providing no encouraging a member to raise a is that right encouraging a member to raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is hardly a legend in an offender um what 's what was the word again was it the wording and I have given it to Joe she will have it over there if I mean that believes this code has been breached he will she is encouraged to first resolve the matter by discussion with the member alleged to have committed the breach right thank you yeah alright I 'm injury mikoni Dion I think you had your hand up to know okay thank the panel of at least three people where are they to be drawn from what kind of people are they to be well some nominations would be really good it is hard to say but clearly someone who may be his head local government experience in the past who may be good at mediation or facilitation something like that those sort of skills so three independent people so your selected members are not so no not our independent people very dependent yes the thing is is there you know well I mean I I did talk to Colleen about about this and you know we kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of people and I 'm maybe somebody who 's you know retired from Council you know somebody who 's just you know return it well oh yes sorry sorry sorry sorry anyway and we are in a public session here so others oh I keep forgetting when the media tech she immediately sitting there but know that the point the point that I 'm making is that it 's it 's somebody that the panel needs to be made up of people that can actually facilitate resolution that that 's what it 's all about so it 's not somebody you don 't want somebody who 's in a high-paid you know position or something right there it 's it 's it 's somebody you know it 's a group of people who are just able to help people reach a resolution so it 's just nice kind people kind people you 're thinking of peacemaking but yeah justices of the Peace don 't always fit that bill so right so see are you good with it yes yes okay and I had Yanni and then so you thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in regards to dealing with the sensitive information and oftentimes counselors will ask for information from staff and I just wondered what conduct we 've got in that regard there 's reference to information that elected members are given being a requirement to distribute to other elected members of it 's relevant so like I 'd my car parking report for example but I you know is they 're kind of a need for quite some greater protocols around the whole information how we as elected members can request information whether it 's under lagrima with it it 's formally to the chief executive formally and writing because it just seems to me it 's a bit of an unclear situation at the moment and this seems to require a different response in terms of the code of conduct that refers to the exchange of information between members standing orders and lagrima provide for the obligation on elected members to deal with confidential information that they 're given appropriately and not to breach the provisions of either standing orders or legume er so i think we 've probably covered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd it like so what what recourse do we have as elected members of informations being done by the organization or you know council company and we would like to see it it 's not covered by the code of conduct just what and just seed but if an elected members got a copy of that is it their obligation to provide it to all of us it 's really does no no not necessary why is it why is that well that 's this is what often have information that isn 't available to every council member ahead of a reason to put things in the right so just in 7.2 members will disclose to other members and where appropriate the chief executive any information received in their capacity as an elected member that concerns the council 's ability to give effect to its responsibilities if this is information that 's come to them from another source so it is read the whole thing members will disclose whether members and where appropriate the chief executive any information received in their capacity as an elected member that concerns the council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is this is a very narrow a piece of thing members who are offered information on the condition that it remains confidential will inform the provider of the information so that 's outside the organization that is their duty to disclose the information to other members and more decline the offer of that duty is likely to be compromised so are you saying that that section is to be read everyone needs to be readers just one thing or is this external information coming in because it 's not clear and I just think it would be good to get some clarity when I know a number of counters have got outstanding requests for information that we 're having a bit of difficulty getting and it would be good to kind of clarify that I also thought that this code of conduct was between us and staff is it no well if we got it Stevie any complaint against a staff member will be dealt with under the employees code of conduct not this one yeah this is our code of conduct that 's how we behave I think the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do that but I think the intention here is that if you are given information that 's confidential that relates to the workings of the council you do have an obligation to you know pass that on we 're standing orders comes in is that if you 're as a council given confidential information there are rules around how you can deal with that I agree that perhaps this isn 't as clear as it could be odds it 's very month ago and it 's so it 's come from local government years and it 's a surgeon 's if you go to a page 2 of the report which says 371 or page took the attachment the code has been adopted in accordance with clause 15 a schedule 7 of the local government act and applies to all members of the council and community boards the code is designed to deal with the behavior of members towards each other the chief executive enstar the media and the general public and then it says that is also concerned with the disclosure of information that members receive and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ability of the council to give effect to its statutory responsibilities now that 's where I think with it there is the lack of clarity because it doesn 't explain what what it means by giving effect to its statutory responsibilities and it may well be that having a an example included in the in the body of the of the code of conduct would actually be quite helpful and explaining what it 's intended for I mean I would have thought like a starting point would be that we should all be able to be entitled to see the same information unless there was good reason not it 's not a disease and I you know that Anna I you know and as a general principle in terms of information that you know that should be the kind of principle like I didn 't work back from that no but it 's lesson it 's referring to information which impacts on the ability of the council to give a fit to its statutory responsibilities I I think the situation you 're referring to yani is is covered by standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you might get something from a resident that is that may have a real impact on the council but it 's only given to you in your capacity as a counselor I think there was a duty there you would want to share that if it was impacting on the council to that extent so that it 's not the sort of information you would keep to yourself you would need to share it with others but is there not really aware from not very exactly what what what is motion I don 't be so if we can put an example or something in there I 've got an a speaking less our question list the second one was just around the comment to the media um 6.1 and 6.2 so it doesn 't seem to be any restrictions on things like comments not being misleading or being accurate within the bounds of reasonableness on the media content on behalf of council so it does seem a bit sort of a little bit skewed and that there 's a whole bunch of restrictions on personal expression but those same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't also apply to the official position you know for so this doesn 't refer to the official position this is members individually no but I they behave yeah so if you look at 6.1 media contact on behalf of council I mean I don 't think you 'd want you know you 'd want media comments observing other requirements of the code for example comments should not disclose confidential information criticized or compromising and partially of the integra start off but that 's not referred to in 6.1 so it makes it seem as though that 's only relevant to 6.2 but I would have thought that would be a kind of general media kind of principle not just whether you 're speaking on your own or you 're speaking on behalf of counsel so we 're already currently covered by exactly this that may have been the current code of conduct well yeah I think haven 't got it in front of me tha I 'd I think he you need to distinguish between media contact on behalf of the council is that Clause says and media comment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at them and just just because someone 's like a media spokesperson on behalf of council shouldn 't mean that they are excluded the same standards of raise awareness professionalism as the ones ever expecting it and personally get look to be honest I would have thought that if you were tasked with the job of speaking on behalf of the council youíve reflect what it is the council wants you to say I mean one just simply says that I 'm the first point of contact for an official view on any issue unless delegation statement otherwise when I 'm absent request for comment I referred to the deputy mayor the relevant committee chair or community board chairperson and then I or bet whoever that person is can refer it to any relevant committee chair or community board or to the chief executive for comment community board chair as the first point of contact for an official view on any issue for which a debt to community board has delegated authority to act and no other member may comment on behalf of the council so it 's on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but if you take like a community board chairperson if they 're going to go and comment on behalf of the community board and that 's just being asked to comment then they 're going to maybe criticize council staff maybe they put something that 's misleading maybe they just go some confidential information like why would that be right and there 's nothing there that kind of puts those same principles in place as point 46.2 so that was well that 's a breach of bird code that 's a breach of the code that 's a clear breach of the code because at that point they are not then representing the official view of their community boards it 's not clear from 6.1 and it does leave it quite open to it because it is the very first point of contact for an official view on any issue so it 's asking for an official view so if they go outside what the community board has decided if they breach that is definitely a breach of the code and it would come to the chief executive and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a panel member okay now I lost I didn 't write down the names who was next phil was anyone else down here no fool ya fool d on ref Sarah yep for this reference to seriousness of the breach in the principles and then is also reference I think on page 3 85 to a single incident or a number of incidents and a culmination of them so presumably though the phrase at the top of page 385 the recipient and I presume that 's the person receiving the complaint is it yep would use the discretion if the complaint to be made in a timely way so for example just if F for example a complainant had not made in the complaint say for a year because they for various reasons they were too afraid to say the the person decided this would take the type of offense if you like into account and around time yet around the reasons for the delay yep yep and then we other point um I 've mentioned before about a sort of role I 'm a and maybe it 's among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a person who could be proactive around some of these issues in kind of like an ombudsman person so that there 's a way of sort of facilitating some of these issues and if you take I 'm sure to be plenty of work if you like all their boards and and all elected members and a mess and staff as well and just if there 'll be a role there for a person to be proactive to facilitate things just and I spoke I think with the objective of avoiding something more serious like a complaint is that possible and Kellyanne I 'm just like your son what was that sorry on the mini sized net picked up on the third one noting the additional provision under course 12 for member blazes code has been breached he or she is encouraged to face resolve a measure by discussion with member alleged to have committed the breach yep and it 's called and they would do that one to one and what I 'm saying in sometimes of another person might be able to facilitate or some kind of restorative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day below that in fact it would her next stage is that the complaints are discussed initially by the mayor or deputy mayor this is or deputy sure what am i learning I won 't be the subject of the computer what I mean I chief executive let 's in label determine in a way that is fair and includes the affected parties whether or not the complaint warrants being taken further so maybe that they agree at that point that there 's an advisor that they bring on an external person it may be that one of the panel members is brought in and I would see the panel member though really more in the line of a problem solver rather with somebody that can facilitate problem solving rabbit them absolutely no an arbitrator or I agree lunch and Dodger looking at how some of those people might be to be doing it on it before it reaches the point of a complaint that 's all because this process depends on first of all some individual discussion and then secondly so if that doesn 't work you make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put a phrase in there that that asks the chief executive to to to you know facilitate the early resolution you know I know without before it becomes a formal complaint I think that that 's in there already isn 't it weird al cien on 385 all complaints will be discussed initially by the mayor or deputy mayor and the chief executive they will determine in a way that is fair to and includes the affected parties whether or not the complaint warrants being taken further yeah except exceed what what Phil 's trying to say is don 't make it into a complaint at that point he 's saying he 's saying not just whether or not the complaint warrants being taken further in a way that is fear and includes effect that whether there is a way of resolving the matter that doesn 't require it to go any further or whether the complaint warrants being taken further so you know the so that you 've got a mechanism in there to to settle things if if there 's a if there 's another way of doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got two mechanisms we 've got first of all the two members talking to each other well it 's is encouraged to because somebody might not feel you know that they are able to front the person so as it currently stands if that 's if it 's not possible to resolve it at that point it then goes to the mayor or deputy mayor and the chief executive yeah who also see if they can sort it out without it going any further so weird as both the other process come in is it going to be before it gets to the mirror in the deputy mayor and the chief executive or is it all knowing it goes to an investigator well the thing is as it says all complaints will be discussed initially by the mayor or gypsy mere chief executive they will determine in a way that is fair to and includes the effect of parties whether or not the complaint warrants being taken further was it maybe bring the parties together and that environment might resolve the massive might find a way of resolving the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think what fools trying to say is that that the reaching of an informal agreement to resolve the complaint in which case no further action is required maybe there 's a there 's a there 's some wording and there that just just enables that to be facilitated and maybe that an external parties brought in to help that process that 's all I mean I 'm I am thinking that you know this this covers community boards as well as council and there may well be then that you know a strong desire to get external help to resolve some of these things early and the process you know you know you 're not a chair of a community all right so I 'm fond of a look at that English Oh see if I can put it but I think that 's just a that 's one of the tidy up ones that could just be um picked up in there okay Deion sorry can you please clarify what you mean by saying what the council wants us to say when you in relation to the question that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the council yeah otherwise you 're speaking on behalf of yourselves so so there are points when they see that 's but but what I 'm saying is that if we say something that 's contrary where you say that yeah but you said I know if you say this is not the council position this is my position yeah and so what 's it so so the question is what determines what the council wants us to say no use the resolution of the council as the council 's position yeah I 'd say it 's what that is accountable if I 'm asked to give the council 's position I don 't tell people what I think I tell people what the council decided present a spokesperson of you which is actually quite contrary to your own but quite yeah and I do have to do i do if i lose a vote at council i do not stand up and say the council position is my position I say the council position is this and the new you might say to me but you vote against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing nothing changes the council position that 's what the collective is all about the council decision becomes our decision whether you voted against it or not but you don 't have to go out and defend it what this says is don 't go out and attack your colleagues over a decision you don 't lie and the in the relation I sorry in there and that same thing that was talking about our gosh I 've moved moved on but there was nothing about media contact in the locations where elected members were elected it was just spokesperson or sometimes these issues are actually you know localized to an area that a council is being elected to so I mean is it is that going to be inserted into the document yeah I think that one of the issues and I think and if I tried to encapsulate what down saying is that you 'll have counselors you know who are addicted to you know represent the city around the council table but they 'll represent award and then you 'll have another counselor who doesn 't represent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that ward so how does that popped up on the code of conduct I don 't think it is it 's not that I 've found it here so it was saying that then where is the first point of contact for an official view on any issue at least delegations that otherwise where the mirrors absent request will be referred to a deputy mere relevant community chairperson or community board chairperson but I think it should also say or relevant relevant counselor for that ward no it doesn 't it doesn 't say that but that 's what I 'm thinking it should say well that it doesn 't say that because that 's not the point of contra first point of contact for an official view that um if you 're not if you 're not supporting the official view of the council which is the position that the council has taken by majority around this table they must only express a personal view you know it doesn 't matter with you the counselor for the ward or not yeah but some sometimes things may pop up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's actually relevant to that ward and the media are looking we 'll probably be the community board chair if it 's within a delegation right so I mean yeah oh no I think I mean this is the current reading us and out yes yeah so it 's not it 's annoying we changed that and you it 's it 's not new reading this is what we were already under before but we are under today so I don 't know that it 's been well understood r if you know there was my next question so mine exquisite on my list was around social media so what actually is social media run to this I 'll lick strip elite ref finish that one of which one is to be what 's not in there that 's there 's nothing in there about it I do they 're trying and there isn 't should we or the face already have a lady way in jegging is this a try but is this time bound in what do we have to get this passed today know where I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some time to write a social media one with input from counselors and I just say so it 's more than social media because there are people who have access to social media that just happened to be in places where we are making public comments that are not to the media so I think rather than being media it 's about public comments yeah and it 's not it 's not whether we 're specifically speaking to that breeze or the star or our Facebook pages or whatever it 's just the fact that we are making public comments rather than subtly media it 's true but I think it is worth keeping the provisions that you deal with humidity especially the results provide a money tree and how the chain Authority lies and their guard I think that 's worth getting more members commenting on other missile social media thinking it might be private but actually it 's pretty eight a comment that is public comment yeah but it is it is public comment so look camp him I 'd much rather get this right yeah I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does have to include what you say at meetings because there 'll be people at meetings I mean of one of my early experiences of when I became mere was that I gave quite a free and Frank set of comments about my view about certain elements of actually the blueprint it was on this particular occasion to a group of architect students who were reviewing the blueprint was entirely appropriate but I had no idea there was a journalist in the room and you know I lived a very powerful lesson on that day given that I had to send well I felt obliged to send a text to the minister to say they were going to be comments in the priests the following day there might might not make his day that 's the question about whether this applies to all public comment and not just media yes and so do we need a special thing on social media or does or could it be covered by the second-ever but its name no public comm is yeah yeah i think that the public comments but that 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition so yeah I think this is it how many people that have a particular interest might like to feed into n about the sorts of things you 'd like cover but I think we can get that back on the agenda next week and tidy that up Jenny what I wonder with you can I can I just point out we 've had this you 've had this since November okay no that 's that 's fine i 'll do my best to get it back to you next week would you like a wee bit more time well you said that is probably doing a thousand other things as well as printing the agenda tomorrow 's oh no we 're printing agent will we exceeded as a late can we leave it lying on the table it 's let 's do it on the thought of May what money for thermae is that right for people and in the interim we still have a codependent yeah we still have a current code of conduct so you know yeah that this has been a good exercise and hopefully reminding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until we place it okay Jenny even our own people also because we at least talk you Micawber can conduct a chilis carvela counselor common about member and also the sea so whether the from the page with we just spaced about this for the elect member in the sea disappointing that people there you have a party to me do some other week is not a funding name but this was spanking for our elected members and also for the sea is you 'd be particular image reviewer the page you go 374 here the law and the responsibility I 'm not sure you 'll meet down by this as well but the trial to tell you out boosie generators slicing a sign today I mean I just I don 't know because I just had to keep her under control wow you 're not a wiring for contact we need to savor it clear yeah sorry this is about name little only members elected members from anyone here ever chief executive learn responsibility in the law lets you in relationship administration our relationship our behavior to towards our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we start see you spirits obscenity male influence our behavior how we behave not the chief executive so so we have an employee code boss she 's got a code of conduct never G yeah right um Andrew thank you there 's just one thing sprung to mind possibly as a result of Jimmy 's comments actually I 'm just noting staff recommendations three requests each community board to replace their current code of conduct with the new code data at the moment the community boards have got the ability either to adopt the code of conduct or not so they make that decision for themselves are we leaving it to the community boards whether they want to adopt this code of conduct or not I would have thought that a whole point in this was making sure that was consistency across all elected members so that we don 't have any differences between community boards and so the rules for us at the same as the rules for the boards and so on it looks as though that so I 'm basically there 's none intended Quantic consequence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power to impose this on community boards the way sit calls 15 of schedule 7 is weirded we can 't adopt a code of conduct on behalf of community boards as well as ourselves yes we would like this to be consistent across the whole organization and it has been currently with a few tweaks so what we 're saying is that we would request community boards to adopt the same code of conduct as us so that we have consistency can I just check because we 've we add the council and we haven 't changed our boundaries we 're still bound by the previous code of conduct until adopting new one by 75% boat with the new community board areas they 're completely new community boards and are they currently unbound by a code of conduct same rules as before but it 's not Hadley fury made anymore it 's lynwood central Heathcott it 's different ballerina they 've been yeah yeah do they did the code of conduct actually expire with a boundary changes and representation review in which case you 'll have to report there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oh no no but I 've contemplate that but the answer better be yes so in Legally when will disco the conduct take effect for us like in terms of say pre going back civil months wind is a sort of stop and staff it all started at once a doctor yeah and that includes that includes any complaint any behavior that that stuff that is taking account for yeah that 's right yes yeah okay air yeah just under the register of interests I 'm head on our system 381 this item number so not knowing but yep yeah I just wondering if under the registers of interests political should be there give them we 're in a political environment right it 's not legal requirement right the register of interest is the register of the canary and other specified interests and it 's not a specified interest no it wasn 't well is it I don 't know but um it 's just that I 'm happy to disclose that I 'm a life member of the Labour Party but it makes no difference to my role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise my position around this table and the best interests of the city of christchurch not for any other reason yeah and that 's great and I think we 're mostly to help me God probably pretty a weird that you have some some involvement underneath the Labour Party over time think you stood for the egg party once didn 't you sorry you stood for the egg pad yeah sighs a member for one year and I 'm thank you yeah not yet but no the answer is no this is not for that purpose and this discussion is not for their papers either all right okay so take that as a no no this is about pecuniary interest it 's bikini and and other specified on trust so you 're saying to me this thing Vulcan political party couldn 't have a coupon in your weapon no I don 't think so it 's not a specified don 't trust I shouldn 't I think it does so be it doesn 't I mean people yeah yeah I think it 's more just about being up front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not using your position it 's easier it 's actually nobody 's business years oh no I agree no and I mean there are people that ran very blatantly on on a political ticket and there are people that that doesn 't and people change their mind to people change their status for a whole lot of different reasons people leave a party your reasons they join parties for a reason they 're independent for a reason but that doesn 't necessarily change you know people 's philosophical view every single person around this table is here because we care about the future of our city doesn 't matter what their political approaches and that 's why this doesn 't ask that question it 's not a register of interest it 's an interest you know an interest as not all my hobby is photography it 's an interest as and what as a visit visit these are these are the whole structure around electoral donations around around well all of these all of these things what people people get paid by any funding they receive you know if somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go and speak at a conference I need to disclose that you know in their do from time to time so you know I just I think it 's important that people see what 's what what can be seen to be influenced if it were hidden but it 's put into the public arena so people can see people 's political and tres aren 't part of that picture unless they choose to make it but I don 't think it would be very dangerous if you had to disclose that yeah and and why should membership be the determinant of your philosophical view or political view it 's a I think you would have nicest yeah one more question before the council about these the new poll of contact kering the cancer we have to category why is the new counselor five the other one is incumbent counselor but incumbent council that we already have signed in the combined banding by the original core conductor whether this transit appear Wistia binding by those that is how about those the new five yes but they didn 't injure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they don 't need it you don 't need to sign it to be covered by oh thank you yeah I wonder if we good truck on with us as we don 't even actually passing it today is wrong way all right so i will move that the report lie on the table until the meeting of the fourth of may to enable the additions discuss to be incorporating the doctor document to be a,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

response you don 't get one that 's me again yeah okay so returning counselors will be aware that in 2015 council supported the promotion of this development under the crush housing accord this followed is inclusion in the land use recovery plan as an exemple our project as we 've just been talking around so between 2015 and 2016 two processes the district plan reviewing in relation to the land use earning and the parliamentary process in relation to the 1878 Riccarton racecourse resolves act followed their courses and ultimately haven 't got the land to a stage where it can be released for development the final step in that is a requirement in the new rixton race course development enabling act prepare a development scheme which effectively is an agreement between the racecourse trustees and the crown which will really define how the sites developed so they act contains a number of minimum requirements that this development scheme was satisfied and that 's what you 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bound by the Act to consult counts on this he provided that development scheme on the 20th 27th March late last week or over the last week we 've been working with mb staff in terms of looking at draft so this report has been able to be prepared and brought to you and so what 's recommended to you is a response that we 'd like you to obviously look at supplement if you see necessary and then we can issue back to the minister who 's asked for it back tomorrow very good what someone like to move it okay seconded by the gym each in the seminar at the community board and also when we met next month as part of the housing accord Andrew clean and I updated to spit on this as well all right um Danny yeah I mean I 'm just I 'm really concerned and I know you 've acknowledged this in the in the comment but I had started the affordability issue has been addressed at all and so I don 't actually support this proposal I support us saying that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met but I don 't want to give any support to a proposal that basically doesn 't deliver affordable housing and I can 't see yeah I didn 't think there 's an exemplar I then it 's just reinforced that concern and I can 't see the need for this development to occur if it 's not going to provide affordable housing click on an errand I 'm actually eco yannis concerns around that and I don 't groove the number were using on affordable housing he 's debating its debate date well there was a it was a number i saw of trying to keep property prices some under 450 which isn 't overly affordable that 's a small percentage of the population can afford that so i do do granny will kiani we need some serious targets around in every neighborhood that 's developed going forward but there are some affordable properties because we have to pick apart our communities otherwise we get for social outcomes add down yeah I Bible make sure you go to send comments and it was in the performance and Finance Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how difficult it is to get credit and the banks are moving away from wanting to give credit to people so minutes when you have it up to five hundred fifty thousand dollar affordable ass I couldn 't even afford that I mean it 's just it just doesn 't make since and I do think we need to be looking at what bleedin was saying before what is the actual model we 've got does it work do we have the right competition in the marketplace to actually deliver affordable housing because I mean it 's just to cost two thousand dollars or something like that per square meter for a house it just doesn 't make sense it 's so expensive when you go overseas and you can actually buy a house with what we earn quite easily so I just I think there needs to be a lot of work but now I 'm actually want is affordable housing and we do not have you know we are relatively more affordable than the rest of the country at the moment which is good but the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Zealanders and it 's not good it 's not good enough so from that basis I really can 't understand why they say up to five hundred and fifty thousand dollars as affordable clean yeah I click what it does make this definitely difficult is using that affordability measure in association with the lending restrictions so I kind of a big instrument was used over speculators but it 's made it difficult for everyone to get to that position of getting on the ladder so yeah it really is a problem we have our own affordability definition now housing policy there 's a dimension of 550 is that 's which over arenot 450 as well also do 530 or below yep no fear comments Vicky um Andrew and I certainly about you I certainly hear what 's been said by others and i agree around the affordability aspect given that we 've got to where we 've got to with this project and it is seen as a viable development it in my view is not really tenable to to you turn on that now I certainly am pleased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 450 thousand and encouraging that we look at that for 50,000 realizing that these are only comments and obviously that isn 't going to be a requirement but that does I would hope go some way to addressing the issue which has been raised around affordability the reality is we 're in an environment where the cost of construction is increased we 're in an environment where the cost of housing has increased we 're in an environment where the property market continues to increase it looks as though it had leveled off and now we hear that it is increasing slightly again that is the environment in which we 're working and quite a bit of time has passed between the the loop obviously been approved and these exemplar projects been set out and now and we are working in an environment where we 've seen that level of inflation in the meantime 450 if that can be achieved is something that I would welcome I agree that you know something north of half a million dollars is not affordable for the majority of people and we we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ensure that that doesn 't become the Affordable benchmark and encouraging as we are in this document an exemplar bringing affordability at four-fifteen certainly is something that i would encourage and for that reason I 'm supportive of approving this I 'm sorry but the the this is the debate and it doesn 't matter whether you 've got something that you want to correct you can 't that 's the debate you want to change the recommendations I 'm just going to point out that recommendation to up there an error that could actually be struck so what what 's wrong it says transport so it should be here as I that that 's obviously been copied from somewhere else and not been filtered out for some reason it 's a so as it approved the arm Jeff it 's received the information and then delegate to the chief exactly there 's one delete to all together sorry thank you no that 's fine i just have to be careful sometimes people like to enter the debate by accident okay Vicki just so that we 're aware the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a council decision I totally agree with you that it should not be that high but that was a government decision about november october last year that 's been made and so they 're affordable threshold is that because you have to be able to access the kiwi home start grant threshold to get in that doesn 't mean that every house in the development is going to be that expensive and given that there is a is it in the public meeting the penalty yeah the penalty per house is seventeen thousand dollars there isn 't it 's in there is a very real incentive end stick to get these houses on the market very quickly and if they 're coming onto the market now they need to be able to meet the market now so while i disagree completely that the home start grant three short should be five fifty thousand and crow and christchurch that 's what it is and i can 't change that but i think it 's important that this is an area that can actually take housing quite well it doesn 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doesn 't affect any of that they can actually go ahead and do this now without any of these pieces going ahead as long as they just list the land but there is quite a resistance in christchurch to leased land from the history with leases that have been in the city for some time so I think biscuits another interesting community that 's relatively close to all sorts of things created I don 't think all the houses will be at that 553 short and if you look at the developments that my career has done elsewhere they haven 't been and so I think and we 've gone right down this path to suddenly sort of pull our support now would be interesting and probably counterproductive but I think we get wicked guaranteed build houses this is not like a long process and we get them very soon and I think that 's actually one of the things that keeps the price of housing and Christchurch down at affordable levels so I 'm fine with this going here thank you alright i 'll put that motion all those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you could just stick up your hand for know and i 'll get that recorded your hand son killin and slugs anyway that 's","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Update,nwCSNdtTaUw,20170406,474.17,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1255,all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and now we move on to the land use recovery plan update so July me to give a brief overview of that meant you yeah that if it got thank you so as most you know the the local land use recovery plan was possessed by the minister on Simba 2013 and that had about 50 actions in it of watch 25 were directed towards Christchurch City Council it 's a greater Christchurch document so the remainder were for either New Zealand Transport Agency will be can or selling a warning in of those about 11 or 12 I think related to the district plan review neither directed immediate changes to our operative plan or directed that the district plan review which we have you know looking to finish as we speak there are also some other non stitch reactions in there as well and really what this report has sought to do is provide you with an update on where those ret we have had a working party for a couple of years it hasn 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is for all intents and purposes a lot of the work done which was introduced through the work has actually being done or all resets within our work program so certainly that the stuff that relates to the district plan review those those initial changes were done very early on and changes to the residential business commercial chapters have also been completed through them through the district plan review join me cus here because he 's closest to some of the ones that you may have an interest in and those are the runs around the the chr in the community as in redevelopment areas and other such ones so have to take any questions questions Becky national to their work by housing New Zealand on brimmed were and surely which are part of the part and parcel of state housing currently up for expressions of interest and what so what happens with it I 'm just assuming nothing and the two exemple I was being pursued by housing New Zealand I mean they were sort of put on hold waiting to find out what would happen in these I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one potentially in brinda a few years down the road so I think they were keen to not do any development on those sites until they 're clear about how that would fit into the wider perspective was it brings in you know a number of large sites in a significant location so it was what two and a half years ago yeah well before there was any suggestion of possible sale hmm and citroen Laurel surely well there was a small one in Brenda and quite a major 1 i 'm shirley brenda one was only about three houses becoming 13 or something yeah of that scale right it was quite a small one could easily have been done in the O rebuild but that 's not a hitting thing either I think it sort of there 's the master plan for the whole of Shirley which I think you 're referring to but then there was there were two smaller sort of four or five lot developments that would bring together a larger group neither of those being progressed no all right with young wanted to check what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far as that one goes my colleagues dealing with that one but some there is still a commercial partnering process going on with a with a third-party commercial company to bring that forward with in partnership with counsel at the moment I 'm not entirely sure of its current status but i think that the economics of that site and particularly the mix between private housing and effectively the social housing components that they couldn 't quite get the right balance in terms of the economics and that 's a sticking point for 12 12 months or so now has it been any sort of lessons learnt done over the whole exemplar projects I mean just to the best of my knowledge not a single example has been done since there is great of the so looking across the eight the site at spray lodge that one is progressing it 's khalik landing zoning and development has started on there albeit the first 20 lots or so the rixton scheme what you 're going to hear about later is that came off the exemplar wagon somewhere around 2015 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housing New Zealand sites as we 've just discussed that they 've chosen not to progress with those and council 's own example our sites they were tied up to some extent with a special consultative procedure around mixed housing supply on there and subsequently they 've been sort of tied into to some extent the commercial artist cars everything right you know it would be really interesting to have a kind of lessons learned around the fact that we haven 't had a single complete showcase of what future housing exemplar housing could be in this modern sort of environment I mean obviously the residential demonstrator project fell over as well so the whole purpose of having these was to showcase what we could do post earthquake in terms of getting better development outcomes for housing and yet now this housing sort of happening at the end of the recovery process rather than as a leader accept it I think it 's fair to say there were a lot of incentives and encouragement but perhaps not enough obligations rather than sticks okay that would be my assessment of how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run around the the bill beck smartest of the sustainable homes working party I think of us so is that still happening in terms of where it where is that it is it something you can answer yeah absolutely yes okay it is yet is still being delivered conference companies haven 't helped they were part of it they pulled out but it 's doing good school Angela he and I was just wondering because I haven 't heard much better well we have got an eco advisor here at council because she attended one of the events I went to housing event with me and I mentioned here and my and my comments so that she could meet a lot of the developers don 't were at the event um I just wonder whether we should get an update and Tony Moore would be the personal hmm yeah but that she 's got a different yeah yeah Julie bail out yeah that 's probably be our something she 's finished okay so we 'll just we 'll make a note of that because I think that we should get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I don 't know whether it needs to be recorded here but it 's sort of relevant to the land use recovery plan but not call critical shall receive me update would you like to move the report be received signal by me I 'm looking at you yep i 'll put that motion or,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Capacity,-LleiyJ1WHs,20170406,1185.32,"Christchurch, New Zealand",3365,"all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that is carried thank you thank you and the next item on the agenda is the housing and business development capacity actual number 18 Richard does anyone have any questions of Richard for all has this comes through our committee sorry I 'm just behind know so um has anyone got any questions of Richard on this one Yanni I mean I don 't know if it 's appropriate to deal with it here but I do think we need to do some work around I think we 're going to have double the capacity that we actually needed and what that means in terms of housing and lens supply and destruction costs and affordability so do you think is a need to have many questions or a different doesn 't need to have a greater economic kind of understanding about what the risks are to having so much available land these figures are at a pretty broad level I think so the short answer to your question is yes that the real issue here is how much of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the work that we need to do is part of the national policy statement we 're over the next six months is to get a much closer figure around how much of the of the green fluid land can be developed over what period of time I mean the servicing constraints are not so much the issue it is the things that you know the lot of the Greenfield Landers are quite tricky lanter developing us and fragmented ownership so it 's going to be quite slow to develop intensification areas I 've got the same issue with fragmented land as well so these theoretical capacities need to be thought through and more detail and we 've got an obligation under the MP is to do that but give it the original question along the line we should look at you what is the economic impact I mean both positive and negative that we positive impacts because people will we have become the Christchurch and find somewhere to live quite easily the weather there any negative impacts on the on the market as a result well that 's something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the concerns that we 've had has been raised as around you know we 've got all these areas that we 're going to try to encourage investment and to but if we 've got an oversupply of existing properties then actually that investment doesn 't stack up in terms of new builds yeah but the the market change to F peaks and troughs an ending it appears above a supply and the periods of undersupply what we 're trying to do is smooth that out a little bit but it 's a really hard to manage to micromanage that sort of thing really i think council you 're handsome but i think the point is a value 1 it 's something we need to look at as we go through the assessments that we have to do under the MPS great thanks yep clean thank you in a note there are a number of papers over you know the affordability advanced by question today but my question in relation to this is that given that we are 30 per city seven percent over capacity is required and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off and housing prices in Christchurch can you see any or is there any than your view any evidence over a causal link between the increased supply of land in dropping house prices because that 's the theory that 's the prior assumption that if you open up you know supply hmm the prices are fraught now I 'm I 've got the views on it yeah not seeing anything plummeting so if you 've got can you see any kind of causal link evidence I think it 's a contributing factor I think the fact that we 've got a reasonable supply of land has moderated Christchurch 's increase in house and land prices compared two other centers but we 're going to look back around the history of section and land prices around the city going back you know even 20 years we 've always been around the national average irrespective of land supply you know we apart from a few blips we 've had constraint you know we were had periods where sections have been slow to come on the market we have been a slight increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then just straight supply there is an interaction but I mean to go back to original question I think that yeah the fact that we 've got quite a bit of capacity is helping to keep houses at a more affordable level okay thanks I have the key RDR outlined here in the loop what does housing New Zealand have to do and bring to work and surely where those houses are being offered for sale so i think that the Lord questions are part of the next reports okay but we can come back in one of its ok yeah the two are linked down I 'm not sure where it was referenced in one that don 't think it is referenced in his report but I just keep mindful of the residential red zone the land that 's there what the potential reuses of that are going to be how would that impact on what we 're doing here or what those reporters so look we all know what that looks like obvious you 've got an outline which has been improved for you to be because diseases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on what might be coming to the market in terms of development all of that but it 's something we need to build in and I think one of the things with Christ Church is that we have a lot of particular greenfield supply and technically we have a lot of intensification capacity but we don 't necessarily have a lot of Housing Choice so you know it 's it 's one of those things where there 's a lot of greenfield stuff out there but we don 't necessarily have a lot of opportunity for medium density development and let 's not coming to market so if the parts of the red zone we 're to be developed for that purpose that might have a different market offering than what we currently see and there might be attractive and would that affect their the actual the total housing package that 's trying to be achieved with this potentially yeah we don 't know what that looks like the other important thing to bear in mind here is the distribution or development potential is quite skewed so and deliberately so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is down the north up the northeast and southwest corridors it the easter i think the instance there 's very little vacant land and the eastern suburbs relatively speaking as other than Preston 's I mean that 's that put at one side but so this needs to be looked at as a no Geographic seats as well I mean it was just a brew of theoretical capacity and in terms of it comparative location advantages of some areas over others it 's a is this there 's no it 's not a precise science actually and is this going to potentially restrict that what am I trying to say is this potentially going to restrict the attractiveness of say the central city in terms of intensification or intensifying the development here obviously there 's a fair bit of land that needs to be developed and we 've got a goal of heaven 20,000 people living within the central city you know that would make that vibrant and part of the recovery plan is opening up these green fields and doing all this work actually taking away that precedence to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attractive place to invest these green fields have already been opened up these are neither planned from their pc pc one days through the loop as earthquake recovery so they 're there but looking at a UDS perspective i think that 's a pretty important issue that decentralization of both jobs and housing is something needs to be seriously looked at so the existing inner suburbs and central city don 't use that potential to redevelop and to be real you know to attract people back in there that is a major question for a prob least part of the GDS review oh thank you thanks Ivan can I ask you like in the report on in 4.8 there 's reference to the intensification and Phil being broadly thirty thousand households okay that 's on a page 234 of the report thirty thousand households an intensification that 's obviously like another town almost in addition to the current population so what I 'm driving it is are we able and how can we make sure that we have our infrastructure strategy aligned with this kind of potential growth that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier than Phil though is going to be soft and Phil that 's it you know whether it 's retirement villages the community has redevelopment mechanisms as well as the central city inner suburbs and KAC intensification so a lot of that infinitely spread around so they 'll have a marginal effect on on infrastructure it 's not going to have a sudden impact what will have a sudden impact if there was quite a concentration of them fill in a one area at the one at the one time where you start reaching thresholds but a lot of this and Phil will happen quite gradually over most of the city apartment cellular is hopefully here is where we wanted to happen around the K key activity centers and around the central city it will happen more quickly and we need to make sure the infrastructures and place for there so we 'll be able to monitor that and make sure that is brought into the infrastructure story required to an hour under the NPC out if you see MP it 's a regular on top in lovely yeah it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd like to make where they 're 30,000 as that that is romantic theoretical capacity so what the impious requires of asses to work out you know just how theoretical that is and how realistic it is and they 've recently released a tool to and draft to help us will be there yeah Pauline I understand that but so you 're saying the potential capacity from NFL an intensification as broadly 30,000 the current capacity is around 45,000 what I don 't understand that can you well that 's adding green foods in there too I think you can 't reply must be that 's a green field as well so we 've actually got an abundant life we actually aiming for 23 says and the next sentences this is a theoretical capacity he 's on over at some that that 's not a conservative side yeah but probably two different time frames here there were 20 28 figure there the 20 3700 up to 20 28 so the rest of it is likely to be carrion past 20 28 so you 're looking at two different time periods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 45,000 will be used up beyond then I think the counts we need to look at how it 's going to actually may not decide to zone razon anymore and it may be it may be fine but the 2028 it probably needs to take stock and through its monitoring process and see how it 's got to respond if there is still a neat if there are still at large yeah yeah yeah thank you that 's explained it really well in its we 're always like she yeah I 'm coming from there 's no it does no it urgent hurry right now to identify me yeah yeah I think the key thing for us is the intensification how do we get there as we get work and how realistic is that thirty thousand households figure because that it is theoretical and you know he particularly on Christ which we have had a lot of properties with the dwellings have been upgraded post-quake and you know the quite valuable assets so the desire and the marketability of those areas to be redeveloped as is probably a little bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so you wouldn 't go on and bold that and if the house sit in the middle of the site that 's it 's not going to be attractive for a developer to do that potentially so theoretical capacity is one thing realistic capacity is another and that 's what we need to do some work on to fulfill the MPS obligations yeah good so would someone like to move it on it I think this extra buck emotion obvious then you can speak to it fell sick and it gleaned it 's very effective output okay and no i wasn 't i was looking for a bluebird to see it then oh i just want to keep one to say thank you for the report is actually the send all the subsequent ones are actually really interesting and I think it 's the sort of problem that Auckland Wellington Queenstown they would love to see this report like the fact that we 've got these options there 's sufficient industrial land the sufficient greenfield residential land is sufficient brownfields residential land and we may not need all of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unknowns about it is a lovely housing report to get and I think it 's brilliant because it means that what we can look at doing that other cities can 't is one actually housing everybody affordably will be it not to the six star green standard that we would have liked in the district plan that the government said no to and but we can it we can haz we can actually seriously look at housing everybody affordably and Christchurch and we can actually tell people that housing is affordable here I was speaking to a group who were over with the driverless electric vehicle work there from Melbourne they were sort of 29 early 30 years early thirties they were looking at housing here and discovering it for 400,000 as opposed to 1.4 million and Melbourne and saying we want to relocate we 'd really like our office to be here because we could afford to buy houses in Melbourne Auckland Queenstown they can 't and I think that 's a huge advantage for for any city especially for Christchurch it also means that we can look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorts of things that help people get into their own house at a time when probably paying mortgage is just as cheap as paying rent because the house prices are quite static rents have fallen and and interest rates are quite low so we 're open to all sorts of innovative projects we have actually suggested that that be part of what the housing Accord that ongoing housing Accord includes will be interesting to see the response on that but certainly in terms of shared equity there is some capacities and Christchurch to do things that no other city at the moment can look at doing very good Oh Glenn thank you and thank you for this report others report and your responses still curious over our overall housing situation and I take your comments Ivan that as you know that the land supplies probably keeping that that lid on things but I think it 's important we just keep our foot on the accelerator and we take nothing for granted we still have work I think over land banking air we conversation term and also over you know I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the marketplace over construction prices I think there 's another piece of work we need to look at as well we really have to take a 360 look at this the big Theory over supply and demand increased demand overland we 're well exceeding what 's being asked of us it might be keeping a lid on house prices is it actually really driving them down so we 'll come to the Riccarton report a bit later and all have our own thoughts over what is affordability we 've got a policy over there too but yeah let 's just keep pushing it forward looks good compared to Auckland but I still think it 's an ongoing dynamic process we 've really got to try and do it can do to drive the prices for marrying yep sorry yonni um just to back up those comments that have been made that I think this is a really good starting point but you know some of the bigger questions about who how many people own something and how how many people own absolutely nothing and so you know if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what type of development and for whom and who benefits I think you would get a very different picture so you know I think this is a good start but it doesn 't actually address the most fundamental issues around addressing inequity in our city and you know simply just having land available for people to make even you know greater profits at the expense of those who can least afford it you know may not be the thing that we want to support but again having the information underneath us I think would be really interesting around you know the way in which developments occurring and you know to give you another example the way in which social housing is being intensified in the south and east and and you know to the north and the West with a new green fields are there 's very little social housing being built as an area of concern so we 're sitting some quite dramatic social impacts of what happens also begin if you look at things like jobs and the East going to the west and into the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profound impact and some areas you know the older traditional working class so it was of Christchurch so I think it 's a good start I look forward to that additional work being done and I totally agree with Vicki that you know we we are in a really unique situation that we could do the most amazing things in terms of enabling people to actually own something you know only a house or only business much greater than opportunity than just about any other city in New Zealand I would thought because of our situation so looking at those things I think as logically the next step in this process so that we can get really clear around you know the old full well beings that were in the local government not just that you cannot but actually the social the community and the cultural but thank you for the work that you 've done very good i 'll put that motion all those","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

petition to ban single-use plastic bags and this was considered by which committee so I can 't see sorry I don 't say that innovation and sustainable development committee Vicky could you introduce this item and just noting that I 've added an additional recommendation off the back of of the meeting of the zone 5 and 6 last week which is to agree to invite the packaging form to make a presentation to a council meeting I think it would really assist public understanding of what 's going on in the space of packaging in terms of waste minimization to be really good to see what what 's going on in the packaging forum world so can you introduce this item Council and so the innovation sustainability committee meeting at this time a couple of weeks ago and meets again tomorrow with a completely different agenda largely around education and so we were very keen that the council adopt as a first point that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bags I think there is one more that we should add to that and that is that we use our procurement policy to attempt to incorporate reuse into our environmental criteria for which will be part of that procurement policy which is currently undergoing review and the people who have made the petition were very keen that the council looked to do whatever it could aware that we couldn 't ban them and and we wanted to work with the community including supermarkets and big retailers to look at what other possibilities have there were there are a lot of possibilities and the more we investigate the more possibilities we find I think we can do this as a city we would obviously prefer that there was a very simple national answer so that each that he didn 't have to go to own way but i think the recommendations here speak were pretty generally supported by the committee and we would just like to add that additional one about incorporating reuse into our environmental criteria in our review of the procurement policy all right would you like to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zero is there any discussion Sarah thank you i think this is a really good step forward and like perkasie we can 't do an outright ban or impose a unilateral levy ourselves but then working with the major retailers will be a really big step forward one of the barriers in the past has been the living the level playing field and having people working together to do it voluntarily and some sort will be really really good we know that oversees examples have shown us so for example an angle nepeta 5p levy on end plastic bag use dropped by eighty five percent really quickly and so without without bending them and being many station telling people what to do we 're able to make a really big difference ourselves so really looking forward to getting this going yani um just crooked so I really support the addition of eight and so an ND and also number three because I think it 's actually really important that we start looking at producer responsibility as well and I think the packaging forum has a huge role to play in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these steps that we 're taking I think we shouldn 't lose sight of the fact that we also should be looking at what 's happening in regards to producer responsibility legislation was sent government because I do think when you think of other things like a waste for example and plastics and and all the nasty stuff that goes along with that there are other things that we should also be in my fault but I think this is a really good start on a very specific issue but it may be that wide oh she 's come out of this work which I would welcome Oh Erin sorry having a mental block today hey that 's right I 've been called worse um what in your name yes the I do support this although I wish it were there was a lot more included in it and it went a lot further a plastics a massive issue for the planet and the amount think it 's run out and I even just look at the lolly wrappers we have here on a disk these are individually placed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for instance they use a wax paper just little stuff like that it just makes a huge difference to the world 's place think that 's going to end up in the ocean we 're just food about the water it 's full of from the oceans of full of place that gets consumed by fish at a microscopic level so we eat it eventually and get rid of it that way but will give us cancer and will die but that aside drinking straws is another one and i would have liked drinking straws to have been included in this would be great to work with the local alcohol in hospitality industry to maybe be one of the first cities in the world to try and go straw free as Soho in London did it and the amount of straws that they don 't now put in landfills and oceans is reduced by millions so all their bar districts did it you can actually drink out the side of a glass or the top of a can or a bottle you don 't need a little straw to supper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not true none of nothing in there I 've researched it lot so it 's that they are kind of pointless so it would be great to encourage those kind of things and the other one is I raised it earlier it 's not the place to talk about a dog poop in here but rapping dog poop and play stick and then storing it and came Valley for millions of years doesn 't make much sense either so yeah there 's so many more things we could be doing this is a start and we should be expanding on this was in response to a petition about single use plastic bags so we wanted to address that Sierra has a particular thing about reusable coffee cups which I think will probably come next and I 'm quite confident that once people know that there is a committee dealing with sustainability that there will be a whole lot of initiatives hopefully from the public it 's nice well I think since these don 't meet our sugar policy either why we even got them actually no it 's called walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they 'll be read I madam chair I moved mentees and when we have the Christmas party I 'll tell you run the best Mindy joke they 've ever seen in their life yeah yeah and I these ones don 't do bad either anyway all right so um so that 's been moved in sick and herbs thank you all for your contributions oh it 's been moved and seconded i 'll put that motion all those in,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

economic development MC and then the transition plan for the merge tourism events and economic development in see Helen are you are you joining love it yep can we pull up another chair right okay thanks very much I just done ah well it 's just it 's really cool that this is just tuned because I was just gonna say I was just I was just gonna say yeah actually yeah I 'm just going to say that it is very good ever look rather than me sort of kind of indicate to you that there there probably is a yeah there 's a visit this can I say a preference for christchurch NZ rather than christchurch ink into brie NZ simply because of the you know that the length of us and it 's kind of snappy it 's who we are projections heed so on that note can I hand over to you Theresa thank you you are you presenting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the bars alone that I go adduction something yeah yes I 'm so I 've just done a cover report for this and with that I 'll hand over to the team so that the naming process has been actually has been a highlight of the of the transition plan and the reason it 's been a highlight has been a staff engagement so all of the all of the idea generation all of the input into the content and the longest came from the staff that list is everybody has seen in the paper included some really off the wall and eccentric and amusing suggestions and it was actually a really good bonding exercise for the entities that are coming together so it worked around more than just a more than just a naming content and of course it helps that with that means we 've avoided any expensive branding or marketing consultant costs and the process so we 're very happy internally with the process that 's been running very pleased with the output with regard to the recommendations so the after the staff after the staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got together that came up with a short list that sub that subgroup made a unanimous recommendation which interested me enough was Christchurch New Zealand so the staff recommendation was christchurch new zealand in fact christchurch ended there was dinner there was then a conversation at the board and it was kind of 5050 around did we want to look to add Canterbury to include that link to include that regional link both economically where they 're so entwined and also in particular around tourism where the existing cct actually deliver specifically enter into terrorism but Christchurch New Zealand was the slightly shorter slightly snappier slightly cleaner line we had to make a recommendation so we came up with Christ Church and Canterbury but very relaxed about about either so if what we 're getting from the shareholder is what we 've got a preference for christchurch NZ that 's no problem at all very good so um it has anyone got any questions Yanni yeah um thank you and thank you for the work you 've done on it I guess what I 'm just having a little bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NZ it as a kind of branding thing but in terms of a name for an entity that some it just does it still doesn 't quite feel right so I just wanted in terms of have you given much thought to the two different purposes and and yeah I just I mean Christ churns as basically you know so it 's a it 's a really good question the there is a little bit in the paper around it the but that brings it to life is the sub branch yeah so christchurch NZ on its own is not a descriptor christchurch NZ tourism christchurch NZ major events christchurch NZ development is what turns it into the enter the entity function and on again star suggestion we think very clever this works internationally in particular because everybody is then clear about the entity that there that they 're engaging with where they are and then you 've got the specific sub brands attached to so we 've done a little bit of work on that and really like the way that works but it is the sub brands that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its and your email addresses to you know the email addresses the oh if you wanna buck dollar net christchurch NZ dot is it Kyoko teens in calm calm yeah so christchurch NZ calm it 's great it 's just in terms of some of the other more creative names Ministry of Christ Church create they send a lot more sort of energetic fun exciting different why were those sort of discounted um so they weren 't discounted there was an awful there was an awful lot of debate there was substantial support for Vera whether whether whether the staff and I don 't think I 've ever had so many texts after a newspaper article saying it 's gotta be shaky mcphobe all the what we wanted what we wanted to finish up with was a meaningful brand that would resonate thinking about attraction promotion and support both locally nationally and internationally so we ended up with this regional brand but we think this is a step forward from you know kind of a bog-standard descriptor that everybody is used in the in the past we like the freshness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brand elements to it so we could have gone cool and funky but we thought we actually ended up with pretty good halfway house could i add a good debate i also think it 's important sorry it 's a really strong statement it 's this is our place in the world this is who we are and it i think it is a really bold name for the entity and the other thing is is that you can add other things toward as well i mean let you could put intact at gateway city underneath christchurch NZ you know to anything that 's a descriptor of what we are who we are what we do can be added as a tag line we don 't you know yeah Oh attention it works on every level for me polishes they 'll know that I 'm on the board report made the reek of a romantic comedy will encounter bride so but before I 'm from what the cheer and Thomas did you know you can hit but Colin funk you 2 101 things but the number one key as its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canterbury whether it 's attacked at whatever it is but the key number one function is christchurch new zealand this make it clearly state what we are quite people can find it easily that is what what it is yes sir my first impression when i saw it was that it was an address um but it actually anything cool and funky is going to date really quickly and then in five years time we 're going to be spending fifty thousand dollars of the consultancy to try and find a new name I know other cities are doing that at the moment and I 'd rather not do that and and I think that yeah we 're always going to be christchurch new zealand and and i think that it 's a good way to go very cool um Jamie Cheers I love we 've got two with us to be really Frank with you I didn 't like Christ Church in Canterbury indeed I thought was a mouthful and yeah i actually did find an inspiring and i know you guys could do BTW i think we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question really around this is how much is it actually going to be about the name really anyway and what it 's doing and that 's what i want to get a flavor for because you know I think I can work with christchurch NZ you know i 'm always liked the idea of like hashtag church error or something like that wit but again you know then it may not stay in that test of time and then it did get me thinking you know since we 've first seen this and then I like the very idea actually as well but then the more I thought about it and want to get your take yeah how much is it actually going to be about this name and how much is it actually going to be about what you guys doing and not people actually coming to us I am lessly sitting on the engineer typing in Christchurch wondering what pops up the spot on spot on Jamie so it is a name it needs to resonate but given that it actually will be about the content that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that where this will work really well internationally and as we think about attraction and attraction in the various different the various different areas and it is time for the city to think internationally then this really resonates and that and that sub brand line works works even more yeah um David I 'm thank you look I quite like the Christchurch New Zealand i think it is snappy does hit the mark and as other speakers have said it has that international snap right on christ church but can you actually just confirm one thing for me with this huge marketing exercise on where to believe it costs 93 did indeed for muffins and coffee for our staff well i think given that huge expenditure and the exposure we 're going to get it 's a very good investment and marketing Andrew thank you I think how we got here is a really good story and has been a big part of the coming together of the various organizations that make up the the converged entity and yeah I mean 93 is great but what it 's done for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even better as it 's excellent and it 's been touched on but what we need is something that resonates locally regionally nationally and internationally that works internally and that certainly works as an outward-facing brand as well I think this is a great piece of work and it 's landed in a good space having said all of that as a director of the organization I 'll sit back from the decision and others may choose to do the same but I just want to congratulate everybody that 's been involved on a great piece of working a good result okay all right so um with someone like to move the motion Jamie seconded by Sarah I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Reports,ZqigXbQWmtw,20170405,2262.89,"Christchurch, New Zealand",5605,"thank you both very much much appreciated and do pass on our thanks to the staff that worked so hard in our beautiful botanic gardens um could I now move on to the water management zone committee annual reports I see that we have been joined by our representatives to sponge the banks peninsula zone committee we have paula smith and these they would be visit opening set correctly sorry working women will just get your presentation relator god no no my heart my key to particle or akiho too I 'm spanning to be back here in the seat I 'm going to talk about the annual report from the bank signature water management zone committee the bank 's mature water zone committee is now five years old and and I 've been cheer for three weeks so i 'm i 'm just going to talk briefly about the committee in the first couple of years they were focused on putting together the zip what we call the zone and implementation plan I think you probably all familiar with the zips and we had a real focus on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sizes and this year has been really this last year 's been a consolidation on that previous work we had a look through some of the zip recommendations there are 120 in the bank 's blanchett something like that a lot and we 've reached a conclusion that perhaps there needs to be a bit of simplifying and streamlining so that 's going to be of one of our focuses for the coming year to review visit in to simplify and streamline this early this year we 've had a bit of a focus on the fires and the zoning committee made a decision to allocate thirty five thousand dollars which was all that it had left and the immediate steps biodiversity fund to the catchments in Oh Hannah tahi which are within his own committee so the boundary of his own committee is X at the top of the port hills so a banks peninsula includes the lyttelton harbour delpo catchment but not the ones on the side even though they 're sort of part of the same land form and so all that money is going to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly some other adjacent landowners what else do I need to say for banks peninsula our main contaminant is sediment unlike some other zone zones where the contaminant contaminants of concern nitrogen and settlement is associated with phosphorous enrichment as well the other issue for banks peninsula is we get all our rain all our water from rain nearly all of it whereas in other zones there might be some ground water sources or other sources we rely completely on rain and that makes banks conventional zone particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change we 've got sure we 've got short steep catchments and erode abul hills and there 's a bit of a myth that the water quality in banks peninsula is good and that the ecosystem health is good but that does not appear to be supported by the data that we 're receiving so that 's about it really any questions questions Yanni thank you obviously the fires has had a major impact on what 's what 's going to happen in terms of water the waterways as his own committee actively involved in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire is not a large area compared to the whole zone and in fact there 's only one or two one possibly two catchments that are seriously affected but the risk the real risk is that with the ground not having a hundred sent vegetation cover that it starts falling into the creeks so there are two or three creeks that dream that areas and they 're like most banks finish creeks a small they 've got some native fish living in them and they 're a bit vulnerable can can I just add to that as Paula said we have a all the zone committees have a biodiversity fund and the banks peninsula had 35,000 left for the 2016 17 financial year and very quickly made the decision to dedicate that to the work particularly summit rose society but be adjacent land 22 that in terms of revocation sir yep Glenn 48-bit say today just one question that stood out there page 192 it was over the ground water takes now maybe it 's something not to get too excited about but it 's just something that is about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have lower ground water or group the whole well we have got away her work yeah looks excellent but there is a bit of an issue with the there are water takes from some banks natural streams and there 's a there 's a bit of a question because you 're permitted to take all the people are permitted to take all the what they need for stock and for drinking in some cases there 's a because in the stream flows very so much through the season there 's potential for over-allocation even within some of our streams which we have to watch but there is a little bit of water taken for irrigation and other other users and beans mature very good any other questions no but thank you very much you 're welcome okay um I 'll take over with Christchurch we smelt land i 'll ask and there isn 't it 's all right an hour apart Reuben the cheer of christchurch be smelting his tangy today so gives his apology so i 'll ask paul into chippin if she 's got anything to add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milestones for 4 2016 and we did allocate 160,000 to 214 biodiversity projects and that particular zone and I 'll just uh give a copy of the map of the christchurch will we smelt and sewing if you could just give it to the counselors to cheer around and and it shows all we 're all those projects are across the sign just to pick up on the effects of the fire this particular zone has made the catchments in the upper hiscott affected by the fire a priority for immediate steps funding for the next two financial years our biodiversity officers from Environment Canterbury are out with resume staff talking to landowners and seeing if there are any opportunities and for their immediate steps funding in terms of some of the other activities the zone committee has been involved in they identified for particular catchments from the data that Christchurch City clicks in terms of surface water that were particularly high in various contaminants and and that was rickdan kashmir stream which was sediment and and also Eddington Brock in and as well as hatin stream so we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before we get on to that I just like to emphasize that the zone committee was very active in doing some work on and sediment control and redman spear and trialing some various treatments there that hopefully what we picked up as part of the fire remediation work and also they 've been quite active and working with the University of Canterbury around modeling some urban contaminants so starting to get a sense of what sorts of stormwater have been swollen up and how much copper how much sink how much sediment help various surfaces so before i head over to my colleague to talk about heightens stream catchment pauline if you got anything you would like to add it 's some Covenant really well Leslie and thanks for your support of the committee you 're fantastic we 're also using University students out of the hate ins that great but yeah what you 're providing a lot of League work to clear the data so it 's really good to see these partnerships happening and I noticed a comment on the banks peninsula that they were working with enviro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody in together on this isn 't it yeah thank you so I hate me stream catchment this is my colleague Nick moody who 's and a pollution prevention officer with Environment Canterbury good morning i 'm just gonna test this slide zephyr or do I point it so all right hopefully we do here it 's so just going all right yeah so that 's me yeah all right i 'll just say next yep slide their things yep this go for it so good morning as leslie said i 'm one of the two pollution prevention advisors at EK n my name is Nick moody all of Christchurch 's waterways suffer from urban pollution whoever is there are just two of us we can 't work on them for months so the zone committee has sleep before four already stream catchments to improve water quality and as you heard these are kashmir stream record and stream eddington brook and my catchment hating stream haven stream is springfield and together with curlers stream it forms the start of the haircut river hey this stream is also the most polluted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it though in the past it was so healthy that salmon used to run up the hip deliver to breathe in the Haven stream as you can see from this map and perhaps the next Mac thing seriously rainwater which forms in its catchment drains the bourne be Wigram softburn part of town and there is contamination of that rainwater from a number of sources including runoff from galvanized zinc roofs and busy roads as well as pollution from practices of businesses themselves i 'm working on a five-year project to improve the quality of the storm water entering hey constrain and doing that in three phases the first phase is identifying high-risk businesses and working with them to ensure that only clean rainwater is leaving their site the second phase it 's working with the City Council to address some of the land use pollutants by treating zinc contamination from zinc roofs settlement from construction sites and copper and zinc from roads city council has recently made a significant investment in this area by approving the upgrade of the wig retention Basin which hayden stream passes through on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remove some of these contaminants so thank you finally once the water is clean enough things to live in it then the third phase will be restoring the stream banks and beard to encourage fish to return to this train once more so on the next slide I 'm just going to show you some of the common are and easily fixed issues which I see in my work and I 'm working on this first phase at the top we 've got our truck and vehicle washing and we 've me to go bus and then not discharge into the river idea safe but many places when they wash your vehicle contaminants leave the vehicle and also detergents you can see that next arrow leads to apply to the river of the church and coming out then you 've got the second slide in the bottom left corner which is very common one at the moment in our city which is construction and earthworks can see them in leaving the site being tracked out on the truck tires on the road entering the storm water drain and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the storm water and polluting our beautiful rivers so that 's a real issue with the rebuild of city of course adding on the final slide you can see in a sample of foresight management leading to industrial pollutants washing into the stream yeah that 's less common but obviously quite devastating water quality so how we fix it we 're working together collaboratively with businesses to support them to understand the impact of ESI account management has on the hip that River ensuring the behavior changes investments are stored a management occur on site a network is done collaboratively between EK City Council and the University of Canterbury at the closure of City Council would be technical services clean and three waters and waste key to the success of the work and they also have only two staff members to go out to all the sites of pressure but I really appreciate their support and in the havens catchment they have identified some issues and help to resolve them and Hayden 's we work with businesses identified as high-risk together myself looking at the store water and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sewer and under manager at City Council Tim Drinan that team identified an issue with faulty valve some vehicle wash bays throughout Christchurch and got all those valves removed this prevented discharge of millions of litres of contaminate water into our streams and many such accidental discharges have been identified by City Council work in stop in the Haven stream so great work is being done there the University of Calgary have done excellent research in the space and as Leslie mentioned we have sponsored our masters students to monitor the stream and look for pollution sources over the last two years for myself that you can my work containers catchment finally there are 327 businesses in the Hayden 's catchment about 80 or iris and I working with 20 of these which means that as one person my books are full in general the businesses response is positive I 'm seeing some big players investing tens of thousands of dollars in this site infrastructure as well as in the key area of behavior change for example so I 'm looking forward to continuing to work closely with City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your support we can improve the water quality of the stream and give the hip get river a better starting life questions and thank you in question thank you ms obviously and an amazing amount of work going on and some really proactive stuff which was excellent you mentioned that you were one of only two pollution prevention officers that you can here 's what what is the y is it just for the christchurch city boundaries is that for a wider area that 's four that 's all of canterbury all the area that he can covers from water down to yes that 's right so too yep we do focus on work on the city okay and then you 've got the two people in the city council team who assist us also crush it twice okay thank you it 's all good lovely thank you very much very good presentation thanks for the right we do need to work together on this game so the next sorry we 've got in White House from selling my horrid so committee and Johanna squash that 's right and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who 's the chair of the Sun one who was sown committee who unfortunately no meeting got changed has to be topology I 'm going to be very brief in terms of the talking about the annual report and in your harness this is going to do a brief commentary on some of our biodiversity projects and I just want to talk about like it 's a couple of key achievements and relate those two I guess one of the absolutely completely critical issues that I know not only is it not only someone who is facing that many of the other parts which is the drawing up of some of our waterways I guess I wanna focus is one of the key achievements is that there 's now actually an operative set of rules including limits in place both for like water quality in water quantity now that 's quite particular to the cell in TI corazon and those include I think what many would say looking across New Zealand some pretty tough requirements for farmers including we believe that at least 900 of them will need a consent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as that some like India sector will require to make additional reductions beyond good management practice loss rates and in the dairy sector that 's a thirty percent reduction beyond that by 2020 to UM one of the key challenges is we all know and I guess for the zone committee it 's really epitomized by the cell in river it goes forward there 's how to get that bet back so that it 's horrible so that requires three things in combination you clearly need water and it were good quality so that it 's swimmable and actually meets the requirement to be smuggled and as well as that you need a whole lot of things in terms of if we call them could make up the visitor experience in terms of amenity and landscaping the line and we try to psych them is try to get people focused on not who 's to blame what 's the blame but what can you actually do about it I want to link that with one of the like it 's the pieces of the package of actions that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirteen which which includes a whole variety of things to try and get more water to stay in the groundwater system and thinks into the low and streams but also restore a whole lot of flows in other ways and one of those is the critical importance of central plains water and the key achievement that talks about the stage one impact on how much water has now as a consequence of being able to provide irrigation on stage one part of CPW from your car in from Lake College intentions toward water how that 's left a lot more water in the ground with system and when stage two proceeds which is still another 15 or so months off expect to see more impact on the particular streams that kind of below central plain stage two which will include the stellar and but will be a bit of a time about them the other thing that those own committee is now very actively supporting and champion is the proposal that some of central plains water from its head graves pipeline would be able to use adjacent to the cell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flows well actually all means the groundwater then ultimately the flows and the loaded strength before I guess we finished here I just like to think in Galileo 's would see is the poverty poverty here please I mean it 's great to have her involved really actively in the zone committee one of the things that she asked for having listened to Johannes present a half a dozen proposals for immediate steps biodiversity funding if we could very briefly give a snapshot of some of the body VC funds than siwanois hora the sight of me is now allocated six hundred thousand dollars of immediate steep spite of this you can 't funding so okay pinky curiae everyone and this is just a brief snapshot over the past six seven years five six years of him units its funding for the zone and that mattress outlines a number of the project right across from tyo all the way after arthur 's pass and we spend yet as into said I 'm over six hundred thousand dollars on just under 50 projects with real action the route on the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catchments and loyal and streams which pretty much described the whole zone as it is and the majority of projects had high or very high ecological assessment scores and but we all SAT around thirty percent are in the low bracket which equally Israel is representative of the zone because we have a very depleted biodiversity across the lowland plains and in a recent zone committee meeting for priority to focus on areas were decided by the zone committee for my work which focus on the high country the horror ah detachment of the area around cause Ford particularly iron Silverstream engine it generally high biodiversity values in addition to that the zone committee has now also made the conscious decision to support Porter fire restoration efforts wherever we find opportunities in the zone to actually help blend honors with the restoration effort and what does it mean or what are those biodiversity project we 've been up to over the last couple of years and those amongst you are active recreationists maybe fishermen would probably no one trees from up on Mount white station we do a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linking beech forest remnants in the foothills with the big riparian corridor with the lowland plains wetlands bringing its further down a lot of the work goes on around yes bringing it enhancements and just ripe here in areas both in private public land on farms and lifestyle blocks there is quite a considered interest from landowners to work on their up here in margins and work around sites that have high milling akai values and all the way down to now sites where we support banks peninsula Conservation Trust with Covenant work they 're doing to work towards this mountain to the sea transit whether it 's from the from the Southern Alps in outer space to tell ahora with it from the banks peninsula and side of things towards they were her thank you very much fantastic questions questions do we have questions so Glenn Vicky and Phil thank you now I 've got the zone right just that question over the ground water take on page 192 and the connection with the previous for the introductory remarks over key achievements in 2016 so is that the connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theater over the combined impact of the 1700 groundwater takes in the zone is that prior to this reduced tape from CPW so or no link and so I mean let 's step back and give I guess that bigger content so there 's 780 yard brownwood it takes across the whole 71 who are hearing for the piece that drains into the lake and adjacent areas so stage 1 or central plains only covers a relatively small part of the plant and so what we 're seeing there is a clearly an important element of mean ultimately well what will be a medium to longer term a really dressing of the cumulative impact of all of those seven hundred times okay oh yeah Hey oh yeah have you got a handle on what proportion the CPW project is of those just a right so I thought off the top of my head I can 't yeah I 'm giving over but it would be less than 100 okay thanks okay um are you guys familiar with the recent vivid economics report on what has to happen in New Zealand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so on I don 't know the details so one of the things that came through very strongly in that was that even if we Electrify our transport system make our houses energy-efficient and our buildings was that land use needed to change quite dramatically and the number of cars and the number of sheep needed to decline quite dramatically within a reasonably short period of time so I 'm wondering if that sort of research is feeding into any of the work that you guys are able to influence again with hope what is I 'm not really able to commit in particular detail about how that report has been given effector at this point in time but it 's one 's own committee and that joint committees with a can so I think that 's probably something we need to raise lady and councillors oh yeah Thank You Phil so thank you and I think if you review report to the section of hitted restoration of Roland streams and you 've got reference to the court TSA targeted stream augmentation just wondering be up there and just how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's in an experimentation stage so I 'm just really wondering about the science hell sound that is in terms of where the water will eventually go and the impact on aquifers um so so that so there 's I guess the bigger scale witches I mean they will basically augmentation your bigger scale what we kind of would host the proposal to use central plains heat pipe i trace the area that I guess is described here is um it 's much more local to give I guess we 've got high value local waterways and particularly the oval but also some there was very very significant to note I used to be their main passageway kind of up the plains so to give effect to local precious waterways that I guess we 've seen the amount of water to climb and some of those secluded substantial mud fish habitats and so so those are local using with curry piloted using water from either the stock would a end of stock water races or I think one of the ones that 's also described using a solar pump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and relatively small scale to give local values back into smaller waterways which means smaller Boise wasn 't right there not deeper was right from that and so so that the relative relatively local and ground water takes in terms of being able to drive them from with Sol Sol account and so it 's not it 's more looking at what can we do to help the waterways rather than the bigger ground getting more water into the groundwater system itself so that 's the you know prohibiting new new water takes that making transfers incredibly unattractive that 's the replacement of a reasonable of cities thousand hectares of currently groundwater irrigated lands was water forum CPW from the record but those are the bigger pictures keep more water in the groundwater system think thank you damn just very coming off while phil was talking about 1700 groundwater takes and also used talk about changing weather patterns where does the water whereas it actually come from is it from the west coast and their own coming over or is it actually from the east coast rail and so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're talking about the rain on the plant for anything on the plane so it 's do you know the Norwest brain doesn 't come that far so you 're talking about any weather systems that will produce right on right on the plains so you is a resident crush you you 'll be pretty familiar with those weather systems is so so obviously the rain that from those nor 'westers when it dumps on the on the hills and fills up the why Mac river in the Rakaia river does that replenish these the groundwater here have as a laburar it says so in terms of the upper and middle part of the plains I think that short answer is probably not too great impact but as you get further down and I think few people in familiar was where Christ ships city 's water comes from you know that the waimakariri you know flowing through its old now buried channels because it used to ultimately for a while was discharging through t y hora we 're tiwa who are now is I 'm so through there you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system and from the way mercury I mean you see the similar st. happening and require so yes it yes it is what central plains what is doing is it 's using water that is generated by those Norway 's rains to then replace some of the groundwater takes in the middle and upper parking place so the so a big problem is obviously then from what you 're saying is actually the ground all it takes so it 's a situation that we 've seen now as a combination of three years of certainly caught less than average amount of rainfall onto the plains to reach as the groundwater system combined was that cumulative impact of a large number of ground water tanks cool thank you Yanni I 'm just a quick question and regards to the nitrogen levels what 's um I just know and you 've got you 've got talked about the CW ms targets can you just give us a quick understanding of what 's happening with the nitrogen targets particularly with the CPW stage one coming on line to him Lenny I guess step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them nitrogen loads in load limits and so the operative plan does have a nitrogen load limit for farming from the 70 whoa who were a area of single Topham heaters 4,800 and turns per year but what the lake currently sees is sink off tom peters about 4,100 feet one wants to detail this was there 's an agenda paper on the cylinder who are a site committee meeting on Tuesday that spells all his out and so that but the lake is currently seeing a lot less because of the impact of the leg so to the mall a molecule of nitrate once it 's lost below the soil layer in the top of the plains takes anywhere between 10 and 30 years to get to the lake so when we look at and model the nitrogen losses from the current land use from current farming um it 's quite a lot bigger number than what we currently see one of the real challenges for the zone committee and indeed for anyone involved in the process of trying to come up with a solution package was the reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to create this package of solutions central plains would have had already been consented so central plains would applied for the consent during the gold rush period of water takes you know back in two thousand two or two thousand five but it was only in twenty twelve that it finally went through all of the Environment Court high court processes so that was a challenge as well so you had to kind of somehow accommodate the fact that CPW was conceited and adds to the load and so basically then as a consequence that in the operative plan there 's a specific load that 's been given to central plains water for their conversion of the driving and then as well as their that load limit takes a account of the laser current land use and the leg effect on that and then as a set and the key achievements one of the things is that also though takes account of the further reductions of those with the highest losses a need to make by 2022 and ends up where 's 2800 if it 's getting better I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work because you 've got a leg things will get worse before they get better that 's the reality of the that 's the biophysical reality I I cannot to talk them here doing the percentages look at look at the design committee paper in terms of the amount that 's estimated is is currently going in the currently in the like is seeing in what the current land use is giving you I I don 't know not opes being yep yeah bit all right that 's really no don 't apologize that some that is really important and it 's important that we hear from all those own committees the way that we have done it 's not a process that we had in place right from the get-go so it 's a great improvement to be able to help us these conversations on a on a regular basis so thank you very much for making the effort to thank you to come and would you like to move Pauline that the reports be received do I have a seconder for that filled I 'll put that motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's carried and could","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Plan,xBR5JBvLHR8,20170405,1354.76,"Christchurch, New Zealand",3814,thank you painted up with erections you could I festival invite filter introduce the paper and and then we 'll open it up to questions and and then send a TV show so I 've got no doubt that the submissions were here today have been helpful in terms of certainly and we already have as counselors earlier at a different recommendation particularly around and community engagement and that feedback comes back to the committee and that then the committee would make recommendations to council so and by the just so submitters are aware by community engagement we mean some some formal informal processors like for example we would have drop-in sessions at the gardens the museum maybe another place in different places around the city so people can look at that that the planning which and make some comments and give some feedback on there so the fit we will be having some community conversations around this very important part of our city the Botanic Gardens so just for clarification no for counselors to that in itself the spatial plan it 's like a series of maps you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aim of course is to improve the gardens its operations and its management and you 'll be aware that a key driver for all this is we have a group new group the Christchurch Botanic Gardens charitable trusts and they one of the objectives of the plan is that in fact the fundraising work that they want to do will be supported so and I 'm sorry that the Civic trust weren 't part of the group of stakeholders because a large number were involved and they looked at really the needs in requirements but so that the Botanic Gardens master plan can be delivered so and I think that if residents are able to look at those maps and the spatial plan and give their views that will really assist us to get the best outcome and I 'll leave the other deep tell us that you may want to ask about to staff to comment on your honor I kind of like to start because I I know the people that work in the Botanic Gardens and a more passionate group of people you could not find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of like it so they don 't get out of bed in the morning and think oh my goodness I 've got to go to work it 's just like it 's a passion so so we want to kind of support them but I think that if I just had relied on what I 'd read externally about what we were going to be considering today instead of reading the actual paper that we are considering today I would have had quite a different impression about what we 're doing and and that 's why I 'm very supportive of this recommendation that we undertake community engagement end and seek feedback from the public about what is really precious to to the city as a whole and the reason is that and there is a question at the end of all of this before somebody jumps down my throat that the reason is is that what I didn 't understand was the connection between the spatial plan the master plan in the management plan and the action plan of that so and I mean as we 've have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covers hagley park and the botanic gardens that this relates to and that the spatial plan was developed as a tool to give effect to projects and objectives of the master plan and management plan not going into the specifics but but in order to visually portray how it was all going to come together but as a result it 's working people 's either memories of being involved back in two thousand seven or not actually being aware or actually having the entire brain upset by the earthquake sequence in the meantime and everything else that 's happened and actually just worrying that something 's happening to the botanic gardens and we don 't want to see a repeat of Victoria Square happening and our precious gardens so so that so the yep so there is a question I 'm sure but I 'm look I 'm happy to comment on that it ya know but what I wanted to know is can the community engagement include a summary of the of the original you know what the plan was the master plan and also the the action plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan and and then also the development of as phil said the botanic gardens charitable trust we signed an MoU with them beckoned 2015 to enable philanthropic fund raising because we haven 't put money on the budget for certain things that are in the master plan and so that I think out of frustration the the the the people that work at the botanic gardens encouraged a group of people to come together as a philanthropic funding group and they they want to get on with fundraising for specific projects so the spatial plan has as an enabler for that so but in debt context I think some of the things will get some feedback from the public that we 've got to be open to so there go look I guess the first thing I 'd like to do is acknowledge that our communication around this project if you like has been somewhat clumsy and I guess it certainly from what we 've heard from the from the deputations in from comments is that it is a little bit complex for people to really grasp that there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the botanic gardens and there 's an watching master plan but not a master plan is we sort of recognize them now where we see images and block building so people can understand and the spatial Prem initiative was to fill that gap and I acknowledge that it 's been somewhat clumsy and certainly I think it is the right thing to do to to pause I guess I I I just urge pause with a little bit of caution because I think it 's an appropriate for council staff to promote initiatives into the next long term plan without a full understanding of the public and and the elected members of what that really means now what I mean by that is the master plan currently is a list of initiatives and the botanic gardens is a very special place it 's a very crowded place and if we just launched into individual projects as we have one sitting in the in the long-term plan at the moment we could create a bottleneck or some some clumsy delivery of individual projects it needs to be tied together so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that anymore in terms of state stakeholder engagement yes I 'd also like to acknowledge that the Civic trust would obviously have liked to have been more directly involved and more than willing to talk again more directly with them and the engagement process and anyone else who puts their hand up I think three months is a good cycle we will still be able to move forward in the current planning for the long-term plan for the council to consider any future investments yeah and then that 's all I 've gots a word right I 've Glen Yanni it may ask a question of n just to cover all just the significance aspect in just my question is over does the passage of time or windows the passage of time pep start to alter the significance measure so it 's been ten years this seems to be a common kind of feature and the deputations this ten year on time frame and so we were judging this to still be of low significance but we 're going to hopefully I 'll to take the community engagement if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key isn 't it that you are going to have to take a process of engagement where people can be brought up to date with earlier consultation yesterday 's seem to be a fear length of time since the last consultation presumably we 're consulting or engaging on the same issue so I don 't think that 's an issue given what we going to do we 're all covered off the yeah thank you Yanni well I think I mean obviously the amendment has changed what we were going to do but the recommendation from the committee was not to have consultation and engagement and just to approve the plan so I think it would be good just to understand from our legal point of view around whether or not if the committee recommendation was endorsed not the amendment how that would be treated in terms of our significance policy given what we today would they still treat it in the same way sorry okay I think I mean it doesn 't I can 't really see the point in going into that given that we do have this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the advice that we have in the report is that the level of cinnamon says low because we people were consulted in 2007 ten years ago no that 's not not quite what it says it says the level of significance was determined by the fact that the projects depicted in the spatial plan were extensively consulted on in 2007 so if those projects had been funded any time between 2007 and now they would have been done dusted but they weren 't funded because we had an earthquake in between and so what the spatial plan i think andruw 's just even explained it better than the report did is that the spatial plan is to pick up what 's missing so we 've got a master plan but it 's not a master plan like the the wolf stone suburban master plan which is a spatial plan this is a spatial plan it shows you it depicts what it will be like okay okay that 's one so just in terms of two other questions one is in terms of 13 year program we were going to review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve and thirteen and I just wanted to check when we 're next scheduled to review those management plans so the reserves Act encourages reserve management plans to be reviewed but it 's not required approximately every teen years and the master plan logically follows a management plan the management plan sets out the objectives of how to manage the reserve and what you 're trying to achieve the master plan follows so ten years have gone by but we 've had this hiatus will buy it was officially impossible to deliver the previous plan generated by the earthquakes so it 's an open-ended answer you can review a management plan anytime you like I will remind counselors that i 'm not sure if anyone was around at the time that the last process took three years so if you wish to go down that route you will not likely you will not fund anything and then it 's going to attempt until you 've been through their process so so i think it would be really useful as part of the community engagement to get an update on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a number of actions and there that may have been done may not have been done i can give you that now and we will publish a bit built a visitor center and we 've done a conservation plan that 's it yeah so the things around you looking at the leases and tidying up the property arrangements things like looking at the the finances for example or surveying the condition of the trees as have those things just not happened at all we 've been recently doing a an operational review row alongside the spatial plan to ready ourselves to present to counsel the state of the nation so to speak and respect to the Botanic Gardens so yes we 've been working quite hard on operational and the asset based information so I mean again I just think that would be really useful we 've been engaged with people govern that that was kind of the actions that we said we were going to do that to have a sort of written update against this you know I think they 're really happening what hasn 't happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was what you were going to do is see that out that 's what we 're going to bring to council but it but also but in attend to the public it 's not related to the future developments it 's a related those initiatives are related to everyday operations except we 've just heard from the deputation that one of their concerns is that rather than going and looking at new projects if we 're not actually maintaining what we 've got they 're really concerned and so I think that will be a conversation as we engage that the community will want to have and understand so yes there there is a point there but you also can 't divorce the fact that to improve the efficiency of current operations you have to invest in the asset cannot divorce the two right exactly so we can get the information that I 'm good and the final question I had was um again from a legal point of view accepting what we 've heard today around the fact that we 're going to go out and engage and therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be putting approve the draft plan or you know simply receiving it and it just as we have got written in terms of the amendment that 's acting like we 're proving the plan before you even had that consultation is moving at for community agencies TV no no I just asked them to start up in terms of if people were going to challenge should we not be putting the word draft and they just make it clear that we 're open-minded as we go through that engagement to listen to that feedback i I 'm I 'm fearful that you still don 't understand what a spatial planners versus the master plan and management plan yeah sorry can I do an answer from staff I think the resolution has reasonably clear enough it approves the plan for community engagement you would expect that that as a result of that there are changes it to be made they will be made all right so um would someone like to move move by bill seeking to buy yarn any discussion yeah yeah um well thank you for their arm chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had in front of us as you 'll be aware and this was discussed quite extensively at the committee and the committee was not of the view that we should have community engagement but I 'm really delighted to see that you know we have actually got an amendment now to that report that actually will engage for the reasons that I don 't think you can rely on something that happened ten years ago as being a reason not to engage and also given the significance of the botanic gardens to the people of the city I think it 's absolutely fair that the people the study have a right to be involved in publicly engaged on what 's being proposed the this is a very special place for our citizens and for visitors and I think it 's incumbent on us to make sure that the city is actually understanding what we 're doing what we 're proposing and therefore I think it 's really great that we are now going to go out for a community engagement and feedback and I want to make it really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to what we hit around us and also that we should actually make sure that in terms of the communication given what we 've heard that the communication hasn 't been as good as it could that we make sure really clearly articulate what the other things that are happening in this space because I think that 's been one of the problems is that you 've got an action plan a management plan and master plan a spatial plan and a long-term plan you 've got ultimately five different documents or contributing to the same piece of land in the city that creates a lot of confusion for people about what what decisions are made and how and you know one of the really interesting things and I think so a question that we should consider hopefully we can do it soon is the whole governance of the botanic gardens and higley park that was one of the things that was identified in the action plan it 's one of the things that was identified through submissions we heard previous term of council and I think it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm the front of one I 'll make is that it was really interesting at the Finance Committee to get a report a verbal update on some of the maintenance issues across the city and one of the comments that was made was the difficulty and attract attracting people into the mountains roles and fields and generally there was some discussion at the committee that looking at internships looking at apprenticeships looking at how we can engage our community and in some of these labor shortage areas as a really important thing to do and it was quite heartening to hear that the similar thing has been raised around there so I think you know we do need to get on top of the maintenance issues in the city and look at creative ways of addressing some of the shortcomings that people are identifying and I welcome that work happening our Phil and I have to say that at the committee there was no indication that the committee did not want community engagement at all i think was an assumption as part of the process community gagement would happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's very clear in the report that that there will be full consultation around any of the projects that actually come from the spatial plan and that will be and so that so so that in fact it happens we want to make sure that the business case which the staff will prepare that goes into the long-term plan so that then the projects are clarified and the staff have written down each and made it really clear those projects will be fully fully consulted on and so if there has been a lot of we known as people are really passionate about the community gardens and people are going to get every opportunity to be fully involved with this engagement Oakland Sarah George I mean I 'm going to have to break this and because we 've got some people waiting to go on to the next item so if people could just just bear that in mind if we could be quick clean see a really fast just on the consultation five point seven to ten actually tells you it is an ongoing process so it 's already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also want to commend Phil 's initiative for taking the committee and the invitation extended to the whole committee for a tour around the botanical gardens with Andrew and staff so that was good way of also engaging the committee so we got to see firsthand let 's make this an enjoyable process pictured at the right level but not make a monster out of something I think is let 's take the people with us but let 's make it enjoyable and a good way to engage with a real jewel in our city yep Sarah thank you i will make this brief um I was on the stakeholder reference group it 's too heavy for me community board it was a really good process with holy engaged stakeholders which is great they 're my impression throughout the whole thing was that it would be and then ready to go out for consultation so I 'm really pleased that it will be going out for for engagement with the community because when we say it 's not going to people fill a void with fears that big things are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will really reassure people that in fact the work has been done and good faith is nothing to hide and that people can once again sort of feel really engaged with their key public space Jimmy afford associate in the community development committee have a discussion and make the recommendation regarding issue actually I in the sum of members we did have the site visitor we was impressive with the staff nurse regarding to drafted is a kind of spatial plan and also particular purpose for the funding were aware because the must be management you can afford you know to how to link together by the spaceship renders powerful tool I will regarded consultation my understand the staff actually doula some of the consultation already for instance like the project partners are key stakeholders and the sum over maybe part of wider community right now the keys we party the more open to the public in contributor actually I would like to acknowledge of staff a contribution in Allaster you know the maybe a year or public years regarding to lease a job so I 'm fully supported this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those in favor say aye as opposed say no that 's carried thank you,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Carl Edwards for this opportunity for those new members of this council my name is David Lynch from the Mentos public relations and I 'm here in my capacity of the director of my company in my professional opinion as a public relations practitioner with significant experience regarding local government engagement consultation decision making there appears to be no basis for which a reasonable person would conclude that engaging public opinion or options on the botanic garden spatial plan through the l tcp would be seen as a legitimate meaningful method for assisting the council each of you either for or against advancing the Botanic Gardens Botanic that 's right lieutenant Gardens spatial plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rely on consultation that was undertaken in 2007 and that before endorsing the plan an independent review should be commissioned to determine whether or not those that were consulted in 2007 haven 't changed their views whether or not wider community consultation is now required in accordance with the attempt and spirit of the local government act with respect to compliance statute decision-making requirements in accordance with section 76 and 81 of the Act and whether or not announced significant matters requiring consideration that weren 't relevant in 2007 only then to the next step of working through the detail of the spatial plan and the operation review to put a business case for inclusion of the next long-term plan should be considered so some observations as I 've said the plan was consulted some ten years ago christchurch has sensed experienced a major earthquake the City Council 's financial position sadly was significantly challenged as a result of under insurance people 's priorities have changed substantial changes have already occurred in the Pretender gardens that weren 't part of the plan for example the ilex visitor center the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Christchurch public and they rightly expect to be consulted on any changes to not do so cleaning lists the council being the subject of a legendary public not cry I don 't need to remind you the recent public outcry with the government proposed in proposing the changes to Victoria Square there is a simple test or asked you to consider with respect to your deliberations today and it 's simply is it necessary is it relevant can we afford it is it something that the ratepayers that people you represent fully understand support and are committed to going forward with this right now I would also like to refer to the mayor and her most insightful observations and consultation when interviewed on youth talks of be on accessible cities and look this is not verbatim that the mayor said words defect go back and we engage the community everything is about what people think will happen it 's not what actually happens the better outcome is to go back where the accessible cities all the public consultation was done in 2 12 to 13 people as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes it 's better to go back and we engage the community and as a result there is a much better sense of engagement going forward so I can move the mere for that very insightful observation and given that it was only a few days ago and I 'm sure you don 't need reminding of your obligations when it comes to decision making that you are fully informed and satisfied that you have been given sufficient time to consider all relevant matters and dismiss any relevant matters and can veer for with absolute confidence approve the planet garden spatial plan going forward today if you have any doubt whatsoever then the right thing to do is to pause to allow the report to lie on the table until you 're absolutely satisfied by the decision that you find it take I think that 's relatively reasonable so what needs to happen I respectfully submit that this leaves the council with only one option and that is to allow the garden spatial plan and the proposal rather to lie on the table and to Commission the independent report determine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still the same whether or not the wider community should be consulted in accordance with the act and finally whether or not they 're an hour significant matters that require further consideration thank you very much thank you um other in christian 's oh yeah right get your brain drive carefully well I 'm on a 10 minute part i might come to you two off the ticket vesica there 's run by the airport company oh there you mean here no I 'm out here on Tim the park hey I 'm out here on a two minute mark I did say sweet Lemire I hope you don 't mind on the window I didn 't realize i earn more than you but I 'll be happy to pay it for you I certainly can 't let you off a council fine that 's not my role but I 'll pair um cross safely into Lindsey love you see Bo [Music] thank you for being so generous and allowing mr. lunch to go please well he should some of the things that I would have pottery ascertain nevermind but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up there you can see that the recommendation that counsels going to consider is to approve the christchurch botanic gardens spatial plan for community engagement and feedback to report back to the social community development committee within three months and i hope you understand the difference between the spatial plan and the and the management plan because the management plan is what was discussed in 2007 yeah not the spatial plan the spatial plan is just putting out the projects that need to be done to implement it thank you for that in bearing that in mind he couldn 't I 'd like to thank you for the opportunity to speak to council on this matter and I 'm reminding the council that has written in our Civic trusts mission statement the role this crisis Civic trust is to promote the civic pride in Christchurch and surrounds by his ongoing public advocacy for good urban design and architecture and by raising public awareness the importance of the city 's natural and built environment heritage the crisis civic Trust has passed its 50th year of existence and in that time has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're handing out to you today councillors a copy of the book city pride civic trust which bears test me to the advocacy role played by the civic trust we take pride in our past efforts however the crisis Civic trust is notably absent from the list of stakeholders in the development of a new spatial plan for the botanic gardens on page 9 of the report and from the list of interested parties where absent which were who were consulted we would prefer to be invited into the discussion tent rather than have to find an unzip and opening in order to be party to the discussions on such an important christchurch asset at our invitation Andrew Rutledge from the council made a presentation to our board last Tuesday which was much appreciated Tim Hogan our secretary on behalf of the Christ aesthetic trust made a submission to the Heron subcommittee in 2006 one of some forty groups of which probably about 30 were NGOs submitting out of a turtle of 597 submitters with this question civic trust perhaps the only one with a broad perspective of the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if the authors of the current special plan consider historical submissions leading to the 2007 hagley park botanic gardens master plan are still relevant and that there is no need to open the current special plan proposals to full-scale public scrutiny we the crisis of a trust do not really except that that is procedure is right and proper in law reports that you receive from the committee on March the first that all he should have been consulted have been consulted under the confirmation of statutory compliance we 're missing we weren 't consulted if we are so insignificant well we 'll pack up and total off but I don 't think that really is the case maybe it 's an oversight but we believe that ticking that box was probably a little cavalier the also the significant status given to the plan on that box that you 're taking foot based on the consultation already done which of course did not include us or the more recently as I 'm making that point there has been as the previous speaker to you an enormity of disruption and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven of the last laps 10 years since 2007 which warrants a broad public re-engagement and we would say not limited to a crisis city council selected reference group it 's got to go wider than that furthermore Hagley Park has now been formally recognized as a heritage area in the Heritage listings incorporated into the replacement district plan at the insistence of the independent hearings panel following the compelling evidence presented at the revised district plan hearings but resisted by council staff because it will possibly inhibit maximizing the years of the park as desired by the crown in any manner the council 's forfeit now or in the future given that attitude the public have caused to be concerned and therefore we wish to scrutinize closely various initiatives for the park as a whole and by implication the Botanic Gardens which perversely is not covered by the overall heritage status of Hagley Park the question civic Trust is also where as are many members of the public of the Botanic Gardens maintenance standards have fallen it appears to us that the botanic gardens are sadly underfunded and under-resourced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rose garden full of black spot speaks volumes on the maintenance resource deficit the few cannot fulfill the need and must despair professionally for want of a more generous staff complement before embarking on major renovations and capital works projects over a period of time from now into the future will say the first call on a council funding for the patinack gardens needs to be focused on the human resources needed to maintain and improve the presentation standards for the existing spatial out a botanic garden of this substance in the garden city of christchurch needs to be well equipped to perform its scientific and curator role we support that function receiving commensurate funding a botanic gardens of significance is the venue for education and understanding whilst it would provide pleasure for visitors simply walking sitting and contemplative reviewing the variant spaces it is not designed to be a playground that we question the need for substantial modifications to the children 's playground area in the Botanic Gardens as the Margaret my family playground has been created recently and provides very high standards for a central city Civic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spatial reference group education for young and old on matters botanical is a function expected of a top-notch botanic garden but creating secret places for children to play and not be observed as a very questionable objective with visibility comes safety the botanic gardens need strong advocacy for its ongoing protection and development things that go on outside the boundaries of the gardens will have impacts for instance there will be a dominating presence of a new cdhb acute services building which required a land swap and easement affecting the gardens access to the gardens from hagley park and use of hagley park for access and parking for the gardens means there are cross border around the key that have to be managed sympathetically having a world-class botanic garden that exports as ax access problems into the neighboring heritage status hagley park potentially causing degradation within hagley park is not a matter to be treated lightly the question civic trust therefore wishes to see the crisis city council as an administrative Authority for the botanic gardens and hagley park we established the former high maintenance and presentation standards the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money on this very important public facility to assured receives many visitors who praised it and allows citizens to engage at this stage the developments the botanic gardens special plan before any major projects are undertaken and to keep the consultative door open for crashes citizens and interest groups to have their say sufficient to accept civic ownership of the spatial plan Thank You pinky and we 've just got a very short pier time got a minute right Aaron yeah well the cynic trust be submitting on the annual plan on the budget 's around and the maintenance budgets around the boat tentacle gardens I didn 't quite catch the question sorry I will you be submitting on the annual plan which is open now on increasing the maintenance budgets around the boat tentacle gardens our ball bit does tuesday and we didn 't have enough time to consider that but we make we probably if i 'm saying we haven 't got it limited that we 're going to do that but we might well do it yes I 'll encourage you to do so at last question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always present in the gardens you know I can remember back in my youth where there were lots of staff in the in the Botanic Gardens and they were doing going through apprenticeship roles with the head gardeners we don 't seem to have them these days I would they come through lincoln university or utter the polytek do you think we would they come from I have no idea where they came from you just know what they do no I think that 's something we should really look at picking up on anyway because it 's a good training ground and it 's good use of resource thank you oh good thank you both very much and will replace you with them staff and moved to item 11 Botanic Garden spatial plan thank you,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

New Zealand",1673,right now I would like to invite Matt bonus who 's got a PowerPoint presentation as part of the public forum a five-minute presentation I think staff have told you that we 've removed some of the slides from your presentation just in terms of the yeah and you understand that yep I 'm we based it on legal advice in terms of the privacy measures can we put something else on the faces if we if we can get it just glued rather than mopped up yeah thank you thank you view time this morning oh this brief as I can I 'm supported by a number of residents long-standing residents in the community and also by Duncan we 've legal counsel my name is Matt bonus of lamb lived on the corner of Manchester and purchase street with my wife and two children since easter 2010 now I 'm prior to the earthquake Gordon in February 2011 there was never any street bay-based prostitutes and this purely residential area our first deputation to the coast of city council was in november two thousand eleven now i want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here to beg prostitution don 't none of the residents are at all it 's been legitimized by the PRA where I am advocating is that we have an unregulated 24 hour a day commercial activity operating outside our homes and a purely residential Europe you don 't commercial activities in New Zealand a subject to responsibilities be that location and also requirements in terms of the they 're offset they need to offset the impacts so what is the commercial activity that we actually face look like and again some of the slides have been edited as the mayor said this morning that just identifies this is 16 in the morning we 've got three prostitutes on the corner so this is the slides are gone it effectively it 's one from genuine 15th it 's six thirty in the morning in fabric 16 at six o 'clock in the morning prostitution in our neighborhood isn 't solely on nighttime activity there 's a preschool established a few doors away from us on Manchester Street an early morning soliciting is not uncommon as kids travel to the preschool fictive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weave through the activities there are plenty of children in our neighborhood including our children and I 've been living with street prostitutes outside the bedroom window for the last six years when the prostitutes moved in they bought a range of paraphernalia with them so it 's not just the girls themselves it 's the activities that go with it now this is the kind of rubbish our kids need to avoid outside our gate we found needles use needles and our hedges and sanitary wipes in our leader box construction workers on neighboring houses of here to remove used condoms from inside homes that they 're repairing and they 'll also stepped on used needles several neighbors including ourselves have found feces on their lawn and properties have been interred and willfully damaged there though recent photos in terms of little lift outside our neighborhood and the one on the far right a enterprising young lady bought with her a table the slide did show a gentleman sitting in a car who 's been there on a regular basis the six league it 's not as the girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decent inside vehicles outside a house day and night they know when were home they know when we 're not and this information has assisted prostitutes in their associates and targeting properties for damage and burglary one neighbors even caught on camera a prostitute informing her associates when he 'd lift the house and her associate 's subsequently injured this property and completely trashed at stealing anything of value they haven 't at the end of last year unfortunately the footage of this incident wasn 't a to bring a prosecution another neighbor had his work van damage when you refuse to move it from outsiders property think of other girls will do because they like the line of sight the prostitute felt the van impudent and P did the view for passing clients and threatened to damages van and when you came outside the following morning sure enough it had been trashed do it large deeds put into it with a rock the examples go on essentially they 're not good law-abiding people and the fact that they have difficult lives and vulnerabilities doesn 't justify a require us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene essentially this is from right outside our house there 's two prostitutes working on the intersection now what this picture doesn 't convey is the release that 's generated essentially they call out to each other from across the road they compare prices they compare clients they fend off difficult pump pumps or customers or sing in yell and Russell was telling me on the drive through this morning that there was a dispute two nights ago when a client hadn 't paid essentially two o 'clock in the morning mess of argument right outside his property this keeps our kids awake night after night and with try calling the police essentially initially the response was good at the police now don 't even bother sending anybody the neighbors don 't even bother ringing in terms of recent survey activity this is februari of this year so every time there 's a color arm that identifies the presence the ones and read where this particular disturbance either it 's working the kids up or there 's a large argument or something going outside the ones in blue is essentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is March and similar level of activity so look I think even the survey the prostitutes collective who identified which is only on a Tuesday shows that there 's a lot of activity that 's dear just saying look there 's a girl standing outside the corner doesn 't convey the level of nuisance and ongoing disturbance for the resonance of this community have to contend with this perhaps does so essentially we 've got five commercial businesses operating from each corner that footage is taken from a security camera that the community board Conley put up for us for a while now temporary basis to see if it could catch our behavior it doesn 't [Music] now what the slide showed is essentially why it 's a commercial activity there 's lots of variety in the sickness the prostitutes come in a variety of gender shapes and sizes sometimes it 's hard to tell whether that they are prostitutes some are barely dressed at all a number actually reveal themselves to passing motorists the fundamentally it 's not the point this is a commercial activity that operates at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now we 've pleaded with elected members police and the prostitutes collective and we 've taken legal advice and that advices the council has the ability not only to take action but the responsibility to do so and essentially that 's what we 're asking of you today we 're asking you please do the right thing and use the powers that you have available to particular essential areas we 've tried all the alternatives encouragement we 've asked nicely and we 've been threatened and vandalized we 've called the police complaints line as I said before that I 've seen anyone nobody rings anymore there 's no point we 've called 111 and November 2016 my wife and children actually threatened inside the house by a couple of prostitutes and the polluted of complete complaint was lodged eventually after no one turned up the police complaint report from the authority states as this as a public space the officers were unable to forcibly move the woman from the area CCTV camera was also put in as well that 's seen just as infrastructure to support the girls actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind it so what 's the correct response on the public places boil or section three interpretation defines commercial activities not only is trading the actual exchange of money but also the advertising of services section six is that no person shall undertake commercial activity in a public place and section 13 allows the council to specify which areas are appropriate and need licenses and which areas don 't it 's not a wholesale being we 're not asking for that we 're not even slightly suggesting it and how do we know that they 're advertising or by their presence the soliciting of the clients from a street location by mobile phone and all directly and deliberately attracting the attention of passing motorists and do we start the actual activity and we have written a servicing of clients in the public realm a number of neighbors have interrupted them servicing clients on private property and full public view this is what 's happening in our residential area so in summary and we 've hit such years of this these continual noise letter and trespass me putting slides up doesn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's done float as the police say look and you can you stop it for a bit it disappears then it comes back again it 's like it 's unlikely to now of its own accord with hit six years of this and we 're asking for action and we suggested the council has the authority and the responsibility to address these issues and thank you very much for your time okay,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Johns Ambulance it 's the social welfare agencies everyone who comes together in a time of emergency those people are together the way they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make that point because I think we 're often quick to form judgments about particular approaches that have been adopted and it 's really important that we have a bi that the line on on the ion continual improvement but it 's really important that we acknowledge what a significant contribution that all of these people make to the security of our city and times of emergency when I live the defense force out as well because that they 're also play a really important role it 's always important as part of an and Ben to review what 's happened as part of that continuous quality improvement approach but I want to again make a point about reviews because we 've conducted a review of the tsunami warning that was issued as a result of the heroic ikura earthquake and that will be released very soon at some almost complete we 've had our feedback from dem and from our own group in terms of civil defense responses and I just think that it 's really important to think about the purpose of these reviews they are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand looking back to understand understand what 's occurred in order to improve the way things are approached in the future that 's why you review and that 's why we want to have that conducted in an environment that continues to acknowledge people operating and the way civil defense does in a in an emergency and also acknowledging the fact that there are thousands of civil defence volunteers from one end of the country to the other and we want people to continue to volunteer for those roles and and I think so that 's why it 's important that we always learn from our experiences and we can 't we can 't change what has occurred but we can always create meaning out of out of any disaster and create opportunity as well that being said we 'll probably be back to recognize the recovery if the recovery planning process is going exceptionally well but we also our hearts can go out family who have experienced lost and also to those who 've lost their homes and others who 've experienced loss in other ways we really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long journey for a number of those people before the recovery is able to be achieved but again looking for opportunity the opportunity and the portholes to reinstate something that is really special to New Zealand and especially heartfelt by the people of Christchurch in terms of what the regeneration opportunities will be in there the area as well so Darren I 'm sorry that you 've had to me rave on but I just I think it is important that we remind ourselves what civil defenses but you guys we 're so proud of you and and that 's a message from every single one of us sitting around the table and I know very grateful City so thank you very much,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Engagement,2fMIROgbIZE,20170322,2165.47,"Christchurch, New Zealand",6214,amex somethin all right okay so the next item is the draft cranford regeneration plan approval for community engagement and given that this has been largely Richard you can come forward because we 're on to cranford yes that 's right that 's right cranford regeneration and so I 'm happy to move this and do I have a seconder for it Mike so are there any questions for staff Glenn I can hear you going I can give you okay so it 's obviously beyond the problematic lane my question is why and this follows the previous discussion in my view that we 've just had over land supply so advanced that the Lance play question yes I do understand the connectivity with that part of the city it looks quite beneficial but do we really need to do it when we 've got plenty of land at the moment for residential development yeah that 's a that 's a good question actually I guess the first thing I 'd say is that that the great Christchurch regeneration actors is not about land supply so that was one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the district plan review and so that the Act doesn 't seek see that has been an issue it 's about regeneration so it 's not a bit land supply so second question is I think what we 've seen post-quake has you know this dispersed land use pattern increasing the amount of Greenfield priority areas coming to the market and a lot of growth and those sorts of locations on the northwest and southwest of Christchurch in particular and also out to sell when and why Meg what this location offers to us which is different to that while technically greenfield priority area is its location and close proximity to a key activity center and and that 's not just a mall you know you have other facilities there such as a pro and con Don Center you also got strategic transport routes in close proximity as well as a motorcycle way you 've got the the PT route running up main north road and into pepper nui as well as the super stop the outside the mall so in terms of its location it is far better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're looking to develop on the outskirts of Christchurch and the other benefits you get from this as well put inside the difficult geotechnical and other challenges as the fact that because you got reasonably large lot sizes it enables you rather than the info we are really just getting an extra dwelling on our you know on a single lot that enables you to develop it comprehensively and get a better urban design outcomes so that 's one of the real benefits you get from this location and from the work that we did is par the district plan review we don 't think there 's any other location and around christchurch which is as good as this from that perspective so locationally great but there are other challenges which you alluded to around geotech hydrogeology at those such things I think if I may ask I 'm just thinking too in terms of uptake so I can see that the benefits is also at least one dis benefit and that is in relation to the northern arterial what would be the uptake is already qe2 running through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a motorway system like it hmm so so the main area of where land council remember this is only proving this to go out for consultation so it 's not approving it per se it 's only seeking public comment so the main area of land that if approved this would enable residential rounders around grasmere so that 's not so much an issue for the northern arterial although there 's more localized transport issues that need to be addressed there the other one is what we 've called the crosier Croesus roadblock and that is in proximity to what we 're suggesting as a as part of the controls for this as an overall cap on the number of dwellings that you would get in there so that would limit the impact you 'd have on those things but I guess that the overall question the overall issue in relation to transport if the growth doesn 't go here it 's got to go somewhere so you really shifting the problem from one location to another location and from our perspective it 's better to have the growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to locations where the only choices as a private motor vehicle and the issue with that is that it 's often single occupancy private motor vehicles so but here you 've got choices such as major cycle routes and public transport and thank you for the report so my question is around the suitability of this land for building is there much difference between this land in the land that was deemed red zone after the earthquakes in terms of a geological I just I wouldn 't mind knowing say but look can you answer it from the generic point of view because it 's just not possible to ask staff to compare two pieces of land when they haven 't got geotechnical report sitting in front of them we have had some technical studies done and from our perspective we while the land as geo technically challenging as there are also hydrogeological issues there as well what we are saying is we think it 's good to go in terms of rezoning and that doesn 't mean that further work doesn 't need to be done particularly at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that that 's not normal though so this isn 't new this is stuff that we have to address all the time we know what the challenges are and we 're far better spacing them for other parts of town where perhaps we hadn 't done that the liberal detail in terms of investigation so but you can only really answer those questions when you know where the houses are going to go and what sort of houses you 're looking to put on there so it 's very difficult to us to get into the entry of detail on geotechnical and other matters when we don 't know what the development forum is going to look like because all this does is enable development it doesn 't require it and we 're not down to the stage we know what houses are going where the reason that I kind of intervened is that there is a misunderstanding that the red zone decision was solely about the land it was actually how the land had been built on which was some problematic unreinforced concrete slab foundations on the edge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a good idea but that was what was allowed to occur this won 't be allowed to occur here so you know I mean no susceptibility to infection natural spread all of those issues will be dealt with at the geotechnical level I think perfect I think the question that that that I wanted to ask was what changes will have to be made in order to make this land even considered for development to the regional policy statement to our district plan and what other mechanism would do this in a relatively short space of time if it goes other then through a regeneration plan it 's a couple of things I think the regeneration plan will put it put a semi on the report which essentially says we can 't promote public plan changes until 20 21 this land is outside the urban limits for the regional policy statement Environment Canterbury are looking to review that but they are probably not going to finish that until 20 23 2024 so you 're getting up to ten years time if you don 't use this process and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at reviewing its district plan so the Christian Council would go do we want to do separate plan changes will run the middle reviewing our district plan will probably not that process might take five or so years so if it 's not promoted all other things staying the same if it 's not done through this process you probably look looking at not having risen residential development and to around 20 25 20 30 or even beyond for between 35 so this is the only process at the moment that is available to us to enable residential development to occur around cranford basin area and is something has to change in the future and and where has this come from like who is the proponents are sort of proposed this conference we have the weather proponent essentially what we went through his counsel resolved to do this last year we prepared an outline which were reported to you at the end of last year that was approved and gazetted and January and we describe that loosely as the entree before the main course went out the main course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for notification in there is no dessert sorry to inform you there 's no dessert but but but this this is really put it out for public comment that the key fundamental decision for council as if you do approve for public comment would be on the twenty-third of May and when we bring it back to you for approval to then give it to regenerate Christchurch and now regenerate Christchurch might further change it before they send it to the minister and if they are to change it substantially then it would have to be circulated to the section 29 parties and we refer to those early in the week has been DPM see he can I Tahu regenerate Christchurch and oetiker oh thank you very good I fell Pauline Yanni so your food to the hydrology of the area before Richard end I just me what I asked like my understanding cream if I 'm wrong is it in fact the current infrastructure would cope with any future flooding of this wider area and some of that 's been currently improved right now but that my question really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is likely to be large sections and is that is there a way that council will have of ensuring that that happens as a way of also i guess mitigating the facile to run off and that kind of thing I want trying to Barris myself by are throwing the hydrogeology type questions i 'll leave that to Graham but in terms of the section sizes that that 's what we 're seeking to enable was medium density and close proximity to the mall itself and within that makes use from a land-use perspective assuming that the the applicant for the resource and building consents can come up with a suitable foundation design so it would be medium density and around that area some of the areas which have greater constraints will more likely be of a a large lot type scenario so it 's more reading and medium density development but gran would you like to give a bit of an overview just of the storm water and other matters immediately downstream from this particular area we have our large krempe Basin area which is has been thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many years and as a part of this whole project if we do these this work now then it can be accommodated reason easily in that large area downstream Pauline yawning I 'm was really following along from Phil 's as well but when you say this land is not really suitable for building on if you 're not looking at in an ex of a physical building the house but for me I 'm concerned about coping with the stormwater and it 's not just the houses that will be some roading in here to service those houses and 420 houses is what we 're kind of looking at so that that 's a concern to me and particularly in an perhaps a storming vent so we would all get water go because I don 't know would that detention basin be big enough to accommodate a little bit because we are putting another pump in there am i right and it will pump to the short answer is yes the detention facility can be managed to accommodate the additional input from that area that is very large area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that storage volume they 've done the modeling yes that weather has been modeling dunning of potential developments around there but it 's a relatively minor part minor part of the total catchment which goes into that area the catchment for the year begins away up at Bishop Dahl well I mean it takes arguably bishop dale has caused a lot of the issues and there anyway it was what people say historically at the trouble began because we didn 't put an appropriate you know still missionary as for additional pumps the there 's not a plan to have additional pumps there is there is a plan to do some automation there to make sure that pumping from the plockton Basin area can be accommodated with priority and some additional storage used in krempe basins to balance that out so let 's see what I 'm concerned about too is our the future RPX costs at move east on council so they surely they must be reasonably high I can 't kill me on that it would be up something like a parkland area sorry major wetland and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on into the future okay in the other concern I have is the transport impacts so we 've already got see a lot of those houses will probably not take up a new road because it 'll be a bus priority but they 'll take cranford street down to town so that 's another the northern arterial it 'll be ditional traffic impacts some of it will be part of the Resource Center it will come up so we 've done some work as part of this and as part of this proposal when we 've had the traffic assistant house and we 're comfortable that we can address the impacts that 's part also the reason for the 420 kept that we 're suggesting be incorporated within the provisions so but but i guess the difference with this is that the growth has to go somewhere either goes here or goes further out all goes in the you know AB cell when I 'm why me so the impacts of the additional traffic need to land some we were on our network and the benefit of them landing here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got the same issue we talked about highfield just a minute ago and we talked about the East frame in other areas and you know I think the question for me is a bit like beyond here is the Y here you know particularly I don 't really think this is a great area to be developing personally but why here but that was the question to ask when we actually agreed to do this you know that was the decision that council make the council made the decision to develop a a draft cranford regeneration plan and is part of the regeneration process it now goes out for public engagement and this document that has that we 're being asked to sign off on today actually establishes all of the issues that have been raised in the question so they talk about the challenges of the environment but they also talk about it being an opportunity to create close to existing residential form a very well constructed and developed and sensitive to the environment place in a in a popular place it is zoned rural fringe I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fringe royan from rural urban fringe I mean in the middle of the city I mean it 's it 's it 's an anomaly within the city the basin is absolutely a no-go area we 're talking about the land around this is actually contains a lot more information than I 've ever seen before and which gives me no pause for caution but also which means you want to review the original decision then yeah well I don 't think they 'd be much uptake for there but we 've also got to be clear what we 're doing here we public we 're putting this out for public notification so it 's not consultation or engagement and because it 's a region process there 's there 's not as much opportunity for people to really feedback in such a way as they would if it was a consultation we 're hearing that 's my concern three men jeer we we have undertaken some pre-notification engagement with some of the key stakeholders in the area we 've been to the community board and some of the schools and others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've notified for a month and we would manage that process with some and there 'll be droppin sessions and public open days so in that sense it 's not different to what we 'd normally do but you 're right the process doesn 't allow for or we haven 't proposed a hearing or a formal process at the end so that is different to what you 'd normally get under a first schedule plan change under the Resource Management Act some sectors of the community that won 't be happy with it because they will have an opportunity to make a submission honor yeah and and that will come back to us as a council as a whole Oh Johnny I understand why this area like I guess the thing that seems to be missing from from the plan that I can 't find as how we address the social and affordable aspect of the housing and I did wonder whether you know we seem to have a real issue with green fields and that there 's no requirement for affordable apart from I think Aratere affordable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's happening as we grow as a city we see a higher concentration of social housing and specific areas that 's historic and an intensification and then so the other areas we don 't see any development of that housing choice for social or possibly affordable housing so I just wondered if there was anything that we could put in here that talked about it I know it Queenstown they talked about the community should gain you know the private gain from the developers is that they get rural land changed into residential and there 's a uplift and for them and the community should also get something in terms of a gain in terms of that rezoning through you know greater affordability so is it anything that we can put in today that would enable us to consider that yeah I don 't think there is much we can do about that and because the costs of this development are going to be higher than probably most other areas because of the remediation of the land is required and the building standards that need to be met i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vary in terms of their costs the this would be one of the more expensive ones to develop because of the earthworks and the development that we need to go through so it 's pretty unrealistic I think to expect what we call affordable housing and its location when we look at the demographic profiles out there that the house prices are already at a level which you know we wouldn 't call put many affordable range for quite a bit of that catchment area what we have managed to do though and we 've been talking to the landowners and potential developers to get them to consider a choice of housing type ologies and the in the 140 so that the 420 housing will that will actually have some lower end housing inner but there won 't be what you called the Affordable in but they 'll be probably within the range of say a first home by using kiwisaver to get a ten percent deposit or something like that but it 's not going to be this well it 's the council decides to intervene or a SRO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housing and I suppose it won 't be at that sort of lower end of the Affordable area because of those costs okay so does the size of the section have an issue with that too because I mean you can get you can get affordable housing when you 've got the the higher densities but not so much necessarily when you 've got the larger sections which is this medium density the large sections are talking about the half acre sections which will resound around this area they 're very expensive and popular because there are lifestyle blocks within an urban context so that those ones will be expensive the medium density will help to moderate the price I think and and but we are seeking a good quality housing it 's we are seeking up near life mark and Home Star standards for this and as part of the regeneration and innovative housing constantly trying to push but yeah the end of the day those houses aren 't going to be at the lower end of the marca that I think so if people made submissions to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something that can be addressed through the notification process yes I think we could have a look at that again but I wouldn 't promise you would necessarily get a different house he makes but it 's certainly a valid consideration and one would need to consider again if people make submissions on all right so it 's been moved and seconded so is there any discussion I 'll put that motion I 've got some problems with it so actually I know it 's a procedural matter but the outstanding outstanding writer who issues relation to what you like in what I sensors a mismatch over the promotion of affordability being a main theme in the housing policy aren 't sitting right for me there 's also the land supply total that we have in the city I do take on board the facets of linkage with that area I know the area very well they used to work there for nine years but it 's I I 'm just not convinced and i know this is about consultation then again it 's not usual consultation as per the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue over night are you working that through so it 's just not over the life for me and that 's why i 'll vote against it today and down and then Pauline David um I just want to sort of I don 't actually know what to do with this one particularly well because I I 'd see the end goal of you know what we 're trying to achieve do but at the same time I just I just have a real struggle this soon after the earthquakes looking at building back on areas like this when we 've got a whole central city that 's got a whole lot of area that needs to be developed and we 've got a we 've been reported that we 've got an excess of houses so we 've got so many buildings and p.m. houses and stuff like that and we don 't not sort of intensification the the central city and when we 're looking at the hydraulic hydrology issues here I just kind of feel as I was kind of like what Bixley was really and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I 've been thinking about don 't don 't tisk that that was just what I 've been thinking about over the last few years I mean nights about this and it does set a precedent in my opinion for redeveloping red zone areas and doing regeneration plans on that so if we do this for you know for this type of land here then what 's stopping the argument from people saying oh well they 're doing it for that why can 't we do this for the red zone you know and redevelop on the areas there are we going to be looking at that in the future or not I don 't know that 's what region eric christchurch i mean to be doing but yeah i just decode some of those issues around the stormwater runoff and the transport and everything like that and we would we 've got some major problems around there we still haven 't got those night oh ho issues sorted out but yeah my big thing he is just taking away housing development putting it over to there when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas that we 've got on the central city and who 's actually going to profit out of this yeah well I 'm an agreement with some council Livingston and councillors wigs on this one and we 've got an area that I think is very challenging there 's a lot of new information that 's come to me since we originally asked to look at this and particularly around the geotech and the hydrological conditions of the land and night ah who is a big concern and we see in the report the in 4.9 that the thing discussions have been head but no resolution has been found yet now we could be looking at something like shades of our car are here and the cost that we could be facing to to have these negotiations sort of to come to a resolution or no resolution and keep trying to find a resolution for years and years I 'm not comfortable taking that risk on this so due to the new information that I 've just been reading up on doubtless I 'm not comfortable so I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I something but are David thank you I 'm totally in support of this resolution because these parcels of land have been the subject of attempts to for rezoning for years and years and years we went and tried to deal with this issue through the lirc process couldn 't get it through we can 't deal with it under the district plan provisions at the moment for some time we have been cogitating over this for years and years and years and I think this regeneration plan has been very thorough and I believe that it 's an opportunity to put this problem behind us and move on yes there are one or two little issues that we will have to resolve going forward councillor Livingston has raised some with drainage but I believe most of these other other items have been touched on or can be addressed as we move forward with this as I said at the outset we have been tinkering with this for years and years and years and this is the great opportunity to get it across the line and move on and deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be supporting this motion thoroughly and I urge others to do so please here thank you and just a couple of things I wasn 't going to speak but in response to a couple of things I 've heard one about the the lake of to lower end housing and affordability in on that I would say it 's better to have housing been no housing especially when we 're looking at trying to intensify in building areas that are more suitable closer to public transport closer to the city in the long-term benefits of that the more we 're able to provide the lease the the costs are going to go you know increase significantly over time when it comes to the the type of leaned I think we 're in a different situation to Pixley end to other other red zone areas mainly because people will be going into this with their eyes completely wide open a new building technologies that have been advanced especially since the earthquakes the majority of us if you have a look at the map on page 9 the large green area the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space in stormwater management area that 's it 's not housing and and will be in will be used night there and so I 'm really happy for us to go out to the public consultation I do have some concerns over the night oh ho thing but I think that that 's something that can be worked through and needs to your work through overtime Annie yeah thank you I just I just wanted to make a similar point although you know I think the key thing today is to put this out for notification I think if people really don 't like it once once I 've heard back from the community and this is the normal process engagement process consultation process for a region plan so I think that it 's not that much different to a district plan and you had the opportunity to hear from people whether it 's concern around the environment concerned around affordability and the social and environmental outcomes versus the economic uplands outcomes i think is a really important question and it 's something that i really look forward to but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know that the logic in terms of being a sustainable study is actually to put and I think housing where we 've got good infrastructure and good facilities not to keep spending a huge amount of money 400 million in growth expenditure going out further north further west or south west when you 've got areas like this that actually could be developed and although the individual costs may be high in terms of the land and I would expect that they 're listen from bexley is that it 's how you actually design on the ground or in the hills for example where we 've had subdivisions going all the way up the hills and I expect that we will be having a really good conversation not just the geotech risk of rock fall but also fire has it given what 's happened so it 's actually it 's how you build on these areas that have got risks and how you mitigate those risks or avoid those risks that as a key thing and I think we can work through the notification process on those issues so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have about rejecting this today I think the important thing is to hear from people over the merits of this plan and until we 've done that I I personally don 't feel in a position to be able to say it 's a bad idea but you know I will signal that the issue of simply allowing people that own property to get resigned and have a huge financial gain while at the same time a community not being able to afford housing or not having in social housing being able to be developed in these areas there 's something that concerns me greatly and it 's something I 'm going to be very mindful of as as we go through this process so but fundamentally there 's been a huge amount of work done to get to this point I think the public and the community deserve to have this notified and then I think it comes back to us to make that final judgment and Andrew thank you and Yanni has said almost everything I was about to say in fact we need to take account of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account of the amount of work that 's been done to date the decision we 're making today is simply to go out for engagement as a part of the process and looking at the end of paragraph 2.1 the council decision following the notification written comments and engagement will be of higher significance so we get the benefits of that feedback from the community and the ability to take all of that into account and then make further decisions on this and I think there 's significant risk in going this far down the track with a regeneration plan and in fact this early in the history of regeneration plans as well and then at this meeting indicating that we may not be comfortable with the original decision we made to be the proponents of this regeneration plan I think we we need to go to the next stage we need to allow for this engagement to occur in terms of the issues that have been raised in the comparisons with other parts of the city we number of ways of dealing with that clearly there 'll be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are any number of engineering capabilities that are available now that weren 't a number of years ago all of that will be taken into account in terms of any building that occurs on here and of course we 're dealing with that part of this area which is expected to be capable have been built on using that geotech engineering and those engineering techniques we 're not talking about the actual basin itself so clearly there 's more work needs to be done around geotech around drainage and around building techniques I 'm confident that all of that can happen but the decision that we 're making today is whether to go out for engagement or not and in my view there 's no question about the fact that we should and allow this to regress the next station Michael Mike thank you I 'm going on formal today well I think yannis did everything and really well I one thing I would like to add is obviously when we talk about trying to intensify the central city I think it 's a it is a different type of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a net type of housing so this area which it is already houses in and we 're talking about the friends were not actually talking about in the basin which I think so there 's a big difference in anyone that does know the earring goes past it it is right on the edge of our urban development and it needs to be sorted because it 's not the most attractive place to be and we 've got a really good opportunity there to actually have someone develop that into a really nice housing area and we can 't keep losing our residents to the Y McCrory area and to sell one because of the type of houses they have there so we can 't actually lit opportunities like this go and this is purely just agreeing to go out for public engagement it is not agreeing that the plan will go ahead thank you yeah I was going to give a great big long speech but it 's 1207 and not all I 'll say is that I agree with everything that Jonnie see gone smile okay i 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposed say no that 's carried noes are recorded

Fund,aY6QeJl9ibw,20170322,905.62,"Christchurch, New Zealand",2642,very much next okay item is the housing infrastructure fund all right where is it page 1 600 19 right of it sorry just ready to start we 're just waiting for the staff but this he hits this this hasn 't gone through a smutty know so I 've got what up are these stuff coming up because I can move on up and do another item and come back to it if people read questions oh let 's see if we if we get if we get to a point where witches can 't be answered or can be so Bucky and then ref this has come up at the Metro Amir 's meeting like that you see me up to and there there issue for all the council 's was the same one as we had in terms of the debt and where it sets on whose balance sheet so because that 's an issue for every council I suspect this may be an issue that gets resolved and the minister was there looking at some means of resolving if there wasn 't going to be an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advise that when unlikely to get it out I mean there 's only a number of cities that can apply for it if that was not going to be an issue and it was able to be resolved would you wish to apply for it we 've we put an initial application through a 61 million of that you have got only a living of that in the annual plan at this point in time so there 's 50 that is unfunded of infrastructure the feedback that we 've got is that there are so many other projects in the pipeline that give a better return not in Christchurch obviously but in other areas that it 's over subscribed and we would be very very unlikely to get it the other issue that we 've got it say it 's from mb staff it 's no Rick that is from MV Staffa correct and there may be some issues about the morning to spread money around the all the metros the other issue is something that sorry the qualifying their trophy there 's only a few that qualities yep and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period than what we would pay back and so the initial cost of repay my you 're not paying any interest they 're actually will cost us more because we have to pay it back quicker so we emit early at the end of the day it costs the community less because you 're not paying interest but in this fortunate in 10 year period because we are normally borrowing and not sure if I 've got any financial accountant here because we 're borrowing over 25 years rather than over 10 years that makes a difference in the amount you have to repack even though we were only paying back principal you go with a breath we have we haven 't got an application in what we 've got is a we put in what were the likely projects that meet their criteria and that was they went through I think in that paper 29th of october i have in there november okay 61 year right yeah kind of following on from Vicki 's question I mean I remember when this came out I said that it wouldn 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I 'm interested in item 3.5 where mb makes it clear that the funding would be a subordinate loan to be repaid within 10 years now I remember we had this conversation at the local government means home last year sometime and i said to the minister you know there is a way of actually structuring this so that it doesn 't sit on couches balance sheets they never came back to me on that but i just want it has there been any conversations about that that you 've heard they 're heavily conversations about that and the advice and again i don 't have and here is there 's absolutely no way we can have that as a liability but not have been on our balance sheet it 's so yeah I know how you can structure it no they are structuring it so it doesn 't have to go on to their balance sheet but they cannot structure in such a way that can 't come onto our balance my eyes and that 's the 10-year cycle so they they are looking at that because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example Hamilton who want to apply for a lot have got that they would love to but there it puts their debt levels way beyond what the local government phone its lending organization will offer to co2 so this will not be an issue that is just for Christchurch it will be city and country wide with the possible protection of queens down so i 'm wondering if we don 't perhaps put in an application on our terms ignoring largely what in b star for saying and just say if we can do it this way we 're happy to if we can 't and it 's got to sit on our debt and we have to patent 10 years go away to two things yes you we could do that we could say look the you would need to come up with a mechanism that it doesn 't end up on our balance sheet and somehow and i 'm not quite sure again not being an accountant how that would work but it 's if only we could so sorry the Revkin wraps up with ya and secondly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 25 the issue that you 've got 25 years but the issue that you 've got also is that we haven 't got the biggest project of those we haven 't got 50 million of that sitting in our annual plan at this point in time because we 've seen it a hub capital program has got a higher priority so we would then have to bring that into our annual plan if they said yes but no but if we will bring it into our annual plan with the same payback period and at a zero interest rate then there are benefits aunt Leah to do that work it would accelerate that work you would still have to find 50 million time 25 which two million a year to actually pay that principal repayment to him yeah um so yeah yeah just had a question around 3.4 which we 've been told that for the number of new houses was low and the cost of infrastructure was high and that was another reason that was given so I mean I think it 's important to understand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promote the Highfield residential development the head of infrastructure currently programmed but what 's the need in terms of the city for having that housing developments occur like do we need that housing development now is there any assessment around why that 's why we would want to bring that forward those are the major development areas that we would identify potentially of limited by infrastructure no we wouldn 't necessarily mean that that area was then developed or anything like that we couldn 't put a proviso on there but it would mean that it was not limited by infrastructure and that was the purpose of this fund so that if people were now ready to develop didn 't get limited by infrastructure but in terms of the bigger picture like we 've got you know the colombo street side nothing been built we 've got the east and frame slow progress we 've got cranford which we are they going through what what 's the like what 's them what i don 't understand the big picture in terms of why even as a council we would want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward the infrastructure for this area if we 've got existing supply and we 've possibly got an oversupply what we looked at when the original application came out it said what areas were limited by infrastructure it wasn 't actually a strategic video actually yeah if you put the infrastructure in wool housing come that 's totally different I 'm not sure Helen whether that 's your patch will not your picture whether you can identify sorry from a strategy and planning if we did develop the infrastructure would it be the catalyst of it I don 't have that answer I 'm sorry but I think actually asking another question which is actually a very sensible question which is would we want to encourage the building of of residential at the high field site ahead of anything else by bringing forward the infrastructure so it 's the other way around that I thank these questions direct and I think it 's a very good question this my time in my axle would be nice yeah I 'm I 'm stead of citing like yeah that 's the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case then the supplementary I hear that was the boys here anywhere else yeah well like if we 've already got money on budget for infrastructure for some of the growth areas and I 'm thinking of what possibly the southwest is there any financial benefit even if we 've got the money on budget by going through the government scheme and that 's I mean yeah because I mean it 's one of the area 's I mean obviously rekha Xiang has always been constrained but we 're doing the infrastructure now but are there other areas that would that would really open up an area for further development that would fit in with our our to the hub approach you know in terms of linking under weakness in putting the entire set of lead infrastructure anyway and so that 's why particularly around horse walls when I would develop you 've had we had the big development plan that went through and just as well we had it was done just before the earthquake and that 's being delivered pretty well your partnership with those developers yeah not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I appreciate that we 've currently I think we 've got a 400 million on for growth all I 'm asking is whether the government scheme that 's been offered if we could access any financial benefit from putting what we 've currently got funded for growth into that scheme we could put in an application for the 11 million that 's outside the Highfield part which is the two projects i think around corners drain in this water supply 60 that 's too I think those comprised of two small projects that make up that 16 and 15 million so we could still apply for that that 's in the annual play in bro whether we would get it or not because I would say it was reasonably but it would also VIN mean would pay it back over five over ten years rather than but we could put in the proviso but it would be just it would still be worthwhile doing very nicely sorry final question of cooker so we can 't currently fund we can 't put anything in the proposal that we currently have funded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we 've got those two projects but it 's got a big growth that limits development now I have to come back into the and so the infrastructure people have gone through and found the only projects could fit on that list made that 61 million because we have been like to say funding lead infrastructure so there was another living above the high field that not good i but that 's not why Highfields not Thank You Bella no no stable is there anything beyond desi livin well here other stuff in there my desires sorry the infrastructure engineer who went through that they did consult right across and they couldn 't identify in a thing that was not that was limiting that met the criteria the mvie put in it on there in their original draft conditionings my point is I think they 're going to be not sticking to the original draft because of the minister 's desire to get us across but my hunch is that and I didn 't realize that you could put on stuff that was already in your in your plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know additional long lists or whatever that that we could put in on top of that 11 million my understanding is those are the only projects they could find that met the criteria that they asked us for now whether they change the criteria and then we could relook at it that would be have you spoken to Hamilton and Auckland and Queenstown and cheat that they 'll stick into the same criteria as we are no rehabbing ok so we 've stuff to the criteria that mbie have given it we might be the only ones just if I 'm yeah sticking to the criteria you know I brought me out on this actually yeah so right I 've got you and then fell yeah this could be a bit slightly off beam but obviously the inference in all of this it 's about Aphra structure provision in local councils so are you aware of mb and all the Productivity Commission for motioning some work over to construction costs in the future near future no i 'm not i 'm not quite sure thank you thank you for leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say so just pass me by so I um this is cushion for Dave but but lien which we need to consider as a council to answer is a process from here because I 'd understand from your report that this we have to make the submission by the end of the month is obsidian or ya idiot that 's too much so with an indicative bit of business case which might be challenging so a song just wondering is there a way that perhaps the housing task force might fine-tune this before we actually saw an office assumption and well we don 't know that 's what this report recommends is that we don 't make a submission there 's been quite a few suggestions clearly around hell in fact there might be some other options that we should consider yeah I would be quite happy for the housing task force to have a look at this and and to delegate to them the powder and sign off on something a lot of joy finance involved yes okay yep all right so so can we receive the information the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the housing task force and the chair of Finance and that 's been moved Phil second good Pauline I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried that is good thank you,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

2016,KaerytV58nI,20170322,610.87,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1693,the party 's coming out of those committees so we 've got item ten the performance report for the six months to the 31st December and a memo has been circulated in advance with further information that was requested by the committee which was to be made available for this council meeting so that 's already been circulated let me just move to item 10 so the resolution is in front of us and the resolution for council in fact is just to receive the information in the report I 'm happy to move Tim 's having a second yawning okay um I just wanted to draw council 's attention to the Patsy issue in this performance report which is around that urgent report back on the maintenance levels of our roads footpaths parks and green space you 'll note that we have been failing on our levels of service for quite some time now and it has been a huge community concern both through the community boards and I think the council reporting so I think it 's really important that we do get that report and we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other thing I just wanted to mention was that um I think it would be really good to get that reporter on it is quite an improvement allowance and you know there 's a number of things that we 're seeing in terms of their repairs where we 're not getting the opportunity to do it properly and Heath gets written Wahlstrom is a great example and i think i 've seen councillors around some photos of that so yeah it would be really important I think just in terms of that report to ignores that we are getting those two things and hopefully that we can start to have a positive direction on the maintenance on the year the failing maintenance degrees great thank you just noting that that report on the maintenance is coming to the April meeting so that 's coming to the next meeting of this committee and I don 't doubt that it 'll be well debate it when it gets there and I 've now got questions from points from Glen and then Pauline thank you and my I have two questions mine are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so if we look at presidents page 55 at the top of the page over PT infrastructure remedial action refers to investigate which sections of this route most significantly contribute to the slow travel times determine opportunities to resolve is that the only remedial action we would take EG would we look at bus drivers using bus lanes and then the own the other question I have is over page 59 and this is to do with civil defense and emergent emergency management the question is around the yeah is this the only measure we would use in relation to that level of service and for CDM testing radios so yeah I just want to try and get behind some of these these measures for these levels of service wonder whether your henna response on those and if we wish to change them can we do can I make some comments first of all and help so what you see are exceptions so there are many many other measures around some of these things and things such as there are also mandatory measures so I think the radio and might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around investigating I mean it 's talks about investigating the slow areas and then looking for opportunities to improve so just so to think about bus using bus lanes and they 've all come from their investigation about we 're the slow junior okay that we 're also reviewing the performance measures so that they are actually more meaningful I guess if I wanted to anything to that would be yes colleagues quite correct lots of other civil defense measures around training and readiness and then the skills of civil defence volunteers the radio one is simply a basic equipment check measure each other okay do the radios working on the event of an emergency it 's good to know that just on first glass these are exceptions right okay so do you want me to go any further or so I happy with that fine thank you should I just go I 'm next I 've asked my dad yep you think 's and highly in I 'm page 49 only have the operating revenues for Council are higher than budgeted due to unchanged crowned contributions for 3 meters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unclean just I mean it 's Isis seem to remember and perhaps Dave you can promptly I seem to remember related to something in your area some money we received around three water 's that you weren 't expecting sorry Oh they 'll be okay yes I can send you an email after this I do know the oh you 're not sorry thank you that there was part of the discussions around some of the horizontal infrastructure entry waters where some of the products came in to meet the criteria are that we didn 't expect fun during their okay so as that this more nicely obviously we 're about three waters and also roading s suit comes to an inn but there is also an ongoing non school program as you 're aware as well which will continue post gear right so will we get some sort of a summary will let it when it 's all done it sure yeah that 'd be great Thank You Dion you my question is still related to a question asked before about the the increase in personnel costs looking like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was salaries were up mainly due to the IT part of it was going to be recovered by the capital program but what is it that I t is doing that 's actually causing this increase in costs from personnel is a big program of work on the way that I tia working on and add could possibly add more but there 's the High Council work that 's going on there 's aunt Ellie there is the SOP upgrade the finance upgrade and we 're looking at the put in a system in place for asset management all of which is taking a lot of it 's-- time and had to say also a lot of staff time as well it 's work that 's been sorely needed for very long time and is an aryl well underway and so when these come to the report obviously it 's it 's increasing the budget there does that come back to us as a counselor do we get informed about that well we would normally come back to with it as part of this report if the overall spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll excuse me I 'm saying this for what I sent you to do that aren 't see you said you 're going to follow up with someone else to get the next yeah sit the judge didn 't get very far okay if it goes into capital the point is it 's it 's here in the operating but but then gets capitalized so it so it becomes part of the overall capital program and the department is still expecting to Maine to deliver those projects within that budget it anisur anything I haven 't covered you know actually one of the exhausted and prepare a budget in its own cost for delivering their big problems of wicket we 've got underway sir yeah we 're gonna talk about what I said yes and there was the other thing that I just had a bit of a question about was was the there was a point five million that was affected in from the three water 's the overspend on vacancies to cover equipment costs do we have a policy that actually looks at how much we spend for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is quite a lot of money we do and there 's a project underway which is looking at that exact thing it 's been I think I must be close to being finished because it started about six weeks ago can we find out when there 's going to be done so that we can you yeah can I just ask the chief executive becoming yes so we manage permanent staff 16 staff consultants and contractors across the organization depending on work clothes but we have got a piece of work that it 's also looking at changing long-term contractors and consultants if it 's work that we continually go out for to build those skills with an organization and that does mean that we change actually our FTE base because it 's cheaper and more effective and more efficient to employ people and long-term rather than to constantly go out and hip contractors in consultants or the same thing so you will see an increase in if te but the but we manage the increases and workloads and particular projects generally around consultancy in contract mainly we may see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Darla so when will let report to us come back well it 's an ongoing piece of work so it 's been part of our savings strategy overtime right do you think we could do you think we could get a briefing on that just a little snow and you couldn 't it 's really an operation or show me like I just all right that 's what is that it all right i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried

NZ,NZ,Christchurch City Council,Christchurch City Council,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZETwErnCvvgbvBbnnHfyxA,23.03.17 - Item 18 - Council Submission - Government Policy Statement on Land Transport 2018,_zwLdthMQyg,20170322,1410.289,"Christchurch, New Zealand",4027,so when let 's now move to item 18 and if we can invite staff to the table very much were there any preliminary comments that you wanted to make on this report the screen I 'm sorry was that Christianization this is good this is a draft submission on the government policy statement or GPS as it 's commonly known on land transport funding and essentially what the government does is gains revenue primarily from road users through fuel excise duty road user charges motor vehicle registration and that goes into a hypothecated fund and hypothecated as essentially means that it can only be used for land transport and that 's to the tune of three or four billion dollars per annum so it 's a chunky amount of money and what they do is they allocate that into activity classes and they consult on that document as to what those activity clusters and other directions look like every three years and at the moment they have relief released the draft GPS for comment and so what you have in front of you as councils response to that and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of metas but primarily there 's these two key things which we think are important to us first is that that they draw a strong correlation between what is V KT or vehicle kilometers traveled and an increase in gross domestic product so essentially what they are implying is that the more vehicle kilometers that you have traveled the what you 'll see is an increase in your gross domestic product and I guess what we 've experienced recently in Christchurch is a dispersed land-use pattern so you have more people living outside of Christchurch traveling none so understand you have more vehicle kilometers traveled however what you don 't necessarily have as a result of that as an increase in gross domestic product so we think that correlation has potentially flawed what you could have is and what they 've essentially does is in Drive drives investment and infrastructure which will cater for that increase demand so what you have is a funding regime which continues to fund to a large proportion of you know improvements and maintenance on state highway networks and what we 'd like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement to this as an increase in focus on more sustainable travel options because you don 't necessarily need to see an increase in vehicle kilometers traveled to see an increase in gross domestic product F indeed people who are loving and more denser and living environments indeed people are using more sustainable travel options so that that 's a key thesis to us submission and we do have some graphs which kind of show what the integers are from what the activity classes that 's it with on the GPS yes so largely this sort of shows where the funding comes from so largely fuel excise duty and Road user charges and and instead of largely where it 's where it 's spent as well so the the document is a policy document and a policy statement it 's its direction but where it has teeth is really in these funding class bands or are all Rangers so we 've got sort of three three key policies of safety economic productivity and value for money and so they speak to sort of the rationale as to why the the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submission sort of responds to that and sort of you know suggests some alternative direction for the policy and and for the funding the the expenditure and activity classes has has grown and changed over time you can 't quite see down the bottom that the the top line there is basically spending and state highways there 's been a lot of state highway building over the past eight years and and we you know we haven 't sort of seen those those proportional increases and things like walking cycling and public transport which of course can have economic benefits and improve road safety and value for money as well so I 'll just get skipped through sort of these on the left this sort of that the change in spending up until about 2007 that top blue line is as an increase in PT spending from the 1997 baseline that basically stopped in 2008-2009 and and state highways sort of predominantly took the lion 's share of funding the the the policy the draft DPS we 've got isn 't largely different to the direction we 've seen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards state highways and and this is we 're just providing a bit of context as to as to what 's happened in the past so we can sort of comment on on the document now this show shows in detail sort of the some of those funding funding ranges those are the gray bands and and the red red and yellow is where with it being allocated and and so you can see some of them are I should have been the middle of the funding range and some of them are really close to being over subscribed so or can 't quite point that local road maintenance is something that is typically very close to being over subscribed as well as walking and cycling a very small amount of funding compared to the entire in LT if pool but you know this obviously a lot of demand for for funding in those activity classes which is everything most other funding bands are sort of within within the allocated range this shows projected allocations out to from that from the last GPS up until about 2027 2028 so s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the near and medium term that 's whether the funding is allocated this is sort of like the long term plan for the for the in LT if so still a large amount of highway funding that that 's going to be sort of proposed to be spent but it hasn 't actually been allocated to any projects yet and you can see up until about 2021 2022 there aren 't a lot of projects sort of in the pipeline beyond that so there is there is a lot of room to change and and the GPS is clear that you know this really is focusing on the next sort of three to five years and beyond that sort of hasn 't hasn 't been sitting since tone so to speak so so the key points of our submission that we should really be looking you know when we talk about economic benefits we should really be looking at triple bottom line and including social and environmental costs and benefits alongside just the economic growth and that 's what should pointed out we think there is a bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and and getting a increase in GDP we we think this there 's also you know a strong case to be made for the GPS to talk about shifting modes away from single occupant vehicles and to walking cycling public transport because there 's a whole raft of benefits that you get from that you get safety you get excellent value for money in terms of benefit cost ratio and the GPS doesn 't really talk about that in great detail with regard to safety we think there you know there could be an opportunity for the GPS to enable territorial authorities to sit a really bold direction in terms of safety there 's a number of cities around the world that have begun to adopt a vision zero for for their cities and city centres based on the assumption that it 's it 's absolutely unacceptable to have any amount of deaths or serious injuries and in the past that hasn 't been that hasn 't been the direction of the government 's safer journey strategy so there 's an opportunity here to to influence that and and provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vision you know enable us to have our own vision zero a much more ambitious target for Road Safety in urban areas that 's us great thank you very much indeed so let 's move to questions Phil thanks very much for your work on on this um I just wondered and like we 've got a excuse me if I missed it that we and I have really big agenda the leg between exhausts missions and in in pollution in the whole cut cut I guess governments really policy about reducing carbon emissions I 'm just wondering in effect if we should and when it comes to public transport if we should make that stronger currently is a plaintiff is a place to actually refer to that other government policies so the the GPS draws from a range of other government policy frameworks so some of them are the for instance the new energy efficiency and conservation authority have set their strategic direction as well so the the raft of government policy government policies are supposed to to align it and to talk to each other the GPS is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but yes there there probably it probably should be something in there and we can make suggestion to that that you know funding and policy direction should more closely align to strategic directions from Ministry of Environment and and antica okay thank you I 've got yani Sarah and then deal Yani yeah I just had um two questions I guess in terms of whether it 's appropriate to put this on the submission the first is that on page five of their policy statement they talked about value for money and they talked about the public transport operating contracts have increased competition and and you know I guess in Christchurch my experience would be that having a competitive public transport system has been a failed model it 's cost us a huge amount of money and we 've seen a deterioration in the quality of public transport and you 'll recall a few years ago what happened with the buses the chief bus has been imported from overseas and the police operation so I just wondered if this is the opportunity for us to at least make some comment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a community public transport system rather than a competitive one eg in a city like Christchurch where you 've got you know three different organizations making decisions over you know public transport okay maybe what we want is just to have a a different model so is now are we able to have something about that in here again this is this is something that we can we can possibly allude to the P Tom legislation and in sort of policy direction as a separate as a separate document to the GPS but it is it like that like the Iike a coaster idiot direction it is one of these documents that the GPS should be in line with and should be talking to yeah so in the GPS I suppose we could you know we could allude to you know presence structures and in the public transport configuration P Tom fare box recovery things like that but there are sort of separate documents that speak to that direction as well so in in terms of how how much would be able to influence that through this possibly possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a separate policy and a separate piece of legislation but this this the GPS seems to be making the point that we get very formally from a competitive public transport model what we 've seen in Christchurch is actually we get a much lower quality of service and and we lose the ability to have you know for positive post-disaster as sensible the sense of approach so I personally would would would like something even at a high level and our submission on that I 'm the second question I have we stood around the issue of maintenance and again one of the things happening in Christchurch is because the roads aren 't being repaired to a full standard what we 're saying we 're going to see a huge increase in the maintenance costs which would indicate that it 's not value for money so a very short term of by government and there is some comment in here that the maintenance is the that they 've looked at they maintenance Senate 's having better impacts of course in Christchurch we 've probably got the opposite where we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a long time to get recognition of investment because we haven 't had that subsidy to do the things properly post-earthquake so again just wondered if there was opportunity to maybe just reflect on yeah we can make we can make amendments to the submission the the deadline is the 31st of March to look up we 've got some time to to include that in the submission talk about value for money local road maintenance renewals and and as I 've met that may be another key point as well yeah thank you so just in terms of process will you pick up these issues as a as changes that you 'll make to the proposed submission or do we need to be passing a resolution that reflects those things and we can pick up the changes put them on track changes into the document and if you want to put a something on there about a resolution about being delegated to the CEO or to the mirror or to the ite committee whatever to the mayor and the chair of the ite committee would be appropriate quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approval and Submission closing date for submissions or comments as the 31st of March okay yeah no that 's fine okay so next set of questions Sara thank you a much the question around I was trying to find it and I couldn 't the the vehicle kilometers traveled my understanding is there HD most vehicle kilometers traveled and on the state highways and yet they take up a really really large chunk of all of the money and so whether we were able to whether it was you booth when we talk about balancing things actually being a bit more specific and they 're about where we would like money to come from hmm comes to this and because if we 're taking away from the the state highways and spending more potentially on the local road maintenance but lowering congestion on those local and those local areas by using the public transport and cycling those kind of things because the State Highway Network HD doesn 't carry the majority of travel but heads what ninety percent of the funding so yeah whatever we could be more specific on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the answer off the top of my head but we can look into it and adjust this machine accordingly can be a bit more specific thinking deal thank you and the road user charge this is there a breakdown between heavy vehicles and say consumer vehicles would the data would be available and the information I presented and then the slides I think it 's all in and and one Paul so the the road user charges and the fuel excise duty yet at a very high level I 've presented are all in the same bucket but that data would be available we can we can track it down and yeah a person would like to look at it and one of the things there is and I mean I just know from from looking at our roads and Christchurch with the heavier vehicles that are on the road from the recovery in the rebuild we 've seen a lot more maintenance costs being born because of that and I just wanted to see if there was any way we could actually sort of signal that you know those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually start you know if if in fact that is actually into the sort of subsidies that although all the costs that we bought beer and get their money back through those road user changes in the urban environment because you know we are in a unique situation here in Christchurch and I have seen and if you just look around you see the trucks are doing a very much amount of damage and with the recovery there 's been a very big increase in trucks on the road with every we thought about that at all well it certainly I think the issue of maintenance and local Road in funding for local road improvements in maintenance as an issue which we do need to bring it a bit stronger and then so it 's not just specific to the heavy vehicles and it is a funding issue across the country yeah I mean heavy vehicles do do you know fortunately a huge amount more damage as they get heavier it sort of goes exponentially up so you think you that 's a low on the present thank you pulling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm wondering that as we go into the future and increase the use of the electric car it possibly PT and most of the funding comes from fuel tips so how will thin they the funding pool would be anticipated to drop a little bit so will they need to be looking in other ways to pips road user charges of possible vehicles and Lisa texts on the fuel they do the ministry has has mentioned this a few times and it is in the document talking about future technology and technology enablers so the likely direction and future for road user charges will be will be some sort of metering so it could be vehicles fitted out as a pay per kilometer basis and so it is touched on it and in terms of technology and and we sort we obtained to agree that that the funding model is probably not as sustainable as it is it at present but the ministry is looking into other other ways to together Road use charges and to fund a National Land Transport program thank you thank you Mary yeah um did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you looked back in ten years at this document and with Transport would be it that you 'd kind of go men did we actually write that back then whereas I think the the world 's going to change so dramatically in the next ten and certainly 20 transport wise that were such a small country with quite a bit of money and we 're at the second largest city here that we should be really bold you know when you 're talking autonomous vehicles I got no doubt that the within ten years we 'll see a flood of them even electric vehicles already here so the next step is obviously autonomous and then your road toll can potentially once every vehicles integrated heed for zero we won 't aim for 300s and hundreds anymore book aim for zero and that 's what did you consider that and in writing the solution thinking about the the really high-level key points we wanted to emphasize mentioning vision zero I felt was was quite bold it wasn 't something that I don 't think any city in Australasia has has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevalent and in policy and in terms of civic direction so we did mention we did mention that the in terms of technology yeah no doubt the you know this will have an impact there are still a few scenarios that we 'll need to sort of think about testing model and the ministry has forecast you know a range that might say well we could in theory all tournament vehicles could actually increase the vehicle kilometers traveled if you could use your time to read the paper or whatever you might live further away but then there 's a scenario where we could see dramatic decreases in vehicle kilometers traveled the direction the key point we 've made about you know the this premise of vkt and the economy and we want to sort of separate those things out we feel might might address that concern of this of the self-fulfilling prophecy of just building more and more highways so we 're sort of trying to make that clear but with what I feel that might and might sort of address the question around what the future might hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that because we are having to think about it really really carefully now and we do mention in the document that these transport investments last a generation so we 're at this point now where we need to think really really carefully and constantly review plans constantly review what 's budgeted projects and we 're urging the ministry and NZTA to do the same I think the key thing for this council is this is this is a policy document on funding that New Zealand as a whole we we don 't have a transport strategy as a country and we have one of the council we don 't want the country but but this is specific to funding more than anything else it does give you some sneak peeks about things that you 've talked about but only really and that broader discussion about funding so I think that 's the context and then once we need to consider a kind of my point that we need to invest a lot in that technology side because that 's weird the changes in the savings to the country will really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will need some funding to to take that leap and be a leader like if they even look at our traffic light system it 's just bizarre so Holden and you know you consider the traffic light with 20 cars and it 's read it doesn 't even know you 're there like its cell phone technology could tell the trip that what you 're there so there 's so many things were so far behind on we 're gonna miss dinner yeah all right thank you very much so thanks for the answers to those questions now what we 've got in front of us now is a couple of resolutions the second of which approves the comments of the Ministry of Transport contained in attachments a subject to the amendments discussed and I 'm working on an assumption that people are generally comfortable with those amendments been included certainly haven 't heard any pushback on this and final approval to be granted by the mayor and the chair of the infrastructure transport and Environment Committee so Pauline which would then allow us to have the submission in place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move do we have a second Mike 's happy to second all those in favor against les carriage thank you very much okay so moving on,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

David lupton who is a transport economics policy and operations analyst he got in touch with me and offered assistance upon completing a review of my numbers and at one point eight million dollar budget that we 've set he wrote the following which is included in the lease hath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past was that the railway station was too far from the city center recent development in christchurch has led to significant decentralization which is both a problem and an opportunity I note the analysis you have undertaken and I think your approach is sound the strong residential development to the north of christchurch should provide a good market particularly as real time will be competitive when modeling for commuters the number one factor and decision-making has travelled on which the train will have over both cars and buses the next factor is comfort levels with Wi-Fi and no Road stress against is a train outdo the car and bus so the numbers of the air the e can report down two years ago would indicate that the numbers aren 't just veer to serve us but we won 't actually be able to keep up with demand already so the numbers and you can report by over 1400 to make those trips every day with the service that we 're looking at we only have capacity for 11 120 from the north so we 're already behind the eight ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congestion yes will they reduce Road risks yes will the service make money yes which shouldn 't be at requirement that seems to be for rail over buses but the business model proves that yes I can 't make money so I 'd like to change the I 'd like to make a change to the wording to reflect such an initiative towards a rail and it 's up for me thank you very much so that does allow some time for questions Glenn thank you good morning Tarly thank you for this it 's been put to us in the past that if you undertake a trial it 's in fact not a trial that you have to go the whole hog so just be interested in your response to that okay so you don 't have to go the whole hog we you can run a trial on the limited basis so which means yes you 've got to get the rails over the trains here which seems like the whole hog but the infrastructure around that can be set up on a temporary basis so there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to be safe so you can do that with the old sleeper and do it backing like they still have my pram so you can do that quite cheaply so I 'll sit instead of spending half a million on the platform you can spend less than 100 any further questions yep absolutely I 'm very fortunate to be speaking to you isin to be working with enormous we do have our first meeting next week some new information has come to light the the public opinion on those husband I 'm not I 'm much stronger than what was previously thought having dr. David lupton come on board who 's worked on rail or round up the world has certainly changed my outlook on things yeah does it 's allowance equation meeting as well as well around a business case for public transport and and it was a very full report and rail was was referred to and my i 'm just wondering effect and in fact will be and is all along it included in the in the reports as to how we can have the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'm assuming that you thought that report was pretty full and the probe the process which the joint public transport committee will nel and back on to have the business case completed that you were an agreement with that yes well I can 't disagree with that the report you 're preferring through as II can 't rape of assessment that 's right yeah so which was aimed at the short-term solution which didn 't work out to be I sorry i 'm not referring to that report now and refer to another report on the under on the vin paper and yeah staff most think we 're here okay if you 've got a lot of questions because it was just a brief the counselors as part of that work we 're doing for the great christchurch public transport committee they 've agreed for us to progress a business case on what we 've loosely termed public transport futures and that is a mode agnostic study that will look at the future of public transport 20-30 years hints and that will consider rail all forms of rapid public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're going to sit down and meet with town a take on board the work that he 's done and include that within that wider piece of work so that workers under way as we speak and we 're reporting to the public transport committee on great thank you Richard are there any further questions for today before we finish the deputation just a very quick one if I may so you 've got a pledge me campaign running are you done to win so the finish on the twenty-third papal okay in so that money that you raised through there is 43 what so it 's due by the rolling stock that 's X so there are four chains up there that we could get our hands on but Mozambique up looking so it 's it 's a wee bit urgent so you need the money for that to buy the stock and then you need some additional funding for some bits of infrastructure in possibly would you be leasing the lines is ideally are so we pay a access fee per kilometer on the lines so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing for you is to keep the stock at the moment as he hit the store your fort leaves otherwise we 'll miss the opportunity right okay thank you great thank you very much that brings us to the end of the 10 minutes but Tony thank you very much indeed for coming and talking to us this morning he certainly provides some interesting questions as well thank you very much indeed thank you so","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Programme,teBkcC1Sm68,20170309,2240.069,"Christchurch, New Zealand",6328,we 'll carry on delegations for major cycle wait Michael major cycleway root program item 21 and the the the updated resolution is in front of you so I think it 's been circulated to all councillors Pauling would you like to move this and seconded by Phil oh I 'll go two questions first so Sarah if Dave could explain the difference in the reason the recommendation I 'm not sure what got circulator but there was a little bit of an explanation on top so we apologize we took the wrong words out of the minute some and so that this one is reestablishing the delegations that were set by council around the cycleways exactly as they were before the elections now those delegations because of the disestablishment of committees we 're disestablished and so what we 're trying to do here is just get those back in place that will sit on the twenty-ninth of january 2015 the reason that we want them is obviously related to funding we 've got a short window to get these projects going they are certainly hitting their straps at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have got two sources of funding both from the same agency NZTA the first one is a third going towards the major cycleways which is over and above normal and then the remainder remainder gets funded 5050 so theorem as part of our normal program so there 's two subsidies formal to financial assistance I suppose rather than subsidies that come from a NZTA but there are deadlines on that first one so that 's why we have fun that 's why council go those elevations in the first place so this was this is reinstating what was there before the last election yep right you 've got an amendment sorry to make it um in the previous tomb as board chair sometimes it was unclear as to where the community boards furter done and so I 've got a just a couple of but the times it did work it didn 't make a difference to the timing so that the the board was able to be invited to workshops with the ite committee to look at and the proposals before they went out which was really good so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed to briefed because that just means that the board 's get invited to the workshops or whatever that I T is heaven and in and be it didn 't having the community board chair along to the meetings was really good and it didn 't make it any longer because often we had our board meeting you know two three days before the ite committee meeting we look at the same report the IT committee had and then the board chair would go along with the board 's feedback based on the comments and the meeting can we put cheer or chairs because it might fear yet so I 've got some wedding and I 've sent it to press although I 'm going to change appropriate to relevant so I 've got in the relevant or chair be invited by the infrastructure transport and Environment Committee to participate and the relevant may just like a route item discussion and give their boards feedback or recommendations yep yep yeah lights metropolitan yeah yeah yeah cheers OH sash chairs what I 'd like to you and that way just yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here some brackets that here so there is it anyway really clear that we actually value the community boards and put here and they 'll have seen the submissions at the community board put under setting examining mover and seconder yes yeah yeah so you don 't need to move an amendment okay fine yeah okay there any questions Yanni I did ask some questions prior to the meeting just to get an understanding of the decision-making process as it was exist without telling to the Eddie community as it possibly get that circulated all on the other side because we 've yeah so at the moment they call it because the because the previous council has already declared the Symetra politan program that decision actually stands so therefore it would be a decision of the council and it 's the council that 's delegating the decision making to the early committee which is what we did before see so this is I don 't think you 've taken license I think you 've given us an accurate assessment of what it was before the election so my understanding previously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ferry Road that there would be a recommendation from the community board to Council so even if it was something was considered metropolitan the board still made recommendations to council they just did not make the final decision and what I don 't see from this process is where the community would makes those recommendations which they currently make on things like local roads so and I suppose that was a reason for the delegation report that went up in January 2015 to speed up that process but still have that input into it it just removes a couple of very formal processes in there so that we can actually fast track to meet those requirements so what 's can 't just ask them what 's the difference in timing between if it 's a metropolitan going to the committee versus coming to council it would make a difference in four weeks or a month probable but but why appeals you yeah sorry if it didn 't go to the committee names of the council why does that change the timer given that we 've identified at big metropolitan doesn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathe three out of four weeks it would actually speed it up hey that having no no no because we 've got a community board wait also just as really rich I mean this is unusual this week because other papers have got a time frame logic can possibly be revisited several times wing designs are tweaked is in response to consultations so imagine that having to come back every time because you can 't move on in the project design until you 've got that but sorting it 's really complex nicely anyway I 've been that we 've made a Mitch problem thing so just so I 'm clear so if we if I moved an amendment that it gets delegated to the full council not to the committee that would have no impact on mate there is not an amendment you vote against this it 's not an amendment to delegate to the full council because we currently hold the decision-making power as the metropolitan the only difference i can say being what 's proposed is to cut the community would recommendations out that 's the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council it actually could arguably done quicker so I I don 't understand why you 're saying that that can 't be because it has to be in go to Betty and then come here it does not matter there 's no reason for it to go to a if we agreed to delegate it I 'm in my eyes it 's the divisions which we should be here in a debate ok and then can I just like wait wait wait 0 thank you one of the things and I found confusing last time was was the dual role of a commute board and submissions and then joining the discussion around the IT committee table so it 's I don 't think it 's particularly good practice for a board to submit and then to make a recommendation based on all the other submissions and I think it 's much clearer if the board looks at the submission for the community of my and then basis a recommendation or gives their feedback based on that because they are representing the views of the community um and so there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then we thought that we would be conflicted and making recommendations later so I think that what I 've proposed up there mmm I actually would suit the process better so we see the same report and the information that comes to ite we see the submissions we see the staff recommendations based on those all the changes that are proposed and then we give feedback or recommendations to ite at their decision-making meeting yeah and I think that and your makes it much participate in much better process rather than the dilemma between said much or maybe he meant yep alright so um I was going to put the motion and then call for debate so you got a question yep if we went through the process of vetti considering making a recommendation to Council and council then approving did you say three or four weeks that would add three or four weeks to process two things yeah it could add could add up to a month depending on what the timing is one of the things that we 've done prior to when we did get this delegation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cycleways and it 's a lot easier to get a extraordinary meeting of a committee than of all of council because of you quorum and I must admit if this does go through we 've already got one hopefully scheduled to meet that timetable and so that 's what speeds up the process enables at a far more nimble approach because a committee is a lot easier than a young then all of council yep damn it yeah that was just probably the question sort of centers around the sensitivity of some of the decisions maybe in the community and maybe in the broader context of the thing and and whether in fact we may be better off having a bigger body just make the decision rather than leading a small group of people shoulder that responsibility and although that unsure about what 's the best approach is for this one because i was at dion I just have a question around obviously there 's a bit of pressure here because of the funding have we actually gone back to nzta and said hey look given our circumstances and christchurch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can we please get an extension on time of this funding so the conditioner so there 's a hundred billion dollar fund released by the government into this program was very it was very clearly stipulated in there that the projects had to be constructed by the end of june 2019 we were asked through that process whether we were in a good position to achieve a share and that 's how we managed to secure 20 million dollars of that fund because we gave a clear indication that our program was sufficiently advanced to meet that date I would doubt that the government would look any extension a time because they are coming under some pressure from around the country to achieve that program I mean but have we gone back and actually asked no I 'm hearing very clearly that we 're and staff wrap it up briefing is that within zto nation office and they restated it and physically yesterday that there is no extension so so we might not have gone back and asked but we 've been told very very clearly and orchid and save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different city we 're in different circles no I 'm Glenn and infill thank you just by way of prices you know that council meetings can be requisitioned to me p so if that were to be the case would all of that which has been worked through at standing committee level here then have to go you know rii litigated through counsel for the purposes of the council signing it off he said what has to be would if you were going to put in a process the normal process of putting it through the committee and then yes I think it would know only to be repeated if you were going to say that you were then if it was going to step with counsel the fastest way would be to say that you actually rescind any responsibilities Eddie committee and we then run extraordinary council meetings if that 's the way that would speed the process what we 're trying to get out is a double whammy really and we also again just want them that the nimble approach that the Yeti committee has done so well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked pretty well so that 's really why we are here trying to duplicate a process that most people have felt worked quite wrong always we 've done with the district plan review subcommittee as well Phil you 've kind of given us the decision-making tree and that 's helpful and you 've also referred to workshops in the different stages of each cycle way just wondering if you let councillors know about the importance really of decision makers being able to understand that quite deep complexities of all the different parts of the cycleways and how important those workshops are and then and certainly in terms of of people and of councils understanding that the what 's required don 't you see um they are these projects are highly complex and also the designs that are being produced I know you throughout the country so the designers are on a learning curve the constructors are on a learning curve and our decision maker out you guys as you as our decision makers are on learning cube so the highly complex the highly involved and they 've got a huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involvement required at all stages throughout we have public meetings and it 's really it 's really concert a lot of public meetings through the consultation for an engagement process with a lot of response from the community and all of us and this whole process that we 've designed here as I 'm to try and engage you as decision makers and net to ensure that you can make the best informed decision right so got a mover in a seconder is there any discussion Yanni Dion Oh Andrew and was told I couldn 't sit at the table as a council when the cycleways were going right through the world that I resented people who had voted for me were making submissions and they felt that they had no representation around the decision I actually don 't think that that 's very democratic and I was told I couldn 't even sit at the table so you know I think the process actually hasn 't worked well because people feel alienated from the people that they vote to represent them and make decisions on their behalf and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased number of wards delegating to a small committee which doesn 't include the full council everyone who should be represented on that isn 't and I don 't think that 's the right approach in fact if you want to speed it up which I hear you saying that you do delegate just don 't delegate it to the committee take the delegations away from the committee like your proposed to do for the community boards and just give it to the full council then you can do it quicker you get everyone taking responsibility for making decisions to which they 've been elected to do so I don 't agree with the process that 's been identified I also went to the meeting where the submitters came to the committee meeting and the ones that win at the start from pepper Nui area got a heap of time to put their case and the ones from the Wooster Street who were at the end had almost no time to present their case so the idea that people come to a committee I don 't think is a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think the whole idea of having hearings and the past has worked really well but just heard around the a corolla wastewater treatment the community liaison group and i think actually having hearings where people can come and make submissions with a scheduled time and that small group then makes a recommendation back there 's a lot better way of dealing with it with what are very complex complicated decisions I think it gives a lot more flexibility to making sure that everyone 's informed so I I don 't support what 's being proposed I don 't think it 's the right approach and also feels strongly that the local community boards should not be excluded from making local recommendations as they historically have done enough city I stood on a platform of giving more to community boards not taking away from community boards and I feel that the process that 's been identified here actually takes away a fundamental right of local community boards to make local decisions or recommendations on things that affect their communities and I finished by saying The Hague leaf aramid board had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charleston area including the plan that was put into place there the award-winning plan the 40k speed thrown to a child street and yet it doesn 't even get to make a recommendation on that to council when you 're putting in the cycleway so I don 't believe that 's fair Dion and then and Ruth infill then gleamed yeah I I cannot support this as well purely from the fact that I actually have a problem with with the cycle lanes and this program that 's going through and that to me feels like we 're pushing this program this process through in fast tracking all this by taking away some of those those democratic rights that people have to get funding and that really hasn 't that that really concerns me that we 're looking at the same date where we have to get this thing constructed just because we 've got to get some money but actually we 're stomping on a whole lot of people at the same time and and that feels to me not right the biggest complaint that I have from being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a big change I 'm not against cycle lanes but I feel like that people aren 't being brought along this journey with us on these cyclones and it is got to stop say ness of Street has a danger to people in the city to make yourself away this the Cyclones come into the city they they link into these SOPA loans that were credited into the city now we need to have a big ring think about how we actually do this I believe so i cannot support this and i do not want to see as pushing this through in pushing processes through that actually going to stomp on people 's rights to actually have a real good say real good feel about this and a good thing because we are trying to get funding so i don 't support this thank you and andrew i 'm going to speak in favor of this the decision the discussion and the questions have largely been framed around the risk have not been able to do this quickly enough and therefore the the loss of funding there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly as well loss of funding of course is one of them but the sooner we get these cycleways constructed and let 's not forget that we 've committed to this through subsequent annual plans and long-term plans the sooner we get the work done the sooner we achieve the modal shift to active active transport that we 're looking for and the sooner we achieve the safety benefits of separated cycleways and there 's been a lot of conversation about road safety in recent meetings as well so this isn 't just about speed for whichever reason we decide to prioritize it 's also about the quality of the decision making now I 'd shared that MCR committee that was put in place as a temporary measure until this decision came in front of council and if I thought that I 'd put my hand up to do an easy job there it very quickly became clear that I hadn 't because the level technical detail legal advice there 's a lot tied up in this the level of detail that that committee needed needed to get its head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with submissions from people who also had made it their business to become familiar with that detail must not be underestimated we 've got a situation where a smaller group of people i think is more able to do that through a series of workshops and be reactive to issues that might come up in submissions that then generate change to what 's proposed which is exactly what we would want change being made as a result of submissions i believe a smaller group of people that are closer to this work will be or able to be nimble and to be able to react in the way that we want then the whole council and all this talk of requisitioning meetings or having special meetings of council to do is I don 't believe we need to do that I think having a smaller group of colleagues who we can be confident have got their their knowledge in the right place around the detail of the cycleways is absolutely the way to go so what we 're really talking about here is a trade off I guess in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ totally comfortable in delegating to colleagues that I 'm very confident in for them to have that responsibility and that accountability through the committee totally comfortable with that far rather do that than have council spending time getting across detail that it doesn 't need to and slowing this down so risking funding risking safety outcomes risking delivery of this whole program within the timeframes that we 've sat out a long-term plan an annual plan I 'd also just like to comment on the amended resolution which on a lot more comfortable with them the resolution that originally was put in the paper respecting the comments that councillor Templeton has made it 's vitally important that the community boards have an appropriate opportunity to be involved in the decision making in an appropriate way and this is where I 've got particular respect for the comments that Sarah mate we all know from previous experience and also from the cycleways that are coming up the upstream benefits can often be quite different than the downstream effects and the effects can be quite localized and that 's where it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community have the opportunity to really be involved in the decision-making not just to make a recommendation not just to be a submitter but to be involved in the decision-making and to be part of those workshops at every stage because things change so I 'm very comfortable with the ability of the community board to be involved throughout the decision-making process given the local effects that we 're already very aware of so strongly supportive of what 's in front of us this afternoon encourage colleagues to also support it um Glenn I think and who was the other one Glenn and fell Mike and Pauline we 'll be here all afternoon right ok that 's good thank you this probably should come to counsel to be honest then again it is it a special case I can see the deadline I 'm not actually happy that that funding deadline serves as a an artificial deadlines over our process but i think if we draw ourselves out to the big picture one of the risks that hasn 't been overly made explicit here is actually the risk to those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city my experience of soaking around christchurch is that you have to be pressed up like a circus because it 's as dangerous as hell it 's not only cyclists and the wrong it 's its drivers there seems to be little consideration and too much risk taking I think what we have to do with these the rollout of both the major cycleways and also the minor even if they 're not technically part of this program is an s of street is listen to the community because it 's one thing to be fickt change but as alvin toffler once said is the rate of change well cities already been through a fast rate of change you 've got to take them with you so we might have some kind of ideological preference for this we might have identified this as a priority in the city but it really is rocking the boat so I have I 'm close with David actually on this I would prefer the whole council to shoulder the load because this will come back at the end of it to the council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this so I will support it but not by much I 've been tossing and turning over this the whole week it should really come back before the council anyway we 've got this opportunity over the money I think we have to take it would be looking a gift horse in the mouth but good luck to the committee you 're gonna have to listen really hard yep can we will want to delegate decisions to community boards that you work delegate a decision to community committee there 's all right so who was I fell and then Mike I mean David but n Pauline was in between somewhere oh yeah yeah okay so look our city has got a transport strategic plan and 2012 and recently staff have told us and if it one of the top achievements of that plan has been the progress that has made to date on that major cycle routes and I think there 's no question that and staff acknowledging there and I think the public due to that in fact the processes have worked effectively and it 's not just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referred to and if we 're going to get cyclists safe we need to make sure that in fact we we keep working on these projects as a network this 13 of them there 's some big challenges the community said to us look we want them done done quickly preferably seven eight years at the most we need to we need to respect that and make sure we get them done and I think um but clearly they like many of them cross the rewards it is complex in terms of how we involve the community boards and sarahs made some good suggestions as to how we do that how we improve that process so and so we need to make a lot of requirements really and part of it is engaging engaging with their communities and in fact there has been a lot of democracy around the processes that we have run we 've had large numbers of submitters which i think is testament to the fact that in fact this is a democratically run process and as for speaking times I 've got no doubt in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every scimitar receive an equal speaking time so look I don 't believe we 're to construct the air cycle ways this can be business as usual I think we have to pay respect to our staff who work incredibly hard on these projects and also they were as the committee previously of weren 't really collaboratively with the staff and the new committee I 've got no doubt we 'll continue that and so we have to make sure that in fact in many ways these projects are fast tracked but they not rushed that they don 't carefully so we get it right but the timeline does need to be achieved if we 're going to going to if we 're going to construct the 13 so we need to keep our foot on the pedal there 's a real risk that the delivery time ever that the delivery time frame would be delayed if we keep taking these back to the whole of council and we make that staff made reference the importance of the workshops so there are time consuming and I hoping that councillors support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are interested in in the cycleways as we 've spoken today to come to those workshops they 're very informative and and they it is known community boards and also attend those and the all elected members are welcome to come so I think the emphasizing that the delivery of the whole process cycleway program is complex the process does need to be streamlined for that reason and so I 'm quite sure the whole using a whole of counsel approach to make them making these decisions would be incredibly time-consuming we need to make sure that we have an effective and efficient use of councils time and at all stages for these cycleways so I 'm urging counselors to vote for the recommendations right and I think I got down to Mike thank you so always there surely bring out the passion and everyone so I 'm it 's a good debate I 'm and I guess the main debate is you know do we delegate this major cycleways to the IT commit in going to speak a little bit from the past when was the chair of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sink where stomping on people the community board held five public drop-in sessions we held a submitters evening evening we also attended public lead community meetings we then made recommendations to the ite committee who then made the final decision it was a very big process that we went through it was complex and it took a lot of a lot of time and for that to go to ite committee then go to the council is just going to add two extra extra time when we 're not stomping on people worried are listening to people the pepper new parallel had over 600 submissions with over 80 changes based on those submissions so yes where there 's always going to be people affected by cycleways it 's gotta happen when you rich a fit into an existing carriageway but things are going to be positive in the long run when we get these all done but we need to get them done quickly because you know I bike to work every day I come in here on my bike and is getting dangerous out there there 's more and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fishy when you look at the roadworks that 's happening the more we can do and the quicker we endure the safer it is for the environment and I guess when we look at cycling the more people we get onto these cycleways the list cars were also going to have on there and so the list the congestion schoo in to be so although they want to debate about cycleways obviously went into that direction but i think it 's really important that we actually keep this process moving along smoothly look I trusted the colleagues even if I wasn 't on the IT committee I would actually trust in my colleagues to make the right decisions there 's plenty of our community involvement for the community boards I found the process work process work extremely well for the pepper new parallel we had a very good opportunity to talk to the IT committee we advocated for the community we listened to the community and and I think we 've got a really good result at the end of the day thank you look I express some reservations earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's been head here I do appreciate the the need for urgency and some of the decisions that we make and the significance of the funding around these projects as well I will with some reservations support the motion and I think it 's probably too late now to amend anything but a suggestion perhaps going forward that may alleviate some of the concerns that council Johansson raised with the perhaps if there is a cycleway in a particular ward that the we make sure even second the elected member for that area on to the pretty committee for that decision making process may in some way ensure a little bit more comfort shall we say in that decision-making process thank you I 'm Pauline thank you and I 'll be brief as normal but look I 've been in local government now for nine years and six years of that was saving on the Shirley papanui community board and I was elected on the grounds and I was very passionate about community and grassroots and put into decision-making which we didn 't always see back the year in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the itty committee to which we 're discussing the delegated authority so I 'm asking people here to trust me to engage fully with community boards with communities and with residents and along with me and the rest of the committee and we have Phil who actually was in the last process with the last two years that we 've been working on these mike davidson you had an incredible input into the puppy no in parallel we 've got incredible staff has been alluded to by Phil who actually have impressed me incredibly with their high level of engagement and their capability to deal with people in these difficult situations people who are negatively impacted by these works and they are just getting better and better and better at it in my view so it 's not just the committee he 'll be talking about here it 's the whole team there 's going to be working on this too and I think we look back at the last two years and we can look at and be proud of the success that we 're having we 're actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aren 't happy generally these things are happening and we 're having a high level of success and getting these things and so I 'm really keen to keep this ball rolling and I really do hope we 've got your support with this complex project and it 's one network and so until we get the whole 13 and we wrote really see the full benefit so we 're really wanting to get there as quickly as we care not just for funding but because this is a flagship project for our city we 're ahead of Halla rest of New Zealand we should be proud of ourselves and hold our heads up that we 're delivering this incredible incredible thing for our city and I would like to say to staff might pick up on think it was David can we please invite the appropriate counselors to the meetings when we have the workshops the seminars and just advise everybody when the the public meetings are on in the consultation meetings and then they have the ability to be up to speed with all the information and our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decision-making has to be nimble so that we can actually meet these timelines so I really do hope you support entrust this committee to continue the work that we 've been successfully delivering for the last two years sorry I 'm just trying to work out where I can adjourn the meeting to this we 'll have to call a meeting on another day I think is gonna have to be the

Signage,zNQHJMBhtEc,20170309,737.72,"Christchurch, New Zealand",2096,and the wording of the petition I wasn 't quite comfortable with the with moving it as proposed because it requires us to take a position and I don 't think we should take a position until because it says to receive an and support what have you got yeah see this is the council receive and support I don 't mind receiving the petition and requesting staff to provide advice on the on the on the three schools presumably to the community board well yeah it 's a little bit unclear um because the committee I mean normally when we get petitions up would refer them to the appropriate committee for a report but obviously you know time is of the essence I guess on some people might say on these ones there is actually work going around like if you typed it to walk in or I mean that 's really part of the master plan program so that so again like yeah I think it 's good to get progress on it and maybe just getting a report back to council by the community board is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you 're probably committing way 10 notification yeah is it but that 's okay to receive the petition and request staff to provide advice to the community board on those three circles well what my understanding is what we would get as a report not invite we 've had some advice already but what we actually need is a report so we can make a decision that 's my understanding in response to the auto shop well is there a material difference can we ask for a report to go to the community board great report to the community board with regard to establishing speed zone something right there yeah good with regard to establishing yeah but that the community board doesn 't help that by way of delegation at the stage so it 's something that will have four recommendations back to Council yeah okay meanie throughout Christchurch that are really desperate for these zones so that information to go out I think that I think where I think this is heading is that during the LTP process which is not the annual plan process but the LTP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a real consideration of whether all school should have a 40 came zone around them the the ER deze raised a good point though because just down the road from sins as a wolves to master plan concert which is based on 30 h and their woolston shop area so you know so these things are not straightforward but i think the LTP is the right place for the big decisions not the it 's not piecemeal but it but these three they 've asked to have a report done and I don 't have any problem with them getting a report done it may well be that the reporters is that they 're not prioritized at the stage it may well be that yes actually all three of these have a priority and actually it might be two of the three you know so it 's not prejudge the outcome let 's go through a due process before we make a decision the staff would already have it 's about explaining that there is a process and there is yeah I ority I think that 's appropriate for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the community board it 's entirely appropriate that the community board handled that relationship it 's not something that 's transferred to us if the community board want to share the information once they have received it I think it would be entirely appropriate that the community board feed that back tom okay yeah I 'm Aaron yeah if the council 's and I don 't know if we do have a position to be good to know if we do on the speed limits outside schools do we agree they should be all the same its case by case basis yeah and there are three funder yeah I don 't know where you 've been for the last you know half an hour and the conversation but we 've we 've had this discussion exactly about how we have a process we 're going to have the player you 're saying the council 's position is that all schools should have exactly no I just see that it is probably something that we are going to have to deal with in the LDP process at the moment we fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fundings been obtained for the changes at high outer out of a different fund because it doesn 't fit within the funding arrangements that we 've already got I mean I just okay book before you lose your ring just the point of order no no it 's all rising um the it 's alright it 's alright could council oak urine please make your point um as sorry for sounding what you may sense making a reference that you may have sounded stressed but I 'm asking the quick really wasn 't very helpful thank you yeah so just apologize from it but now your apology wasn 't helpful actually could you just stick to your point ask me to apologize the my point is that there is already a national campaign to have all schools with a consistent speed limit outside them is that our position or doing because the way we 're funding it is going to take another 60-odd years to get through all the school which is why I see that we are likely to include such a position an hour ltp process we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our annual plan so that is that that 's simply what the decision that we reached as a council that we were not going to make such a major change to our LTP any major change to our lgp and the annual plan process we all agreed to that so I 'm suggesting that if we are going to have a position as a council we do it in the LTP process and the meantime we 've received a petition on these three I don 't know where they sit on the current area of priorities I don 't know whether that just off the current area of priority we are going to get a report from staff that will sit all of that out and we will know exactly where these three search and we will then have a consideration of the matter once the community board has reported back to us yani speak to this in terms of 15 so what you see from the report is that the bull received the petition but we didn 't have the stuff comment that was being put into the council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is actually all three of these schools have existing council projects underway around looking at immunity improvement through either the master plan the ferry road master plan around wilson park and the cycleway outside longwood f so actually there is work going around how do we make these areas safer and increase the immunity for pedestrians cyclists and people just generally going through so you know I think it is important that the board does get a chance to look at that and get further staff information to respond because actually this isn 't so much it as i understand it about the school speed zones whether they 're 40 k 's are not and just plunk women it is actually but how do you create a safer environment and as I said there 's work already happening on those so I don 't think that this needs to wait for amendments to the LTP or anything like that I think what it needs is a really good look at what 's happening and the one in particular is to walk it or NOAA which you know you 've basically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minister to increase a school significantly in size the count the community board had already put in funding to actually do some basic smaller enhancements of safety that has been worked through with the school and was told was going to be good but we did ask for a review after that was put in place because we were concerned that that wasn 't going for enough but it does raise the issue is there any requirement on the the story when it expands schools or mergers schools to actually look at doing anything themselves in terms of their obligations and I welcome getting that back because this was one of the concerns that was raised by the community when Phillips town was closed and put NTT Walker and Noah was the whole issue of kids safety and it just seems that we haven 't quite got the process right where the ministry can make these significant decisions with a significant impact on a community have no responsibility for addressing up and then puts the burden back on us as a city but having said that children 's safety is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play but it would be good to get those reports back to the community board I actually think all three of these can be addressed relatively easily through the existing processes we have underway yeah so you 're moving that yeah nice yeah sorry this is a debate I just wanted a Phillips town already had one I know before it was moved I don 't know but look at it these can all be dealt with in the report that 's coming does someone want to second the motion before we debated and do we Oh Sara right thank you um I 'm pleased to hear from Castle Johansson who 's got more local knowledge on these matters than I do that there may well be work underway that 'll be referenced in the report when it comes back that mean we can deal with these three particular cases in a certain way with an existing work streams which would be great but I think we need to acknowledge that you know once this has been raised as a local issue we know from the previous item that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools and around schools isn 't only related to these three schools it 's far wider than that in fact it 's not only related to to Christchurch its is a national issue so whilst the report coming back will address the issues that have been raised in the petition around these clearly we need to have that bigger debate quite possibly as part of the long-term plan and it would be good if we were able to as part of a commitment to putting 40k speed limits around all schools look to some form of government funding or two and gender some kind of a national debate around there given that it 's likely to be a national problem rather than a problem that just affects ferry road that just affects a limb would that just affects christchurch it 's a is a far bigger issue than that and i think needs to be acknowledged as such and i 'd like to support those comments i think that there 's a growing awareness amongst us all that we are dealing with a significant community issue which is about our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to see a change in behavior and so we 're not going to have children walking to school unless parents feel confident that they are going to be to the best of their knowledge safely able to walk to school so I think it 's great that we 're having this debate and I hope that we can continue there and get some significant things in place in the long term plan thank you i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried I 'd

Speed zones",kev8mcKX4rw,20170308,358.74,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1060,thanks to order her community boards that really to me it 's been so much better than I thought it would even even be myself could I invite the transport team to come to the table and while you 're walking up to the table I 'd like you to to contemplate asking answering a question and the range of all of the proposals that we 've had for school speed zones is there enough money on budget to do all of them and do they have an impact on any others that might have had an expectation of being before us in the very near future I 'll have to run my head real net sorry yeah oh and also multi mind to do whatever on my other mind to do is to take a mover and a seconder and I 'm happy to move it and somebody else can seek and it that to move the whole lot as one block so you know resolution to cover all of the individual projects except for the petitioner the the petition one and the petition one is just simply that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that because that we 're not approving them and we 're not accepting them for approval at this stage so so park the petition will deal with that separately but the actual school speed zones and the under vidual community board reports are we able to do that so to directly answer the question we 're funded for approximately three per year this year we 're delivering effectively five so yes we we are we we a you 're getting value for money the reason why there 's more this year then we would do normally is because of the high out of school and being funded through a slightly different mechanism because of the way that that large campus came around so it 's being funded through the safe routes to school budget is opposed to the school speed zone budget and and they are really active warning signs as a carryover from last year so that 's the reason why there 's more this year than those previous years and it 's not a really its mass and doesn 't that that 's how it 's not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all yes they 're all within the budgets that we 've got this year and does ethan was massage as he doesn 't it doesn 't affect the prioritization that was sit in the in your plane process last year right so you were happy to seek in dutch so I 've got a resolution on the on the lot and we 'll come to the petition next and yanni i had was around what 's the school 's responsibility like you know if we put over supermarkets going in for example they have to put on traffic lights or traffic calming or these things that they have to do nate I 'm just wondering like in terms of the schools that have changed or expanded is it any sort of requirement through consenting at eight to do some sort of safety enhancements so generally what we like to do is to program our infrastructure improvements go we 'll go hand in hand with a school treble plane and that 's where we basically we we share the responsibility around in terms of the education and the measures that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community so basically the idea that a school know where the thousand students goes into a local community there 's knows that a terrific assessment around that can I deduce that we address that question you asked earlier for a briefing note on the current prices yeah i think that anyway and i 'm wade reset question yeah yeah because I mean that the main issue for the errors is that if you if you don 't move it down the road then you 'll actually continue with a zone that no longer has using the street let em and that is the problem with that one but yannis point is quite separate witches the role of the Ministry of Education in terms of the ending up days yeah I mean yeah that would be really good to get just something back around around that um and nothing yeah the only other thing is I think you sent us through a lot hid go on the email was a list of the priority of the school signs as if possible just get that recirculate i 'm in debt that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you that 's all just to clear up that 's a briefing night in that program in those priorities will see it 's probably LTP any ongoing in your plan process yeah right and can I just ask that in a presumably will that when you bring us information about the schools that besides the state schools at some private that the private some of the private schools be included for example those that move over over the road from one side to the other there is a crossing issues like that with that where they will fit in terms of our prioritization around these issues what private schools private school is which ones well as this it 's also it 's all I guess it 's all schools will cut will cover it there are some issues in but in particular with at least one private school where the school move part of part of its debts structure over the road as it expires a school in it okay and they keep that that decision that leads to impact on the community in this whole school safety okay all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a differentiation between knowing private or public schools just yes sorry I just didn 't know that issue because it wasn 't related to anyone that we 'd been dealing one but anyway that 's good thank you alright well I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried now,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

evolving the whole of the community so that 's what 's been going on there lies village queens now the other well assuring that we haven at the moment really is the echo a wolf we had a deputation from a resident that 's really concerned to be arch and the loss of tablet spicier the border des cités as such last month in we could see exactly why and this concerns these lots of you know different untrust trying to use that space the day that we were there were two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were obviously the blink each here 's its entre sí but is also a lot of concerns from the fishing the fishermen story of a baby there that have lost these space to unload safely end and to refuel the boat so that suburban a show with tank is sitting on the wharf with people coming off the cruise ships so what the board has asked for as staff can beat with a report to see what can happen going forward to try and manage the whole situation in basically just to say here had such a Russian with the wolf has got to where it 's each because um it 's clearly congested and obviously we just need to try and funny to be a bit more to try and get it sorted because after all and what 's cruise ships coming in here it is probably seeking bogus gateway into constitutes at the moment I love with airport and the Allendale hole that 's been really good to say that those progress been made excuse me on the whole it 's going to be a real easy for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by in particular and they 're really pleased to see what 's been hit meaning so we 've got a good group of people working i reported back to us on that a civil defense we don 't have well the eager our civil defense came to a meeting last month for some concerns that they feel like they can 't operate the way that they had been up until Nia and because of the way that some of Defense has become structured they don 't matter those people don 't want to have to go through the training or do the other things that are involved become a civil defense volunteer they really just want to be able to tune up on the day and help so we 're just weeping with him at the moment to say you needs an option for them kirara I should lose working party was peeing very instrumental worse it 's going very well and I think it 's another good thing that 's just come out of a community that 's just Korean spy you know he talks about what they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all community borden in your plan engagements so we 're just hoping that here we can set up meetings at the moment to engage with the community on those things last but not least and little turn I staying the rave aggies Maddie grout tomorrow evening and a little time apparently it 's a fuse time the his pain and this type of potential is resorted held in Christchurch East End as you can see a very own entertainer will be speaking during this event so hopefully people can make it along that would be really good it 's between five and eight tomorrow evening and it 's really about us moment turned up could I just um ed and but we talked about the portals recovery of it today or we 've heard a bit about it and the importance of actually the rural community being able to assist with the portals recovery and that we were able to move in behind it was a back behind the scenes program where we worked with with those landowners the larger landowners and governors bay and around the edge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we knew where where stock was we knew where the cannery yards word and using people on site from banks peninsula we actually knew and that the people and work it that we were working with they knew everybody loves so just the importance of actually involving other rural aspects to that to those portals activities that went on during that fire I have already had a meeting with them Terry to do with the recovery with my North Canterbury rule support trust hit on which is about social services and rural communities basically rural communities but the serious got a number of lifestyle as butts that we 're still able to help them in a minor way or direct and where they might get some help so I just thought I 'd like to add a little bit there sorry no no you don 't understand that we did work behind the scenes to assist the city in fact we mastered some sheep for um some city people with a well-known dog trial used from the from was Lee Spurr and he put the Sheep away and he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistance real people were of assistance during that fire that 's just one instance that I know of in chair very good I 'm Sarah thank you is obviously a lot going on I 'm just wondering after the success at the community board conference two years ago whether you are entering Little River big ideas and to the best practice awards at the community boards conference appears been suggested that we do we did mention those big bit ly really amazing yeah I don 't know in the applications close but be be an excellent and entry for the community boards Awards absolutely think 0 we 're growing yep very good idea I felt just very briefly to look at the work by the rural sector is certainly your knowledge and like one example you 'll be aware of too as the of exponentially Conservation Trust yes and the organization they don 't they are doing it is just wonderful so thanks in your we were excellent and and moving this one do you do what do we want to kind of capture something that we could seem by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little rubber people you know like to capture that in the resolution it was just amazing presentation I think that would be really good I mean what we 've got here is a community that 's worked in exactly the way that we 've talked about communities working for it for a long time and you know that collaboration that partnership with council that partnership with other bodies and the community really just stepping up to take ownership of its own issues is something that I mean I think we need to be commending for the way it 's been done in little river and diamond harbour in fact as well and it was Little River people that we heard from today but the work done in diamondharbour has been just as good in many ways although different but there 's a lot of what 's happened in these two community-led plans which there are other communities elsewhere in the city that could be working in the same way and there are probably some learnings from the way that we 've done this work on the peninsula so it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a resolution maybe just recognizing the the work that 's being done and of we have we formally received that document as yet i 'm not sure where we 're at in terms of i know the community board and received is where the council should receive the documents yes fine enjoy yeah it 's normally receiving those have we formally received the document don 't know do you have to I don 't know no we don 't have to but um we 've had it presented to us today so if it was appropriate to do that that might be good so receive the community board report and receive the Little River Big Ideas report and congratulate the local community and the diamond harbour community for providing such strong leadership in terms of community lead community development perfect yeah I 'm happy to move but look could I just add something about the little brother issues wicketless this this community plan is that it 's actually got the right infrastructure behind it to make it work it 's got a little river why we 're a trust that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at the inflammation and implementation coordinating it it can received funds it 's already set up has been operating for a number of years as well respected for the way it works it 's got a small team paid staff so that 's also part of the success of it as actually having all of those in that infrastructure ready to go behind this well you know as I said before you know the there is this now a community resilience partnership fund which is jointly funded by central government and ourselves and you know it 's not it 's not a given but I 'm looking at somebody who 's not in furiously so in the way that I was not in furiously were cheering the presentation so I just I just think it just lines up on on every level I haven 't looked in detail at the diamond harbour one but that may well meet that objective of the fund as well and having a trust that you can and be Stern in terms of taking it to the next level then I think that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean I think this is entirely appropriate that we do this today but the other community that 's working really well in partnership with council the moment is there Carolla community and I know Christine mentioned the a Corot working group but I think it 's worth pointing out that that working group is made up so as a working group of community board but it 's made up of community board members and community members from both the business community and the residential community and the work that that group is doing is is committed is excellent and it 's producing results as well so there are people that were original submitters to annual plan and long-term plans here at council who were frustrated with some of the issues that occur Oh working group are dealing with now who are very happy with the outcome and that group has really got up a head of steam and is resolving a number of issues using community knowledge and community partnership to work through those issues there as well so I know there was something on the press website this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work but the community involvement in that group and the successes it 's achieving shouldn 't be underestimated very good all right so you 're moving there and who would like to second there um Phil I 'll i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Recovery Task Force,TSlWcZ3NtHQ,20170308,1183.23,"Christchurch, New Zealand",3199,poor and the next one is sprayed in Kashmir community board welcome urine we have a a Kirk here from era ha nui grace at the beginning of each of our meetings followed by why at her son by the board a lid by grace in Seoul Smith 's and selfishly they were away on disaster duties this last board meeting and we had to look at each other because there isn 't one of us who 's confident and even singing a short later so we didn 't have it there so I think gray should never be removed I 'm taken away for disaster um we 've got to we 've got to par days we 've got summerfield school zones coming up and the reason why ten was so alert and asking about the budget is because to just happened to be in our ward the the two next one 's happened to be in our ward summerfield school and South Christchurch both of which need it and we look forward to that discussion and the established of us and the next resolution is a somewhat redundant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was about the establishment of an umbrella disaster committee to coordinate the volunteers they governance people the owners of the land the governance of the land etc on the port hills to coordinate all of them in the recovery which is happening and which is terrific but those are the two parties that will be put to the council um one of the things I asked to be included we haven 't got pictures where 's that woman she 's still we have to do she 'll eat a very high bar and she has seizure very high barn how does she do it when she 's brand nude it 's a completely segment well I 'm clay I asked to be in the mood report to be enclosed a leader from John cousins who is the chairperson of the craycroft residents association and he wrote a lovely letter in the paper thinking everyone consumed with the disaster right across the range not just the fire service but everybody else civil to be in city council staff and so on and I 'm glad he wrote that and I phoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is there in your papers and we had we had a heartfelt deputation on the mistakes that have been made in the maintenance in the parks we have a group that voluntarily plant in only but also we have other groups voluntarily planting elsewhere and these had a heck of a lot of their plants completely destroyed with streamers being somewhat inaccurate in terms of taking out plantings that had just happened some of the plants actually are several years old and they were completely destroyed by the people who were meant to be doing maintenance this I ask this person one of the people who came to our deputation because she was so committed and has been so committed for so long and volunteer parking planting I asked it to appear before the council to come and appear before the council because she 's a very effective speaker about what 's happened to plants when the maintenance goes wrong but she won 't do it she says that we 're just as good at representing who abused but we 're not we can 't tell you the distress it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strumming machines and who I just meant to be cutting grass and we are having a meeting with staff and the park staff are doing their very very best to keep some control of the workers doing this work and it 's no it 's no blame on them for what is happening but nonetheless we are looking at trees that have been planted by volunteers that have been destroyed in a second and the deputation that came before the board was sad and depressing to hear um we 're sprayed into school the wonderful where sprayed in school which has already got one of the largest playgrounds in Christchurch is had a pool installed in nineteen thirty three and nine and in nineteen Twitter sorry in 2011 they opened a brand-new refurbishment of the pool with a beautiful they 've got a DVD of it and it 's beautiful it 's a summer 's day and it 's children and pulls laughing and dancing it 's hot all appearance a dear it 's wonderful and it was on Waitangi Day 2011 so we all know what happened after that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importing from America that can withstand and it 's on a boat that can withstand earthquakes can be yanked out of the ground after an earthquake repaired and put back into the ground and they have raised seven hundred thousand dollars and they are not a rich poor school and they 've raised seven hundred thousand dollars and we had a meeting at the school a couple of weeks ago and all they want is another 200 like it 'll be easy and it is led by the wonderful Dwayne major who bought the beach and he and his committee and the school are working so hard to raise the final bits of money that will and that days will be the surrounds of the pool the changing sheds and the filter system and to work to get that pull back into that community in there and they were very quick to point out that this will be a community pool event with tickets available to anybody in the community who would like to have them not just the we sprayed in school community I mentioned down accessibility and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all the time but I want to make sure or that but notwithstanding the expense of the psycho ways and the importance of them and and our board especially pleased with the psycho ways and the impact it 's having on our community as having a beneficial influence on our community and just for example on the latest one which they are consulting on tonight they 're going down to main terrace and there is a sin for what there 's a cycleway shared footpath cycle way that goes across the main park between hoon Haynes braden which was reused a lot and the slope up to getting back on the road and domain terrace is too steep for wheelchairs so I asked the staff if while they 're doing that and looking at the installation of the Sacre way down domain Terrace if they could make that slope more accessible for wheelchairs so that not only pedestrians and cyclists can use that cycle way but so can people in the chair and I just I 'd like I just like to say again we 're whatever we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who aren 't cyclists and perhaps are not peace pedestrians and certainly Anton plans just to make sure that all of us can get where we need to go and the Selwyn street shops we had a terrific this was such an example of staff competence we had a terrific presentation on and the Selwyn street shops by people who look as that look who sounded as though they 'd been born near they knew every inch of it you know when they mentioned shops they said to 22 feet from that doorway there is this and then up there there 's this and they knew everything about her notwithstanding the projects being postponed which they mentioned to us at the end of the dropping presentation that the postponed in the long-term plan notwithstanding that we were thrilled to get the presentation because it was just so competent and knowledgeable about the Selwyn street shops and they had listened so much to the unity and notwithstanding in fact that we 're not going to get all the parking back that we it that some of the community might want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people in the thing the only thing I don 't also say about the Sylvan street shops though is that every one of you have seen how dare elected looks when we drive past on the brahms street motorway we are looking at weeds and they are not the council 's fought their private property and I just wish that we could persuade the poor private owner of that particular property who has lost everything and has not got the money to recover when the earthquake happened to do some weeding around that area because it does make selwyn look extremely depressing and is not welcoming to people who might want to build or put in a business in that particular area and then finally another kudos for the staff and we 've got great signs going round now pune by ponds where our drainage schemers going in in conjunction with the athletics park which lien opened 10 days ago and the drainage and development the drainage and the staff during the development of the nappeun away have combined together and they 're a part of the development of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pond and the park bigger and you appreciate how important it is for the ponds to be bigger when you saw the helicopters coming in and dropping their buckets into every single bit of water in the port hills pond swimming pools every single bit of water was accessed by the helicopters and when I now look at now Pune and I think that they use some of the uses it will be put to be haven 't we had not thought of before the disaster on the port hills that so that pond going to be widened and broaden but the important thing I wanted to raise was that they 're assigned all around nappeun away pointing out to the walkers and the dog walkers the people who go through those parks the reason why this project is existed which is to help prevent flooding in Christchurch and I i really encourage this the staff and the council to think every time we do a project to put a signer which says in plain language that it 's to help christchurch you to say to people how it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little bit more advertising of how good the counselors and the effort that is putting in to make the recovery affordable accessible and an enhancement of our beautiful city thank you that 's not the end man I never quite know how it 's going to run through so good um there we had one event that i am move on recent event about I 'm Eddington mustn 't Mary 's Church annealing temperature it 's one hundred and fiftieth year anniversary so I when launched there it was a wonderful occasion what they always are and addington and it became apparent that i didn 't know that the bell tower there that was dedicated to Richard Seaton is actually the stairway is beginning to sort of slope and so they were worried about having a about hell that 's a bit like that our peers or so and it 's so they 're looking to fundraise or something that we will keep an hour vision into the future another thing the board is working on is visiting boards of Trustees which is something that we haven 't done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've got some meetings already lined up to go to school such as hell Morton but we 're looking to go to every single school and just to hear what their the board 's worries are and concerns and things that are looking forward to as well and to an award so we 're wanting to do that and a recent thing that 's not it was in a recent meeting but we 've along with the idea about Paul 's as we had Sarah McKenzie who was behind but when Barrington park playground was remember when it was bird and then the funding happened and people put sponsorship towards it and then the count put money towards getting that repaired very rapidly she 's wanting to have a peddling pull within our ward for free access again to water for kids or something that will she 's presented about and we 're thinking about for Barrington park when the refurbishment happened so just to let you know about that in advance and the last thing really as that the community board executive councils a part of the national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there 's also ones for the community board at that committee so I 'm the zone five Rick now front which goes from white a key it all the way up to the top of the South Island so um we 've hit although community board chairs know that so I 'm I guess I 'm the conduit now instead of Morris I tow that sort of national body so if there 's anything to do with community boards I 'm going to be feeding it back and forwards in it the conference as well which is coming up that 's obviously being advertised and the eleventh to thirteenth of may so that 's I think it very good excellent you 'd like to move it I 'll move it and seconded by tongue is it yep you as my goal um the carrot Carolyn and Melanie given oh what a wide-ranging report one feature which they touched on to is about that portals recovery penning which you know does have a partay here and the request from the group was it it be multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be involved together and that is happening and gradually so but I think it 's important that I guess what hip what we 've learned is just helm hell attached and how important the portals are for us and in fact this recovery project will be very very important so it 's great to see our local groups coming to the board straight away and the board will be an ongoing good conduit for for that recovery is a long side council of course i 'm just wondering whether the recovery manager is going to do presentation to your to your board has Mary Sinclair been yet or hasn 't been yet but it 's going to hit but it 's going to happen because I think he 'll give you some confidence around the way the processes as structured under the new legislative framework so we know at the end of the period for the state of emergency we then moved into I gave notice of a transition period and the transition period has enabled the recovery manager that 's appointed by the group to delegate powers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and those that lasts for 28 days so that from the date that we did it so what the reason I 'm explaining it to you is that there has been a legal process followed in terms of the new statutory framework for transition to recovery but Murray 's been appointed to lead that work for the for the city and it would be great to get him in front of your community board as soon as possible did you say 28 days year 28 days from the date that it was announced which I think was Weeden 's day was it last week Wednesday this week yeah not this week not this week wednesday last week i think ok yep yeah yeah yeah we we realized that the resolution was somewhat redundant but they came and saw us really quick and we thought it was very important yeah um Pauline thank you just want to congratulate Melanie for picking up the zone 5 wreaths they 're just wondering I didn 't know there and I 'm just wondering if something should go out to the community boards advising them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be encouraged to feed information through to you or have some sort of conduit there so whether these are spaced on a meeting report once a month the board members can have any concerns forwarded to you yeah so we 're gonna do pavia all the all the board chairs no because i sent more text messages hunter now needed to do there what probably a month ago we see there isn 't developed at throw to the counselors movie and probably the cheese in the board advisors but I be there might be a good idea for me to even buzzed and then if we can get some sort of yeah mechanism the where the doors are open for communication to flow a little bit easier because I actually don 't sink board members know an awful lot about the role of his own five you know how to feed into there might be something you can pick up yeah I agree yeah can I suggest it if the mover and seconder are happy I 'd like to add to the resolution that the report number 19 be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually an action it 's been referred to the recovery manager and you 'll be able to speak to that when it comes to meet with you but you 'll be great yeah Yanni yeah I mean it might be good to all sir just I guess the recovery meetings going to all the boards or zero process for that happening all the boards well maybe the boards that are affected well so like I know our board would be really keen obviously we takin some of the portholes so not the affected part oh really who 's wall and miss Braden he 's good but in terms of the recovery manager 's role it 's just the boards that are affected yeah and but also like the downstream effects on the river is something that has been raised with our board yes I know but is the recovery manager and we will yeah yeah yeah we go because thanks right so i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye all those opposed they know that 's carried and we 'll come back to the the road the speed zone and a minute yep thank you,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Council,3jDvwGTYzD4,20170308,504.499,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1368,and deal with the school zones at the end Papa no Emma 's la drones hi we 've got no Pat Hayes so I think here 's David de before me will take the reporters read and I 'll just raise a couple of the issues that you may be interested in the big projects for us at the moment in the world the senal burns community center rebuild which is eagerly anticipated by those in the ward we 're keeping a very close eye on deadlines and timeframes we 're not builders or engineers or project managers but we do think that at the moment the time frames are a bit long the rebuilders anticipated to start in august we 're pretty much there now going for resource consents so we are a little unsure why those dates are quite stretched the small burns park pavilion and pour toi let 's 5.3 and the agenda some information and that is not entirely correct it 's not remedial work for the buildings it 's in fact a rebuild of that pavilion building that is our understanding the grassed area of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and re turfing that is to start in july on the first and the only reason that hasn 't started sooner is we 're advised there is quite a fair bit of congestion in the tender market at the moment so the staff have been ready to kick that off ASAP but for that reason haven 't been able to that will take around a year which will be disruptive for the community it 's a well-used park but the staff have done some excellent work consulting on what the pavilion should be built to include we all thought a kitchen might be good for you know two sausage rolls and things that have time but kitchens are not top of the list it 's toilets storage and we 're hearing some changing area so appalling is whispering something to me and I can 't hear so you 'll have to hold a sign up pulling so we 're really looking forward to that because we 've been dealing with a soggy boggy revolting to park for what nearly six years now the Redwood Plunkett rooms this is urgently needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submission this building is going to be used primarily as a base for a community board funded social worker and also funded through the Belfast Community Network we are still seeing a huge amount of mental health and stress issues in our ward particularly in those areas where there is clear deprivation and in some of the areas that aren 't so clearly deprived either we know that there are social workers and community workers working in San Albans school for example so and we helped fund that as a board we 'd actually like the cdhb to front up and fund some of these a bit more but as we 're all hearing they 're pretty stretched as well right now the construction that 's going on in our ward with regards to the cycleways as I 'm sure you 're all experiencing in your wards is causing a bit of stress i think our residents are being really really patient around this what i do think we need to do as a council and community board is communicate with our local media and with our community board members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we are doing three streams of work down rutland street at the moment one is the storm water and wastewater the other is the fiber cabling going in with enable and thirdly is the cycleway development itself now if each stream was done one at a time it would take a heck of a lot longer as I 'm sure you can understand and it would mean we 're digging up things two or three times which we don 't want and I think when this is communicated to residents they are far more accepting and supportive of the disruptor that they 're having too to deal with so we 're doing that through our Facebook pages and through emails and through forums like this I think that is about all the annual plan look to be frank in the past we 've often founded annual plan sessions there are more staff and elected members and there are members of the public so we 're bribing people with pizza and we 're hoping that that will help this year and I 'm being facetious we are inviting the urging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles so we 're going directly to schools in the ward and we 're going to residents associations in the ward as well on the tenth of April the papanui NS boardroom really just to see what the issues are and we are aware of a lot of the issues because of people obviously coming to the board and we 're on the ground in our wards as well and also putting forward to the three main projects that we have presented to council already an hour submission and we 'll all will be presenting to counsel in our submission as well we also have had a record number of applications for the edible gardens Awards which is really great and the staff work very very hard at this I did try to bribe encourage judges to give me an award for best tomatoes when they visited on monday i think it was to take photographs but they didn 't work so we 've got 50 this year which is i think five six more than we 've had in the past and why there is concern if accan tis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they they were big gardeners and and entries in the competition so that 's merit very good reporting can I just need to today at if we look at 8.1 and uh what page is it 322 it talks about the verb which is the Belfast emergency response farm plan and this is the one that they 're actually widening it to include the coastal community to support any other through the tsunami evacuations by opening a support center so it 's good to see the two areas working together and our community governance staff are working well with Belfast network and civil defenders to develop this as a community lead response so yeah I just congratulate to the Belfast network for thus they 're really active group greatly doing very well be there was just one other very quickly I thing I see in the press this morning the swimming pools stuff and and the proposal for free under-16 visits which I 'm sure our board would think is absolutely marvelous but I just want to raise the flag we know that Graham Condon is extremely well used and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haven 't been harpooned yet which is good getting into the ball but we are finding that it 's very it 's very very hard to get a lane sometimes and I think that 's because the swim clubs we 've lost qe2 obviously the swim clubs are coming in if there is a code Brown then everyone moves into that big pool as well as if this happens and the smaller pool so all I would ask you to consider us when you look at this that you think about capacity in our facilities as well because the last thing we want to do is not be able to provide access if indeed it gets very good pick up okay good all right I 'm not presume Pauline you 'd like to move it and I presume Mike would like to second it so I 'll put it to the vote to all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

other things as well on those issues and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got the council is working with community to design a new facility for Austin village to replace the earthquake damaged wilston volunteer library 689 fury road and that 's a significant project for us the other one of course is our most significant project which is the lynnwood whilst an aquatic facility and thank you to the council for budgeting for this project and ensuring that this project will go ahead we read in the paper this morning it that you 're looking at providing slums free funds for children under 16 years old and we think that fantastic idea I 'm very supportive of that but we realize that if you go ahead with it it 'll mean existing pools will be really congested so the sooner we get that Linwood Walston aquatic facility up and running the better and so the action that would like to see from from this project is that we 'd like to be involved in the site selection process and we don 't know when this is happening you would like that starts as soon as possible but we realize that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so we would like a project manager to be assigned as soon as possible to this project so we can get it on the move I think you 'll be looking to knead it very quickly if you do the first ones so i would like feedback on when a project manager could be assigned to this project significant community issues we 've got the intersection that 's an endless hill and bridle path and the safety issues have been raised around this intersection since the reconstruction of pyramid bridge and we 're now seeking feedback from the community on the helps the alternative options for this intersection mentor board significance significance methods of interest and we have the annual plant engagement and consultation and as you can see there 's several meetings going on as well as this we having a presence at a lot of the events that we 're having a rounder area just at the moment with the wealth and fear and the washstand Darla and we also having a garden pride awards coming up soon some of the skate park that scene has been on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working on a temporary site for a skate park and sumner but we 've also asked the staff to prepare report under suitable locations for a permanent skate park within the larger area Annette larger area extends from ferramenta Sumner and there 's been overwhelming community support for this recommendation and another one where the border concerned with the quality of repairs that skirted doing to the road carriageways and footpaths and our area and the last thing I 'd like to say is that we would like to thank the council and community governance team especially for all their work and the port hills fires I think they did an amazing job and um you know I can 't fit them enough from our board for with your work and that variant I was just you know they really come together thank you guys thank you I mean just just commenting on the par-tay recommendations we 've got 4.1 the board provided comment to the council on the assignment of beliefs from the Canterbury horticultural society 's can 't read cricket trust report it was presented to the council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not include the community boards feedbag um you I don 't know whether you 've caught up with the fact that hands off Hagley send us all an email afterwards saying that they totally agreed with the decision that we made so they thought that we 'd made a really good decision so I wasn 't quite sure there were two issues around environmental concerns and around resource consent whether they 'll complying with the conditions the end and that they would definitely responded to at the meeting and but they weren 't relevant to the decision around whether the horticultural all could be leased to the to the Cricket Club so did can you sort of advise on that I we get offered coming at the time it came to the board and which we 've asked you to yeah but it was not going to be a recommendation it was something for us to get your feedback because there wasn 't time for it to be a formal party be nice that release evaded the comment to you yeah but I just want to kind of reassure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complimentary about the it 's really good to hear ya to clarify that though I don 't think that 's that last thing that is actually correct what the community would be that was reported to the council when it made its decision so I think that sentence could just be should be deleted from the record because yeah well I doesn 't think it was there that 's not really there 's best I can assure you okay all right no sorry any other questions just in terms of the request for a project manager for the limud woolston poll I mean is that are we able to get a response to that not right now no okay could we get it could we have it a response port to our board well presumably you your board has resolved there no no the board the board realizes that we can 't move until we get a project manager but how is the community board communicating that to the organization it 's not a governance decision to appoint a project manager it 's a it 's a management decision so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advisors I don 't get you pay news I think there 's a staff report that is coming to the community board as part of the area reports to a next report to the next community board meeting because at the last community board the at the last community board meeting the community board requested that staff came back to them on the process of investigating a suit of that salvation and also how we progress the discussion on the lynnwood woolston aquatic facility and I think one of the requests had been that we start to engage with the community about matters to do with the lynnwood Wilson aquatic facility and advice that we are staff gave to the board was we couldn 't start engaging without knowing what the parameters of engagement are going to be community customer group is meeting with city services group next week and we have a project team working on planning out the timeline for the live would Paul end so we should be able to detection quite quickly on that so we 'll be able to let the board know we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alright so yani you 'd like to move this report be received yeah I just wanted to make 11 comment which was um we you 'll see that we 've had the life festival just this weekend so just wanted to thank you t on I 've actually co-sponsored that with the community board and just wanted to thank all the young people that were involved in putting on that event it was a really fantastic day and a lot of community groups came along and supported that as well so for those who don 't know the life festivals been going um I think you leave out quite some time I think maybe 15 years do you know chef I think at least 15 years and it 's a very successful youth event that came through the young people wanting us to do something positive and then what NP so um yes I just wanted to acknowledge the staff and the sponsors and the people that are involved in that event very good um Sarah you 'd like to speak and exhort human rights I 'll put that motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's carried thank you Sarah thank you very much ask what the process is to prevent the petition that

and then the report on the 28 sorry I missed out the briefing then Gulden 's it 's not thank you Gary so the next issue or like next term exciting users the Rickett and community center the current forecast dollars for 2018 for the opening then it was at a meeting under December the 15th 15th and December 2015 when our community board actually recommended the council proceed with that with the final design end and get the process on up and up and running and we just got a bit of a concern that there 's a review of the specific functions of the center that which is underway now so we just don 't want any holdups with us which two and a half years consulting and we just want to get on with it so we 're very very excited about that progressing as soon as possible and we had a good briefing from staff on the from the on the foreigner we pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant asset to our community it is a covered pool in it so it 's coronation Paul it was built at the time of the coronation of their current Queen and it 's a it 's a it 's a facility that gets very very well utilized and we just want to make sure that that pool is retained and once the the new metropolitan pull those up and running so that 's a signal that our our community and community board of sending those will skate park and recreation park we 're really really pleased with that we can do it in halls will long be record and successfully so if other words in the city having problems with locations of skate park you can come and see us and we 'll sort of help you through that that will mix in the S word now so the infrastructure projects that are underway and as we 're well aware of the work that 's happened in wicket and road Dean Zev and we 're just looking forward to that infrastructure upgrade progressing in a timely fashion and I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UM to the time frame and really looking forward to the next stage of the sudden arterial motorway Wow is that going to make a difference where is that going to make a difference of the southwest of Christchurch would we haven 't got all those vehicles coming through hornby unless they want to mcdonough 's or a Carl 's jr. or to pop in to pack and save they 'll be a blur or dress but they 'll be able to just truck on through so that will be really really exciting til they get to run the further into town anyway where things start to get a bit clogged up like they do near the pond road realignment is progressing really really encouragingly say run and the significant community issues are still and the perceived antisocial behavior of youth and record and I think it 's probably more than perceived by some people but anyway pen that 's an issue that we we know the steps in place and the has been for quite a while to actually remedy the situation that unfortunately there 's still issues some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other parts of the city as well unfortunately so the other was the the application for new liquor licenses and that some that 's a that 's an issue that our community board and other community boards in the area and no data are dealing with and we just from putting out a plea for the local alcohol policy to be adopted as soon as we possibly can to make our lives a lot easier so we can get that more community input into that process I think the hearing dates been set to season August circuit of August no seas and August Jesus Navas dr. horses birth dates and all guys do in August yeah so we can 't do anything until the hearing of the appeal also sub if those by the way counselor cutter no no you don 't you don 't need to yeah it 's a second of Chickamauga the now where are we the community board significant matters of interest them I don 't want to mention that because I think it 's part of our RMA process now so I don 't really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that our city council 's nearly adopted in cultural strategy and needs to be considered along with other RMA considerations and do I mentioned the the next item of significant matters of interest as the issue of the o wacker pet continues to frustrate the board and we still have been asking their board put a notice of motion we asked for full report to be done and the report is around and it has been around for quite some time but our border absolutely been absolutely frustrated with the inability to actually see that report and to get any feedback from it so that 's that 's an issue that we are a bit concerned about then the EMA going to have a workshop from on the consultation document as our board and governance manager was just reinforced to me on the four teats of March and we 're really looking forward to that and i will give another plug for our dearly beloved culture deliver this saturday i would like to see and all of Christ chips there we 'd love to thank you whistles any questions because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buck would like to move that and seconded by and Galloway and i

NZ,NZ,Christchurch City Council,Christchurch City Council,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZETwErnCvvgbvBbnnHfyxA,09.03.17 - Item 10 - Roads of National Significance Downstream Safety Improvements,InFewkL8ahc,20170308,563.74,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1520,"and will now move on to their heart a which is part as rural roads of national significance downstream safety improvements so is on pedestrian crossing points that looks like that was not a unanimously held view if I read that right do we need to start here for this one no questions we 've got staff here if there are any questions all right with someone like I mean this is another example I guess of the conversation we need to have around road safety the proposal that we 're coming with here as it for a signalized crossing which is probably twice the cost of the zebra crossing and it 's primarily for school kids crossing the road they tend to cross at two times a day which is morning and evening and we felt probably that a zebra crossing you know care man crossing would be better the NZTA regulations in terms of the amount of traffic going down that road suggests that it that wouldn 't be safe enough and so we 've come up with the signalized crossing so that 's what we 're approving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do need to have maybe with NZTA and reviewing what we think is safe and what isn 't it 's not always just about the traffic flow I 'm sebacean who 's using it when they 're using it and how much traffic goes across that road so you know it 's a and it 's inexpensive I mean that the original budget for this was over half a million dollars then the actual budgeted cost now is 250,000 that 's a lot of money just for a little crossing so that 's something that we do want to have a look at as well but I think there needs to be a general conversation for all of us about all this traffic safety business 10 because generally if it 's a school crossing when they cross it is staffed by parents and end but I mean is that taken on by NZTA because needs to do with the amount of on the road that 's the problem as opposed to or twice a day you can have a man crossing but isn 't it the Christian that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed because of the best just a crossing anyone could get hit at any time during the day but if it is a managed crossing it the crucial times for schools you know if it doesn 't mean that it won 't be used the rest of the day yep David going away from them because they give people a false sense of security you do have the right of way to walk on that but in actual fact so you would see a trend away from zebra crossings probably secondly that there 's no mandate for the school necessarily two men that in that time now that 's their choice and they do have some schools a very proactive I don 't know in this particular case how many other pedestrian crossings I 've got have they got enough people do so that 's the other issue there is no mandate that they have to have a school patrol out there my understanding so those are the two kind of criteria coming and I suppose what 's trying to recommend is what 's become practice across New Zealand jonnie2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of priority for dangerous intersections or safety improvements well it 's not an intersex gotten its Kotwal yeah it 's a crossing yeah so in terms of the stretch of road in terms of light the idea that we spend the money here how do we know that this is like the top priority for compared to say like the other ones that we got sent through the other day a beer and it 's not there until I know that but this is not a necessary improvement that 's a safety improvement for the school which costs along right so and then right okay so and then the second question was just in terms of the number of signals that are going in do we do we know how many are going in I 've just been concerned at the number of signals that we are putting into some of our yeah crossing so but these ones only go read when somebody pushes a button yeah so that it 's not a traffic set of traffic lights it is a signalized traffic yeah and I understand that so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been some favorite to me that some of these on-demand crossings tend to get triggered when there 's actually no one crossing I think egg liev right so the one done but Dean 's erev work for the cyclist to go across they shouldn 't be being triggered on this someone 's on it and then the person decides to go through the traffic before they go and then they will go that 's what normally happens and a Muslim a time you 'll hear that suddenly there 's no traffic coming it 'll shut the road I 'm already across the street yeah sorry yeah I won 't do it anymore Erin I 'm sorry right if there 's an issue with he be a volte-face secretly super douchey yeah so are there any other questions on this one Andrey so given the conversation that we 've just heard how I 'm very aware obviously of the the puffin crossings in the way that they work because we 're having one of those installed on Norwich key in Littleton was consideration given for a smart puffin crossing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have just been raised stop saying possible oh all options were considered including a key crossing a zebra crossing but they were ruled out because the volume a terrific I demonstrate in the type of traffic on a nice ride and the design standards relating to so um can I just comment on it madam chair the-- do you want to know that 's all I more than happy to move it I because of the board 's robust debate I end concern over the cost we had a deputation around the cost that it was so high and once we drill into it we found out the actual cost was less than half of what was on the budget which raised concerns around the board of how they had come about and then because we are so responsible we also took out of the LTP another signalized intersection which is scheduled 50 meters away from where this crossing is because we just could not handle the double up of two intersections and soy zoms road does have less traffic volume then he would road and there 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got the count here we got the counts for here wood versus saw his arms I mean that the traffic volume is down here his arms I mean it relates to getting to the airport obviously and getting onto johns road but in that year yeah I know they were I 'm pretty sure though and that I 'm report that went to the community board got them in front of me 2013 here would road as 15,000 227 2013 saw his arms rotors 9427 and in the projected modeling what I saw his arms sawed his arms goes up to by 2021 eleven thousand nine hundred and sixty-three 20 31 12,000 89 and he would write at the same time 15 to 2 7 13 so I 've got he would Road reducing but it still stays more than soy 's aren 't so I 'm trying to find it on the report no I don 't want to read it on it I don 't want to read it on your own you um it 's office so let 's hear the round numbers you see in doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not securing it you are my good I just make a note that obviously the the Northern Corridor construction is started which actually will increase heavy vehicles on saw his arms road as well by quarter well I can come come give us a sasuke clarification of the comet they can secure and made around the cost and I don 't think there 's any we 've been told it could be done by half the price so do we need a resolution around that community will do the amounts in the budget yep alright alright so i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye or there 's a person no that 's Carrie thank you","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Council,U2nNc05Hcuk,20170308,749.82,"Christchurch, New Zealand",2105,do you feel sufficiently grilled thank you thank you very much now we move on to the fiend often why Mary here would community board David good morning and an interest in saving time Paula Caty report has read but I will just bring out point for the part A 's and one significant community issue and pates are obviously the roads of national significance downstream safety improvements the oldest of four point to the old school model school speed zone in the future of the old Bishop Dale community center and the 62 notes the bishop their library that continues to be built looking for an opening early june maybe july and then our other significant community issue is our brains road here Wood Road intersection which is obviously been referred back to the ward which we will move on we 'll continue to investigate everything put some like some excellent right in absence good oh thank you just reading about the BBQ offer yeah how many objections did you actually hit there was one community group which his off the top of my head of membership for around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I community group and plus there is a number of other individual objections okay decided to back away and did I 'm pulling thank you I 'm just a question on the everly park upgrade you 've got it coming back to your board on the 13th of March is that correct oh yeah so is there any concern that that you 're just responding to one small group on this and that there may be need to open it up for full consultation again that 's currently under review and it being appropriately comment at this time so your decision on that day would you be in responding to the small group that comes once once all the informations on the table on be happy to make a comment hmm and has it been too late so far and not that I there 's some more investigation being done the equipment was born purchased at the start of the year and it was before it came to our table had already been delayed for approximately three months just in the purchase of equipment equipment was purchased some time ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change any of the equipment that was signed off it is all under review at the moment of these I can 't comment but here 's the people who came to the deputation requested that some of the equipment obviously what those men requests from changing of its footplate are from its equipment use from its location but at the moment it 's under review and I 'm not pathetically okay so I 've just because then the report it states minor changes but what you 're telling us sound I hear what you 're trying to ask me and I 'll just reiterate i 'm not prepared to comment at this time you know that 's all right I 'm you at you are coming to and that 's fine but I just want to reiterate to the other counselors that the surely papanui board had a very robust consultation on this in the compromises there we did reduce the footprint considerably and and altered the playground equipment in the location of it and so I just really am concerned that this is going to actually blow up into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the reason for it is because the the existing equipment is actually beyond its use by date and safety requirements so we really do need to get on with their ref yes I 'd like to make a comment on that I mean this and the BBQ issue revealed some I guess problems with the consultation process we don 't always flush out all the views in the community and that is something that we need to think about Oh point no no speaking wait wait dan speaking is our community sorry stuff I mean we 've discussed this you ain 't down there trick it was what was going to hit that exactly so that nothing is changing about the equipment because that would involve new consultation what staff and a council member and community board member I 've done is work with the group who have had some concerns about it to see if it is possible to reduce the footprint that 's all but it will stay within the resolution around the equipment because then got the consultation process what it shows is that sometimes we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be opened in working with communities to get a an outcome that suits everyone so nothing is going to change from the original approach around the equipment there just might be some modification around the footprint so hopefully everyone will get what they 're looking for okay so we 've actually we 're asking for some advice to support council when these issues in relation to you know the legality of changing decisions you know especially when it 's simply a boundary change has taken it away from one community board and put it on another so you know so there 's still a bit more water to go under the bridge with the whole thing but it 's good to have that clarification my sorry i 'm just a subject or no it 's not a comment on that because i actually find the comments regaining the consultation really disrespectful for the glassed community board yes that is the trouble Donna it is the trouble women for a huge consultation period and a lot of people submitted on this and there was more a lot more in favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done to the design so it is a little bit disappointed for the community board to hear this come back up for discussion with one group actually chasing this this argument and for for the New finitan by Mario here word board to respond to that without actually realized in all the work that we had previously done and all the people that were in support of the actual project and the work that had changed to it so it 's disappointed hear those comments for me yeah fitness ball well I do have I actually don 't want to start this debate and we haven 't responded community concerns that so job if someone turns up at your community board you all right I 'm now playing into this um exactly the trouble was is that you know when you ask a question of a chair and and then extrapolate on that then somebody is going to reply and somebody is then going to reply so we 're not doing ourselves any service by having this conversation without having the benefit of advice and we have asked for advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shifted from one board it simply a street you know and to be blunt you know I was surprised that every Park was an findell done you know it 's just it 's a crazy boundary but we are going to look at the boundaries of the wards again and the reason that we 're doing that as part of the representation review and they won 't change until after the next election but the next election should be changed to new boundaries which will have an even spread so you won 't have three wards and one board an area and two wards and another board area it 's the disproportionate effect of the three and the two that doesn 't work so we need to actually redo the boundaries and get them so that they 're even and it may well be that five wards within the city and the one out on the boundary could produce the the numbers that we that we need so but that 's work to be done and the staff are really excited about doing another Jason review just a joke criticism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know they did because it 's fine it 's fine you will invite a response can we just talk about anything else that you 'd like to have to raise um this weekend everybody 's invited long to the culture calor this is a big surprise what a good i interact starts at twelve i think it finishes at four or 430 and hopefully the wheel is fine and we 'll have a great day ya know Colchester lures culture galore is a fantastic event and it 's is it sponsored by your ward alone now or it 's all alone of his hip we 're still in conjunction with football yeah yeah yeah restarting mover well I think it 's a fantastic initiative and the fact that it 's been going for so long and the fact that it 's to community towards coming together to help fund income is great yani thank you um I just want to ask about I throw it a new report that you 've approached dtl around bishop del mall and I just quite keen to understand how that 's working if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that that you require and just kind of get a bit of an update about what sort of work you 're doing what they say are over so so would be two weeks ago we received the report and approved the disposal of the sale of the old library which we can demolish the X as far as have Scott the land and the use of the land going forward my understanding is still in question whether it 'll be for a commercial use into a park that has yet to be decided oh sorry this was um around the idea of working with development christchurch over I 'm sorry for the the mall itself yes the old library yeah I wasn 't quite sure but it seemed like it goes together quite nice it 's working well my understanding is that there 's very engaged group of retail ously who are keen to see vet part of town or that part of our community succeed part of that will obviously be pinned with the new library which is going in there it would be interesting to try and get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currently they avoid the area and it 's it here 's a long-term future and we would like to support it and everything it can do Thanks I don 't need but but you don 't have a bus service to know it was a goes down agrees road cuts them through there we 've had this conversation with you can numerous occasions I mean just to follow up yannis questions yes we have spoken dcl about the regeneration of Bishop Delmore and it 's due for regeneration the opening up of this site once it 's demolished obviously will become part of that conversation what actually happens is once it has been demolished it will come back to the community board because it has two under the reserves act or whatever and the community board can discuss the disposal aspects of it but I think we will do that in conjunction with the local business community and the local community about if actually what we want for Bishop del more in the future and actually yeah where the transport piece fits into that yeah okay so you can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant piece of state housing and yet older people so it 'd be great to populations really grown out there ya know there 's a lot more development happening out there as well done behind on the

Zone,TIRFmaVmeks,20170308,414.12,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1142,"past all of these open minutes to Kyoto community campus school speed zone and I don 't know if is anyone got any questions on it say what I 'm really supportive of it but I just um wanted to know from staff I don 't know if there 's any stuff here just say well that 's what I 'm going to ask for is I 'm going to ask for staff that 's why I asked if there any questions so who 's speaking to the to the this one yeah okay so question oh it 's just a high-level question but you 'll see that we 've got a number of speed school speed zone reports coming through and we 've had other requests from other communities for them but they haven 't generated a report so I was just trying to understand big picture what the process is for schools to actually request to speed zone and how it 's absolutely necessary for the consideration of this report because this is revoking speed zones it 's a colocation of schools on to one site so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools and they are moving now to co-locate with the site and I understand though yes as it possibly i 'm here just to get them in my bag but it 's just obviously we 've got the petition from our board coming up yeah and we 've got to respond and we 've got about i think three or four speed yeah but we don 't need to respond to the petition today we need to respond by getting a report so if if staff could circulate to all councillors enter the community boards the process for prioritizing what are the prioritization we 're going to say this on the and the petition anyway so the process for prioritizing and and who and how people how we prioritize these school zones because there 's three per year or something so I mean we may need to make a decision and the LTP to put more money on budget to get a lot done so it was raised at a previous meeting we also talked about two technologies and things that are appropriate so maybe you also needed to upgrade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked about it a couple of meetings ago so that works been done right if could you circulate it in the meantime what the process is Tim did you have a question just without this one well I think johnny is quite right in the sense that as we only have three or a number per year per season and everyone 's wards have issues around schools so does this push the three back was this an extra so the three top ones next in the list are they being pushed down one because of this is a priority will be a certain amount of budget which will enable us to go depends on how much they they variously cost obviously I would have to get some advice on what with the priorities but this one obviously has had quite a significant change from we 're at Walt 's load has to respond a far better to do it when it 's a new school rather than two with it Peter on and then try and retrofit it is there a difference in cost associated with moving a speed zone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as as some of the infrastructure costs already catered for in the existing infrastructure that just gets moved is at the point there is we can if the if it 's applicable technology or signs whatever we will reuse what we can and even if we come we would actually reuse that stuff elsewhere but maybe it 's not still 62,000 okay so there 's no if this card jumps in the list is one school that 's going to be waiting another year and it 's already know that we have a list obviously of priorities of schools so therefore this is a perceived and concern whereas the other schools don 't and there 's not a question of that but I 'm just thinking you know what what is the what what 's the price is because obviously we 've got a new skills your new pressure therefore it takes priority over schools that have already been identified and the list of skills but these ones already have them that 's the thing but they 're moving yes but you 're assuming that they don 't have priority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do hit the ones that are on the top three nick schools on the list for speed zones have a priority and there is a system for that so is this the same budget or not it might change the priority justly for schools okay so we can meet sort of it we would result if the questions can 't be answered then we 're going to have to defer the report okay well if you leaned on the time will come back without us we are working with the Ministry of Education around the priorities of where we see the biggest bang for our buck is so basically as true as schools change and this is a change school they have to look at the list but we are working very closely with the Ministry of Education on where those priorities at a Christchurch the next one are both moved sites that both move sites so can you come back before we close off the section of the meeting and and tell us whether any other schools are being pushed down the list as a result of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this is going to hold this up is certain social drivers over the visiting sector B Delta today yep I 've asked them to come back with the specific answer the question I 'm happy to vote for both of these yeah regardless say I 'm going to put the warrant or whether I 'm asking the question yeah that 's a fair question look it is a fair question you 'll notice it one other question when you come back is um is there any requirement for the schools to contribute it in limo ministry of education history I mean I don 't know highs across reason million yeah not to our understanding but again Ryan will be able to clarify that when he comes will get down and you can do both those reports together brilliant thanks very much","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

morning counselors and staff and community great to be here this morning as we 've said the coastal build community board report we are presenting three-part A 's to you for your meeting today the one of the first ones being the higher tech community campus school speed zone the marshland school speed zone these two here you would know that the high tech community campus has merged between the avondale primary ordinary primary one only primary and other new high schools and so they 're looking at variable speed limits of 40 km Shortland Street and a modification for the variable speed limits and breezes road to better align with the new campus there the motions school has moved as you know from our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're requiring something there residential red zone provision of wastewater and horizontal infrastructure of course this has been a huge issue for the residents that still remain in the red zone and the brooklyn 's area and an even there so I just like to say that of the 44 residents that remain in the red zone 24 actually remain in the coastal booooored area and there was it was my first introduction actually to a community meeting when i was first elected and i have to say that the engagement team just handled the superbly they had a called a community meeting to give out with the residents affected and they wanted to hear from residents how they could be consult through this process which was amazing and listen to that so the community actually were able to come together and formulate how they would like to be consulted with the documents so that was a really good outcome and the engagement team were superb and that so thank you very much staff it was very much appreciated so we would like to put forward that the pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the staff and the recommendations there I just like to highlight some of the things and our report I don 't want to go through everything because there 's quite a lot going on but just to show you some pictures that we have today thank you Joe she 's been amazing putting this all together for us the staff have done a wonderful job for the new brighton library it 's been shut for six months and they had to relocate from the library and pack and sort what they were actually going to take to another location so that they could keep the service going so the justic surround I just can 't begin to imagine so fantastic effort by the staff and the pier repairs have also underway and they 'll be completed approximately in the years time we believe again that hi Otto Community Campus you can see up there they had the official opening last week and it was privileged for us to have to have a tour through and watch the students really being engaged and enjoying and being excited about learning and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think they had a couple of hundred more than they anticipated so well done to them we wish them all the best so at the moment the coastal booooored ward is probably in a holding pattern we 've got the decisions to be made by region and dcl issues like that but the community is well and alive and able to enjoy a whole lot of community events so we 've got some of those up here and as you can see one of the events that were unfortunately we had to postpone was our bus to her so here 's the invitation again on the 19th of April and we have got a nice picture of you up there for you to see we are going to squash you into a bus and give you a whole lot of fun so be here or be square is basically yeah only you decide who the drive is going to be him but if I 'm a bit but come over and them see what 's happening on our side of town or what 's not happening perhaps in some cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that i love you brighten was held on my tony day we had five to six thousand people there at thompson park was absolutely awesome top left corner so that was just amazing to the staff and all the community groups that are involved there we also had recently as you can see in the bottom right that kept me in to coast to coast this isn 't as you know as an international event and it brings great publicity to not just New Brighton but also to our city so and it was really great to see I was one of the participants I wasn 't in the actual race no so one of those participants on the sideline really encouraging everybody along the way and just to see the community get out and have little parties along the road was absolutely fantastic next like thank you we have the partners at play we did on the and febri via that weather was abut against us you see at the top but that was it was a lot of because still had fun again celebrating everything that Parkins has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the bottom there was the Children 's Day which what was unique about this will happen to be held in the red zone but and um it was unreal because they were apparently 10,000 people turned up for this was absolutely amazing and for that event to actually be organised a required 200 volunteers and a lot of the schools and community participated in that so big ups to the schools and those that got involved there they had a lot of fun so just amazing to see the red zone being used at endless capacity also there 's going to be following this very closely on the 18th the much the Polyfest which is the Polynesian festival and that 's 20 christchurch secondary schools coming together to put on something there also in the red zone on the same spot and people travel all over South Island to see watch their families in school there do their thing also we had the privilege of having a the south shore had a privilege of having a student volunteer army come out and help spruce up the place and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think Lee and you even got your gumboots on 2g up a few other people so I 'm an expert at concreting now Oh following in a proud tradition of me as a new zealand the theory impressed one of my report in the water inas was literally I 'll come to for some chips in there are over a thousand people that volunteered that day to give that community and south shore south brought in a real boost and they did the technical tricks and repairs and installed bench seats and what have you so really a big huge thank you to the student army for getting involved the only Community Board of going to officially thanked them on our behalf also the other thing that was really exciting was an event called x-rays which is we are an adult and a child come together and they do physical and mental challenges together working as a team and you know when you look up their webpage and you see what it 's all about how you 've got kids this is really something get involved and that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great family event there so it 's very exciting that your brightness able to hold all these events for the city and to bring attention to us some of the issues that we 're facing at the moment as was mentioned this morning as the levels of service but we 're working with the board on this in the staff of being amazing and as you can see up the top there one of the first things that 's been implemented we have a three month trial for the smart bombs so one of those as a recycle bin and the other one is for ways so we 're really excited to see how that 's going down there at the whale pool after three months and hopefully it can be extended to other areas of the city very shortly the other probably issues that we 've are still very much in the for people 's minds and around uncertainty as the natural hazards especially in the south shore and South New Brighton so those things are a real concern for the people in our area we need to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are also reviewing community response plans as part of the development of the community board plan also we 've just got to acknowledge the red zone read the work that regeneration regenerate christchurch is doing for the red zone areas the under consultation process that 's going out at the moment to get people involved in the regenerate reference and visor ii group so nominations for that close on the twelfth of march but a great big thank you to regenerate christchurch and their team and everything that they 're doing there we also have greater new bright and regenerate regeneration that developed Christ future hitting their part of that is they 've got up creating momentum fund which is empowering some of the community with their ideas that it 's an exciting initiative they 've got up and going there also you will see that we 've got the first sign gone and just an indicator to the community that things are actually going to be starting with the whale pool revamp their so that 's very exciting so I gained a huge thank you to development Christchurch for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it today it has been behind the scenes but certainly we 're going to start things seeing things come to the fore so great to be able to see some action coming there some of the other issues we 've got view of just got that poor old South Brighton boardwalk fear that you can see how it was on the right and how it is after the earthquake there in six years of just as India so that 's something that 's very dear to I have a community board have us for the south to come back with options of repair for their ends and costings the up and coming events that just can 't be must as we 've got three big ones coming up as the new brighton surf lifesaving championships 1500 athletes will be coming into the area on the 16th 19th of March and we 've also got the ray white duke new brighton juke festival of surfing which is going to overlap with the surf lifesaving but that 's great because they all love each other so they 're all going to share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at that picture up the top right they are thought it looked a little bit like aaron killin and another life during a hand I 've be honestly if the waterside yeah my apologies because a jury me yeah so for the Duke festival will just say it 's going over a nine-day period I got close to here it 's a massive event that so professionally being organized as four days stiff competition outdoor surfing surfing movie night for that one for the kids one for the outs you don 't have to be a super to enjoy this whole thing we 've got there 's a rock concert surfboard exhibition and surfing beach art nor the art gallery that they had in the art for sale was absolutely outstanding last year so check that out come and have a look also part of that is going to be the GM you brightened youth music they 're going to do they get youth on the stage as the opportunity for them and a non-performing and a non-competitive way to get used to a stage and to show their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got children and your communities got children where they want to they love music get them down there to see what can be done will be encouraged and inspired the other thing that we have going on and the 22nd of March is a dune restoration trust conference and there is a free evening for the community for their engagement and a seminar so that is going to be held at the New Brighton club and that is it from us Thank You Tessa um Rick yeah thanks for that I mean it 's fantastic seeing this community reports there 's so much going on it 's very exciting the one question the boardwalk I mean this is something we talked about at the the volunteer army some years ago that that 's the type of project that could be completed by the SBA and even the engineering society so in terms of labor and even potentially design you know that could save a huge amount of money and it 's something that 's fairly low impact in terms of health and safety issues so that 's something that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that to the University about that now because you could have you know a thousand fifteen hundred people out there building that thing very very clearly what we thought vast variety of options include community and other groups actually doing it I mean the cost that came back from estimation was nine hundred thousand dollars which is about forty thousand dollars or meter that 's rich and we have an insurance budget of 300,000 so yes but actually it fits it actually helps them as well as it can be a project they can do I mean there 's a lot of Education to cover they did the entire circuit for the south shore smush last Saturday and they did all the weeding as well so they got rid of all of the noxious weeds and they did the picnic area which I mean it was extraordinary but when you have you know a thousand people front up it 's that many hands make it yeah and it 's a great working opportunity as well it 's a great optic in look they loved it and then there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yeah I 've got you next best friends now as I 'm sort of going down and it was just great fun yeah so and I forced him a forester wonderful part ranger to go on television yes he was he was he was he didn 't want you no no no I 'm not going to go on television so I told the TV one came from and that he in it he was instructed by the media television because he had much bit of a story to tell than I could tell because in any place that you see it I can go on holiday now because this is this has done months of work all done and one one morning they got it done by one o 'clock it was amazing so that 's a yes this would be a fantastic project for that yeah Thank You grand idea yep yani another note um I don 't know if you saw the article on the wii sport and the bike path that they 'd put in there with the community so i 'm all for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's really important to involve local communities as well and so if you get seven hundred gravity students you can add assume community members and you 've suddenly got over a thousand people yeah I just want to maybe if maybe we should think about inviting if there are in town the people from the Westport to kind of just talked very what they 've done because it 's pretty extraordinary story mm yeah yeah thanks you having um clean mention my dear but it 's bought these three hundred thousand and the budget so I think we can build it to budget with a lot of people I 've owned over just wanted to acknowledge Mike Burke here because we last time I saw Mike I think was that fairly direct amusing that we headed Brooklyn 's over the pressure wastewater system and it really is a quite a turnaround from other experiences that we 've had over that system and I think a lot of it began with that meeting which you attended Kim you first where I think we do it really hard to dig pretty deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had kind of first dibs at how how we actually went about the in-game munication and it 's that hard work and you know people have to really try and rise above things but it 's pretty full-on meeting but I think we 've got there now i 'm beyond infill awesome report love love seeing what 's going on out there actually it was really good I 'm but you did touch on once something that I just want to understand maybe what the board are doing around what you see it with South Shore and South new brighton area with the the flooding and and some of the work that 's going on there the temporary stock banks and other works can you tell us a little bit more about what the board is doing and what they 're looking at there because there is a big issue and we we do need to start thinking about it there 's a big issue um we know that the community have come together to put something to as a proposal to to the community boards are we waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think when it comes to the flooding we 're waiting for the the peer review of the chocolate and taylor report and also just perhaps we 're needing to also find out from south with the Easter each because that has great significance on the flooding and the area so there are those things are stop banks there we understand that there are some strengthening going on there so yeah we 're encouraged that it 's not forgotten but we need to keep on to that yeah not too sure they 're just getting the community consultation the community are consulting the community on that so it 'll be coming to us as soon as I 've got it really it should be yeah yeah Christian yep yeah I do yes it 's good to see that you 're on top of it is at least in that respect because it is something with the huge issue and all these were definitely having to get some resolve here very quickly yeah thank you so fill in Pauline thanks come it 's a very impressive report so much really actively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing the track work with a student volunteer that 's that 's stunning and my question is really refer to the community response plans the need for that so is that something that the board which is the engagement for that is that an area that the board is leading or will leave in the future too we 've had some workshops on that so um maybe you want to speak a little bit of it Joe but we have actually had some workshops on that I 'm a very strong indication from community of course because the evacuation of the on that night of the earthquake in the tsunami warning issues and all those dynamics around that community of wanting answers and answers soon a lot of our community do actually have their own resilience plans for evacuation but we 're needing to have that cohesive approach and the community board want to be cleaning and that will you know where the council are also doing their own investigations and just debriefing and looking back in hindsight on on certain issues so we 're waiting for that report to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other workshops to further a plan right will be interesting here the outcome thank you thank you that that 's it that 's actually really good to hear because you know the review that the council 's doing is just to look at what happened and you know but the solution for evacuation evacuating that number of people and well depending on you know I mean I yeah I have a view about whether we should sound sirens for a close proximity earthquake or whether because I mean I 've got a few about the sirens so it 's different from the council that made the decision to put them in the first place so the we test the sirens but we don 't test the community 's readiness for evacuation and we don 't ask the community to think about who their neighbors are that might need to be evacuated and if we reduce the number of cars on the road for an evacuation if we need to evacuate then you wouldn 't have every household on their own so I think the community itself is going to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of communities a series of exits in a series that have to be managed in different ways because there 's somebody is going to have to be authorized to direct traffic until the police arrive and they can only be one way and then what do you do with people who 've got something on the other side of the bridge and they haven 't been home when the sirens called so all of those things need to be worked out and work through but there isn 't a template for a coastline the scale of the numbers of people that we 've got in bordered by river this virus on I 've looked around you know that the rest of the South Island there 's nothing like Christchurch 's coastline anyway there 's a lot of work to be done but it 's each community by community needs to do that work so I 'm really pleased to hear that the community board want to lead that is thank you good so Pauline yes fantastic report it 's just so heartening to see is ref see everything happening out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know rights from New Brighton but you 've given us another whole perspective on it today and I think that 's so exciting I 'm just on that the Belfast Community Network are working on a civil defense plan and I think they 're working with coastal ward now set correct go fast I 'm sure every sorry I don 't I don 't open today he 's pretty sure that they 're pulling up but my question is the coastal dunes seminar can you just give me a little bit more detail on what that 's actually about in the purpose of it please can we distribute some information around yeah I 've just I 've just picked up a link to it that 'd be grand Alicia 's with something with my life Damon Anna um it sounds at what time I gotta get away by there there 's a 45 day but conference but the similar is community is just a free sim enough the committee as at night and this is how the whole truth there 's a whole conference as the national conference for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brighton okay look I 've got the link to it i 'll send it to your mounting so that 's exactly what i was looking up because i thought that sounded excellent and extremely interesting so I 'll circulate it to everyone coastal dunes alright um in Vicki on any projects I 'll send to their details if you like but just a question and you mentioned Polyfest about to happen I can 't find dates or anything Oh a tenth of March I think so 80s mad March it in the same places as the children 's we split screens Children 's Day awesome thanks come yeah thank you because i 'll just say about children 's day i think because there was a bit of stuff in the media around whether we should be using you know hagley park versus the red zone because i 've been off the view as others have been that the red zone needs to be opened up to the people christchurch they need to re-engage with it and holding events there as an exceptionally good idea I thought it was the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know it had plenty of room for people cinti of room for parking it just had everything going for it lots of trees with that people could sit under people were spread around there were lots of activities I just thought it was it was absolutely fantastic Ryan fairburn who maintains its thrilled with the way it was lived well so he they did an extra special job and actually I paid tribute to them and my speech because I said you know that the people that have been caring for the area actually put on an extra effort beforehand and I think that really encouraged people to make an extra effort and he wants leaving at green bins hint hint but I can 't seem to make headway anyway or just slip them making a note there somebody yes Dave Dave 's taking it on he 's making a great job and it 's community lead yeah it 's great all right well thank you very much thank you very much and I guess that Glen and Dave would like to move and sickened the report we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them immediately afterwards yep yep those separate papers yep so i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those

public forum I 've got Chloe albertini of the inspire or foundation in spiral yeah he 's going to talk about the otaku orchard thank you adds an area good morning councillors thank you to Vicki back for inviting me to speak briefly to you today I promise I won 't take up too much of your time and that way what I have to share is very excited so for those of you who don 't know me I 'm Chloe oddity knee I 'm a coordinator with the food resilience Network and I 'm leading the autographer orchard project this project which I 'm sure you 're all familiar with is the crown jewel and our shared vision to make Christchurch the best edible garden city in the world and yes that 's directly from your food resilience policy and so we 've been making really great strides with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars in grant funding and public donations and over without a hundred thousand dollars an in-kind sponsorship from industry partners we 've got fully costed designs for both the edible park and the building and we 'll be applying for consent in the coming weeks just last night we submitted a major funding application to lotteries for the construction costs of the building its all full steam ahead you could even say that it might be the fastest progressing anchor project in the city all powered by the amazing spirit of the Christchurch community and of course that 's where you come in we 've really appreciated the support so far of both the council and council officers and taking the project to this point and now the only thing standing between us and delivering the project this year is being able to attract the financial resource to do so so right now we 're crowdfunding as you might have seen in the paper yesterday and we really need your help to get this across the line I know you 're all incredibly connected to your communities and will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your legacy preserved for decades in one of Creighton Christchurch 's most delicious park by having a brick named after you perhaps even stomping up to name a tree it could really great beer grapefruit okay I 'll quit with all the puns but please feel free not only to pledge and spread the word through your networks but also to connect me with people businesses and organizations who would welcome the opportunity to invest in this inspiring project for Christchurch my contact details are on the plea to me page thank you and I thought I would just speak very very briefly and then if you have questions you can this plenty of time for those very good does anyone got any questions yeah thank you I just um remember last time you came one of the concerns was around security of tenure yeah and we had a resolution to asked after work with you around the project yeah and including looking at the security or ownership issues oh and one for us now I was so we initially had a five-year lease that started in febri last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all partners including the council and departments and autographer limited and also the Canterbury horticultural society is to have a um a 10-year lease with two rights of renewal and sitting with the cadbury horticultural society who are one of our key partners on the project and so that 's something that 's definitely being looked at and and that should be signed off in the coming weeks it 's good news yeah I just clarify like your understanding of who owns the land so the crown owns the land and they 're an auto a kilometer other agency looking after that and and what their understanding is of the future ownership of the land is that it will transfer to counsel so that 's why council have been involved in those discussions okay good news great um Phil thank you and thank you I 'm just wondering like in terms of say your policies in the process you have is there a way that the garden would be spray free or organic yes it 's absolutely going to be organic yeah it 's LA thank you anyone else I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's just such great news about getting read 10 years ordered us yeah and and we got 250 thousand dollars from the router foundation towards building last year and so that 's a really great vote of confidence as well and I said everything 's really coming together and there 's so much good well involved and the the thing that 's important about the crowdfunding is first of all it demonstrates the funders in to everyone that this is something that the community really wants and wants to invest in and that 's something that we 've said all along so really important for that to go ahead also it is the chance for our community people business organizations to get their name on the project and when I think about the project being built and the experience of people walking through that I want it to look like it 's community owned and so that 's really key for key for that and I guess you had challenges is that every single council are sitting here including the mayor should make a pledge on pledge me codeine seed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballpark for Christchurch is that a good enough head for you absolutely horse and of course share it through your networks and share on Facebook and Twitter and Instagram and everything else you 've got nobody got facebook and twitter those things right onto it thank you very very much and now the next one is the deputation by appointment but I do notice that the Deputy Chair of one of the submitters today will be will be included in the deputation so might just have a conversation about that later so Mike O 'Donnell Pam Richardson and John mica speaking regarding the little rubber Big Ideas project reference from item 20 thanks financial Oh community board report to Council come on good morning I 'm mecha die from this river then this is Tori this is John both of whom being part of the project group just to tell you a little bit this morning about how the plan came about it 's a true community plan as it was born in the community and the state that you see it now and it 's entirely community created so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot chocolate song and twist it a little bit it started with a flood so whoever has so much better than a cursed yeah but lasted longer it 's a little bit was flooded probably as far back as anyone living there now can remember but we had a couple in quick succession one of them was we were 12 was a lot the worst flood in 100 years at 100 year flood and three weeks later we had another one and just to sort of personalized it when that happens we get about a meter of water through the main street little river the shop is flooded out the café 's voted out the garage is flooded out and yet they 're more familiar than they 'd like to be with it and I got a bit of a fright because we had 40 centimeters of flowing water under my house which is only 40 meters from the econo and I had to carry my children to the fire station because i thought the flood was severe enough to knock them over and what that did was that that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agencies around some flood mitigation and so we got together with he can we got together with the council and we gotta a targeted rate agreed for mitigation measures so that 's one of the real positive that 's come from this now I 'm out of that became a plan which was called the the issues and options plan which was done by a local planner so she happens to work at Lincoln University that Suzanne dr. Suzanne valance she put together a plan and its scope widened somewhat so it wasn 't just about floods and flood mitigation it was about what the community wanted what the concerns were and start talking things like speed limits and footpaths and connecting cycleways and plantings and water quality all sorts of stuff and now I come from a small community there are if you include coop town and birthings flat that are probably somewhere between 11 and 12 hundred of us and anyone from here that has a background with small communities now sit generally where they can they take care of themselves they own they own stuff they step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from my background which was in consultation with the old banks finisher District Council Werdum that everybody tells people like yourselves what the cumin see wants how how do you know that really is what the community wants and not just the view of one person so really that was the issue that we wanted to result we have all these people with lots of them passion and ideas working kind of separately and then we have agencies like yourselves who don 't quite know what the community wants and and just want to do the right thing you want to you want to do what the local government act us you were doing which is to reflect the needs and wants it your community but you need to know what they are and you need to better trust what you 're being told so this plan put together a consultation process so there were already been consultation that went into the issues and options paper so we already had some good founding stuff there and so we took this out to the community and we asked them what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because i know we 've run got ten minutes there 's some wacky stuff in there and that 's how you know it 's real so my other job or one of my other jobs is I 'm on the board chair for the local school we want to make sure that the voice of children was heard in this and I might have pushed that a little bit myself and Tory was good enough to go in and interview the kids in the classrooms just set them around said what do you want so this stuff in there if it 's heavily reflected that playgrounds and want it then that they need a shop in Little River when they 've already got a sharp this stuff like that 's but you know that that 's genuine input from the community so what we 've done is we 've collected all these ideas and thoughts and we 've had fantastic backing from the council them from staff and from the team that are based in little river so one of the men my messages to you is keep that up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've got a plan which captures what we think people want we don 't have priorities we 've identified agencies that might be able to help so people like yourselves might be able to help with some of the local roading stuff and footpath stuff with cycleways and so on so we got the prioritization and then what we 're using this plan for is a mustering point for all those groups working separately to come together so how do you know who else is interested in your stuff and we stir this charters on Polly sure I 'm age now but in UK we service charming thing when you started a game up in the playground you 're just kind of put your arm around one another and you went round and you chanted who wants to play and that 's what this plan is really doing it 's who else is interested in stuff that I care about and who 's prepared to grab a spade who 's prepared to talk to people who prefer to advocate for it so what I 'd sophie is it this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a hundred submissions or pieces of content to it or hydrogen well had 400 thank you that 's one of those we 're not done we 'll get more input will get it 'll evolve some of the ideas in there we might decide to shelve but that 's what I plan does it kind of grows and it changes and evolves with what the community needs I 'd also put to you that in a way we 've done your job for you mmm now it 's a curious your board that 's kicked that off so they put us at the credit and that is you in the broader sense but you know you don 't have to do all that hard work of finding out what have we do the right thing here because we 're telling you what the right thing is can I not in the nicest process is music to my ears you know okay so to go back to it you know small communities in particular own their own stuff and there are projects in there that we need your help with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together and there are some that are just worried about local people pulling finger and so I think this is a fantastic thing to have done and you know i 'd recommend it to any other small community out there on I understand diamond Harv is working on one at the moment and and this is just a real a really good model for community engagement I think so whatta mask interview is continue to back your community listen to us please ask questions by all means if if you say look who sets though is that just you make or as have you got some wider mandate here by all means ask those questions we have all those submissions on record if you need to backcheck exactly who said what we 've got all that and I think I 've talked enough look have you heard of something called the community resilience partnership fund so it 's only just been established so I wouldn 't be surprised if you hadn 't heard of it because it only got worse much ancient in the press but it what it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beasts and precisely the sort of initiative that you 've just described which is not so much investing in a project but investing in a community so that the community can lead the partnership with the council so when it 's not abandoning communities to do things on their own it 's actually investing in the community so it 's got the capacity to develop up the ideas that we can then assist with and the normal process so and end because when the community leads there are also other access access to other funding mechanisms you know you said de targeted bright but also you can get a private you know you can get Charitable Trusts donating you know so this is the yeah the sum is greater the whole is greater than the sum of the parts I 'll go right this time so music to my ears so questions comments injury um I 'll make a comment I think this is an excellent piece of work I mean when we put some fifteen thousand dollars on budget for the development of this type of thinking and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ document or a plan in this way was really just to to get some conversation going in communities like Little River and diamond harbour as you say is the other one we we were hopeful that some good ideas would come out of that what you 've produced is is something I think way beyond what we expected and the great thing about this for me is that there 's been so much input into it from so many different sources and then there are projects that drop out of it most an action plan that drops out of it but not all of those projects need to be canceled delayed projects not all of them involve council funding there are community led projects here there are community funded projects here there are partnership project between various entities sometimes involving Council and also there 's a sense of the priorities that the community is got for council led projects and things council should be doing as well so I think we 've got a lot to learn from the work that you 've dumped I think it 's a really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a relatively small investment of fifteen thousand dollars I believe that yeah we 've got something here which has got far greater value than that and will actually serve as a blueprint for Little rivers wishes desires priorities to be to be recognized for a long time to come recognizing that this obviously remains a work in progress in those priorities will change and things may be added to this in the future but um yeah really just to say well done for the work you 've done what we 've got is is an excellent document which will lead to I 'm sure some really good outcomes from Little River thank you Andrew I know you just remind me of something I 'm just fronting this today the real chair Janet Reeves is a real driving force behind this and she 's the one that 's made that happen she 's had the expertise she 's drawing people together she 's pushed when she needed to she 's encouraged when she needed to she can 't be here today but but a lot of it 's down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community board too yeah no I didn 't mean to sort of say that before because but that pain will be sitting up at the table as the deputy chair of the board when it comes to the report itself so and as you say you 've highlighted an element of the report but we all know what Pam 's invested in it as well so that 's just a great model so thank you very much for your time it 's greatly appreciated and I think we 'll be reaching out to you otherwise and the very near future so thank you thank you very much and,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

morning so we 've got Stuart maunder the general manager we 've got Anna hurt just the education and development coordinator and we 've got Matt maling the director of New Zealand opera thank you very much indeed for joining us if you 'd like to come forward to the table and you 've got 10 minutes to make your presentation this morning if you didn 't use all the 10 minutes then that might leave some time for questions so thank you very much indeed for joining us welcome and I 've just started my fourth year with the company and now more than ever we are very very proud to to second that council statement in the long term plan that arts and culture thrive in Christchurch and we believe that that means having a resident provider of opera in one of the great theaters in this country that 's the Isaac Theatre Royal we go forward I 'm not technologically exciting okay Museum of opera as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has an annual turnover about 7.4 million and since 2014 the company has increased that output from 21 main stage performances to nearly forty one in 2017 and as well as eight performances of large cellco presentations with festivals and orchestras and our mission you know its track plan is to contribute to the cultural life of our community by creating all of these diverse opportunities for people to experience the power of of opera and from the outset when I joined this organization I believe we needed to perform our way to sustainability in 2016 we presented two productions in Christchurch up from one from 2012 when we merged and that was answering the call of our many benefactors and supporters here who said that they needed this community to have more opera they could only support us if we were here more than once a year because we couldn 't be seen then as a truly integral part of the Christchurch I 've seen unless we performed more than once a year so as a result I believe that the our company is now a vital thread in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the National Opera Company in this in this city I believe is what helps to make Christchurch a memorable place to visit and to stay and live for the company it 's a great thrill to perform in the Isaac Theatre Royal it 's possibly the most perfect opera theatre in this country and in the last 12 months we 've enjoyed an incredibly successful season of Treve Arthur and Sweeney Todd and next week we bring our new option of Mikado to town now for audiences this is a chance to hear and see these masterpieces in the area to which they are meant to be seen and heard and we are of course invited to Christchurch Council who helped make this happen each year last year at 600 is no six thousand seven hundred and eighty-seven patrons attended our offerings in Christchurch in 2016 and in 2017 this looks set to beat that number as well and we have a very happy policy of presenting as many new zealand singers as we possibly can and many now have thriving international careers and we endeavor to bring them all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rhodes is the title role in in Sweeney Todd and a lady called Rochelle pike in Rachel pike in Traviata we did that with four different experts in Travie are 25 in Sweeney Todd two in the forthcoming Mikado and four in common which we go to see in july this year this is of course on top of the 11 local singers that we showcase in principal roles and over the hundred and fifty local singers in our courses nationwide and we 're a major employer of course of artistic talent in this city and the engagement of Kiwi artists is an important part of our work we harness this country 's great wealth of talent by employing all local performers designers technicians and particularly the company 's chorus of local singers and for every production we employ the city 's great Orchestra the Christchurch Symphony Orchestra and this year I 'm happy to say on two occasions as it was last year now in these interesting economic times collaboration is the name of the game and New Zealand operas is passionate about bringing opera to as wide an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partners provides us with a particularly thrilling way to continue to deliver interesting and challenging work to our audiences in 2018 we 're planning to work with the Christchurch Symphony to deliver a spectacular opera in concert exclusively for Christ 's Church in the refurbished hall we have a very very good relationship with the Christchurch festival and are working towards inclusion in this next festival and we also continue to engage communities through all of our outreach and education activities targeting everybody from school children to seniors and as with 2016 over 2300 young kids from the schools in the Christchurch area from Diamond Harbour to ashburton experienced a specially devised production of elixir of love don 't said his great work and for most of them this was their first taste of opera and if nothing else it proved to them that opera is not a dirty word this year we go to present a new production of don pasquale to a projected three thousand children in the in the Christchurch area that 's up from last year obviously and it means that people are actually enjoying having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pre-performance talks in many u3a lectures in workshops in dress rehearsal attendance and our design and creative workshops where we use local designers to work with children allowing those kids to get up close and personal with the operatic art form and usually that culminates in attendance at the Opera so we continue to provide opportunities for many of the local arts practitioners here to develop their craft to pursue opportunities to perform of course but also to take part in workshops and stagecraft sessions we 're also forging very strong links with tertiary institutions in the Christchurch area particularly the University of Canterbury and Mazda involving those students in workshop and master classes often with our our visiting artists so for us there 's no doubt that the grant funds that are allocated by the council are to New Zealand opera more than doubled in the worth I we believe that we give back to the town in visitors to the city and eateries in hotels in local employment in addition of course to the need for all of our artists to be fed watered and housed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the national companies presence in Christchurch we believe means that this city can experience high quality operatic fair and can experience it so next week we hope to see you all I know many of you have RSVP 'd to The Mikado at the Isaac theatre royal perfect theater to see that piece interestingly that was performed back in 1887 in Dunedin and its second tour in that year was in Christchurch in the Isaac theatre royal so it 's 127 years ago that we will see we will celebrate that almost to the day that we 've opened in Christchurch so we thank the council for your continued support and we advocate that it would be great if we were here for another 10 years or 50 years or whatever it is but we love being here so thank in 2017 where 's the company are happy to say that we offer more new opera to New Zealanders than ever before and we thank the council for allowing us to make that slogan true thank you great thank you very much thank you for the presentation that does leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions thank you yeah yes thank you for joining us this morning thanks very much for you continued commitment to Christ Church as well as it 's very important for the cultural health and sitting

Fund,9pJQaiezMB8,20170301,470.96,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1351,"mm6 the Metropolitan discretionary response fund and we have three items to consider here Presbyterian support CS and the free theatre and we 've got recommendations around all three the recommendation on the free theatre has in fact changed and the thinking there is that it would allow some more detailed work to be done by the committee who would then make a recommendation back to Council it just gives the benefit of a little bit more time to consider this more fully so the committee can then make a recommendation back to cancel for council to make a decision at that point Mike welcome to the table did you have any comment you wanted to make on the report ok the council has have any questions and thought that wasn 't here for the info I was quite happy to move item 3 that we do make that funding now just my question is why were referring it back to a committee for more work who yeah so that was my question yeah i mean the thinking was that there have been some discussions with that group in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this morning was that it would be helpful for the committee to be able to have a more detailed discussion with staff prior and to better understand the reason for the recommendation and maybe to find a way through this so that they could come back to council with a recommendation from the committee we just thought it was a better way of working that may get to a point that you would be comfortable with anyway cool thank you Tim yet the other is was it 's a with it 's quite good for the community to say that relationship with the free theatre and it to start building their so see Erin yeah my question is actually I 've read were you thinking of going against the staff recommendation and just recommending they did get the Fanning wreck we didn 't actually sound that out this morning odd seeking their I think the thinking was that sending it to the committee would allow for a more detailed discussion that may end up at that point anyway and rather than having staff come to the table and explain all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better head of the committee Jim part of the raising of going to the committee was to build up their relationship so we 're not here in 12 months and 12 months and 12 months and so we get a better decision it might take a wee bit longer but it 's going to be a rope of value decision to build up that relationship because if you just say you said no yes and no it doesn 't do anything in 12 months so let 's build some resilience and some relationships of the committee and the free tier and go forth from me I think that 's important is it only something that 's mean certainly something we did in the last term of council and it 's something that I 'd be quite keen to seem to continue in this term Jamie um quick question on this mr. chair and I obviously we spoke about this at the informal but i 'm just wondering and please tell me what I 'm missing here but if the rationale is that the council probably doesn 't have that information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so we 're sending that to the committee for the committee to do wouldn 't it make sense then for the committee just to make that decision because then it 's only going to seem to back to a group of people within that haven 't built up their relationship so I think we are the trust we don 't will it not make sense just to simply delegate it to that committee I 'd be a starter for that and I think that it 's just saves everyone at a time sounds like a good suggestion can we get some staff advice on that is that a decision that council is able to delegate to that committee for them to make the decision it yes yes like what could I move that we that three is that we delegate to the community committee to make up so reading the ocean or the made the decision rather I just think that for the people that aren 't lean on that committee we 're back into the same situation again yeah absolutely yeah now that makes perfect sense so so refer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management social and development can be C 2 for consideration and decision on the application so that has the that wording has the effect of delegating the decision-making to the committee then we probably need to include the word delegate that 's exactly what I was thinking yeah for consideration and delegates the decision on the application to that committee yeah perfect and that makes it absolutely clear and that means the committee can do the detailed work and then make the informed decision at that time yeah great thank you so um we 'll continue with questions so I 've got Phil and then Mike so thank you Mike with that last step location I just wondered when it comes to the committee if information around the events that have been held you know what theater events and what what actually has progress said even since your current report or be useful sure and probably it 's a good idea fellas chair of that committee for you to have some conversation with Mike about any extra information because might need in order to enable that full of consider incineration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many ways the very reason for referring it to the committee is to allow for that further detailed information to be available Michael thanks just a quick question about the implication from presbytery support in the past that looks like the last four years they 've been funded 20,000 why they increase 230 the scope Gail come to the table coerce st application I 'm Gail pain auto pissing on disability advisor and the reason is increase in client numbers and increase and frailty in complexity of clients and in order for those people to still be our residents and living in our community they need a service which as I 'm specific to their needs and this is quite a creative one I can give you the numbers so in fifteen sixteen year they had for the service 35 volunteers helping they now have 55 and they supported a hundred people they now support 150 so that 's the reason thank you okay so do we have a mover for these resolutions Tim seconded by film okay so Jamie we 've picked up your amendments in there in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet as legs I don 't need to move it if everyone else is happy with it ya know all right that 's great so is there any debate on this Phil just a point about the Presbyterians support one it to me it really stands out and I think gal has answered about the increased work that is happening but also just to remind counselors at sexy and the report that counselor part of Health and all places policy that 's what we signed up to and this is an outstanding example where a scale referred through where this organization from a county level and from a professional clinical social work level work work in this area and it 's I think it 's great that we are able to support it thank you I 'll put motion all those in favor say aye against that 's carried thank

2,_r9IBeA00VI,20170227,763.82,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1847,"trying to understand how have basically not to reflect on each individual one as a group around the table today so the proposal is that community boards be invited to submit on all the master plans in their areas with a view to ensuring that the budget reflects the priorities for those areas now sitting behind that will be the briefings that we are going to have with dcl who have done some preliminary work but have some more work to do and also probably later on this is to be you know perfected this is to ensure that the budget reflects the priorities for those areas so that means to make sure that it 's entered this into the annual plan so for adoption by the when when the annual plan comes back for finalization but but what will also be sitting on behind and just to reflect some of the conversations we 've had is it as a an ideal ideal of having a point workshop with the community boards and the council together so that we 've got their full understanding about the work that 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of date some of them need to be updated and some of them just need to be got on with so there will be different views expressed by different community boards in relation to these there are areas that don 't have master plans that ought to have a regeneration plan and that will come out of the discussion as well I 'm Sarah can I just check that with the looking at ensuring that the budget reflects the priorities for those areas is that for their areas of each master plan I know yeah because our board would hit struggle to prioritize for example between the otrs between two year you prioritize each one yeah because we 're five yeah gustaria the other room um I 've just had a good chat with staff so minus ten like the wolf stone village one that there is money that we can do the planning and we can sort that out with talking to the community board and I 'm for the final annual end decision that the one that is ready to go as Sumner yeah and we would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's currently on the LTP so my understanding is that staff could go to tender very quickly if we 're not seeing that we deferring the funding and personally that would be my preference and I think the rights impact would be pretty negligible don 't know exactly what it would be but I did have one thing that I was going to raise for that which made a bit cheeky but I hope my colleagues will just allow me just to raise it and it may be a solution was that we did I thought put money on for the worst Lee Kashmir Road intersection which I don 't know what year that zone it may be that that 's out and a year given what 's happened and therefore there may be a you know a possible swap which wouldn 't have any rates impact can we just our staff cause you 're my for their 14 ideas and anyway it was just so ya know I say Bryce sorry can we just us and staff about we 're the Sumner where 's the Sumner village master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward yep so that we can start work and this funny until you enter the entity is money this current one so bring it forward into the 17-18 it was proposed to be deferred bringing 500 from 1920 into 17 18 yeah and then you 've got it instead of a million dollars and one hurt you 've got two lots of 500 it would allow construction to continue in the financial year that we run now desert know we were already working it 's already in here yeah being hit 500 k sorting of all the fiber cave for 17 18 in another 500 k 4 18 19 yeah to complete the construction or the sumner be 1.1 moon do we need anything and here to say that yeah do we doing this what do we need it was a draft ideas for us that the notice check like thought before we do that because my undersea is again that will delay that project and it 'll put over two years so I mean what would be the current budget impact of just keeping it on the existing LTP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year well I think you need to separate that budget from national materially delay the project so the staff at voices yeah every time those two years won 't materially delay the project many more than the challenges that the project Jordan has which budgetary they ask difficult challenges and we 're good that they are not challenges that have been brought to the board at this point so the board didn 't know that there was a delay so when would we got the tender that we agree to this amendment sit there for a year that this is not this is not what 's being proposed is it that funding remain is currently programmed in the LT in the LTP is what yannis asking but what 's being proposed as 500 and maybe i can give you the wording that what we 're proposing is to reface from 2019-20 500,000 into 2017 18 for the summer village center master clean p 1.1 yeah and I 'd be happy to move there okay so um not that 's my so so that 's y Arnie 's amendment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not having the million and one hurt it 's having over two years it 's just bringing one lot of 500 forward from there so it was halted after recommending the year 1617 is irrelevant to the San your plan so I don 't know why that numbers there at all leave that out so you 're wanting the one point 0 37 million for 17 18 and you 're saying you can split it across the two funny staff were advising that there wouldn 't be any material difference and delivering the project if we split over two years 408 and this year and we can go out yeah so can we have the wording that there 's agreed so the amount for 17 18 is five hundred and thirty-seven thousand in 30 days hang on five hundred and thirty-seven thousand intercity in Israeli thousand what and then 500,000 for 18 19 and then so it we 're not noting that the Summoner Village project what if that 's going to be what we agree to is that we can bring forward the funding of account be constructed sooner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funding if required we can know that the Summoner village master plan take out the words project p 1.1 and then leaving the word funding so delete up to funding is rephrased nao azri phased as we phased as follows to enable tender and construction to proceed yep follows to enable yet to enable tendrán that 's I 'll be phased yes still she yeah as follows to enable and then delete the words up to tinder now delete the words up to tinder up to yeah to enable take out the words remain as currently programmed in the LTP yep and then take out there IE and put a colon instead up the full stop cool right is it yes good okay so what 's the rates impact of doing that and the impact of all the changes of that 's been approved is to increase the rates in the eighteen nineteen year not the annual planea from 5.52 5.53 right but no change in the annual plan year at all yeah great thank you thank you alright so so you 'd like to move this Sierra will you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question I had was if construction can happen quicker is it- things we do hope we should have a process to run forward funding of you know we can actually tender a contractor to be constructed so so would that have an impact on rates for the annual plan year well if we bought funding for word no no light at the end of it if we contractor and we can get it time to clicker a zero change proposal or something that can come through doors well i mean that you can this is apropos pope there 's a process for doing that affair if you need to but it 's not something they would take on here doesn 't alright personal so i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye aye those opposed say no that 's carried and narrow to 12 27 so um Curtis from right counselors that if they 're going to offer the colleagues projects that had already been to local no it 's important we are nowhere either go to any cost yeah gonna either adjourn the meeting term and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to just put the motion to a vote so so we 've got the annual plan as amended and it 's been moved and seconded and I would like to put that notion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and Aaron Aaron no so so that 's carried now the next step in the process could you just remind us what happens next because you 'll be coming back to us with the consultation document just for final sign-off yes on the 9th of March yes and then it will go out for public consultation and so the public can expect to see this heading the the trips that are about the on the twentieth of March and they will be invited to be making submissions on the draft annual plan so this is on the consultation document which will attach be attached to the all the information that will sit behind it right okay so so thank you very much and i know that staff have put on a tremendous amount of work to bring us to this point the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wii way to go so thank you to everyone for all of the work that you 've done and for colleagues to i know that these

Region,v16ZR0K5ZLk,20170222,758.99,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1969,for the public session as the training of agreement between local authorities in the Canterbury region I know that one of my colleagues has something to say about that so he better hurry up and get back into the room so I thought that but I 'll move the motion so do I have a seconder Phil right and I I thought because I mean it would be yeah anyway look what I want to say is that it is it is my privilege to now be the chair of the Canterbury Merrill forum actually I don 't even know whether this has been reported this might be breaking news I what I was elected at the at the first meeting of the Canterbury mayoral forum but the Canterbury mayoral forum did not meet within its normal time frame because of the Kaikoura Kaikoura her annoy earthquake and because of the earthquake had got held over and at the first meeting which was this year wasn 't it I was elected as the chair now that 's an incredible position of responsibility but also taking over from Dame Margaret baisley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agenda and that 's what I wanted to talk about at the meeting this morning as we consider the the draft rainy or agreement and that is that in Christchurch we 've got an economic development agency CDC and it has lead the development of the Christchurch economic development strategy in fact i went to the launch of it before i was the mayor and it was just prior to the earthquakes that it was no he should know it must have been after the earthquakes that it was refreshed or the work may have been going on before but so we 've got a Christchurch economic development strategy under the leadership of Dame Margaret what was established was a Canterbury regional economic development strategy with the focus areas being led by different mares and one of the wonderful outcomes of that regional economic development strategy was the whole focus on on getting broadband rural broadband 4G into the regions and mere Damon OD from tamaru actually led that part of the Canterbury regional economic development strategy and and there are other foci of the strategy as well visitor strategy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know and of course the roading network which has a joint committee regionally that drives that work as well and so with a number of different areas there 's a lot in common between the the Christchurch economic development strategy and the regional economic development strategy so by taking on the role of chair of the mural forum we have firmly put on the agenda for this train iam the merging of the economic development strategy for Christ 's Church and the one for the region and one of the reasons why I think this is really important is that Christchurch is completely under dependent on the region so Christchurch wouldn 't be what it is without the region but the region wouldn 't be all that it is without having an international gateway city on its doorstep so the relationship between Christchurch and the region is going to be the focus of my leadership of the Canterbury mayoral forum over the next three years and when you think about New Zealand and you think about the powerhouse that is Auckland and you think about do we need a counterweight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canterbury sits in the South Island and if you think about our gateway status you think about the international flights that our Airport company has been able to come and get to come and lend directly into christ church that is an enormous benefit to the South Island but it 's actually an enormous benefit to people who fly here as well because they are bringing visitors to where they want to be when you look at the advertising that 's done for New Zealand overseas in terms of what is attractive to visitors to Christchurch into or to fly to New Zealand if you actually think why they want to come to New Zealand the images are overwhelmingly of the South Island it 's where our visitors want to be and so I see my role as the chair of the mural forum as an extension of my role as the mayor of christ church but also bringing that integration between Christ Church in the region but then reaching out from the region to the rest of the South Island and I think that puts us in an incredibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why I was wanting to move the approval of the draft renewal agreement and and look for this council support thank you though look I want to support it too I guess from having been on what was the urban development strategy and now the greater Christchurch partnership I certainly appreciate the value of working with and neighboring territory authorities and I think if we 've learned anything over the time of the earthquakes but and also particularly in the last week around with the fire with the fire issues and we know we we know the value of actually working together and collaboratively and working collectively sounds easy rolls off the tongue easy but in fact we know it takes a lot of the talk and in hard discussion in fine-tuning and the areas in fact though that the mural forum attends to are ready paramount for all of us and so that whole year of natural hazard risk is right it is right in there as well as transport in the regional water strategy and in a number of other elements they are also important I think for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have those initial discussions so that when it comes to the other other regional committees that in fact we 're prepared and we get on the same page as soon as possible to achieve the best results not just for Christchurch but for greater Christchurch in the whole of Canterbury so I I I think we need to be clear and we have the report is clear and I 'm sure we will get will receive clear reports on the discussions at the mirror forum here is there anyone else that wants to contribute to the debate Yanni and then Glenn um thanks for sitting around that website I think actually I was I was heartened by the fact that like to say what the website is I 'm not interrupting you but it would be good advertising but I 'm fortunate when those websites got very long address the fan of any relevance to what i can tell you yes that 's canterbury mez dot azor I said you are a website w eb SI te s dot right it 's totally what you would look up yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that site so the guy so i just won by the point that you know that this has been quite a contentious forum and i think that the important thing is though to separate out the merrill forum from the trainer agreement so I mean I 'm really supportive of having a triennial agreement I think it 's really important that we do that it would be good to meet with and I think we 've started to do that with sanbornton hosting us and sell one to have a regular rigo meeting between the council laws and the elected members from a can and the commissioners of course I 'm all that the ones that are pointed but just to say that it 's good that in terms of three years ago I think we were really concerned about the transparency the website i think is a really good start to dealing with that making the information accessible open and transparent because that was one of the criticisms several years ago I think the other thing though is as was said the triennial agreement commits the council to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know it 's unfortunate and in the document it doesn 't really spell out and maybe you can just take this on board as chair that spell out actually what those structures are in place because we 're not asking I hope for a huge duplication of work to be done by the merrill forum on the other things that are already underway collaboratively one thing that is missing from here which I just you know possibly take an amendment or some work to be done that I think one thing is not mentioned the trainer agreement as work around a regional funding for the major regional facilities and I think you know it would be really good to signal that that was a key piece of work that should happen so I just passed that on just to say that yeah in terms of the mural forum I think again the important thing is that that isn 't signing us up to do things as a city that the other councils want to force us to do it is actually about working together and having good communication between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us as a council to get either a mandate for things that they 're thinking about well for direction on on what way we might want to go so you know I don 't fundamentally it 's good that we have these agreements but we do need to always make sure that they are transparent in terms of how they operate and have good public transparency decision making as well so thank you thank you sorry who was nice clean yeah thank you and transparency was one of my key words I 'm really pleased that the chair of this forum is now you know the mere christchurch city and i hope that will enhance the transparency just given the history here the fact that we have difficulty actually tracking down the web link there 's a lot of things so i think if we can promote that have greater line of sight on the work the work of the forum that that will help a lot but here Yanni 's really captured I think the main the main issues any other discussion so did you want to move an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a happy to if we can be mended I 'm happy to do it on the road and come back on it yeah we just make a note if you want yeah could you put note that there is potential for regional facilities can I put services because that is actually one of the purposes of the triennial agreement there is potential for regional facilities services to be Co funded through through the mural forum I mean it can 't take a fit without all of everyone signing off but but that is a basis where it could be discussed yeah yeah sure now there are to be co funded through recommendations from the mayoral forum so that yeah and I

New Zealand",7008,"OOP straight to public participation and we have two items under that heading today the first one is the health precinct Advisory Council and I 've invited them to come to the council meeting today they presented at the urban development strategy implementation committee meeting just recently and I think that there is seen as certainty that i have that the health precinct does the unsung hero of the renewed christchurch and we 'd really like to invite them to come forward and make a presentation about the work that 's going on there thank you can you switch your microphones on yeah that 's cool that 's great I 'll let still be sufficient to that should be a theory but colleagues please Johnny okay so thank you first leave me again zeal for the invitation and it was as you record recently that presentation we gave at which one or two of your colleagues were present and we also talked about this project last year with the cat then council as part of this awareness campaign that you hinted at spreading the word about what this project and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council members present still award who 's the executive director of Allied Health canticle district health board and lead for innovation we have amber Clark from Martha potpourri who provides us with excellent advice and support sue Rogers is our executive officer and bay de nuit who you 'll know as the representative of DPM see in regard to this project so that 's great that they were able to join us this morning would you move the slide alignment so the council is made up of the leading health and education institutions in the city and as a result of the earthquakes and what followed we 've come together to innovate and think of different ways of delivering health care education and training in this very special part of the city along Oxford terrace so we have as I 'd mention the Canterbury District Health Board we have the University of Canterbury represented by Gail Gillen professor Gail Gillen our Institute of Canterbury represented by okay Jenkins cake Giles rather my apologies university of otago represented by the Dean professor david murdock and amber hooves been introduced so we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving a lot of thought to how the relationships that we 've developed over the last few years can lead to innovation and changes in the way we work together as institutions but also in partnership with the city so our vision up here is developed in 2014 I think it 's as relevant today as it was then we want to work as a network a hub Ernest spoke so we 'll be reaching out to other colleagues at the other dhb institutions and partner organizations and we 're interested in building our reputation here in the city for world-class health care based on research and innovation there 's a big education component which I 'll refer to in a moment and then increasingly to we 're starting to think about the economic recovery of the city in our region and how this project and perhaps inform that in the future the overarching goal which you share as a council is to improve community well-being in the long term and have a fantastic healthy and safe city so this is the role of the council where a governance group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the time of syrah but our organization will continue on into the future to provide this leadership and governance and to harness that drive in passion that each of them demonstrate for their role in the city so our role is to champion excellence and think about that healthier future for the city in the region so if we have been excellent so in 2014 a master plan was developed it was developed in conjunction with colleagues in Sydney the colleague of mine had been involved in a hospital complex development and this this plan is actually being followed although it was never formally adopted by the crown as you 'll see as I show you and the up-to-date version just go back sir the idea is that it is a river facing precinct and populated by a variety of facilities starting on the left-hand side of your screen under the sign of course with the new acute services building for the Canterbury District Health Board on that triangle site the new outpatients which is under construction now and then a series of buildings that will form a built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and teaching agenda so thank you soo there the next slide shows our key strategic goals and I 've got a copy of that plan on the table in front of you for each of you to study in this short presentation there isn 't time to go into them in great detail but I 'll just touch on one or two aspects as you 've implied me at Dell silver this is a project that 's not well known so we hope this presentation and others that follow will enable people to understand and engage with their work the emergence of buildings and once their foundations of completion will also i think help with the visibility of the precinct as as we can see obviously the hospital and our patients coming together research and excellence this is one of the best research informed health systems in Australasia here in Christchurch that 's not new and it 's a fantastic asset that we have here in the city and we continue to rely heavily on that to inform excellent healthcare in primary and secondary care in the future we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've seen the statistics the aging population will create massive demands for the healthcare system and particularly its workforce so we want to be focused on developing innovative models of health workforce roles so that we can all be looked after in the future and that were may involve new projects that will be working with in terms of developing new roles the people who may be in health and then of course once you 're a medical practitioner or registered health professional you need to undertake ongoing training throughout your career clinical simulation is the new happening thing in terms of professional education both from an undergraduate but in the postgraduate simulated environments be it award or an operating theatre use of robotics and augmented reality make it possible for us to train health professionals in a variety of innovative ways clinical trials have been a mainstay of the Health Research campus here in the city for 30 or 40 years and those trials bring much-needed new medications new approaches to treating patients and economic growth for the region so we 'll be continuing with that and then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organizations in terms of developing innovation the paperless hospital digital advancements and shared patient records and with its commercial partners such as around health care so those are the strategic areas that we 're working on in terms of the built environment I have emphasized mere previously that we 're not involved with car parking and I reiterate that this morning we have very ambitious plans for that river facing precinct on the left that blue triangle there is the outpatients and then as we move along a number of buildings are being developed of course the canterbury district health board itself has already moved into premises within the precinct and on the far right is the currently vacant site at 36 oxford terrace which is currently being managed by attacker 0 as it looks to find partners for capital developments on that side so although the built environment is important of the hospital shown here and I think the next slide shows the outpatients department building being developed it 's taking a little while to load into the memory of the computer I suspect that 's it there and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the health research in education facility is going to be on the corner of antigua and 2 m street and you can see the piles being driven into the ground at the moment that building will be I think a breathtaking example of how professionals can work together the lead tenants the Canterbury District Health Board and RR together with the University of Canterbury will be working in their building on their training education and research mission but they 're not all having separate floors they 're going to be working collaboratively together right up and down that building providing a wonderful environment for collegial discussions planning training and research as much as it 's about the buildings it 's also about the people this is a young have researcher from the university of canterbury working on the development of a color CT scanner which is a major project and funded here in partnership with the universities and the dhp the next slide if I 've got it right will show professor I 've just forgotten his name now reverse the battle of God who was the probably Venter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be involved in this story is very exciting the whole of the the precinct will be added to by the movement of the nursing and other technology other health related programs from era bringing thousands of extra students into the region once that building is commissioned in 2018 Stella Ward has shown here behind her fascinatingly are some of the major digital projects that are underway within the wider countably dhb and that 's all present at the design lab which I think some of you will have had the opportunity visit our partnership with marta potpourri is very special to us and we 've had engagement with colleagues at 2a he we and regular input of course from so thank you for making time to listen to us we have on your discs a story book if you like which i think the mayor 's been studying closely and that story book contains some of the backstory around why we 're doing what we 're doing a little bit about the people who are involved in the aspirations of the institutions collectively so we 'll be continuing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months and we look forward to working in partnership with you counselors but also council staff as we breathe life into this project so thank you very much and look forward to answering any questions which my colleagues I 'm sure we 'll be able to help with thank you thought that you 're going to take the full 10 minutes in your heaven so there 's a couple minutes for questions and I do recommend that people read this that this is what kind of smoke my tires when I listen to the presentation breath thanks Ian fantastic stuff I mean this is exactly what we need for the city my question is around funding so given that the CD HB is continually underfunded what 's the funding relationship here for this organization and so and council in terms of funding is is quite small in terms of it 's just a small administration that allows us to continue to fund the appropriate streams of work for the for the channel each of their pillars will need specific business cases to stack up and certainly for a CDHP to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well signed off and we are committed to a 30-year at time in the precinct working with Aurra and you see and other partners collaboration and so each each component will work through and I guess the opportunity to attract industry will also help leverage the ability to think about how we partner with industry to fund some of the work that we 're trying to do and an example of that is the work that we 've been doing with Orion health Hewlett Packard Enterprise and GE Healthcare that are particularly interested in how we work in thinking about in had contributed to significant funding to support what it is that we 're doing and so that that investment attraction comes directly into your group as opposed to the individual the governance of the projects come through and each of the individual projects needs to stand up on on its own but the governance group provides that leadership in terms of prioritization Phil thank you for the presentation it 's great having seen it twice nail to you know thank you particularly mention about the goal being improving community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that area in regard to strengthen communities but also government have given us some funding recently for that too so what ways you think besides the DHB working collaboratively you might be able to work with us around that whole area yes we 'd be delighted to engage directly on that topic of our our major strength is that this is where health professionals are trained they develop their values and their skills and where they 're the research informed teaching and learning leads to outstanding health care so we 're kind of at that end of the spectrum on one hand but also we 're very keen like you to be working alongside primary care more comprehensively in the future and that 's something we 're starting to discuss right now for this year as a strategic alliance perhaps with primary care so because we 're a governance group obviously and we have a small budget as stellar as pointed out we 're not delivering services but we 're providing leadership and context for others to lift the game and to deliver excellence thank you and I did Howson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council it provides that opportunity for each of the pillars of our strategic plan to reflect and we 're we 're aware of our policies on the excel so thank you it 's brilliant look thank you very much and i know it 's just a short window for a presentation but it was live-streamed and because you 've presented at the council meeting which means that there will be a link online which will enable you to you know link to that and I know that counselors are already putting it on their Facebook pages so hopefully that will help to increase you know sort of public awareness but I think it 's really important that people understand that this is the future of Christchurch and hidden away and this thing called the health precinct is really the answer to some of the global problems then the world will be seeking answers for so congratulations you thank you very much for agreeing to come now a next presentation is somewhat different from the one that we 've just had and I 'd like to invite Marcus branches here from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be well known to many around the table in Andy Buchanan who 's from the engineering school at Canterbury University one of the and the top three percent in the world just put in a plug for Canterbury University in that regard and again this is not an area that we have any particular decision making over or influence but it was just too good a chance with Marcus here and Christchurch not to have again a public presentation of an idea that I think will capture people 's imagination over Terry Marcus your mouth okay okay Mac Mac compatible introduced okay very good introduction yeah Marcus is a the timber frame is skilled from North America butts actually an international organization and that organization is has got behind this whole proposal and is offering to do the job through a local timber engineering expert Andy Buchanan because you need a registered New Zealand engineer to lead it 's an extraordinary proposal which if it gets across alone would engage the people in Christchurch positively about the recovery of the cathedral and greatly aid fundraising as well and Marcus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brilliant mine and designer behind it but as I see it is this very powerful professional organization very wealthy organization and I notif at the pro bono contributions from that organization and a new zealand company lately pacific museum ever who 've offered to provide all the timber at no cost most pro bono contributions are hugely valuable me and they illustrate the spirit that would be behind restoration of the fetal if we can get it underway I hope is that this would leave the restoration thanks not what I just say couple of words and if you can you know me I 'm retired professor of civil engineering at the University and my passionate to the building club being a consulting engineer and come tonight and are still at and markets introduced me to Marcus Andy could you go behind the desk because we need to pick up your voice for the recording otherwise certainly better yeah so thanks man all I want to say is that I 'm the engineer behind this it but I 'm just providing the technical engineering support but last year I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visited Marcus and he took me to church steeples like this all over well Philadelphia and in Pennsylvania and I was captivated and I just liked to hand over to Marcus to tell us his vision Andres front page of the press yesterday I 'm time to heal well I 've been faking this for six years six years ago yesterday six years ago yesterday in the United States I 'd was pulling my pants on and turn the TV on and I saw the news from Christchurch hmm in the devastation there 's a helicopter shot flying over the cathedral with the spire snapped off and you can look right down the tube of the the stump of the bell tower and that was a start of an odyssey that 's led up to this point and hopefully beyond in an instant I realized that there was a traditional form of steeple building that 's time proven safe engages the community that could repair and place that spire and do it in such a way that it would engage the people of Christchurch engage the people of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me I come from a part of the world where we have a lot of our amish neighbors and i don 't know if you know about the Amish sect they don 't drive cars a horse and buggy and when somebody 's barn burns down well everybody pitches in to fix it as a young man I was invited to one of these Amish barn raisings they assigned a minder for me an older gentleman with a long white beard Amos and I worked together shoulder to shoulder all day long by lunchtime we had the frame up by dinnertime the roof in the siding the doors were on they were loading hay in the barn and the calves are going in to be milked and I turned to Amos and I said I think it 's wonderful that your community builds he 's big strong Barnes he laughed and he laughed me laugh he said son you got that backwards he said it 's the barns to build a community and it 's true there 's almost spiritual events of my life most uplifting events in my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred and forty foot wall huh what 's that meters I don 't know Bridge written covered bridge in Canada five days five hundred guys start to finish and it was like a celebration the whole time that 's what I 'd like to bring to Christchurch and that 's what this is all about should we just bring that here so you can point to yes I think I use them on the side you right can everybody say we 're just going to make sure that we can get it on the camera so we don 't miss get that on camera it 's all good yep good all right thanks as you can all see I 've been thinking about this entirely too much you ask you ask my wife she 'll tell you the idea is to build it as a telescope interlocking inner there but it 's light you know they nestling sections that will slide inside each other and allow the pieces to be raised up not by cranes but by engaging the sweat and spirit of 500 people on capstans as the capstan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think you all have a copy of the report that I did there 's a an engraving 1583 in Rome where they had nearly 1,500 people on capstans raising the obelisk in st. Peter 's Square now I visited there and talk to some of the families that lived around there and they still bragged that their family was involved with raising the Oh bliss this is a part of the story that you can tell your great-great-great grandchildren the idea being to prefabricate getting away from the microphone too far too few prefabricate the various sections and I 'll tear it apart in a little bit and assemble them inside so it looks about like this now I 've taken off a bell section just for clarity it looks about like this on the day of the raising eight o 'clock in the morning eight o 'clock in the morning your train cast and crew 's gather and I would guess not thousand spectators from Cathedral Square and they start on the captions now you 'll notice there 's a lot of mechanical advantage here but it really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this model isn 't perfect exhibit it 's going to fetch up right about there and it just needs to be a little jiggle and another little jiggle I won 't do that in the real glass shoes come on you do you have any idea how far this thing is traveling how many pumps been dropped by bag Chandler 's hey all right so there she goes all right and you can see that one section doesn 't sit on top of the other they nestle so it 's like two men grabbing each other 's forearms so they won 't let go now we 're up to here we set these in place this forms the level where the bells go one and there 's no one here similar slide this one in here just for temporary and then she is it 's about two hours later figured by ten o 'clock she look like this it 's something Kristin spell level will be up there another figuring if you start the Holly at five by the time you get the bells on and the fittings in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me open the honey you can have the bellows going and we have the best and party in Christchurch that 's the end of the Second World War that 's a result so this is a story for our grandchildren great-grandchildren this is not a building project this is using this building project as a pretext to heal the people a time to heal all right now I figure if we got to go ahead in the next couple of months we could be doing this on the anniversary of the quake in two years the stonemasons here in Christchurch are I don 't know if you know this but you have some of the best stonemasons in the world legs are in Canterbury and the stonemasons I interview around the world say oh you don 't need our help you should talk to Mason 's in Canterbury they figured this is this is an offer cuff estimate from five years ago about a year and about two million new zealand all right about 1.5 million new zealand is what the timber framers guild has estimated cost to field our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ padding add some oh my god we forgot about that call it five million they budgeted 10 million for this so part of the the gift that we 're given many many gifts one spirit is we can help bridge that gap between where we 're at and where we want to be with this big terrible debate that 's going on in the paper at the moment so I 'm not here to take sides I 'm here to lend a shoulder to Christchurch like I lent the shoulder to my Amish friends what parts of I myth Andy I 've done this I 've done this sermon a thousand times and I think I 've forgotten it 's like I 'm trying to cut it down nice and short by thinking get the gist of it what 's worth knowing is Andy and I presented on Max 's behalf to the Cathedral working group and they 've really engaged with this and it 's included in their report to government so it 's actually within the proposition right now but we see it as being a way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isn 't just about a cathedral but for something in the heart of the city and if we pull this off we can 't do this without help from a lot of people and the people in this room are on this table are someone 's I 'm going to really count on because we 're going to need a lot of cooperation with that I need you know just all that kind of planning and accessing and everybody pulling together and and if you have a complaint speak up wild and strong right or if you if you have a worry speak up even sooner all right well we haven 't got time for for a debate and discussion and or even questions we don 't but it 's just it was an opportunity in my view for for a very public presentation because you could have come and made this presentation as an informal you know workshop or a meeting but actually by coming here now you 've live-streamed you 've got people listening and it will start a conversation and I 've never seen the likes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to capture the imagination of a lot of people I heard someone I hope it helps front drive the fundraising parenthetically we 're going to be doing a steeple raising like this in Pennsylvania on the fourth of July our independence day if folks want to come to Pennsylvania and help with the steeple raising I make arrangements we could watch stream it but you you must I mean a bit way to be it would be like I mean it would be it would go viral wouldn 't us I mean it would be amazing if we did this it would be just six years ago the lead news story on news broadcast around the world was Christchurch 's fallen and if we pull this off the lead news story on every news broadcast around the world will be Christchurch is back and with a vengeance and contrary to my young friends surmise this is not an avocation for a space program for new zealand all right thank you thank you very much Madison thank you and II really appreciate you coming and I 'm sorry we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fantastic presentation thank you now get out of your hair okay well now we have to move to deputations by appointment and we have generation zero regarding item number 10 promotion of Alec electricity and I could invite the two representatives to the table and if you could introduce yourselves to us and make your presentation thank you thank you very much good morning everyone my name is Buddhist Tanaka I 'm a physicist by training and just here representing generation zero I 'm Luke sports figure a PhD student at the University can be part of the epicenter the research center they 're investigating new zealand 's electricity system transitioning towards ninety percent or more renewables and specifically looking at weather and all have security of supply under those conditions and we are here to present on the procurement plans for the electricity going forward for crisis city council and so just a brief introduction about our group I 'm sure most of you heard of us but generation zero is basically a nationwide youth let advocacy group with the vision to see New Zealand achieved net zero greenhouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably well aware climate change is a major problem facing humanity at present the primary driver of climate change is the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere through human activity the predominant concern and in this is the release of carbon dioxide through the burning of fossil fuels it is paramount for a collective future that we export Lee and quickly on reducing greenhouse gas emissions in this effort I think our Civic institutions must be the leaders and act ethically and courageously to set an example and guide our society on to a better path for our future so with the choice of electricity suppliers to be decided christchurch city council has the opportunity to reinforce its leadership role by explicitly stating it will only acquire electricity from guaranteed renewable carbon neutral sources so what 's the big deal about renewable energy well renewable energy gives us a massive opportunity to drastically reduce our greenhouse gas emissions this becomes especially vital as the transport fleets transition to electric vehicles because this combination of solutions has the potential to reduce New Zealand 's carbon dioxide emissions basically turn 80 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sources are maintained and further developed to meet the growing demand and for that to happen these generators must be actively encouraged and support through procurement contracts is significant way of achieving this in our opinion now while the council staff have indicated that Chrysler City Council is likely to be mostly getting their electricity from renewables without an explicit guarantee and procurement from such guaranteed sources this simply amounts to a lucky convenience rather than an active decision to do the right thing and this does not amount to a positive signal of support for renewables and such a decision does not send the required signals renewable generators that the ccc are actively supporting the Renewable sector and as such this does not build confidence for investment in greater renewable generation additionally by not guaranteeing that the supply is from fully renewable sources crashing City Council is funding generators that ultimately use for so feels regardless of whether your electricity generated is from fossil fuels your business will help these generators and at the expense of truly renewable sources it is not consistent to claim that CCC which Triple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use fossil fuels for generation the council 's internal energy analysts also make some confusing remarks in the analysis they state that seventeen percent of the power fed into the grid will be run on renewables and that there is and I quote no filter which allows green on the electrons through the power your needs now I 'm confused because it is meant to indicate that contrary to staff claims after seventeen percent of councils power will be from non intervals because if that 's the case this some miscommunication that must be cleared up before proceeding if not my question what the relevance of that statement is to the decision at hand a suggestion is made in this analysis without much evidence that i can see that the procurement from a certified kabul carbon-neutral provider would be more exposed expensive than the mbia LED all of government procurement process however it is unclear how this conclusion was reached and we implore council staff to undertake deeper research into the carbon neutral providers and present a comparative cost estimate however we do recognize that there is massive value in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated reduction of risk for the council by engaging in this process and given that the staff estimate five or six months of to survey the market and secure supplier under direct engagement with the market we propose a new option to the two that you are presented with so what we suggest is that you engage in the aog procurement process for an 18-month contract with the explicit condition that carbon neutral providers are thoroughly researched and comparative cost at some estimates obtained from the providers themselves with the aim of switching to one of these providers at the end of the 18th month term this will reduce the risk of direct market exposure which is a significant risk what wala fires are being researched and a plan drawn up to switch to a carbon neutral pro item if this option is not tenable we request that the council take option two and directly engage the market and only accept supply from a supply of power from guaranteed carbon neutral providers and I have to reiterate this this is not just about the carbon footprint of the City Council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a supply contract do we support renewables or do is support albeit indirectly fossil fuel generators do we make the decision that helps our future and do we do the right thing now I have to acknowledge that the Chrysler City Council is the leader in fighting climate change and our emissions you guys from moto electric vehicles you promote alternative transport models and you stood up when the old ruling bloc of us came around and you do the right thing by and large so I so I encourage the council is a stand up once again and make the ethical and courageous decision sure the other government agencies all hard and turn off them the way forward it 's up to local government now more than ever to take responsibility on an initiative on climate change thank you very much and any questions how to take thank you I 'm councillors questions Aaron so just looking at art because i have a question around the spot market versus the fixed price is it cheaper to get electricity off the spot market than buying into a fixed price over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opportunity to buy off preferred suppliers or not so the price of generation on the spot market is make dependent on hydro conditions we have a dry year with less type of storage if we have to use more thermal thermal fuel costs so it is quite that 's so currently we 're in quite a wet season at the moment is currently spilling which means it 's overflowing so that 's where the risk is so difficult to really say is it going to be cheaper on the spot chamilia because even looking at the previous year it would have been cheaper in the spot market then Anna fixed yeah but of course that has risks if you get in the course the whispers a big disaster somewhere a masive cable goes down or something the price will change dramatically so if you look at the since the spanning off the wholesale market since in 1996 there 's been 2001 2003 2008 and I think 2011 have been dry years so full years of 20 and that 's very laid back of the envelope type calculation but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's part of the risk of the decision is that is council willing to take that risk being exposed to the spot market price based on those conditions currently the hydro conditions look favorable if it 's quite hard to tell with a limited data that we can only have and then my next question is around the the carbon tax on electricity seems to be a blanket flat on all the companies just pay per kilowatt or whatever that seems detrimental to heading towards being carbon neutral because shouldn 't you just put the text on the ones that make electricity using carbon and if someone is using hydro then it shouldn 't be applied so isn 't that with a real fault set here I think the UM the cover price was charged to the thermal fuel not to the electricity and is this contrary to what we 've been told when we ask you a question that it 's just it 's a blanket like per kilowatt amount like you 're normally throne of a fuel tax now who is was it energy link or another not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's your bank yes I my understanding it is charged by the fuel that 's used rather than as a blanket so there might be need to that needs to clarification and just to reiterate again it 's it that 's the central government issue as well and what we 're saying here is that councils and local government can send economic signals by saying we are willing to take a bit on some risk to encourage renewables and I also encourage you guys to explore the options that it 's not it 's not necessarily that you have to engage spot market directly as well there are providers that will give you a guaranteed term on a contract as well so that 's something you don 't look at any other questions for generation zero very large organization is we are we must have a guarantee of supply and we must have an idea sitting budgets and your plans long-term plans about what we 're looking at I mean I would be concerned if we were vulnerable to a spot market that the baseline spot price for spot market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spot market rather than a firm price over a period of time that we would be then honorable to the spot baseline spot price going up like petrol etcetera where you can 't really kind of govern what 's happening there and so you know you 've got to understand I think that we have to be to give to our ratepayers of a sense of firm reliability but also to our staff etc that we need to know that the budgets over a period of time because of for instance with climate change and we hit a number of dry years and the spot price goes up we have been vulnerable which affects the rate payers across juice so I yes all right so I completely agree with that and that 's why we that 's right that 's why that 's why I proposed this kind of hybrid option where we go with the aog procurement process which gives us a guarantee for 18 months and in that 18 months we can research because I think that the problem is that the research hasn 't been deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a fixed term right that hasn 't happened there 's no evidence of that and without that you can 't make the claim that we 're entering spot market and it 's a risk so if we actually look at that and say okay we 're going to be going with the MV process we have a gantry supply for 18 months that gives us time to actually act on and do the research required to see if we can find find suppliers that will provide a firm baseline Su Su request so that 's why we propose a hybrid option rather than the directly engaging market straightaway because I think that is a risk I think we 've gone over the 10 minutes but look thank you very much and I 'm and we 're going to go straight on to item 10 so we 're going to replace you with the officials that are advising us on item 10 and in if you 'd like to stay then obviously you can hear the debate about the about the the item that you 've presented on I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much appreciate noise thank you very much guys","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Reference,__EpQuun6-o,20170209,814.48,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1645,thank you very much yeah we 've got seven minutes before 15 we may get started on the terms of reference we 've actually been consulting with people as we 've been going around and and hopefully we 've captured all of the amendments so if you could move to the to the emotions that they 've been that actually being put together as emotion from individual counselors particularly the chairs of the committee 's concerned but will the sake of this discussion could we just have deputy mayor Turner seconded Phil Clearwater the lot and let 's just go through them so the first one is to provide a delegation to the clear that thinking provide a delegation to the innovation and sustainable development committee to develop the terms of reference and for the development forum so adopt revised terms of reference for the development forum at its first meeting the second one is that the social and community committee terms of reference delegates to the multicultural subcommittee responsibility to consider and report back to the committee committee matters relating to the multicultural strategy and notes that this empowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked the social and community committee to adopt terms of reference for the multicultural subcommittee carrier and then the housing task force meeting if we don 't need the word cycles that the housing task for the force meetings are held as required instead of and that 's just to give that sense of momentum and urgency to the work of the task force which may have differing needs in terms of meeting times there are four people on the task force and that a get on with the task that the and then there 's a just a addition of social housing which was actually a an oversight of just a typo absence so good eyes for spotting that the terms of reference for the atty committee include conservation of resources and sustainability a natural environment including the waters aquifers ecology and conservation of resources and no sustainability was wasn 't it sustainability isn 't being added can you take that end sustainability out and then at the bottom it says identified that the committee encourages sustainable solutions just one word solutions with good idea encourages innovative approach and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're not crossing over into the work that 's in innovation yeah it 's not the ISIS committing it 's the innovation in sustainability committee x we good I approaches you need to go back to the actual terms of reference to see how that one 's written sorry Kim we 'll come back to that but can 't carry on down that the terms of reference for social community committee identifier responsibility for the public realm that terms of reference for he be amended to read delegates to the land drainage recovery working group the responsibility to consider and report back to the committee on meters relation to the land drainage recovering recovery program including opportunities for betterment a tidy up off the terms of reference for the Civic awards committee and making it clear that the committee reports directly to council and that the terms of reference delete the committee 's delegation to the Civic award community watch the juice oh sorry yes yes yes so they 're delegating it to this yes that 's fine and that 's that 's all of those so go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us can we are we able to change the word will have encouraged across other committees as well not just a jacketed themselves yeah I just occur I haven 't got the list in front of me so where is the list sorry so the infrastructure transport and Environment Committee encourages opportunities for citizenship community participation this is picking out strategic direction works and partnerships with key agencies groups and organizations and encourages and a budget approaches and solutions and we 're adding to that the word sustainable so it 's got encourages innovative approaches and sustainable solutions so the idea is is that that 's that 's the strategic direction of the council as a whole and it 's not specific to this committee so it 's across committees yes but that 's the other committee is that 's what I 'm trying not to do as I 'm trying not to create a conflict between two committees who are committed to working together on this issue where there is a crossover yeah in the program so these are all to intercept them so when you get down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is sustainable deals with the major events through the new teed their other community events where is that currently sitting so windows yes so do you want to keep them it 's in there it says community events programs and activities do you want to keep them okay fine certainly fun OIC do you you would look yeah if you look let 's just leave it to you guys if you can I mean it doesn 't matter this is not the end of the road you can always come back with changes but if you can agree changes that make sense then I 'm assure the rest of the council and also so so all of those amendments have been moved on blog but if people are generally comfortable if we can go back right up to the top and that the council receives the information than the surfboat adopts the draft terms of reference ISM as amended and Oh what is it Azzam endured as amended by this resolution yeah as amended by that so instead of describe um yeah as amended by this resolution thank you notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amendments to the council as established under the local government act notes that the terms of reference for the delete council strategically as this is already in the terms of reference for the strategic capability committee right so so if the two movers seconders are happy then I can accept them as moving and second in the hole and yanni and um one was I 'm not clear what 's happening with cycleways there 's I see there 's no request for delegation so yeah well delegations are actually part of this there 's a number of committees that might reference to delegations delegations yeah okay do we have a time frame for that must be soon see a time frame it 's just that we 're currently we no relation and we don 't know what process is better okay and then the other thing is just in terms of the strategic capability committee I see there 's no reference to reporting back to Council like a fine so is that changed or yeah right so but it shouldn 't ah so it 's just is that right though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be reporting through you no no that 's alright yeah ok just cheating so just um because in the finance somebody there was strategically won 't be happy with the crown yeah so my husband 's birthday no it 's not that has ever been changed Heather well good so right okay so we 're going to make it clear that um so is there any delegation to the strategic capability committee we 're not doing delegations here what but at this stage that 's just to report so things like we 've got other ones where we say you know will report to council ramekin to council so hey do you need to just refine it reading make sure that it 's clearly the committee considers the reports to counsel just like all the other ones I 've got so that if you take two for example council remuneration employment policy I don 't know whether that committee is going to make recommendations to council all hurt or whether they 're just going to do it no no they 're going to make recommendations so yeah so maybe just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommendations to council on explosive yeah well except they 're advising and supporting the mere so maybe the is responsible for advising and supporting the mere to lead the development of the long-term plan etc leading and overseeing the council 's strategic relationship with the crown leading and overseeing specific strategic projects have shared interests and interface with the crown knowing that we can 't make any agreements without counsel so and then is responsible for making recommendations on matters relations performance the chief executive of organizational capability councilman eration and actually any decisions arising out of that the strategic capability committee can make a recommendation but that that the ltp is not dependent on a recommendation coming from the strategic capability committee because it always reports to counsel you know I understand yeah but anything to do with cost share for example would come back to Council or for decisions absolutely it 's nice more yeah but it 's for decisions with this is not being delegated decisions so yes it needs to be made clear that it 's responsible for leading and overseeing those leading and overseeing but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the word and clarified for that yep alright so we 've got the whole thing now moved and seconded as the single resolution so I 'll pop that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's

Plan,cm70MmV7RT4,20170209,1388.34,"Christchurch, New Zealand",3998,onto the crunchy City Council draft response on the draft outline of the attacker avin river corridor regeneration fan because what I 'd like to do is move into public excluded so that we can come back at 130 and deal with the attachments for the report so that when we then we can reconvene the meeting with in a timely fashion in order to then move on and if we could get an indication from people I probably like to indicate to the media for example that we 're likely to reconvene as a public meeting probably around would half an hour be enough for the PX components of that this is a couple of other papers and peak so we might as well just deal with the lot so maybe about help us to reconvene for the final paper yep all right my mind you if this is quick enough we can get through both the we can get through both of these before before lunch that would be great all right shall I hand over to to staff just to give us a brief overview of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public commentary I 've seen de round us would unda cater peps of misunderstanding around the process thank you madam chair is this is a draft response from council in relation to the draft outline which has been put together by regenerate Christchurch now regenerate Christchurch is the only Authority who can prepare an outline on regeneration plan for this area of land so in terms of the outline itself what it actually achieve its not the regeneration plan itself what it must do is identify the opportunities for public engagement set out and really what it does a set out the process for developing a regeneration planets off so the substantive nature of the work is still yet to be done really it has this is the area that we are looking to develop a regeneration plan for and these are the time frames that were looking to do it with them and this is the engagement process that we 're looking to undertake with the public to get it done so that 's all it really does it doesn 't get into those substantive issues of what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an watchin bein having said that it is an important statutory document because the regeneration plan itself must be consistent with the outline so does have weight it is important but it 's not the regeneration plan per se that 's not the main main court says it work it 's the entree and where we are at the moment is that comments on the draft outline close on 21st fe BRE so we 've certainly got a few days with them which to make any changes and get it in to regenerate christchurch if you want to do that and then if you look at page 101 of your agenda that sits out the time frame within which regenerate christchurch will look to prepare a regeneration plan and the process that they will go through with them which to do that very good so that 's helpful thank you in a really good description I think their entree main course really helps to clarify the process that were on so questions Phil thank you I just wanna make sure like at the beginning overarching issues it is stormwater infrastructure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunities on the next page 11 de Rodes clearly referred to and I just want to make sure that in fact we retain necessary in wastewater infrastructure say that we already have that in fact we don 't lose sight of what we need to retain in clearly potable water will be another part okay so we could at a paragraph following the paragraph on the roading network which is the wastewater and potable water infrastructure that crosses or services adjacent hearings Thank You Ellen Dion then Yanni so I mean there is a fear of the community obviously got to look at this on the agenda the other day so there is a fear that the ex states that we are a statutory partner and their feedback from the community isn 't part of that statutory requirement from regeneration act but regeneration christchurch will regenerate Christchurch 's asking for public feedback on this which is absolutely fantastic but there is a perception or fear that those those weightings of their opinions won 't be the same as those statutory ratings from us which is why i 've got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so the main one that I 've thought that that has come back to me was around the time frame being quite tight after six and a half years of quite a little amount of community input that they 're going to create the Regina or the draft regeneration plan within the next six months or six months after the draft outline has been created and then there 's only 30 days for the community to have some feedback on that and the other thing that feeds into their quite closely is around the information sharing so there 's a bit of a regenerate Christchurch 's what 's word a policy is around free will open up open information however we all know that and and this just comes down to trust I think a big part of this and this is this is where we as a council should be giving a little bit more waiting on on actually trying to show this trust and so because we all know what Sarah did with getting rid of the documents and everything like that they they had a policy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get into a situation where the regenerate Christ chips are saying you will give all this open information at the moment and then maybe they they withhold something so I think it 's just really needs to be very clear so that that trust is built up with her in the communities and I think it 's just in the other point here and I think it would go on to part 5 of our submission is about the public the public must absolutely absolutely be involved in the visioning process and that it 's not just Christchurch that 's involved it 's actually something that could be wider for the the impacts of this is actually wider for the whole cell phone under maybe for New Zealand as well so there 's a couple of little points that we can do there yeah so how can we get some of those points I was getting there I 've just got a lot back you through I 'd say how can we get some of those those points potentially put into what we 're submitting so that we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are the statutory partner in this document before our communities I suppose during this time frame and in terms of the time frame itself it is six months but there 's always a balancing act between too fast and too slow and you 'll be aware of the time frame for the other the act itself but again if I direct you to page 101 at six months to review the draft but then if you look at all the other 30 working days 30 working days you know that adds up to about 40 weeks so by the time you get this plan signed off you 're looking at a year to a year and a half type process so it 's it 's quite quick in the first tranche I guess in terms of getting the the the draft plan put out the input but while I can 't speak for regenerate Christchurch I would imagine they would consider you know continue to to be working on that right up until the time that 's delivered so it 's that the process as a whole needs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and engaging with the community the whole way through so each of those dates in page 101 is subsequent also six months and in 30 days then another 30 days in another 30 days yeah that 's great yeah so it 's about that 's about 40 weeks for the last part and that 's to get it up to the the minister who then needs to make the decision itself so if you take add 40 weeks on to the six months you shun it 's a reasonably chunky a period of time and total yeah great yeah I mean the thing is is that this is a this is regenerate Christchurch 's Percy 's yes and yes the process is driven by the requirements of the Act you know to a certain extent and certain amount of time has to be met for certain things but I think what the community are asking for and I went back and read even Smith and Sylvia Smythes article that was published in the press and it is worth reading because what it what it does is it captures the essence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there has been a loss of trust and a new organization has the shadow of what has happened before cast over whatever process that has to work with within the legislation and I guess that they 're looking for us as a council to reflect that to regenerate Christchurch that in terms of building trust the more that the community can be engaged in feedback loops the stronger the sense that this will be a participatory process and given that this is exactly where we want to be ourselves as a council in terms of our decision-making processes then I don 't see any Harmon and just strengthening the language around that because there is no question I think in the minds of anyone around this table that it 's got to be participatory but there is a need for some speed and and and I mean I it 's any any recovery document that you want to read that 's ever been considered anywhere in the world always says that there is a need to balance speed with deliberation so as long as you have the capacity to engage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're going through a process then the stronger that ability to get speed will exist because there won 't be resistance and I always I came up with a phrase which was take your time as quickly as you can and that phrase was designed to sort of kind of express the view that you if you don 't consult you will spend longer in the long run so you 've got to find the right and engagement process so as long as we use language that strengthens that desire and our submission then I think that will it that will meet that concern so if we add to perhaps that section 5 response where we talk about the importance of that community participation and engagement and perhaps use some of the words that regenerate Christchurch have on their website and effect about co-creation putting the community at the heart of what they do and ask them to reflect that more strongly in their plan rather than just refer to the principal 's yet on the website yeah I think that would be very helpful yeah I think making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other one there the other question I have is around the durability of the regeneration plan it says within the draft that the draft outline that the that it will only go up to the Xperia the expiry of the regeneration act but remember that the regeneration plan itself as as as what is required to change user underlying documents the underlying documents don 't get repealed yeah on the I know the the RMA and the all-that-is district plan yeah that 's what I 'm if our district plan has changed by the regeneration plan then the district plan remains change that doesn 't end in five years yeah but well I think what we 're getting here is that if there 's any sort of plans about doing something or doing things within those time front well with them sort of what regenerate Christchurch does because we don 't know what people will come back with in terms of a regeneration plan for that area that if it does need something in that regeneration act and that regeneration act Dean 's then it just ends up being like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crack on doughnuts you know what I 'm sorry it is swings and roundabouts so if we need powers that are available under the Act to be exercised yes they need to be exercised within five years but if you 're concerned about the underlying changes to the district plan they do not end with the legislation so you know I mean that this is the conversation that we need to have a maybe maybe that 's also useful for regenerate Christchurch to be publicly expressing you know the nature of the changes that can be made under the Act or the powers that can be exercised because because they are time limited and one respect but not in terms of any changes to the district plan and there was one more well I think that will become clear on the plan itself yes and I think that that is probably a matter for the council but when it 's involved in the regeneration planning itself rather than a comment on the on the what is the plan for the plan yeah I mean they just make an explicit they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think what what was important there and the other thing that I think that has come back as around the biodiversity there 's no mention of that at all yes so in our submission we have we have been very clear about the importance of the river corridor is a river corridor so that 's the conveyance functions of the river but also the ecosystem functions of the river the riterion merchants in the history so that 's all captured within our submission here and that 's matters of biodiversity water quality landscape and recreational opportunities yeah I thought that was a very powerful part of it yeah I mean it just doesn 't explicitly say I was kind of faced part of our submission hmm yeah I 'm yani two quick questions one was I 'll just concerned that if there were ideas that like we 've heard how long it 's going to take so if there were ideas of things that we could we wanted to do as a community or a city in the red zone do we do we have to wait for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other mechanisms that we can use to get progress and I mean obviously I raised the example of the build Sutton house which I think we wrote about four years ago as a council try to get progress on that still waiting it would be really good to know that there was an opportunity to do things quicker then waiting for this plan which will take another year and a half if there is a kind of immediate need for some of these things to happen collected but as staff we think what are the important things that needs to be considered and we 've spoken to this in terms of our draft submission is that those transitional uses that may be established throughout the the the land subject to the regeneration plan and we 've used the example of a cycleway potentially long stock banks and as you know councils got broader plans for a city to see cycleway anyway it might not be in the exact same location I think that 's a type of thing that certainly from what I understand from regenerate Christchurch that keen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little bit of time but I don 't think my own personal view is that that shouldn 't be an absence of those transitional users potentially being established in the interim so those are the types of things that I think can occur on a transitional basis but peps come permanent in the future so that 's something we 've touched on in relation to the city to see cycle weight but but it is something we could broaden if that 's an issue you 'd like us to bring out a little bit more yeah we 're just using examples I think it would be really good I mean you remember that the idea for the garden heritage park were headed dwelling on it that dwellings now being demolished so we lost the opportunity to have a you know transitional cafe garden space a whole bunch of structures and things whether it 's trees or houses or you know um what 's left has been taken away before the community can even get into this process so what little we 've got going forward that may be of community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process to identify and put into action something so that we don 't lose it all me so if you think that we can you know incorporate we could use examples like what we 've done what what Council and other groups have done within the central city which has worked really well before the permanent works have gotten and we had discussion on that earlier possibly although you will recall for the community orchard in the central city that we have a resolution through council to try and get security of tenure because these groups ask us for funding deponent to capitalize the projects and we have no security of tenure which means for the people that are trying to raise money it 's incredibly difficult because they 're told well why would we invest in something if you 're on a month to month contract so I think there is a kind of room for improvement and it would be good just to maybe highlight that if we could just the second question I had was around in the council document on page 97 and I just wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top which says it 's to enable the crown to efficiently and effectively manage hold or dispose of Crown land within the area by determining through a robust and streamlined presses the bits do serve land including options for future use that might offer a financial return for the crumb and I was just concerned I mean my understanding is we can 't if we were concerned about that we we can 't remove it because that 's a statutory thing that is enshrined and legislation but I was concerned that it may be hard for the community to advocate for community projects if thats hanging over that one of the outcomes of this process I think the the framework for the regeneration planning has multiple objectives and the regeneration plan itself and the engagement with the community will have to navigate its way between those multiple objectives and that that one that you raise is certainly one that is there and there 'll be some lend within the residential red zone that is possibly capable of remediation and of some sort of developments in the future that may provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that is underlying that that that use is not necessarily in conflict of course with wider community values and in some areas future residential development or commercial development could well contribute to the well-being of the broader area in particular particularly as you as you move Eastern towards some of those key activity centers it may actually reinforce those key activity centers and add to the urban form of the city so that 'll be that 'll be a question for the regeneration plan process itself so I mean I just thought a a principle should be I personally felt that people who have lost their property in the red zone actually do have some right in terms of efforts going to be sold off to future people to develop on places where people loved and had their homes without any offer back to them would seem a little bit unfair I 've already raised this you know what what then is the master murder we could do on other occasions but I don 't think it 's appropriate for the outline because there is no determination at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas but I think it would be not unreasonable to consider making a property that was being redeveloped available and it would have to be by ballot anyway because if there were more if there was more interest than there were positions but that would be buying at market value at the time not not at the rate that they were paid for for their land yeah I just feel of people are forced off their land then there should be some obligation to go back to those people so that the Lord didn 't allow there and because they voluntarily sold it will voluntarily sold it but we know the whole history of that I know we know that history of another contract we signed with the government we we signed an agreement that we wouldn 't have a right of refusal if the land was subsequently developed it would be remediation before any of it was a 51 so you 're proving me wrong you 're proving yourselves wrong I didn 't think this would take a short period of time um sorry there 's one more thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose we 're very passionate about this so it 's it 's very important is it what 's it sorry I 'm being sarcastic carry on thank you um there 's no mention at all about people who still live there and the comment and the actual draft outline talks about that the plan will take over all of the red zone land but there 's actually no mention of those people who are in and around that and how they 're going to be impacting what they 're what 's going to happen with them so I think we actually do need to respect those people that live there and when we 're talking about doing these things it 's why their website is very respectful of them absolute it 's not specifically identified on the outline then I think it has to be thank you with those amendments people people would generally happy to delegate authority to Carlina myself to sign off the final worden alright so would someone like to move that Jamie seconded Phil I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know that 's carried the,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

and I am dying shall endure from council side of things and David Murphy from Environment Canterbury and thank you both very much I 'm sorry you 've had to wait but you can see that when controversial you 're not controversial but things that people are passionate about come first then it can take us a bit longer to get to items such as this but this is a really important item and we 've been looking forward to this presentation since we came up with the idea of having joint you know presentations on these important areas of of connection between ourselves and and other districts so if I could just hand over to you for the presentation thank you very much thank you madam mayor and Thank You counselors um I 'll make it brief I just like to introduce again David Murphy who is the program manager for the hora que hora program a tena koutou katoa cord David Murphy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here this morning and follow an item on multiculturalism and so I think that 's a great segue and uh so thank you for the privilege to to present today I I will be brief this is a briefing on restoration of authority ahora for your information just and thank you very much great introduction Diane just to explain my role on wallet away hora it 's an operational programme where the current program funders are the ministry for the environment environment canterbury and tere naina oh no Tahu and we are governed under the table or a co governance group of which Christchurch City Council is one of the members so that 's how we fit in the the brief summary which I 'll give you today we 'll talk more about co governance and some of the achievements under governance I am speaking on on the achievements of works for a number of different different people I 'll answer questions as best as i can but that i want to acknowledge all the people who contribute to this and also tell me to do known as a kaitiaki @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all time ahora lake ella smear new zealand 's fifth largest lake depending on the lake level it does vary which I 'll get to so usually somewhere between the fourth and the sixth largest lake in the country and it partially sits within Christchurch City Council 's georgous jurisdictional boundary and it has significant values not only for culture recreation and economy but also ecology and there 's actually a hundred and sixty seven species of bird out there christchurch city council range as a part of the annual bird count on the lake and on one day they count between anywhere between forty eight thousand fifty thousand birds on the lake so it 's a it 's a significant at treasure in the region the problem this is often discussed around the co governance table there 's a legacy of nutrients in the lake nitrogen phosphorus binding with the sediments of the lake the Maori or the life force and the ecology have been damaged and there 's also we 've got the added complexity of the need to manage the lake level way back when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be getting your ankles wit in Lincoln so now the lake level is around about the one metre or below level and when it gets to a certain level because of flooding on land and other reasons I 'll get into the lake is opened so there 's the challenge of managing and restoring within managing the lake level situation as well and also projects on restoration can be quite complex very briefly in regards to the I tahu the lake is a tribal tongue treasure and it 's a major mahan Kukai makenga kai is the food the the art of food gathering in the places of food gathering as well and it 's an important source of mana prestige in 1999 for latah who the treaty supplement my Tahu what also they got the let the ownership of the lake bed and I Tahu had the aspiration to restore the Maori the life force and Mahan gakkai values of T ahora so the ownership of the problems and the solutions where do you go to to from that point it started in 2012 with an agreement between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group this has grown in in 2015 Selwyn District Council joined the co governance group and in 2016 Christchurch City Council joined the co governance group and it 's a joint commitment to lake restoration as far as i know i think this is the first co governance agreement in New Zealand which is voluntary under legislation they don 't have to work together but the parties are wanting to work together and I 'm very proud to be working with in this program under K governance because everything in the program is in joint decision-making which I 'll get to and there 's the respect to program partners aims of co governance very briefly to provide successful leadership and stewardship of terroir horror and its wider catchment and to govern the audit abajo a program that 's where aight Christchurch City Council involved well through the many existing were works of the City Council in planning and waterway management and land management all these works benefit the lake and the catchment Christchurch City Council is also a member of the Tewa horror governance group under that there 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our officials on and there 's the Christchurch City Council are also represented on the agency 's group the statutory agencies which meet around the lake to discuss common issues the cell my hores own committee and the lake opening protocol group which I 'll get to achievements of co governance this is where I 'll give er a brief summary of a number of different streams the opening of the lake is a joint consent between I Tahu and Environment Canterbury when the lake needs to be opened when it hits a certain threshold and goes to a protocol group which the City Council is part of and once a decision is made a main joint decision making the consent by tarun Environment Canterbury then they open the lake and if you if I have your patience for a minute and a half I 'll just show you a brief video on what unlike opening actually looks like and there is no sound with this but this is right on coyote spit near town booty and when the lake reaches a certain threshold the diggers get in there and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drivers and health and safety considerations taken into account and they cut this wrong Channel right through the bar there then which then allows a certain pressure to build up and the water to come out into the sea now I 've got the greatest respect to those drivers of DC knowing and the like because they 're not too far away from the shelf edge there and they 're operating in some serious surf so they can only operate within a certain conditions as well so so the joint consent to open it with Kai Tahu but and and then Environment Canterbury River engineers which oversee this body of work and it 's so important that Lake opening not only flushing of the lake also reducing flooding on farming land and significantly oh there 's a great view out to the southern sea so that opens it can take three days to a week to open then it 's it 's left open depending on the weather conditions it may stay up in two or three weeks it may close the next day because southerlies just bringing those stones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide about 80 metres long and then it gets up to a certain hydraulic pressure and opens it so and i will also to come back to the presentation which i may have just killed proposes we [Music] yeah sure really come on ah Joe knows I 'll also when when the presentation comes back up there 's a there 's a very interesting slide on it because you see there 's a still photo you see that channel open and it 's teeming with tuna eel so the water conservation order has been changed in recent years to allow that Lake opening to also coincide with the migration of of eel and patty key flounder oh this sounds being turned off yourself yeah so you 'll see there that the waters churning with with tuna ill heading out to sea about to disappear off to the mysterious location up near Tonga to reproduce and then then begin their migration back and and since the change of their water conservation order there 's been a noticeable improvement in fisheries within the lake so this comes on to the other value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's a picture of a Pataki a flounder being caught there so it is a significant Fisheries in the lake and evidence of co governance and joint decision-making working together to also mention Selma hores own committee have been worked on a with community on a solutions package the zone implementation plan which has got statutory and on-ground actions and the lake is a key focus here and that 's the first-ever plan for the Tewa hora catchment that 's going from craigieburn down to the lake Osborn 's drain much smaller location but I just draw attention to this and because it 's an example of co governance working together that 's satellite shot on the northeastern part of the lake there 's a drain which runs down to the lake which has had water quality issues for a long time but because of a collegial approach your working party of from co governance partners working together on a consent there 's a path ahead to improve water quality another small example I 'd like to highlight a hurdle in restoration a hurry lagoon is on the the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was actual a Bay of the lake it 's a its current area is econ endowment land and there 's been the desire to restore it to increase the moringa Chi and ecological values so there 's a steering group representing local Runanga and neighboring land holders which which with econ staff input specifically to keep the clausal her teeny canal flowing and so there 's no flooding on neighboring land a plan was went up to code governance for approval so we 've got a vision document there for the next ten years where action has started of how we can restore that area of land and improve mahanga Kai biological and and recreational values and down to or totowa as well very briefly we 're an operational program started in 2012 undercoat governance and we have works in biodiversity science engineering cultural component extension and communications and the goal there is to restore and rejuvenate the molding the life force and ecosystem of tewa hora the coat the partners have realistically said this will take at least two generations 35 to 40 years so looking till horizon and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five years where we 've been getting rungs on the ladder and initiating it works going forward what are the opportunities for Christchurch City Council under code governance well around lake restoration there 's beneficial values for community in recreational values for the area health and ecology and education and there may be other opportunities to to contribute and there 's to be also be a bigger bang for the buck through complementary actions around the agencies group there 's going to be a workshop in terms of trying to map out what are the existing actions of all the different partners and where there 's natural synergies to 12 thank you very much for the time um could I ask if people have any questions Yanni and insole I mean this is a little bit wider than then your specific presentation but just in terms of the model it seems to have been really beneficial Oh have you thought about whether there 's other areas within waterways with a similar model may be may be worthwhile and the model of co governance yeah um probably a question for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different projects of the ball though I 've grown up and I 've educated in New Zealand I 've worked on projects overseas and it 's always interesting in overseas projects there 's always one pan there in a leading position to another so it this this program brought me back to Christchurch and it 's it 's it 's it 's a it 's really exciting to be part of not only getting rungs on the ground but doing it under joint decision making but sorry to answer your question briefly I haven 't thought of other possible applications it 's interesting because I mean it 's look who liked it for his own committees that I think as the as the obvious one but I 'm I felt exactly the same as Jonnie when I joined this group because christ church was a late comer to the partnership I think we signed up to it last year pleasure so and but but I was invited to participate before the formal signing up was undertaken and since that time I 've asked Paul n Cotter to take over that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role in terms of the zone committees but but like Yanni I 've thought it 's just such a good model you 'd think that you know working to that degree of collaborative coordination would really be beneficial in terms of our own waterways but the zone committees are that are that process so as I was reminded by the previous chair and fell d on Pauline so Mike thank you David my question really is what inches of the source of the problem which you refer to the beginning and that is that the elements of phosphorus and the different the different sort of I guess tracks that they have taken them to end up with the degree of the pollution that we have all right and probably my answer to your question follows on responding to two med lzl as well the zone committees there a key so in terms of my line management I 'm a servant to different masters I report to the joint officials group as part of strategy and to our funders and within Environment Canterbury I report into a zone team and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also even though that the situation is large with the amount of nitrogen and phosphorus already in the system the solution you can see in the landscape it 's gratifying to see our armor see it as a jinx all really the whole catchment there is many different players and we all have a part to play and the zone committee are are critical in their work and and how they implement that zip in water quality the drops of water which are falling up at craigieburn which are coming down in White Cliffs starfield and how that water floats are firm and and so that the zip is going to be a zone implementation plan sorry is going to be a key part of the ongoing solution to the lake yeah there was actually a big part of the question I had but because yours Nick stage is obviously improving water quality in the work that you 've done already you 've delivered farm environmental and sorry farm environment plan workshops and how the farmers taking to this new information is what I was really wanting to know it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counsel and that the guts that question I came onto the program as the implementation manager after those workshops those workshops are running very early phase before the farm environmental plans have become part of the zone implementation plan so because they were very new at that stage in the program piloted I think believe 53 farm environment plans they were received well from farmers because they were gaining that level of assistance and know that there was an action which was in the the very early phases of the program to to trial out there with the community sorry can I just go do you think that could be improved obviously to to improve the water quality where you know you 're saying that whole catchment you know that the farmers are really important there i I 'm just quite curious to sort of here you know is that more work going on there in the next phase as well there is definitely a large segment of work particularly within the zone the cell one hora zone team which is extension work out on farmers and implementing that zone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be involved in this Co governance group and thanks for the opportunity lien it 's an enormous project there 's a huge time frame as you say a couple of generations because it 's taken many many years for the lake to be come to reach this degraded level and there 's also enormous amount of money I think leaving point two million from twenty twelve to twenty sixteen from the government so in it 's nice to see that it 's the whole community involvement what all the children planting is at four thousand trees things like they 're so can you tell me though that when the council 's involvement you 've got here that we deliver our planning all the way management in Land Management works so we 're about as our land management works where does that fit into the their projects we 've got a very small area heavily like we do as always what it was more Eakins word to it to an extent i mean it is it is a collaborative process there is one of the groups that the council participates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the taylor horrid agencies group and so that 's one of the things that they do look at is is how land is used right at the lake margins which in and of itself is kind of an interesting concept because the margins of the late can change depending on how much water is in the lake and how land is used at those lake margins can have obviously in a very immediate effect on what 's going on inside the lake itself okay it 's like I said it 's collaborative actually it 's it 's in some cases it 's it 's quite direct because we read that council do own some land on the lake margins and in some cases we have leases with farmers to use that land and it 's so how is that used in and where and so one of the things I know the lake margins group is looked at and has had successes in it is getting stock off of where the lake either is or is expected to be under reasonable circumstances so that kind of thing so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it 's our land right I see that 's good I 'm and also just follow on from from dions comments i think the the farm management plans are a key tool and cleaning up our waterways and i 'm just wondering where are the milestones in the reporting back to see if these management plans actually working do you not not know the answer to do what I think I 'd like to take that question on because that that question would be best for the soul one Horizonte man and Bette and and there 's a reporting within the cell mar hore ozone committee as well on how the zip is delivered thank you okay follows it up with the hmm thank you for an excellent presentation thoroughly enjoyed its bit especially the video that was just stunning can I just ask a follow-up question though from your answer dying in relation to Lisa 's around the lake that the council has on its own land I 'm assuming a term of the lease is that they don 't have any runoff into the lake or any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy wood wood Carson I don 't have a lot of knowledge about how though Lisa 's work but my understanding is is that they 're based on the types of uses of the land there wouldn 't necessarily be an issue in terms of runoff it 's more making sure that the animals themselves if they lease holder has animals like cattle or sheep that they 're not in an area which would adversely affect the lake bed or or contribute nutrients to the lake and again through through fencing and land control with the leaseholder and and changing the nature of the leases over time has made a big difference say compared to 20 years ago just because if we want to be clear on the whole Canterbury braided River system it 's quite important that we 're actually doing the same thing ourselves and before we ask you can too yes and I like I said I don 't have a lot of knowledge but makes we are we are pretty good about me pine demand out there Lisa 's actually do not in any way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think all right so the resolution is that we receive the information and the report would someone like to move that Pauline 's taken to the Sarah I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye suppose they know that 's carrier thank you very much,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

meeting I 've been to of the year so and I 'm Claire Phillips the manager of the community support team as you might make up that 's it all the others on I can I 'll turn it up please yes softly spoken I 'm absolutely delighted today to present the draft the draft multicultural strategy for your consideration and in adoption as many of you 'll be aware this has been a process that started in june two thousand when the community came to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around multiculturalism in the city and one of the requests in decisions that fell out of that meeting was to establish a working party it was unique in in the manner of it being a council and community advisory group there was tasked with developing a multicultural strategy for the Christchurch City Council and indeed the city so over those ensuing months the committee effects team committee met a number of times and discussed issues and developed really the framework of what you see here today which has our future together a multicultural strategy that sets out a framework for how we work and live and end in develop our city as a true multicultural City and we 've been out to consultation we 've taken on board issues that were raised in that consultation we 've worked very closely with manaphy noah and has the endorsement and blessing of the puppet abou Runanga committee which is unique I think for New Zealand and indeed i 'd say the world in terms of our partnership with indigenous peoples so we 're very proud to present this to you and i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy to hand over to the chair of the multicultural advisory group councillor chin to discuss further has anyone got any questions for clear otherwise I 'm going to hand over straightaway to councillor Jimmy chin who led this development of the strategy for the council and I 'd like to publicly acknowledge him for doing so and thank them very much on behalf of us all the effort that you put in and with the group that you managed to bring together who embraced such a broad spectrum about our society here in Christchurch Thank You Man okay okay so male in my fellow councillors I 'm a 30 exciting with this final multi-culture strategy that we are here to adopt today it 's been a true partnership between the council manaphy Nova in the wider community now what you have before you today is a very special and inclusive document the helps to set out how we can celebrate in harnesses the dena marie said they are diverse communities bring to our social economic cultural fabric of our city you are aware these the strategy high-level strategic document @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a set of goals and actions to ensure every single person in a church feels a sense of belonging this strategy also give every person an equal opportunity to

work for in crucial and equity so I have been honored to lead a multicultural strategy the working party tasked with developing this strategy and I sincerely wish to think that working party members for their outstanding contributions wisdom an analogy so I still alight to take the opportunity to specifically to thank all other working party members 8 external members from the wider community matura Rothman geo was sought rathi he came real paycheck or corner Kathryn Peete Josiah to la MOLLE mana hut in the van key chain and also for our fellow councillors yani Johanson Anju turn green

senior management thank you so much to you all of your commitment in the expertise this strategy has been a year in development Michael she mentioned earlier and we have learned a lot during this time as we opposed to reflect on this today provides us with an opportunity to show the importance living in a certain supportive thriving and diverse community today is a min momentous occasion because there are many years in the making where white church can lead a way to set an example for the rest of our country and indeed the world so people are all strength so it is a people hate America a

support this document for adoption today thank you thank you very much angry would you like to second day at Marshall I would be delighted to second motion thank you and I 'd also like to echo a number of the comments that capital H n is made as part of the multicultural working party obviously I 've been very close to the development of this document over the the period of the work that 's been done and I 'm very pleased with it and in fact I think as a council we should be very proud of this document we certainly achieved something quite special here the way that we worked with the external members of the working passing the way that we had the the first draft of the document which we then took to the tejano gap habitable Runanga committee and the ability for local ruining and nighter who to really have an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way that the night Apple narrative really is woven through the document in a way that celebrates biculturalism as a part of multiculturalism and really shows the the respect for where we 've come from as well as where we 're going so what we 've got here is a document that sets out a framework for how we how we want to be as a city that celebrates who we are as a city a city where people regardless of background regardless of community regardless of troubles that they may have had in previous life can come here a place that they can call home and really be an active part of our wider community here in Christchurch and as a migrant myself I 've been here almost 20 years now but certainly I know what that feels like this is somewhere where I 'm totally grounded that i really call home that it home and it 's the people here and the quality of the welcome that I 've received that 's really made me able to do that and I welcome the fact that we 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Christchurch is and intends to be a place where migrants regardless of background can come can feel part of our wider community and can celebrate the fact that they 're here along with us celebrating and the diversity that we really value cleanin info I was working knowledge young this much pushes on GMA we were as a group there was a lot of good work by Tim is squishy charm right boo but hey we don 't assign work crew looking for more on ecstasy to root through that their first we are quite awful so rather than eating any of those local for others on possible relationships I 've have remember administration always you 've bicultural nation multicultural society yeah sorry friend you today we 'll make this exquisite climate we allow people in my gosh you committed to know the players and place to be in 1963 with these words like orange 2017 about silver we are so I think as a city reservation the minister thank you well I also want to congratulate everybody who 's been involved I think this is a terrific document @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it it will come alive it 's already alive and I just cussed Jimmy Chin 's forward there 's a line there where he writes regardless of their background we want the same things and I think that 's a lovely way of expressing and in fact we you know it our diversity we are well we want to welcome people and we do and I think having Jimmy chin on their council as an example of how we as a city do there and as well as the great leadership that Jimmy and the committee have done and clear behind the scenes we often don 't hear about that but it is a great opportunity to celebrate it as glean sears and in my in my own Ward spreyton ward there is a huge range of ethnic diversity and a large number and I see the Filipino people featuring very high as recent immigrants and as well of course as local Maori and Pacific island people and the other smaller ethnic communities so it 's very important that in fact we have the strategy now as to how we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know we really am I guess implement that this whole whole policy and strategy so thank you very much Yanni I just wanted to make a few comments and thank you to the Working Party and thank you to all those external members that were involved as being said really acknowledge that that I think an example of a new way in which possibly we can work as a council with communities to to get really good outcomes but I just wanted to make the point that you know I think approving the strategy is really the easy part the hard part is actually the implementation and for far too long with adopted strategies and strategies and strategies but we we 've fallen down i think is around the implementation so I just want councils to be weird that today this is really the start of a journey or the next step in our journey I should say and you know there needs to be a commitment to resourcing a number of actions through the strategy I think if we 're going to see the benefits of that so just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really pleased that we 've got pretty clear monitoring information in here but we need to just take it take the burden on ourselves that this needs to be something that we do wrigley keep an eye on and allocate sufficient resources but um council Livingston has has made the point that in the world that we live in today isn 't it said at a time when we 've seen cheap airfares so the reach of people being able to travel is as easy as ever before and yet and we 've also got the internet which is bringing us you know much more connected at the same time it feels like some days that we 've got the worst conflict that we 've ever had we 've got more people being scared of difference then then appreciating it so I think this is very timely I think let 's hope that Christchurch can continue to be a place that is welcoming that is inclusive and as Glenn said celebrates our differences in our diversity rather than this BB being afraid of it so I 'm thinking to everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to the next step thank you and I 've just wanted to kind of close off the debate each well every month and starting on on Waitangi day the city hosts a citizenship ceremony and and we always start on my tummy day because of that by cultural element that has more the foundation of the bicultural relationship that forms the basis for this multicultural strategy and it 's I just thought that I 'd just share the words that I always use in the citizenship ceremony is because people think it will just give a an expression to what I 'm what I think is is so important because there are two elements to it one is us that every one of you has your own story about what has brought you here it is the culmination of those stories that adds another chapter to our nation 's history each one of us or our ancestors made a journey to make hotel royal new zealand home by walker by ship or by plane that is that journey that we all have in common and it is one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of in terms of that i go on to say sharing the stories of our journeys that brought us here enables us to build understanding which also builds enduring relationships and creates unity and i really love what Glenn said you know that language of being tolerant has now transformed itself into the language of celebration of diversity which is completely different and I just I 've really welcomed that I also make the point that some of them some of the people gaining citizenship have had to give up citizenship of their country of bird in order to become New Zealand citizens and I always say let me say that as new citizens none of you Seavers your ties with your home and boo you bring your language your culture and your history with you and you nurture them and your children and we the wider community are enriched by your experience and all that you bring with you and you gain another home a place to stand as a citizen of New Zealand and this I wanted to share that because I think that really emphasizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I again want to say thank you to you Jimmy chin you 've done an outstanding job thank you to the working group who committed hours of work to this you know over many months and have really developed something very special total agree with we now have to come up to the delivery side so and I know that you 're going to lead us through that as well so on that note i will put the motion all those in favor say aye aye those opposed say no that 's

Participation",vzedx0QRlcA,20170208,775.92,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1768,oh yes and thank you for the coffee and right so first of all I 'm drivin apologies everyone 's here and declarations of interest I haven 't been notified of any public participation public forum no public forum presentations advised so we come to deputations by appointment 350.org Christchurch Charles Jace would you like to come forward and present to us on item 10 provision of electricity handmade after he can voted to oppose the deep sea oil drilling and he said this is the first time in our council where we have looked beyond the people and the environment of Canterbury and we 've made a moral decision that affects people right around the world and I just like you to keep that in mind because by an electricity is one of those moral decisions that will affect people around a world the report to the council read the electricity contracts that will be discussed later in this council meeting said that there were no there was no need for community consultation because they could not identify any community groups that might be affected when a decision on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suggest that when carbon emissions which is going to be part of your decision about the electricity contract is to be discussed then carbon advocacy groups like ourselves should in fact be consulted the electricity procurement process looking at option two I was in our opinion not properly researched or considered I recognized the problem for councils and following recommendations of staff when those recommendations are based on an outside source like energy link which may or may not have performed a comprehensive analysis to raise two points of question about their analysis one is in 518 they said that the extension of the Huntley power station from 2018 to 2002 22 is because of fears that without Huntley other generators would not have enough backup and yes that is what was published publicly said but if that were true Genesis would not have planned to close Huntley in 2018 in the first place Greenpeace discovered that the wholesale electricity price for every provider is based on that of the most expensive generator as Huntley is the most expensive generator in this country all generating companies would have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the main reason Huntley was extended keep profit margins up for all the other companies but more to the point of this particular meeting is that they say in five dot 16 that all generated electricity is combined on the general spot market now that 's just simply not true they ignored the fact that there is an echo spot market in New Zealand and through that they can buy renewable energy on the spot market though there 's only two examples that I noticed that for I thought their analysis was a bit lacking when I discovered on Tuesday afternoon that the electricity procurement contract was on today 's agenda I read through the recommendation which is option 1 which is to continue with the MBI LG contract but using even more polluting generators than with the current Christchurch City Council supply contract so I knew there had to be a better way it took me exactly two hours to not only find a carbon zero certified supplier for the City Council but also to procure a quote for providing electricity to the council at the same cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she can make it available to you this provider provides totally renewable energy to many large electricity users including fulton hogan the environment commission ACCC les mills human rights commission queenstown airport and Auckland University of Technology and many others and they 're currently in discussion with providing to the Christchurch hospital board and to the Auckland City Council because they are carbon zero if future governments impose a carbon tax which weighed 350 think that they must at some stage Christchurch City Council would not have to pay a carbon tax on their electricity if they used a carbon-neutral source this company recently won two out of the ten sustainable business network annual awards the company in association with juice point and charged net New Zealand are the leading suppliers of charging infrastructure and electricity for electric vehicles and the expanding network of EV charging stations the company is wholly 100% new zealand owned forty-nine percent of the company is owned by pioneer energy which is the Otago based community owned power generator the company has a sister company through pioneer energy that can provide the council or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advised if the ccc a Christchurch City Council sorry ivory vision contracted the company to provide 20 gigahertz hours which is one-third of your normal requirement or your last year 's requirement if the Christchurch City Council contractors companies provide 20 gigahertz hours of its electricity requirements for the next 30 months it would save the carbon output equivalent to putting 660 electric cars on the streets of Christchurch 350.org christ church submits to this council that it by twenty gigawatt hours annually of the electricity from echo tricity the company that i 'm referring to and that i have got a quote from and then evaluate over the next 30 months with the object are going to 40 gigawatt hours in other words two-thirds of your usage in the next contract round the mechanics the put it in a place are simple they take about two weeks to sign up the contract council staff would then identify a number of Christchurch City Council owned or operated building sites that together would use twenty gigawatt hours annually and electricity would provide electricity directly to those buildings and they could hook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you does any accounts that i hit christian era in port um probably ask you one hundred actually the so why are you suggesting only a third of our electricity done this way and not all of it i think at a practical basis I shouldn 't really be speaking for you but I would have thought that one would wanted to trial and have what you 've your existing supplier as well so you can compare and and so on but I mean that 'd be up to you know you and when maybe with reference to your staff with whether you could go all the way and do all 60 gigahertz hours okay so two other quick questions one is when the aluminium smelter closest you see electricity prices reducing what 's your group 's opinion on that we don 't have an opinion that we haven 't analyzed it and then finally and the report that said that all our electricity supplies that we receive here South Island generated from renewable energy so where does the carbon site come in and your equation because the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust power and they all generate electricity that produces either carbon or methane methane in the case of of the gas generated the geothermal generated and so what will happen in that contract with all four of those companies that there would be a movement of the load I suppose depending on their ability to generate and feed into the system and you would be getting hopefully most of it from Meridian but then you would also be fed in from time to time from the other companies and that and the carbon assessment of that is quite an easy thing to do holding thanks Charles following on long on the same thing just to clarify the reports is it because the renewable energy or renewable energy is produced in the South Island we would be only sourcing our energy from that source yes I 'd night from the big pot New Zealand wide yeah but that 's not correct you said it 's not know because if you 've got four companies in the contract and they do you know they do change they switch you know we provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get it back and i 'm not i think it this is the reports you sweet doesn 't come back the other way we buy as that 's what i 'm trying to clarify in my understanding is when we 're in a drought year and we have to reduce the amount of water that comes out of been more and the other dams that would do get it back okay yeah but no i haven 't seen the equity great stuff but Sarah is not going to get a question unless you g asset right now thanks Charles so just um while you 've given us an alternate option today and you coach David Bedford earlier why is that really important for us to do this what 's one of the things is that it 's part of of the you know the council 's long-term plan reducing carbon emissions and it 's also a moral choice not only in terms of Christ years but of the whole world and by using a renewable source you can reduce carbon as I said equivalent to 660 electric cars on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your sustainable goals the council sustainable goals but the worldwide need to reduce carbon very much thank thank you for making the time to come on normally we would go straight on to the item I 'm concerned but as you will have noticed on the agenda two of the attachments are and the public excluded part of the meeting and that 's because they contain you know confidential pricing information and so we will deal with this item is the last item on the agenda go into px to discuss the attachments and then come back out and have the debate on the on the report itself so I 'm sorry I can 't assist in terms of bringing it forward on the agenda today but also the nature of the information that we 're considering that is the only way that I can really manage it in order to get the meeting running smoothly so thank you very much for your present a few time and,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Strategy 2017 - 2022,kYgSAnLVdbw,20170203,1417.61,"Christchurch, New Zealand",3794,and the next item is submission on the draft energy efficiency and conservation strategy excuse me madam madam chair I 've I 'm I don 't I used to have she isn 't one of the companies that were talking about but i actually just checked last night and my share broker has moved a number of shares around and I don 't actually hold any in that one anymore it 's just um this is the draft strategy around he can this is not about electricity is this a different okay I 'll stop yeah I think he 's now sky ting don 't you yeah um just that you know i mean i 'm a former cabinet minister and actually having heading shares and a blind trust is actually a very good thing to do so that you don 't actually know what shears you 've gotten anything that would get wave there are no conflicts of untrusting but thank you for sharing that information which is an entirely irrelevant for this particular debate okay we 've got we 've got staff here in relation to the draft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any questions Sarah oh right okay back oh thank you um when it comes to the public sector and we 've got a suggestion here for the supporting actions table where we change to consider how public sector agencies can implement to procurement allah and aiding in the greenhouse gas emissions I 'm sedates page a hundred ninety-nine one hundred and our submission I just like to am in a similar vein to how we thought that support wasn 't very strong rather than getting the government to consider how it could do things i think maybe suggesting that they should implement them as an action rather than considering them as an action so taking out the consider how public sector agencies can under mint and as you just say what implement procurement policies are taken to account these things so are you suggesting that they should be saying require public sector agencies to implement policies which procurement policies yep I think that would be stronger rather than just getting agencies to consider it if people think that 's a good idea it 's our procurement policies yeah yeah and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my ear Pauline 's next and can I have a show of hands who else wants to ask question so so perfectly though any on evow questions on page it 's page 110 they talk about the transport accounts for around thirty six percent of energy use in seventeen percent of New Zealand 's gross emissions I thought it was a lot higher than that still transport was fifty percent that 's in the government 's submission draft submission I 'm just querying that statistic anyway um they also I just they talked about heat process changes and I 'm on deck salon page 110 and i 'm wondering if we could encourage them to have a shorter time frame to address that sixty percent of the proceeds heat is supplied by using fossil fuels inter actually what 's your time frame can prove by four to twelve for scenes between 2010 and 2030 do you think it 's is everything that we could that they could actually get that achieved in a shorter time frame the the the strategy that we 're dealing with today is only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the energy efficiency and conservation authority so there is a there is a broader strategy that the sits with them and that 's the new zealand energy strategy which is a longer-term one so that 's that would be the place to change those sorts of time frames rather than this one there 's a very short unless because it 's essentially the work plan yes missing from the dead into the five years yes oh which is most unlikely yeah ik what it was my question yes but the other thing is i don 't think they 've mentioned solar once on page 112 very briefly we haven 't really reinforced solar and i 'm wondering also why we haven 't actually mentioned biofuels anywhere we 've looked electrification dancers and other yes now good question the solar when you 're looking at renewable energy and heading on the carbon emissions Solar 's for New Zealand isn 't a great target it 's got some other benefits for a number of reasons but when you 're looking at carbon emissions it 's those transport and industrial type emissions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think from some others soul was not a real target aim for if you want something change quickly in New Zealand because of their eighty-two percent renewable electricity supply in the moment but people were doing it for other reasons okay in the boys on the biofuels and the eco head is not coming through here you 've got a program whether they 're looking to move more from the energy efficiency still important but definitely a message on the cabin looking at reducing carbon so they are doing a lot of work and southland on wood by ms and those sorts of things so innovations so it is a component of it 's not coming through here it definitely could be an addition I types might be happy to see that as an addition and particularly applicable to businesses and if we can get a lot of the diesel transport using biofuels that could have a considerable impact and just the other feeling I kind of get from from their drafters that it 's actually based more on economic benefit rather than environmental benefit I could be wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the goal is is threefold one is energy efficiency the other is productivity in terms of the economy and then the third one is the low cabin so it 's wanting those three to work together yeah okay and the other thing I wondered if because we want to continue encourage the government to continue the echo program so maybe we should strengthen that and instinctive ization miss the incentivization so someone 's got to leave someone 's gotta feel very well to say year we want this but we 're the incentives we were the incentives for people to buy an electric bike get out of their cars you any anything we can distinctly suggest that we could be more incentivization for people to adopt us and it comes from my environmentally neither than the economic lens which is you know why I asked another question so I think I think that 's always kind of here from now I and the strengthening the encouraging the innovation so the government to actually fund innovation towards energy efficiencies is probably a good one to strengthen thank you very good Phil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've done it because like it 's there 's a lot of detail work being done and it is excellent and like a real street that I thought was the area on web businesses can contribute and it kind of thing I did have a few questions around I just wondered Helen thanks for explaining that in fact this is just sort of part of the wider New Zealand energy strategy maybe if it just seemed to me that if since this is really about contributing to climate change and that in fact we should include those some of those wider s beats to in terms of where the set I so I 'll be interested in your comment on on that and then I 've got some other specific questions who so the the the strategy itself does reference back to the New Zealand energy strategy so they 've done that quite well in terms of how it nests and the context is reasonably clear in there what it probably doesn 't do though is linked it all the way back to the sort of climate change sigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the paramount issue certainly so we can we can put a comment in the front but as I say they 've got that threefold goal I assume it isn 't just about low carbon it 's as much about the productivity of the of the economy and the energy efficiencies yeah yeah this must be mature but I I don 't think maybe that 's something I am certainly we can we did it thank you and so look the sick the parts on transport are really so important i see you 've broken them up a bit in but i just think you know and perhaps nick might like to comment on this actually making it clear that part of the way forward in terms of the modes of transport change which you refer to in fact is really working at alternate alternative modes including cycleways and milking and we really spell that out I just felt if some emphasis on their end or so um acknowledge ignore and acknowledging and in fact Christchurch has it got a big investment in n cycleways and government have supported me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we and I think maybe some clarity about the the quantity of the emissions from transport because we weren 't quite clear that you might have had at the Iran we asked about their but it 's my understanding it is it it 's at least a third of our carbon emissions really a what it well get that I think I think that 's um it may be confusing and that often often it 's the percentages are expressed ignoring agricultural emotional absolutely so I went once you put agricultural of oceans in there it looks a lot smaller like well maybe yeah and that some yep nope agricultural emissions of methane yes that 's right no no I don 't think transports fifty percent because there 's also shamina G in there as well you see well maybe some of those figures could be included of you and you 'll have them we can we can cheat those they 'll be reference they will be graters and look why M pleased that you refer to the clock we 're doing a lot of electric car area but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be too many cars will stall and commuting will lead to urban sprawl and I commend you for being brave on that it doesn 't mean we don 't do the new technology the in fact we are that the part though that I wondered about too is reference to in reference to rail is it in fact there 's a real real gap via that you 'll be aware of Nick will be that in fact kiwiRail is really quite separate from wrigley for from the regional Land Transport plan for example it 's it 's not included because it 's a commercial sort of arm of government and just how in fact rail as and particularly the freight area Kemp can be and can be supported I guess to I guess at least listen the carbon emissions so they were some of the sort of areas i had just specifically to i just wanted to make sure and you can perhaps clarify this for us on page 99 there 's to support councils to adopt voluntary target rate schemes were possible i 'm just wondering if you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would work so the Environment Canterbury have a voluntary targeted rates scheme set up in some centres not on a Christchurch where people can essentially take a loan and pay it back through their rates for getting rid of open fires for installation of your homes that sort of them so it 's not it 's not rolled out right the way through the country but it is in some towns and cities particularly in for Environment Canterbury is particularly around air pollution benefits as well as the warm in her pajamas previously in it yeah thank you very much I just kind of felt like I pressure all the work you 've done the submission but i felt i was i was quite soft and and we should be a lot more direct in terms of things that you know government could do i mean i think cartridge has really got a really important story to share with the rest of New Zealand and with government over the lost opportunity following the earthquake so I 'm surprised there 's not more mention of district plan and regulatory processes they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to refer to existing programs as being successful but my take would be that we 've actually lost a lot because we weren 't able those regulatory things into a district plan around you know new builds and even the repairs and the whole repair program through EQC or through the insurance companies seem to lose the opportunity to make things you know energy-efficient so I just wanted if you 'd had any consideration of that like maybe just you know talking about taking opportunities you know post disasters to actually improve the energy efficiency of us of a city or of a community through land use planning and district 23 and I 've done at all it 's it 's not something that was considered as part of the submission but we could certainly go and have a look at that so it would be around legislate for legislative and regulatory reform in terms of both resource management act as a mechanism but also the building it in the standards and the building code as a mechanism so ending we would get multiple benefits in terms of both the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit of quality housing and also like I mean I think we should think also wider than energy efficiency if you think of things like water conservation for example like the idea that people have graywater systems as a requirement I mean this is acres we could but this is an energy efficiency strategy yes yes but you know if you if you think of through the whole debate about home heating the whole thing of that you know going from solid fuel burners to electricity it 's quite interesting around that health argument around people being able forward to actually be warm versus you know doing lots better for the environment so I just think you know I just don 't marry betters energy so I mean yes I mean look everyone understands that the conservation issues go far further than energy but this is the energy conservation no I understand that but it shouldn 't be done at the expense of the health of people in my view and you need some caution around that but also just the other thing I thought that sorry that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it shouldn 't energy efficiency not be done to the expense of people 's health yeah so what are you saying so basically you know like going to cleaner technologies if it 's more expensive has an impact on people 's ability to be able to afford to excess energy and we should actually be mindful of the social impact of that but um I think the other thing for me was just the whole issue of land use and intensification or use of brownfields this is green fields I know at the start we kind of talked about that but this sense of is contradiction that we just opened up more land for housing so I wasn 't quite sure if you get thought much about I think land use planning is worth the some commentary because if you if you 're not locating around hubs then you 're forcing people into cars you 're forcing people into you know traveling at a distance you know I mean I remember one of the subdivisions that opened over and the east you couldn 't even walk to the local dearie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Len juice cleaning you know sort of prioritizing brownfields as opposed to green fields as absolutely appropriate because of the link but also so are the standards that apply to the builds themselves and it is true that some of the standards we wanted to include an our district plan were not accepted by the under pendant hearings panel and that position was supported by the governments of Muslim which is I think a shame and and I think it as exactly as the only set amidst opportunity so we 're happy to strengthen that section around the homes yeah in terms of both the resource management in the building it framework yep and I was so happy to add something about the lengies planning yeah just that is just a link to it because it does mean that there 's more energy use of people have to travel in order to get to places you know which is why we 've focused our activities around the the key activity centers but the one that I just want to add and I 'll come to you as in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the DHB being part of the had exchanged the local energy scheme and or district energy scheme and that was a decision that was made in Wellington wasn 't a decision that was supported locally by the Canterbury thb and it 's again a huge missed opportunity and we 've got that cold cold burnin facility right and they use booooored hospital being powered entirely by weight would waste residues is the good example and they don 't they 're completely ignore the fact that they had an opportunity to decommission a coal-burning facility right in the heart of the city and so that was just just saying yeah Vicky and I think there 's a couple of ways that we could do this and I think it 's quite hard to write a submission with all these M pods either we could do it here or we could do it like we did the oil one and just have a small group and just rehash it I would I would love that so I 've got a list so first of eight items that we need to strengthen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it yep it 's i mean the the energy strategy that it 's based on is unassuming the 2011 one before the signing of the Paris thing which actually includes the words the government wants new zealand to be a highly attractive global destination for petroleum exploration and etc and how coal is really important in crude oil and all those sorts of things and yet we have a Paris agreement which requires us to cut our emissions by thirty percent by 2030 and this covers five of those years so and I mean even government fleets of vehicles are still not electric there 's no real incentives here for people to change their car for a fossil fuel car to an EV through way of interest-free loans the targets are incredibly soft and I just think in the way that we did with the oil submission a group of stroppy people sitting around the table just telling it really hard it 's probably the easiest way of doing it and say so what 's a deadline for the symmetry febri so that that group of stroppy people will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appoint counselors but actually we 're going to delegate to them so can I have names please so delegate them to delegate the approval of the submission to the following group of counselors the woman 's get it was the worst it was human that 's how I kind of delegate Amendment and final approval yes yeah um and it 's going to be Pauline Phil and perky I didn 't get my end up and we wouldn 't we have a submission service that we 're just we 're signing off on the terms of reference next week so yeah yeah and in the mirror so yeah do do you want to be on a limb all right he likes roughly what sprinkling so right could we have a quorum yeah 30 you 've got it you 've got a quorum of two yeah that 's cool thank you final approval of the submission to UM yeah for me you back don 't Jane hot to work with staff just just say trying to improve them all the submissions take out those words yep yep two counselors back kasia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'm going to suggest that Kevin and Nick have a go at the list of things that we 've heard yep tomorrow yeah end on Tuesday morning will need to meet and get it signed off so we can send it off on tuesday afternoon yeah is it me public transport we 've talked about encouraging the use of public transfers in the polluted city but we haven 't really focused on electrification and public health out so that might lead to it including we delegate it to a meeting of with a quorum of two thanks boys so I 'm changing it to a meeting of councillors etc etc with a quorum of to thank you alright so i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye where the place i know next Kari zoo boo oh sorry Dukey Pauline and the 14 and Sarah moved in the season I 'll put it again all those in favor say aye those opposed no no that 's Carrie right and finally can we have staff back at the table now just

everyone how nice it is to listen to other people reporting and this sure thing I but you have not gotten it because the staff had been tendered around which is supported by several groupings in the community including the Christchurch City Council is a terrific thing yeah and i hope to be copied elsewhere and those kinds of ideas that we get from other boards it 's really nice to be able to hear and listen to them and that we had tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kuru club and i 've mentioned in before they lost their premises to a fire they were homeless and they now our next door in the bowling club which was down to 18 members and they are have bought the building after having saved money for a large number of years they told me and i haven 't heard of many sports clubs that have safe manning like there and they are keeping the greens going for the 18 members end themselves over the next five years and I so look forward to being there tomorrow because this is such a success story they won 't run rugby league clubs and softball cultural Club Torrio classes and other sports as well and on we on no vendor the fifth we had the last meeting of the year which is what I 'm reporting on and rally school presented in the beginning you know how we give grants to young people to go away for sports and we ask them to come back and report and very often they don 't and when we were young people we wouldn 't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rally a group that went to the sports occasion and Tehran Iran which we help them get to they turned up on mass and they sang lai outta three separate way outta just beautifully and they started what was going to be a reasonably tense meeting off in the best of style that was followed by the Tennis Club submissions on lights and Tennis Club and on the lights and the tennis clubs where the board mater and the board has made a recommendation to the head of green spaces and I think the head of green spaces will be acting upon our recommendation reasonably soon and we 've behaved a couple of informal meetings on the annual plan and the LTP and are we are proposing a couple of changes from that which we presented to council before Christmas is our first draft we will be we are discussing a legacy project and we will be asking we hope for some very small amount of seeding money for a project that we would like to see to come through to fruition possibly when the council has got slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the other boards reporting on new libraries being opened its it right that 's just a cool thing and we one of the things we are instituting this year is meeting the boards of trustees at their meeting so we are asking to be a in other words be a submitter or a participant at the boards of trustees of all our schools and we are hoping to get all our schools done in the coming year and one of the things we will be introducing though we hope that the conversation will be mostly them telling us about their issues one of the things though we would like to discuss with them is talking about our participation school particularly when it comes to democracy and encouraging children and young people to participate in the processes for example of council and we would like it 's probably impossible to make it sexy and exciting all day every day no matter what you might think of your own ability to do that clin but we can but we can try and say how important it is to be here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes meetings and I think that 's it I think I aww finally I can 't sing so naturally I 've introduced to my adder at the beginning of every meeting and we had Christmas carols sung as a our Christmas party so I stand very close to staff members like era ha nui grace and solomon whenever we are required to sing and this new regime but i 'm so we 're hoping that we can get some encouragement to from the Mavi advisors and council about what else the kinds of things that we could do to further our engagement with Maori and comply with the treaty thank you it 's fun thank you know the initiative around the meeting with the boards of Trustees is fantastic it 's great and I think your idea that people come here and then they hear other great ideas that boards are doing will help to spread those ideas yeah it 's really it 's really terrific to be here actually good done Phil um I just want to acknowledge Carolyn 's cheering publicly the issue that she mentions with gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those types of things come up in our community boards it 's so important that everybody feels that they are heard and the debaters in public etc and um I just wanted to publicly acknowledge Carolyn 's cheering up their issue and the board at that time so I think your Carolyn is extremely what I think it so thanks Karen I particularly wanted to add to the comments that the inmate about the links with boards of trustees because I think that whole education sector is something that we as a council to need to need to develop and it 's just so important so and I think the planning that you outlined for the board sort of program if you like I think it 's really good you be proactive as there 's a community board in leading it thank you thank you yeah so you 'd like to move the report and second to but um I 'll pop that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much care thank you and could invite erin homes then Ron Rolston operations Trent,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

2016,nKy7r2PPQho,20170203,686.09,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1778,could move now to the community board part of the agenda and as I said on previous occasions that that from the next month these will be dealt with my way of reports so that a cheers report will come to from each of the community boards and that will give us an opportunity to really engage with our our community boards the chief executives report will come to the community board council meeting and the future which will be the second meeting of the month and and there 'll be a new addition to the agenda which will be a me as report and the mayor 's report will enable us to report on on the other external organizations that we engage worth either through the utes or through the merrill forum or through the local government New Zealand and it 's just an opportunity to provide reports on an ongoing basis so that the wider activities of the council are able to be brought to the table from a governance perspective so could i invite there christine from the banks peninsula community board Christine Wilson to come forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair of the community board to thank you come to the table you 're most welcome that 's really good to be here think you lean for the welcome and as i said earlier on and we are really looking forward to being able to do those reports because i think we 'll be able to cover a lot more information and then so we 're quite excited about that and just add minutes from attorney active november and there was just a couple of deputations it go because it was a confirmation of minutes may chang one of them was the ok 's by water is it appropriate to talk about that now so that 's one of our in your playing items yeah yep car away the key I just really wanted to obviously the informations here in the minutes if we had a wonderful deputation from Rebecca parish and one of the things i think that raised it as a priority for us as a board as the fact that they so many young families lebanon Akane 's bay as a result of cheap hair zone and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data because of this you can stick financial circumstances they cannot afford our bottled water so it 's a real problem for those families that love and over the yes so I really just wanted to pronate to the table today because eaters are consumed for us because I think water and particularly as just a basic made of everybody really so we really would like to try a beast to support and the deputation that was submitted through Rebecca and I 'm pair for the old Cane 's a water committee also i think because obviously they here they came to Gran 's the the museum 's quite a dominant feature they 're all sorts of reasons but if I think it 's just something out of the Bennett 's that I really just wanted to bring to the table today I don 't know if there 's any questions a real neat not no no just if you carry on and I can and the other item obviously was the g jenkins seen hip occasion it got sorted and as you 'll say and the minutes so it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phones which apposite us at the dictation animation on Monday and just gone there Crowell wastewater karate or the group came over to door dictation so as a result of each hour working community week group was formed which will consist of two community board members to Robinson bay from Robin symptoms by Totec Matua and the rune hangers which is all know Kevin Coco Rocha and so hopefully our thick group being formed it might be able to help get things moving forward and I think the communication is really probably going to be k and all of us so hopefully that we can groups going to help as part of it the things on the peninsula obviously warden very but this why say we 're looking forward to doing the reporting because we have to bring the effect council but the one thing that lock received and that 's clearing and as moving forward I bistro suit degree because it 's quite a bag be a few of the board members as the maintenance our shows and over through the peninsula and look obviously it 's citywide so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the contractors so we can kind of get a grip of we 're things are each into hopefully and take the 18 because quite a lot of angry at the inn we do get comments like council can 't get these things right here they expected to get other things right so it 's just basic concerns we think if we can try and sort out with those things that we can get on with more strategic things for Peninsula and another positive that the naval point development plans back on the table near the cra-z so the community excited about they obviously there 's a lot of work that Eric banks and was timed to be doing but there 's been several meetings with stakeholders in I don 't envy the planners the job because it 's a lot of interested parties Stanley was not a huge amount of area but obviously yes and you know important not just to the much about our Christchurch and study abroad because of you know the boating activities and things that take place down there so that 's good that that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pollito fleets due to reopen on the next month so we 're really looking forward to the eight um I was talking to one of the librarians the other day and she was very thankful that they hid that temporary facility a perch are the rec center and she said that they wouldn 't have been up to at coke because our the lunch and libraries quite a hub for the residents here and so they 've been very thankful in a thinking for the new facility the other positive of the long-term pole and the way that it 's been managed near as being really successful it 's been really utilized people can buy a ticket or a concession card for family for a link was one hundred forty dollars in make a nexus T 'Pol during open ears and afterwards and its really woot and it 's really good to see it been you know fully Yost and a little bit of a big ideas as another big one for the peninsula and I 've already heat and somebody or a business owner that just moved into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wants to get involved with that plane so it 's been good I mean and the list goes on and on and the cruise ships and a per hour as another one is lots of foreign against seat obviously this but I think some of the concerns that are coming out of the really around been over to and provide decent toilet facilities for people that are comin through and the infrastructure I geese and with so many coaches turbulent Christchurch we know earlier and but on the positive side and as I say who 's over there it 's actually thrilled what 's the business that it is bringing into that part of the furniture so young its pod stuff won 't meet sabir don 't really at the moment very good is great for a feast report so you 're done I could tell you a little bit nervous but don 't be ya know none of us are gonna buy it no impunity lighter yeah very move the report and Andy so move that the minutes be received and that the report be received because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's great the minutes and the report favor safe and if I can just add a comment about the Littleton swimming pool longer days longer sees and better use of a council facility more people including me more active more often there 's been a great result thank you I um it just did occur to me that you know that there are other facilities that could benefit from the experience and I can see in galloway nodding who he 'd frantically because that 's that facility out it to help or wolves or that that would obviously benefit from extended hours and with a community sort of liaison so I 'm just I 'm just wondering whether the whether we could get the lessons learned from what 's happened in littleton somehow gathered together and brought out all 's well I think it 's probably relevant to haul swell templeton and possibly unwelcome as well in fact all of the summer pools cuz i mean we 're seeing creased use because we 've extended the length of time the pools opening the day we 're extending the season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are getting later if it 's a good outcome for littles and it could be a good outcome for all of those summer pools yeah yeah yeah exactly yeah yeah I 've felt but I 'm i 'm happy to second the report um and I 'm particularly impressed that the board are you know working with the residents of cannes by around they already had accepted downs I guess I reckon so yeah but I 'm also wanted a comment on Ripley 's Withey that you 're involved with the echo our Harbor issue in the group and working with the group 's the different resonance groups who who clearly have different views around there Christine so I think committee boards doing those water issues is commendable yeah hopefully thank you very much thank you lean and thank you around for your time chronically so nervous next time for phone so I i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you lovely thing to do and,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

2016,ynvR_BKZIp0,20170203,686.29,"Christchurch, New Zealand",2201,that next ex community borders coastal Barrett come money first time welcome thank you the warning again good morning counselors staff and community it 's really great to be here mm need these it doesn 't like first time seeing I 've been newly elected so um happy new year the minute fella reporting on today from the 15th of November I 've just got the one meeting via this was our very first community board meeting after we were sworn in and one day after the 14 15 million but earth quake all our community board staff were involved with the civil defense etc that evening the night and the week following and yet we were still able to hold the meeting without any her cup so awesome you know great thanks to our staff for being able to do that and deliver that it was really amazing Emma notes for that day I 'm 15th November are pretty straightforward but i would actually just like to highlight one issue here under the members exchange which was because of the event the day before the board requested that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tsunami sirens activation etc a few issues to say the least that evening so on to say I 'm glad to report back that we head through the council a very successful workshop as part of the council 's independent tsunami review really successful we had local community board chairs attend that meeting and the feedback was absolutely fantastic so we 're looking forward to seeing what comes out of that because the study you know is when I was looking for to have a really smooth exit plan and plan in place there so that 's all I really want to talk to about the the actual minutes but I would just like to take the opportunity while I 've got you in front of me just to say a few things and on behalf of the community board and our community I 'd really like to just publicly thank you all very much for the financial commitment that you 've done to the hots Paul was an allow pool that is really exciting for our community it that 's going to trust a sudden to be restored and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be such a unique asset for our city so for everyone to enjoy and we 're looking forward to seeing pigs on the ground very soon it 's just very exciting and we just have to also acknowledge the part that development Christchurch limited play them that they did a massive amount of work behind the scenes that 's never seen but to get to where we are today we really appreciate what they have done and their community consultation process and the phase one was was excellent as well so that was that 's great we also bought here for you today a community initiative called a sure thing and in this we have assessed summertime 's event calendar for New Brighton and i 'm told officially that our side of town has the most fence in the city so this is a really good place to start looking for that and on the weekend for example we had quite day and I tell you the priests really doesn 't actually show really well the thousands of people that were there there were thousands it was like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing was we 've had winds all over the summer and that one particular date has hardly any wind bleep I thought to come from down south somewhere really struggled to get up if at all and but it was ideal just for the little kids to be able to get their kites up and it was just amazing and the buskers were there as well and I 'll tell you I drove down there really but I try to get cop out the hedgerow all the way back and walk down so should have done that in first place and the other thing that 's come out this monday is I love you bryson in thompson park which is also going to be an amazing event and also on the 11th obsessed says every element that we have the close to posts which is going to end up and empathise are down there by the pier and every saturday we have an amazing market they 're being done by our community so what I want to just sort of just say briefly to was that brings me to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as community boards as one of these things this is a classic example of how we can get something into the community that updates their community is what 's happening on local level the council do that really well on their webpage across the city and community as us as a community board right sort of instigate maybe something social media pamphlet something that is able to get this information out really really quickly I know that other boards are looking at the same thing as well but something that 's localized for us for example we 've got the major issue of rubbish and maintenance and our area as we do across the city generally but that seems to be something that 's on the social media a lot but I do hit here that there are some room there 's some action being happening very soon I 'm going to have a debrief next week and regarding rubbish bins and things like that was really exciting to know that and that as stuff I 've been working hard on that the community board members have individually and collectively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes to the information sharing like what is going to be happening with the rubbish bins to have something like their own personalized face book or pamphlet like this would be a great way to quickly get that out to the community and it 's not coming from all sorts of directions or we 're not individually having to do it so a better for our resources and our time the other thing that 's exciting for us to the Qt sports and recreation we had the sod tuning I have to say Lee in you must have been working out of wee bit harder than me because you tune that 's all pretty easily no I think they softened up for bid okay but it sounds really good but um so at the moment they the staff have a consultation process going about the hydro slide so we 've got two colors they 're asking the community to choose from one is blue and one as the Canberra colors red and black so you can go online press the button choose which one you like and also they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lastly we just I just like to invite you again personally to a coastal bus to a coastal booooored bus tour and that 's on febri the 16th now so it 's all day but for those that can 't make it all day there 's the opportunity to join us either in the morning on the afternoon so we 'd love to see you in information about that will be coming out to you so it 's our shout coffee is on us lunch if I come and enjoy some fresh air and in a little time at the beach say thank you excellent a lens term Dion Pauling oh yes staff can just put pianos out at their leisure thank you the board they 've all been around a bit now kind of a lot of the issues that have been produced out they have been traversed we had a good gathering with the leaders the other night over from the community over the tsunami workshop and I think that went well too given bodger once described your bright and as being a you know it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold it all together but people know each other pretty well the boards responding well under Kim 's leadership staff from border working well together so here I think there 's some really good things and once q2 's built that will really be a restore a lot of hope and confidence in the community so all goes well at this point yes the electric kim and i had a catch up yesterday and saw the electric charging stations going in just adjacent to the lot to the library so we 'll have to buy a Carter to use them now after you it 's the compacting burn that I 'm looking forward to yeah so the trial of the compacting fun will be out and you brighten and there 'll be a result on that sometime very very soon mm happy with regards rubbish and there 's a lot of events out there whether it 's the kite diet coast to coast when we do events around the place or when I used to wear you always try to include the community whether it 's a school sporting group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it is because that kind of assists and join in the community to the event but also generates money for those organizations which is always really hard to do had ever been discussed with you and your community because I mean not you 've got the standard contract that if you followed would be ridiculous if you 're having a big event or an event because the rubbish generated a zone above the norm so obviously you will have problems it 's not as a no brainer and it 's for the obvious really good idea so I can 't answer that given that i 'm new to the table okay but definitely something i will be a question our last staff when i meet with them your pack stuff and I meet next week well it hasn 't been asked yet it 's a bit of a shame I 'm not sure yeah but now I think yeah but ok thank you thank you well I can get back to you on that if you 'd like dianna yani in about 4 from my perspective I think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting to you know not feel right and so I think we I would actually like to have some sort of briefing from all kappa you know or something to actually just talk to us about what 's actually going on and how we can have a bit more influence about what 's going on nothing community boards need to be involved with that as well absolutely yeah yani that 's all thanks if we do have a report coming back on maintenance so that should hopefully be the opportunity to do that but um I just answer in your reference to kirito and see that you 've had some sports clubs come and have you any idea or since of the master plan for qe2 site at the non you know not with a school all the ripped centers going but the other stuff we 're on the edge was your blood given any information around the time that will be coming to us there have been expressions of interest and we have had some come to the board and no decision can be made on it until we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presented to us you know we 'll have a big benefit are you worried that you 're getting groups coming ahead of that who never worried that the community 's passionate and Reza to be involved in this is Easter okay yeah excellent I can I 'm just wondering how you make decisions then without having a plan for what happens in q2 well once we see who 's interested in what the expressions are interested are then we 'll know what plan will be going forward so but yeah so we need to wait for that so yeah that 's exciting exit so Glenn I 'm assuming that you 're moving their motion and seconded by pooling I 'll put the motion that we receive the minutes and we

NZ,NZ,Christchurch City Council,Christchurch City Council,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZETwErnCvvgbvBbnnHfyxA,26.01.2017 - Item 14 - Submission on the Health Amendment Bill,Zre-0p4Elns,20170126,748.43,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1854,and the last measure on this part of the agenda the submission on the health fluoridation of drinking water amendment bill now that so there 's a copy of the submission on everyone 's desk so desk so we better it up it updated and the key elements of the update is that is that we opposed the bill because community consultation is not made a requirement for decision-making ovation to a decision to fluoridate drinking water and so under the local government here I mean that the bill proposes that the decision making around fluoridation go from the local authority who has an obligation under the local government act to consultants communities over decisions of significance and this is a significant decision Tranzit transfuse the decision making to a decision maker that doesn 't have an obligation to consult on any of the decisions that it makes and and then if the new decision maker has been given the position of that I mean the new decision maker makes a decision that the water is fluoridated then the cost is met by the local authority that has no say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost comes back to the ratepayers of a district even though they haven 't been consulted over what is a significant cost we oppose the resolution at the local government New Zealand conference which sought to see the decision-making transfer through to the Ministry of Health and because they saw it as a health decision but I think that councils around the country that voted for that change to the law expected that the decision making would also be accompanied by the funding responsibility and of course the government 's done the complete opposite butchers which is interesting they have handed it not to the Ministry of Health for a health decision to apply across the country they have handed it to individual district health boards so in our region we 've got two district health boards we 've got the Canterbury District Health Board and the South Canterbury district health board and then each district health board makes its own decision if the Canterbury dhb decided that its water supplies plural would be would be fluoridated then the cost for christchurch city alone would be ten and a half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could be more than that and over half a million dollars per year operational so it 's a significant cost to the city and its and the district that it has the peninsula is part of our responsibility as well we have multiple levels of multiple points of or and from different public water suppliers that supply our districts so so so I think this submission is now a lot firmer then the one that we looked at in its draft form and so I 'm really keen to open that up for I me know if there are any questions of staff but I mean it 's it 's not questions really other than technical questions and then just a probably a debate on whether we accept this submission and then whether we want to appear and support of the submission or not Pauline Sarah it 's sort of a question I 'm just wondering if we and it 's on the content but whether we should in our own conclusion actually put some more info the point of difference that we have here in Christchurch because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost implications of that that we do have a point of difference and therefore that will have could well affect the viability of any proposal I 'm just wondering if that needs to be highlighted in strength and aninha could just refer paragraph 7 45 69 and also I also would like to have 17 a and seated and our conclusion near that looking at all practical options practicable options for the achievement of the objective that doesn 't include a mess medication I just like to see those two things actually highlighted at the conclusion as well and wonder about the will of the table to do that sorry we 're which part you want in the conclusion to read the Christchurch has a point of difference in how its water is sourced which could make the viability which could affect the financial viability of this proposal and that would refer to paragraphs four five six and nine and the report and also to strengthen to make sure 17a is included in the conclusion which is actually seeking innovative ideas to to achieve this all practical options without mess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refer to mess medication because that sounds like that okay if you 're in there 's it 's not the argument we 're not exploring other options i think as yeah but that that is an obligation under the local government at you 're quite right you know it should be highlighted thank you yep um Sarah it 's the most democratic principles and things when we look at the the DHBs and point 24 their talks about the the DHBs and the difference between those who are appointed and elected and the potential for conflict there and to DHBs minus 10 is that DHBs have to meet what 's required by the Ministry of Health and so is this if it 's a director from the ministry that dental care those kind of things be a key consideration would they have to make the decision to no matter what the elected members stood for anyway it would there be an imperative for them to decide to do it so imagine after about the background weakens of the DSP are some of the submissions made previously around for reduction from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it so that 's why they meet their middle years out of a grant from the government don 't get any wrong but so in the past I 've made submissions saying that it 's a far more cost-effective put fluoride in them for them to treat but that 's one group pain another group benefiting and that 's the problem here and so that 's really the difference but I would say and I I suppose our members sitting away from the board of the boat but any place that I 've seen a dhp up here around fluoridation it 's been on a cost-benefit basis that it was the benefits outweigh the costs ok and what one of the things could I just ask you a question it is that second sentence in 31 it submits the legislation will remain unaltered because of that requirement the local governing to a bit community views if you read that that 's saying basically you want the decision to stay with counter I just wanted to confirm there it 's kind of hidden in the submission here maybe it 's due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the intention is if you read their symptoms you 're right in water and Christ you just given a strong emotional attachment that people have to water you need to consult this community incredibly well and thus seeks to take away any consultation a lot of people will be making submissions if the DHB or the Ministry of Health had to fund and had to consult under the exactly the same conditions would we want the decision-making sit in here or something else that this is no matter what we wanted to sit with counsel and that 's just what I want a preliminary their preliminary our primary view is is that the that the legislative framework shouldn 't change yes our secondary position our fullback position is it would is that if the decision is made to transfer the decision-maker then actually central government has to fully fund both the costs of establishing Vera Dacian and the ongoing operational costs so and the reason that we 've highlighted central government as being really the source of this for the funding of it is because if they make the dhp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will give in terms of the DHB funding for the area and i 'm not in favor of seeing our dhb you know sort of more underfunded you know as a result of a decision that it may want to make around fluoridation i might just talk to Judith and whether we pull that second sentence up to be a point so is highlighted slightly more maybe maybe maybe that we should start that at a web that opposes the bill because it opposes the bill and submits that the legislation must continue to allow the local authority to be the decision maker because there is a requirement under the attack for councils to consider community views before making such a significant decision yep they were just nvm verify make it a bit clearly yeah yeah yeah but we 've got to state our opposition to the bill yeah all right yeah but someone like to hit with amendments oh noez this past year with amendments as discussed and do we want to appear in support of first submission I think you just made a compelling case I think you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I actually think that there 's going to be quite a few suppose around crashes so and you know I know that if the test of the Vicki but Facebook page is anything to go by there will be a lot of submissions from Christchurch so we will certainly ask for them to to to hear submissions and Christchurch yep exactly we could put that in here too yes please do yeah just one in terms of just making a position known to algae and z does any yeah yeah we will be good to circular yeah to them so okay can we send a copy to LG and see it as well but I 've got to speak to them about something else I 'll me there 's also the regional Miral forum tomorrow the regional mayoral forum tomorrow can be informed by me and tomorrow I have been having some crib associate medical officer of health once he 's seen it and I don 't know what they 're saying but the DHBs Magnus emissions so I have a meeting with them tomorrow morning so i will tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or ipod council yeah no that 's fine sorry I don 't know what their submission is I 'll probably find out tomorrow movie yeah all right okay so would someone like to move us ok second Pauline I 'll put that motion boilers in favor say aye those opposed they know that scary,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Grant,nh_QAnbX61o,20170126,731.76,"Christchurch, New Zealand",2212,far beyond the call of duty reallocation of a heritage incentive grant number 11 sorry who moved it Aaron siege ended Phil is there any discussion yeah I want to hear from staff I 'm not sold on this one okay again yet again we will hear from staff on the woods mill for my street eddington we 've hit it twice before so now we 'll hear it for a theater no no no no I 'm not I 'm just acknowledging the fact that this is the third time there the council has looked at the scrap my wondering if councillor golf could be a little more specific they 're not sold on the sweater helped me to kind of I was wanting I don 't know well it wouldn 't be there appealing with it straight record but um I guess wife laid that you know I 'm not diametrically opposed this I was just hoping that you may be able to sway we Smurfs way us with your sweet words on while is worth pursuing with us I just get nervous and I 'm reading this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no no that 's the sort of thing if people have tried and failed and tried and failed and it 's like a hot potato that really looks terribly unappealing and has been unable to work for a number of different people people so I 'm getting to the point where i 'm slightly cynical reading the report thinking you know what there are actually a lot of good causes out there are a lot of buildings which which people are getting on with and will we probably coming to the council tying money up and something which is a bit of a sinking ship or historically has been a sinking ship and has gone nowhere i I was unconvinced on whether or not we want to be putting such a large sum of money aside for something that I have minimal confidence and it beast that will actually get off the ground so let me and let me start earning Fiona can be hip some coming off the detail of the scheme so what smell is pretty much the last remaining industrial building that represents the kind of industrial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things like that and the Edmonds building and more recently old crumbs that 's just gone from my head the one that was that the train went through where the cinema was entered o the mornin lil the door yeah um so so this is this is the the last remaining building the the prospective owner has a background and structural engineering and I think probably has a better understanding of the the kind of scale and complexity of the project but also my understanding and I 'll hand over to fiona is that he has a simpler approach to that of the strengthening into the adaptive reuse then perhaps earlier schemes have had but at that point it 's probably appropriate for me to hand over to Fiona to fill in Italy so um well yeah there 's actually there 's probably two reasons why we think this is potentially one that 's going to fly as opposed to the ones that have fallen down so I guess one is that the new owner potential owner is a structural engineer he fully understands the building he 's come up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report says it 's less invasive than the previous schemes we 've said so in terms of the heritage retention it 's actually a much more preferable scheme for us there 's a minimal a much more minimal loss of heritage fabric than previous schemes we 've said sort of less less concrete less steel you 're going to the end result you should actually read the building much better and the previous scheme that came into you guys they were actually intending to take down one entire Bay of the mill building itself which is that three story you know the large of the two buildings in sight where 's this one he 's actually he said there 's no need to do that you keep the bay you can just stitch it back to to the main part of the building so from our point of view as well that 's a far better outcome so and the other sort of strand to why potentially this is going to work better is that I think they 're looking at more appropriate uses I mean previously I think they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hotel and things like that and that was just problematical round in terms of adapting it and using it whereas this one there being quite pragmatic about it so they 're looking at commercial office space for both buildings and the and for the mill building I think sort of commercial office space all the way through all those potentially you could Det the ground floor to sort of retail or or something like that if that turned out to be more appropriate but at the moment office space is really the key thing in this area and then potentially you 've still got that sort of restaurant cafe use in the grain store next door but with offices above so I think it 's dumb better heritage outcomes more pragmatic potential uses this guy knows the building inside out he 's looked at the engineering on it before he 's done this worldwide as well in terms of the engineering so he really knows what he 's talking about in those terms and for us as well it 's a much lighter touch it 's a much better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's almost a complex which you 've got the two buildings and thus the open space to the front of it and it 's it 's a really rare thing for us to having Christchurch now so we are really keen to try and retain this one which is why we keep sort of trying to move this this grant on and I think this this looks like the best opportunity we had so far with this complex and as he so see local is he that familiar with the new developer then familiar with her you know the Christchurch name I want to get an i guess so much will make decisions based on how feasible I think of it you know i 'm going over supply of office space yeah eddington officers are not on the up you 've got no the supply of office space centrally far better quality buildings the rent will be far more attractive a bit of quite bitter quality in the sense that it 's you know a great buildings new yeah not necessarily cooler but I 'm just saying that that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff it looks really challenging that you could get rents that could actually approach making that stack up so all credit to him if that does does he have experienced in and Christ risen familiar with our he 's he 's mean that 's around for the last five six years he keep him he kept moved here soon after the quakes initially he came with an American company that that came in to help with the engineering and basically he stayed and he set up his own company and people that want to do this stuff though to you know I think you gotta back and it 's kind of no loss for us in the sense that if it doesn 't we do the money doesn 't go what my concern was around I think you 've answered it was opportunity cost you know have we got other things that that could be more of a goer or may look more promising that may miss out as a result of that do you think that that 's going to be the case anything on the horizon that may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't got a stellar track record um not that I know of at the moment sorry um there 's I mean there 's potentially some people interested in grants at the moment but nothing on this scale and are noting that this I mean there are other grants that can fall within the what we 've got available alright because this has already been allocated ya know so there 's still some money available for what I know of that might be on the horizon and totally isn 't yet famous and think seeing Pelini available no I think actually your question was quite useful because the explanation you know certainly I think has just opened up people 's eyes to the significance of the building in terms of what what it represents because it 's not just the fact that it 's here such as the type of heritage that it is you know I remember when the Edmonds building came down itís I refuse to have anything to do with anything that ever replaced it I 've never never bought petrol at the petrol station that was there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there and no that none of the shop owners are to blame for it but I I just think it was willful destruction and totally unnecessary and this is Anna this is an opportunity to keep one of our industrial buildings now I 'll be sporting it Aaron though and tum jaan e so on there Edmonds one madam chair is that the reason why you told your husband you wouldn 't pick up a cookbook again for the nice thing you 've had a good break I I think they 're clearly there is other funding if other applications come in this is an outstanding example of industrial heritage as has been we 've been told in like it 's it 's I think I 'm counselor Goff supports Toby that in fact it 's worth giving these guys apart and we 've supported it before and here is still an opportunity and certainly I think it 's with us and I think the the skills are that have been described to us through with the need for a new engineering approach for the sound of it I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is certainly a useful opportunity and we hope it succeeds tongue Yanni this was discussed at the informal this morning and your concerns were actually shared around the members around the informal but I do think that when we talked about it that this that this is the third potential develop to have a crack at this there 's more information each time it 's looked at with this developers background there 's probably more potential for this to be successful because this is such a really realistically as Fiona see this is the last really of this kind of building in our city it is incredibly significant and we 've really got to give them what may be one more go and see that this flies and in fear enough if it doesn 't then we do have to take a hard look as if this is ever going this building can either be in this category yep yeah oh thank you um I think the question raises the important issue of do we have a heritage strategy because it seems that just giving money to heritage buildings isn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so is there a kind of I mean where 's the heritage strategy at and do you think it would be useful to have a bit more proactive thought into how we actually save some of our most iconic heritage buildings in the city so we 're in grants but apples or other things so um you will be well aware that I 'm here to staff have been completely focused on the Heritage provisions in the district in review they literally that was one of the last chapters to be considered by the independent hearings panel and so staff have literally just started to turn their mind to the Heritage strategy and is on on the web program and we 're working with heritage New Zealand Department of Conservation and other key stakeholders to look at what the scope of that night are who to look at what the scope of that strategy should be and in fact is it a strategy or what are the tools and levers that are needed now in the city so we 're just starting that week and starting those conversations okay all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor say aye there 's

Zealand,dmjBi_dlhws,20170126,608.779,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1661,and audit and risk management committee 2016 annual report management report from audit New Zealand treasure and died thank you this is obviously you know quite a focus technical report and Tim and in relation to the issues that it raises with respect to skirt so I particularly was came for either or both of you to give us a bit of a an overview of the issues in particular the the one issue that led to us having the the new go to my brains not working properly you you know the comment from from the Audit Office in relation to our capitalizing off of monies paid to scoot and in the second issue as in relation to their handing over of not knowing that the value of off the its SEO asset valuation problems that we have with them as it comes back okay before it comes P so just all i 'll give you my version and patricia can correct me be the way it works with skirt is that we receive monthly accounts from them which the crown counsel and NZTA pay as their received and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is work in progress so that the amount we pay goes into a work in progress account because at that point we don 't know what 's been done for the month and we have no no and the job isn 't finished so we can 't do anything but it as projects are completed and the paperwork is done and it comes back through the asset owners on the fourth floor and up to ourselves we then have sufficient detail to identify whether it 's a capital project like for example waste water pipe replacement or whether it is just a repair to an existing asset and Patricia are coached me earlier that a repair is something which doesn 't extend to the life but I but clearly does and the analogy was painting your house which doesn 't extend the life of your house whereas if you re cladded it from weatherboard to some other cladding it does and you 'd capitalize that cost so we get the detail back we look at it to find out festival isn 't roading or water or wastewater and in second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital work or is that something that should be expensed so that 's this in an overview what happens is the most simple explanation that I 've heard so I 'm glad I asked you the question okay thank you for sure so the issue around the 55 though is that there are costs there was in fact 89 million of course that spirit encode which was earlier work around the analysis and of and the investigation of what needed to be done and our view was that that was capital the reason we expensed it two years ago is because were wrongly advised and so we expensed it but once we receive detail we determined that wasn 't the correct treatment so we reversed it and capitalized it and the reasons for why I said out in the order paper for it now audit disagreed with us and we sought external advice and we also sought the advice of the chair of audit and Risk Committee and we remained convinced that our approach was correct so we continued to process it as a capitalized item just to give you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way audit was suggesting we 'd actually have to write an amount off at the end because we 'd have a balance left over but so so in in essence we in order to agree to disagree that they didn 't agree but we did and and so we stayed with what we were doing now the other thing they have to say that was in the back of my mind is we already had a qualified opinion because we knew we couldn 't value the roading to a satisfactory level and so if you 've already got a qualified opinion there 's not much worse can happen really so weird enough to it and that 's an essence why we disagreed with orders we still think we 're right but that you 'd appreciate with accounting that is there 's not it 's not always absolutely black and white yeah but I just wanted to kind of you know have it on the record that this is a technical issue it 's not you know it doesn 't in any way invalidate any aspect of our report it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and and our accountants and these are our advisors who are also Watterson and us and their own right very good so does anyone have any questions Annie think you have two questions one is um in regards to the valuation of the writing network I see in the audit New Zealand letter that we reevaluate in 2015 but it wasn 't considered adequate and likewise they make reference to the storm water so when do we have a date on when we think we can get an adequate valuation of our roading in a storm water enough so what does that days John Waters being done this year and I 'm confident that we 'll pass the test for storm water and the problem before had been that we hadn 't fully identified the assets because the focus of the asset owners was more on wastewater and roading which had far greater impact on the accounts roading is still an issue and the problem there is that the traditional method of valuing roading is to look at the age of it and if it arose 50 years old then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to need total replacement and you and it 's valued on that basis the problem we 've got with our roading is that because of the damage that 's been done we 've got a condition assessment but the mere fact that a road is only 10 or 20 years old doesn 't mean it 's going to last another 30 because of the damage done under the earthquake and the problem we have with ourselves and audit and is we can 't find a method to value it that everybody can agree on we have a conditional assessment and we have a schedule to repair but what we can 't do is link the condition assessment to the fact that it must be repaired by a certain five or ten year time frame or that it in fact could extend longer now with ripped on it for two years and we are working with order to try and resolve it and with the values it 's the problem is no one else values that that way and we will talk to nzta but who obviously have some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopeful that we can do it this year but I have to say I 'm not as confident on roading as I am on waste on the storm water is the methodology for NZT a different because because what what why is the NZTA methodology for valuing roads berman from a council I I didn 't go back and check the answer to that I 'm sorry before it came down I talk to Matthew absolutely prior to Christmas and and I can certainly go back and follow up on it and more but it 's one of the things the path that 's not as clear on that as it is on storm water and the second question I had was just a relation to page 32 of our agenda and the key messages were advised that there were separate reports issued and one of them was a supplementary letter two counts on the accounting treatment for the crossing car park every month can you tell us what that was about and I 'm Q tell us what 's happening okay let 's watch the item number it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 70 if that 's 32 about what what page of the audit report to page two it 's in low key message section on the the very second page and that was simply around so can you see it here bullet points right 12.3 get one this is simply how that audit New Zealand have expressed wanted to raise some issues into how we were going to account for the crossing car park near a transaction so we believe they had done at the year before because we 'd presented the information to them for the 2015 accounts and they hadn 't hadn 't come back with any problem what we didn 't realize was that the impact on the accounts in 2015 was only three million and they didn 't consider it material so they raised quite late in the 2016 order that they were unhappy with our treatment of it at that point it was it was getting towards August we didn 't have time just to come back to them with a satisfactory answer so we have we are seeking outside advice and we will talk be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the audit and Risk Committee in April with that with our approach and we will then proceed from there thank you very good but someone like to move that we received the report Johnny chin seconded David East I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye or as opposed they know that 's carried

Regeneration,cEwA3CL-QRc,20170126,2069.29,"Christchurch, New Zealand",5251,I 'm the third item on the agenda is public participation and Cantebury independent advocacy no don 't think it 's called advocacy is it advocacy service to change the name assistance service Lorraine Guthrie Neil mikela and Vanessa Taylor you like to come forward okay can you it 's my knee that 's okay yep can oh yeah I just wanted the microphone on that was all but again it 's on now thank you so independent advocacy including insurance assistance so thank you for time today and our goal really is just to leave with you an image a vision of what advocacy and this sort of unique environment and Christchurch actually is so we have here our vulnerable client who is very vulnerable just fell over and who has a number of reports here that have been accumulated over six years and has met these people acclaims technical experts a consent officer a builder a project manager contracted loss adjuster engineer senior claims manager claims specialist a drainage in landscape expert and this asbestos contractor an electrician a foundation specialist and behind the as the ghost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have our vulnerable client who either has those people in front of them in a meeting or has their reports that they are expected to read and understand and so an in a particular situation working through these sorts of issues we understand that there 's an error a sort of a facilitation process neil is a facilitator Broker so Lorraine 's asked me to take on the role of a facilitator or a broker in this situation so we have all of these people who our homeowner is dealing with and I 've been brought in and paid for by the insurer or the government to be a facilitator that immediately raises some issues for me and some delimits for me I can 't sit next to Lorraine and be you know an advocate for her so I would make clear the difference between an advocate and a facilitator I need to be impartial independent or at least seem to be even I 'm being paid by paid for by one party my own personal ethics will be to to be impartial generate trust and confidence and Vanessa and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm being paid for by the insurer to get people across the line that 's that 's the mandate and agreement that I 've been given so I can 't as a set next to Vanessa and help her but I will try and remain impartial and independent as I can be in the context of being paid for by one hearty so as a CS advocate our role is to sit with our vulnerable client we see facilitation is the role of the insurer they should be paying for it because that 's just part of the claims resolution process what 's happening at the moment from our experience is it 's sort of a low-level mediation which is about brokering a deal trying to get people over the line accepting some sort of resolution whether it 's right or not from Erin we believe that advocacy evens out the power balance it reduces inequality discrimination through advocacy the vulnerable client is able to pay first of all access these reports speak to the people there are professionals understand have the technical information and the time to actually work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a manner where I don 't have to worry about the client doesn 't have to worry about whether or not they should trust what 's being put forward see as it advocates are intentionally on the side of the client that is our role we 're not in the middle or anything where we are on the side of the client and our experience over the past three years is that clients that have held to their positions through EQC and now with the insurer are usually right I know there 's a perception out there that it 's about greed but our experiences the home owner knows their home and they have held to the position because they have known that they are right an advocate can be useful and that whole facilitated process because they are able to put forward the clients views vulnerabilities or whatever to make sure that the best possible outcome can happen through a facilitated session from our point of view we see advocacy is a community solution it 's about getting clients back into their community into their families and functioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture of what advocacy looks like you probably know from your own personal experiences that even highly functioning people have difficulty and dealing with these situations when you 're dealing with so many different people and such a context and we 're talking about potentially vulnerable people who are on their own as vanessa is representing trying to deal with that morass so having someone as an advocate on her side presenting the picture and making the challenges is an essential part of the resolution design component and that i think as Lorena 's saying is not only generating a fair solution in terms of what needs to happen with their homes but its generating healthy and well families and as a result a healthy community and that 's why we 're presenting to here to you today and just from a client 's perspective what 's it like for you Vanessa to Heather and advocate with you amazing I don 't know what I would have done without it and it 's about having someone to listen and crust and really really good really good so it 's about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting in your corner thank you thank you very much and thank you for making the time for coming up thank you good I 'm going to get councillors now to move to item 10 and I 'm going to invite representative regenerate Christchurch to come forward I 'm going to deal with this item is a deputation by appointment but I 've actually asked you to come on behalf of the counselors in order to do a presentation on the paper ten Cathedral Square and surrounds regeneration strategy so if you 'd like to come forward that would be great thank you very much all right over te Thank You Marin counselors as you know the minister supporting greater Christchurch regeneration and the Christchurch City Council advisory generic roasters to focus on three initial private areas being the central city the residential red zones and you Bryden would like to focus the conversation say on the work that we 're doing in the central city and formally seek representation from the council to be part of the steering group that we 're establishing so I learned hand over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who 's going to take you through the approach and we 're here to answer any questions that you may have Kira you might be asking that one of the questions is why we choose a serious a priority area I why on the slate of I called of what everybody calls cathedrals clear and surrounds the option city is just a working title but the reasoner 's city centres hold an incredibly important point and the economics of any city region they are traditionally been on cross roads rivers ports or defensible areas there where people came together to trade trade with the lifeblood of cities but it 's also in the best cities when the advance the centre 's became the cultural centers areas where Renee songs up in the area where aren 't happened where education happens at the highest level they provide something that sebab be a dozen or the surrounding and all cities doing as a place where everybody comes into to experience things that they can 't experience in the way does like the area the other thing is it is the commons is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you don 't have to spend money in a city centre you can sit and enjoy watching things pass and when you think of cities like that unfortunately images of Europe pass you 're made of the walled cities the Centers of transform but they have all transformed over time from central business districts to city centers to cultural and creative centers we have an opportunity for that transformation at the moment so it 's probably not that 's this map shows an aerial of the area that we are going to start looking at intensely and pulling together all the various projects are already happening here in the in this area we have the hotel was already appearing including the new crown plaza for four and a half star hotel other commitments from the existing hotels have been damaged to be refurbished and and repurposed ice hotels we hope the investment by the council in the library we have a commitment towards the convention center or a conference center we have the Town Hall coming on stream and a couple of years we finished and on the definite is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time on budget which is great and I had to look over it not long ago and it 's going to be an amazing again and you 're amazing function yeah not very far we 've got the art center and the art gallery here outside but what surrounds the city center we 've got the business district all the council offices the international offices they 've all relocated out of Center not necessarily a bad thing when you look at disruptive technology in the future probably you know I 'll be to or but you 'll find another person looking at how do you regenerate that area and 20 years saying what do you do with the buildings but that 's what city building it 's a constantly reiterative process we 've got the retail area really kicking on and in fact already better than it was before there 's pervading better opportunity for retail definitely series competition for of time centers so you don 't need to go out of town center for shopping anymore we 've got the east friend with higher density residential and then to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is bubbling away in heartening already a great place to live great place to build housing close the center but again coming back why did we choose this place the red doesn 't indicate the Imperial map of colonial England it 's the line that is not yet committed to development there isn 't any resource consent setting on it they make be buildings of them may not be buildings there is a large area of land that is waiting for new users to happen so the purpose of the regeneration strategy in the regeneration plan is to work with a group of experts a group of stakeholders and the wider community to fill this up with exciting uses and places that the private sector can 't wait to build in a nutshell that 's what we 're doing because regeneration I shot we don 't build we create a framework if we need we can create legislation by CEO job is to help forge a vision for the future not for the century but the next entry we have been given an opportunity to recast the city center as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth and to that extent it 's a unique opportunity to provide a unique environment that 's people friendly Karan friendly creativity friendly education arts and residential it 's a big challenge but that 's what the journey that we 're asking everybody to embark on with us so the process of regeneration we we are still in the process of defining what regeneration means for a place like Christ jobs because there is no other phosphoryl City saw for this level of damage so but in the research that I 've done the one that stood out and it encapsulates all the other ones up in regeneration and tends to change the nature of place by involving residents and stakeholders embracing multiple objectives and activities with partnerships working with different stakeholders it 's not art been renewal urban areas where you go and you build something I 've been regeneration as when you create a climate where everybody can go in and do what they do with a nut climber and with enough remark in a coordinated fashion and a celebratory fashion so we are able facilitate an imporant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just focused on physical forum it has to include cultural social economic and community actions my experience in previous projects when there 's been studies done later on my projects the projects that have been the most successful up in the cultural community projects I 'm old enough that most of the physical projects have actually been redone again and time and my most successful projects but the ones that linger of the cultural and creative projects even things like festivals they go on for 30 40 years long beyond the life of a particular user bowling and we have to ensure long-term self-sufficiently its sufficiency for the wall of christchurch economically socially environmentally we can 't have anything that is going to be a long-term costs on the community has to be a long time again not short town by long-term gain the community so the strategy provide clear well supported vision for the area that 's why we 've asked for stakeholders group it 's a touchstone of community and stakeholder attitudes they 're not decision-making body but they 're a recommendation making body but as we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ network in a tree that flows out from them and that 's what we expect for them us to reach into their networks we have to answer the question of how will we live what and play in this area in the future because many of the uses that traditionally would go enter a central city I 'm actually available to us so this is really an interesting exciting opportunity to discover the next century city center and I in common a city center and the CBD quite specifically because our CBD has shifted the earthquake moved up it 's quite funny the tectonic shift of the CBD that 's a good thing because CBDs are struggling in America to gain the football that they had before we have to identify any planning changes and other statutory policies and tools including the regeneration plan which will in nature enable the vision to be implemented so we 're not shocking away from legislation but only if it 's needed it is already an existing legislation why not use it will recommend immediate initiatives to bring more people into the city and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already started it started long before it started before regeneration Christchurch was was there and we have to reinforce a positive international image for the future society we we don 't want to be the second city in New Zealand we want to be the first city in the world you know the city that welcomes new technology welcomes it on and welcomes new ways of living so the steering group is they are together development and strategy make sure that the team the technical team have got touchstone and I guess an ideals trust who will shape and form the vision that doesn 't mean to say we won 't be going outside that group to seek way the involvement and as we said also we 're happy to engage with other groups and appear and discuss and what talks work from and and absorb that information so it 's not a closed door so the big questions we will be looking at and are looking at now and we 've got some really exciting things might be happening like Cambridge University join us on studies to look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense or do we want well share an idea talked about a Fame green they didn 't use these wats but that 's an open design jargon but an intricate city center full of lanes and places that people can enjoy full of business and new new businesses an act of square a place that people can go 24 hours a day and or something happening there and it 's overlooked and safe so we 're picking up on not one of the that is quite interesting for all the wonderful squeals in the world and and I some people know I walked a long time in Melbourne one of the that it 's just been ported the best girl in the world which is federation square oh I was there when Federation Square was conceived and I didn 't like the architecture so I was a naysayer or not I liked the use but and fight it 's set apart it said Melbourne business boring as you thought it was we changed and in the night sense it was good but the other thing that brought it none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one square and it created a center for all the cultural things that happen in melbourn all the theater groups and all the music and all interest to come and perform and their art centers and so there is a revision of of that part and yes it has a cathedral that sets they 're very proud and architectural II beautiful but doesn 't dictate the uses of it it 's just part of it there 's part of that huge circus of life that happens in the area and greenery just doesn 't mean greenery on the ground we can have greenery above the ground we have green buildings we can have canopies or vegetation a softness and cracy I 'm a vibrancy that we can have and you know that the bottom slide is idly the wait dinner we could have run not in two or three weeks if we wanted on the square why not so what we 're talking about as a process not just a plan mm-hmm if it 's an incredibly successful process we may never need a plan that would be the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most successful processes one that at the end everybody who owns and is doing intuitively because most of the great cities were built without plans we were built because a group of people got together with a vision of how it would be created and then they created that rules around that the mid-division happen we 're instead what we traditionally do is create the rules and expect the rules to create division and it doesn 't really work hmm so um that 's all got to say that that and I wish you well on your tone building exercise good does anyone have any questions as I 'd like to quote Jimmy okay thank you your presentation because your particular emphasize we got into this wonder social culture in the economic well-being and but I review your steering group I didn 't see any person on behalf of multicultural community I 'm not sure because the CBC also when dokey district district two attractive you know lots of people from the intonation of an asian wife on regional also from the local I 'm not sure whether in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group agama that could be an oversight I I just expected a number of the representatives would represent their organizations but we 'd also come from a multicultural background if that 's not the case when we put the names together then we will look at that specifically it may be I have to confess up in a not one quite a long time we 've reached the point naught when multiculturalism where you could Riblet like together it would naturally be multicultural and so if when we put that group together it doesn 't represent that waiter community I 'll take on board what you 're seeing and I accept that 's absolutely true and and it 's that multicultural community were also embrace city life as well mmm yani one of them we asked regenerate crushers to do was advised an additional measures around increased momentum of regeneration of the central city so- doing that work was supposed to happen before this work has that work being done and you know other any sort of reports or information around what the priorities are in terms of the central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things that regenerate crushers was going to do was to look at that blueprint in terms of the central city evaluate progress and provide advice on what was happening thanks honey so couple responses to their question in terms of the leader of expectations in the role of regenerate christchurch one of the things that we have agreed very early on with the mirror on behalf of the council and also with the minister is that we would leverage off existing monitoring and reporting capability within organizations like the council like cdc and like central government agencies well we 've done through workshops and discussion is determine the area of focus within the central city it 's not our intention to reduce a multitude of reports and reporting mechanisms but to identify particularly areas that require focus and to get on and activate whatever actions are required to achieve the outcomes that we need to see any cetera because one of the things that own regulatory tools is something was touched on in the presentation it 's also touched on in that evaluation so is there anything that you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put into this process or to be thinking about now so the answer to the question is yes we 've done some work with council officials to look at existing regulatory tools that 's something that will be feeding into the process and something that the steering group will make decisions are recommendations are only for this area of this interesting now we 've we 've looked across the central city yourself but that there will be relevant to this area of the central city as well first I would be really good for us to go reporting date on that wider work within the central city I guess at the heart of my question is how do we know this is the most important thing to do in the central city oh sorry I you know so that I mean I think pop I can 't see because I have no idea why regenerate Christchurch employed me you know I 've always thought myself as being fairly unemployable which is why I was self-employed for so long but I I was an unusual choice for the position I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person in it is somebody that had the design on development background because the market in this particular area if you look at this area that we 're setting at the moment the market is responded as has the government you 've got the course you 've got the the Environmental Council you 've got the council and you 've got the large international corporations all located here market was bonded East frame market is responded we hope South frame another place that we will be looking at in the future market hasn 't really responded the one area can 't a casual street the retail area market is responded you know and create a magnificent we actually like you know if you look at that map I mean I think I 've been brought in because I will make very quick assessments of things I 've got a lot of experience but there 's been a lot what done and that map that you see when you look at this area the market hasn 't responded in this court area so that 's why we 've chosen it so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whoopsie is what 's is obvious eyes because it would be reported in the press my best behavior but it 's pretty obvious that the market hasn 't responded here I don 't know why that 's what we 're trying to find out and if its legislation will fix it if it 's encouragement will fix it if its investment will look for it if it 's fresh blood will look for that if it 's fresh ideals which i think is what it is we 'll look for that so we 're responding here but yes we 've also have a duty by June to choose another area of high and we are starting a mechanism to look at with the council how do we identify a range of places that will need spatial regeneration and we 've already identified some but by June and we have to come up with another area and a five-year plan so there is that piece of what will be going on but this area is crucial and the timers know you know and so we 're not messing around we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make any apologies for it the report will be written as we do it and recorded as we do it and the success will be the report so Cynthia apologies very generous on their think of city in a way that has really not engaged the public since year an idea say I mean I 'm just delighted by your presentation and I think that I mean it actually the minister coined a phrase on in a slightly different context many years ago straight after I think it wasn 't beckon 2011 which was the phrase it 's blindingly obvious and I think the area that you 've chosen is blindingly obvious in terms of what needs to be done in order to just catalyze that regeneration as you know there is a reason I think there 's a very simple psychological physical reason that area was shot oh it 's the area that was the last area for the public to be late and is basically a walled city and that 's why I came to see it like a medieval walled city and the people were locked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their mind but it 's not our job is to bring it to the forefront because I remember how if it was doing anything and not area before befo everybody wanting to know what was happening but there 's been bigger issues as we just held with the presentation before but we know have to move forward and grasp of future thank you that 's excellent thank you very much all right well thank you for your presentation and we 'll move on to item 10 and do we have some staff that are coming to the table for this or yep we do now with them that donor scroll up to the council recommendation because we 've made some changes to the two to the recommendations and it 's it 's our intention to nominate three members to the steering group on the basis that councillors mangion swigs I mean obviously councils words with the with the central city council mangi with his focus in terms of the his role finance and councillor scandrett with his background and events and and that that particular background here 's the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new teeth that 's being established the transition holdings limited and it 's going to be really important to make a connection what the with that new structure that 's taking over economic development and all of our cct visitors strategy etc etc and events and then finally an additional four councillors to operate with them as a steering group from within the council to work with our own council staff in order to make sure that we 're feeding and as much as we possibly can i guess that the messages is that this is this is highly important italy as the heart of the city and to get this rolling as call critical so is there anything that you particularly wanted to it you know highlight or should i just ask counselors for questions and maybe um maybe given time just questions okay does anyone have any questions for staff yawning I 'm just want to understand how what the reporting process is from regenerate christchurch back to us as council because I 'm still really unclear and I just as similar to the question I rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we expect them to do with made that really clean a little expectation yeah I don 't know that these are the right staff to be asking myself I mean it 's pretty good that you and I have a conversation about it because I 'm obviously more in a position to answer your question then then then staffer but that 's not what this paper is about you 're saying this report back here at the start yes something so I think it 's something to be asked neat person generally yeah I but also am Caine that the other work that we 've identified doesn 't get delayed by this project so there 's a whole bunch of other stuff that we 've asked region Christchurch to do I mean I understand the need for this project what I don 't understand is what 's happening to all those other things that we 've prioritized a fiddle earth and where that 's got to it 's not a question to ask the staff that are here to talk to this paper but but but let 's have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clarify what you want to achieve so there any questions of staff right okay well i would like to move this recommendation do I have a seconder for air is there any discussion I 'll put the motion all

Cotto car toy no Miguel Cotto who do to cope up in a mirror is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour today after a four-hour graduation for our speech and I was doing well and someone knocked on the door so this is what I really have to say this is really a historic moment for our ruining it for a couple of reasons our relationships with cannery in 1858 the carboy ruining app was the first ruining her with a new zealand portly be followed next video and the potential follow now we became a ruining of which was really a council under the native district regulations act which we had control regulation all our lens on our past that mean the liabilities the zoning that consents everything really fell within our people what 's important about that is that we had trading systems from our oil and butter cookie poorly be right down for taco stewart island real puppy and wellington through east coast of New Zealand I could all was treating the poor lady with people with trading really the night economy was booming and in fact what our people wanted to do in 1860 was by land outside of Italy reserves so that they could expand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my toe recoloring in the coloring in book now we lost there for a whole bunch of reasons we don 't need to go in but the other important thing is that our land was actually registered and the Canterbury Deeds office here now the reason why I 'm saying that is there 's a gentleman not too far from here called James Fitzgerald hmm he 's now made of stone it 's all right but Fitzgerald said something really quite interesting he said we don 't need the Marty Glenn court in the South Island because we have the ruining ER and they have the same powers as the provincial government hmm now the reason why we had an economy we were thriving that 's because we regulated our parts I think this is really an opportunity for us it 's not so much an assertion of minor multiple happen for ourselves but to participate in the Canterbury economy we have a strong tribal structure and economy here without a here Bennett and really what the tribal headquarters have done or the tribal Holding Corporation has developed many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've contributed to the Christchurch economy I think together we can establish degree of of self-reliance self-government and our villages where we establish economies and contribute to the can of air con so the real challenge for us and for our committee with your cells is not to be another committee kicking off stop outwards we need to give strong direction to stop here good strategic direction and good governance so we can oversee calculus for everyone in Canterbury so to all I know you 're signing something today is that we see is something important and all their relations from banks peninsula hmm so pleasure always maybe ah the day a 1000 koto I 'm gonna finish up with a quick story about that Sonic 's is important bpc my great and my teller for barneys six why well that song she wrote that song because my aunt which welcomes look and my art my migrator didn 't want her nice to live in Alton because no one should leave to any week really what that was about is there was a whole generation from 1967 onwards when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we say our people in their relations here live in Christchurch because of urbanization that 's a description of what happiness not an explanation they live here because the council 's rezone and regulated them from living on the villages I think of a great challenge for us now is to rezone the villagers we 've done a big a huge amount of work there and to reestablish our people there and small businesses um I would like now to move that the council approved the relationship agreement between the Christchurch City Council and now papa te Runanga is set out an attachment a and you would like to second that deputy mayor Andrew Turner seconds oh now open the resolution up for discussion Andrew thank you um the signing of this

discussion whether any changes to be made to this or or any names to be added so waste management 's there was some discussion around those and grime you okay yes yes crystal our dear did know the entrust forward whether we wanted three councillors in an we appoint another one which has currently been the way or four councillors did you want an external one or caucuses for what 's the time frame for their we do just because it is urgent that we have to do within three months there was a recommendation that came through from the not from the board but from from the chief executive as to a potential turn ative not non counselor um former chief executive CC a choke knob yeah that consoles at 1pm there are four councillors that want to be on the report council is what we do have some should we should have my external conference for we 're going to I would prefer to stick with the external appointment to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frankly I don 't know how David feels about it okay yeah yeah yeah well we need a process for the external appointment I mean see CHL have just done an entire set of considerations for appointments on our behalf and I wonder whether they they might actually if we well I mean I 'm trying to think of a process if we could nominate the three counselors that are agreed and the end and indella gate the decision honor on an appointment say to the to the mayor and the deputy mayor with in consultation with the chief executive and what 's ECHL yep but yet for the one external SATA right so if we put our agree to a point and what are the three councillors Pauline cutter David east and n Galloway agree to appoint counsel is caught at Eastern Galloway and delegate the decision to appoint the external member to the mayor deputy mayor and consultation with the chief executives of council and in CZ HL or should it be the in consultation with the chief executive and the the chair of CC h ow yep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole series of people that they 've interviewed and I think that 'd be relatively easy to find someone who would feel that this is at the world or to the museum it 's the sorry yes Museum trust the museum trust I 'm only doing this because it 's an urgent appointment so and the rest of the ones that aren 't agreed can wait okay let 's make sure that we 've got them all captured somos Welfare Trust was counselor buck public house adviser me as Welfare Fund trust counts the back suggested that we also include counselor Livingston yonke yeah so end and counselor Livingston public advertiser Hebrews we decided to defer here Christchurch agency for energy continued to be counselors casa and Livingstone yep keep Christchurch beautiful counselor cotta yep Museum trust board we 've just done yep safer Christchurch um and the Galloway was the name in the mix there yep you have to become a champion yep good the Riccarton island community safety working party there was some discussion around that one and Jamie you were happy to continue Jimmy you 'd indicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be a counselor Goff endure community board member to be appointed by the relevant community board yeah I 'm just looking at the counselor for records on yes mm-hmm do you want to be on the Riccarton island community safety working party okay mmm okay what we work with do we just can we just a point Helen brought and directly from here I 'd be quite comfortable with it yeah okay so Helen Broughton and Jamie go the Canterbury neighborhood support district committee I think that cancer East wanted to remain yep and we 've left the water appointments what about the water management committee selection working group you 're heavier I 'm happy to go out of as well I 'm certainly happy to stay it 's a selection part yeah and David indicated that he is quite happy to step back as well so councillors cotta and clearwater KY work Oh governance group I 'm very happy for councilor cottage to remain the oche nudge that means that she actually goes to the meetings central plains joint water committee remaining with the eastern cotta yep canterbury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deferred right regional transport now we 've since discovered that I can 't be I can 't have an alternate correct because it 's a joint committee under the local government edge which is very annoying but look I think under in the meantime can I be appointed to it and at some point I will step back I 'll absolutely find that you 'll be appointed okay you can come with me though you 're allowed to be there Rebecca I might need your advice but no there 's a very good reason for that I that the the new chair of e ken has asked that the miRs put their names forward for that committee on the basis that it really they really developed the the funding bidders at were for the whole of the Canterbury region for roading which goes up against the National Writing Program and I think they wanted the the weight of the mirrors sitting behind the verge I know that I 'm sensitive about that measure for their yo yea summit road Protection Society I know that counselors candidates very happy to remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community board to make the call on that public transport joint committee work done urban development we 've done our civil defense emergency management group did we do that last time I think we did didn 't we hear what did we does that include communities as well because a few community groups have expressed an interest to get more involved in civil defense yes no this is the civil defense emergency management group because that 's the region it 's the region it 's not the city the region so but I agree that this is a legal joint committee under the Act and but but I agree that how communities get involved from here on owners and I 'd very much like to see that happen yes structure around it and we 've got the even Heathcott ste hurt I trust as council the Livingston Brooklyn Bush trust counselor chin rod Donald banks peninsula trust accounts to council Turner Kate Shepherd Memorial Award trust i 'm told that hand has gone up there with Sarah Templeton rnzaf Museum trust counselor chin continue McLain an statute counselor Livingston yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've been there a long time I think it 's it 's in poor condition that 's not yeah it is aren 't you are not Jamie hey not a nice nice the McClain that 's to change Council imagine this is so you were actually you 're actually came you 're happy too yeah but look if if it 's in it 's the it 's the whole retirement village this probably yeah yeah but there 's some it 's built around the McClain Institute you know that um me oh um MacLean mcclain yeah mcclain 's mentions it yeah which the solve it is but it 's not the mansion it 's no that 's the retirement fellowship hallelujah yeah yeah I used to be the Presbyterian minister rip by virtue of the world and then I thought I 'd continue because of this but I think I 'm past me use by date on their trust I think okay someone else Lee all right so Jamie Gogh all do bradley park board now we 're quite happy to leave that with the community board so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourth ones a staff member John Mackey 's on there at the end and then community border point three plus one staff member yes we got invited to the opening of the tea house and I think are the only council that would but it was I just thought it 'd be really good to maybe organizer two are out there I am concerned that that we just made sure that we do have the right the right governance yeah I mean there 's no currently no criticism of it but just there just seemed to me that um it 's an amazing asset and we probably haven 't got as close a relationship I think that as we should so yeah and I think through the appointments process it may be that we can identify what some of the gaps are and and look at some appointments they would you know really really help them so I don 't know if there 's a time sensitivity to us but I would like to get more information about what would be the best way of giving them support from then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because if they just appoint community board members it may not be addressing out the community border in tanjung appointing a couple of community board members in one external member but orton bradley park again is governed by an act of parliament yeah so the does a bit like the museum right yeah so sorry well no it 's more like I 'm not like museum at all and the scene is necessary yeah museums got a major reconstruction to be thinking well if you think that can be achieved through the community board but do we delegate to the community board to make the appointment or we can we already delegate to and the question is do we delegate three we 've actually never had a counselor on there and we 're not in the three years that I 've been here we didn 't have a cancer on their last time it 's John Mackey and three others yeah that 's right and two of the others last time were community members rather than community board members very good point which shows that we appoint people to things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so it 's not even that if you think about the problem that issues with the museum some years ago we went to a more focus as in terms of considerable pointing like all collected rips we access it all there 's a skill set that 's required and so we identified the process to get the best person to provide that skill set to what they 're born ended and I was just came that we also have the ability to do that but I don 't know what the time frame is around the community were making those appointments but maybe we can just get some information back from our staff member whose honor as to how it 's working yet so the minutes of that body are reported to the banks peninsula community board every time they have a meeting yeah the minutes are reported to the community board I believe there 's a good level of oversight and I believe the way that the appointments have done in been done in the past have been really effective and that 's the reason why the community board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that we get the right people as our appointments on that board so I would quite like to I mean in the spirit of the you know that the devolution of decision-making that we 've pretty much signed up for the stoom I 'd like to effect but I also would like to take up what yani tseng which is we do need to have a mechanism for a better understanding of the roles of the government 's and each of these organizations you know and and not to send people off into the ether and have nothing come back so we 'll work up a mechanism for ensuring that that happens but which may include her in this case if they reporting to the community board that could come back for a cheese report yeah they could do but it also could come back here as as part of a full annual report just a simple statement from each of the representatives you know with assistance from staff that just make sure that each year we 're getting some feedback from the organizations themselves yep yep well maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something um and in the Canterbury Sports Foundation cancerous you 've been on that do you want to remain there does anyone else want to go on that one Mike Davison this is two counselors or one counselor on one staff member so and this is a staff member that she 'll be here yeah okay well I 'd leave it to the two of you then councillors east and Davidson yeah alright so that 's the sit-ins the sister city committee cancel Davidson would like to be on their channel okay um as well well hang on we can 't how how are we going to organize this because it can we leave the sister city with one it 's not urgent we can do that one in January I 'd like to leave it because I 'd like to have a conversation with people about what the different roles are and and and and in terms of the relationships this year but but give us some thought about it I don 't think that there 's is this room before but for people to have more than one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some thought about what your priorities are and you know it might well be that will get the chairs of all of the sister city committees in and have a conversation with councillors about about their work programs and what they do because some actually require a lot more effort and consistent involvement than others do the Christchurch Christ Church Committee doesn 't crush eh go search committee doesn 't do as much as for example the Christchurch China it actually it 's the Christchurch China Sister Cities committee it 's not a city committee it 's a city 's committee because we 've got two sister city relationships and that respect all right so now we haven 't got anyone moving this heavily so i will move it seconded by andrew i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you you,"(-43.5320214,

approval,hODf1nSCTJE,20161214,524.56,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1360,the cranford regeneration plan outline for approval but Richard Osborne joining us so can we just get a time frame of any sort of break well I thought we 'd with stopped for lunch at one o 'clock just for half now right Richard do you want to give us a quick outline on the outline I 'm I most certainly can the first I just like to comment on how wonderful in Thompson locks and I did notice that I got some loads on fundraising what 's he fundraising for good on you you were going to get a donation office until you see there we will we will thank you wretched just in terms of the report itself what it 's seeking approval for is for counsel to for the outline for the cranford regeneration plan so essentially if council approves it today that would then be sent to regenerate christchurch and they would go through a process which is out leiden the greater christchurch regeneration net and essentially they need to either the board either needs to recommend it to the minister will make changes or decline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of process and all it really does is say if the minister does approve it that we 're looking to prepare a draft regeneration plan for this area so it 's the first part and that process or lb at an important one thank you very much is that right are there any questions so you 're happy to move it move by ref mangie second debris but you know now I 've got questions but we can take a resolution so you you don 't want a second it right okay second up by David East right Pauline Glen and then thought did you have a question no Erin did you have a question oh I think like Pauline and then Glenn just concerning this filter now because the cranford Basin has already has its issues and a lot of the issues and problems may got your speaker on yeah a lot of issues and problems possibly arose from winds and developments we in turn many years ago this your risk that any development he will actually exacerbate existing problems I know that they 're there may be plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a risk that the basin will not be able to hold the store der that there may be more flooding issues that in terms of stormwater your right to raise that issue because it is does a tricky piece of land and let some of the reason why it hasn 't been developed previously as you now know that the storm water basin and the northern natural abstention designations have been confirmed so what that does is give us the residual area to do something with and we weren 't in that position previously putting all that aside that the land itself is very tricky technically and those are the issues that we are going to need to work through in terms of the draft regeneration plan so at this stage in the process we don 't necessarily think we 've got all the answers we have had a number of technical reports and we 're confident progressing to the next stage but they 're still work to be done in terms of working out the storm water components of them right so agreeing to a draft plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regenerate is produced or not so what this does is of counsel is to agree to this today it would then go to regenerate Christ tubes and they then need to go through a decision making process as does the minister need to go through a decision making process and if that and of both of those decision-making processes are positive he will then direct us to prepare a draft regeneration plan now that is really when you look at the the area and detail because we 're saying at the moment is that we we we want to prepare a draft regeneration plan for this area and we think that meets the purposes of the greater christchurch regeneration act for the following reasons but with reasonably nonspecific in terms of what those outcomes will be so who gets the final sign-off minister the minister so if we approve this to go to a regenerate plan today and it 's picked up and accepted that 's the end of our import is it no no no no um so this is this is just a draft outline and all essence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but don 't Lea since what the draft out or what the outline is saying is that we want to prepare a regeneration plan for this area and the regeneration plan is where the detail will set in terms of what you want to do and what you don 't want to do so for us we think that what region if this is successful today and through regenerate christchurch and the minister 's processes will look something like an outline development plan which you 'll be familiar with and all go out for cut and then we 'll go out for unity engagement they will go for community engagement and that will have a number of technical reports for which will support it and those will seek to address the storm water issues right but but but stormwater as tricky but site site as tricky and we don 't know Ellen to that same pattern of developing an area which is going to add expenses and challengers later on so that if all that 's contained in a report it will be and will obviously go through a process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah Glen just following on from Pauline 's questions there Richard where does the literal drainage come to so there 's been a lot of questions raised in the end communities nearby with subdivision is secret over the flow so where is the actually in point of drainage and so I don 't we haven 't done all the technical work for thus thus thus far and that technical work should really sit within the draft regeneration plan itself we have been have developed a number of kind of piece of work I guess which relate to stillwater but there are number of springs in the property on the on the variety of properties some of the stormwater am currently discharges to the Dudley Creek division right and this number of issues around that and itself so I think that the key thing with this is that we know that as as complex but in terms of the detail of those technical matters we consider those be stories through that the draft regeneration plan itself hmm he may be referring to the horseshoe lake specially soon you know which obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorizes the chief executive and I to make any amendments to the plan before it 's submitted as I said it 's not the end of the process that 's the beginning of a process again I 'm very keen to support this because I think that 's very important that we use the new legislation in a way that it was intended and this certainly would enable us to make a change to our district plan the fact that it 's outside the UTS or the city limits i think they call it and it has been supported by our strategic partners in terms of this process is actually a positive move so I 'm very keen for it to proceed right okay i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye as a post a note that scary hey I had a mover in a second it was wrecked mangie and second device David East sorry,"(-43.5320214,

better to actually put it in before the Christmas break rather than right wait for the committee 's and these results would be over six months old and you 'd be seeing the half-year accounts from

@ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their tickets are on sale and have been for nearly a month already so the ticket sales are are progressing through the air so they 've sold out the last night as a sellout it didn 't rule so that 's more a blip caused by weather and the circumstances that that trusts us in and other than there are in supposing I should talk about vives which is skimmed over it fee basis result is severely impacted by the impact of the insurance settlement that had already accrued insurance recoveries more than what it got so I had to beg those out and its financial statements and that 's was approximately sixteen million dollars worse than what it had forecast it would be so its performance before all those earthquake for later things was online with its plan and there 's work being done at a staff level with them on their performance very good are there any questions Yanni I 'll just looking at V base and wondering um I just said that there were new management agreements for a number of venues and it mentioned ilex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangement being new in this last financial year or is that nuisance earthquake it 's nuisance the earthquake so that lease agreement I think this is the second the financial year we 're looking at would be the second year but that I think it came in during the previous year before that I thought it was like it was it a three at lease or a five-year livia nice so she 'll be coming up so maybe next year bro um also just the buskers like I was just concerned like there were concerns raised about not using existing venues in the central city and going to hagley park and clearly that 's been a hugely expensive strategy there was also concern about the fact that we were subsidizing performances and other parts of Canterbury not just in christchurch do you have any view on with anything else other than the weather that when you know that that meant that we had that in that huge financial loss and what are we doing to mitigate that this time you compare the 2016 15 2015 the only difference other than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ christ college auditorium so they had to create they created they took the decision to create more marquee venues and hagley park so that was the main operational difference that is a very risky kind of thing a few you haven 't relies on with her to have my keys at egli park I think that was the rain was okay it was the wind that caused the issue which meant branches were coming down through hagley park at that time which there 's one of this thing it 's bad luck but they 're not going back there um and what about the the cost of what about the Canterbury performances today we cooperate much money do they 've got attendance I I no they had some good attendance in some places and it 's a development and in other areas if it would be fair to save from the debrief feedback that I 've had from them on that I have been tweeted by one of the performers who can 't wait to come back so it will be a great performance this time back in the streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ davidson second did somebody would like to second it glenn Livingston I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Report,Tw7k0vGLOLY,20161214,1857.44,"Christchurch, New Zealand",5050,"item 6 Lancaster Park status report hi hello did you want to make any opening comments and look like I 'm sure you 've all read the read the report you visited the site I think it 's just worth while reiterating two key points and that really is one the extent of damage to that asset is is very significant the visible ground damage is well documented but I think what you all saw on the tour of the site with the extent to of damage to the above-ground assets that suffered very severe shaking and really the work and testing that has been done as we raise strong question marks about the future seismic capacity of those those assets the second point really is around the costings and I think from councils point of view the cost that is relevant right now is what would it cost to recommission the venue and that 's a that 's a whole different ballgame to just a cost to appear that 's cost of reinstate and corporate hospitality it 's the cost of replacing services it 's the cost of new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that so that debts the complete costs that council would would should consider when it considers this decision finally there 's been quite a bit of talk around the 50 million dollar cost and that really is the cost of repairing the ground there is still significant cost in the above-ground structures that needs to be addressed and all of the other things that I 've just spoken to so we 've had a a pinion from Rawlinson 's that suggests that it 's a 255 to 275,000 our million-dollar investment and I think that 's the the guiding that council needs to consider thank you great thank you so the report that 's considered the report that 's referred to in item three a of the staff recommendation how quickly is that able to come back to us until it of terms of a report on on demolition reasonably quickly in terms of future options for the land that that is a little bit more complex around the impact of the the vesting act and delimitations and all that that puts on future uses so I think we would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April if that was convenient okay now just looking at this new set of recommendations here or this proposed council decision here so we 've got to a commence immediately to leader process with a taco and development Christchurch develop business case from alternative site including options for multi-use facility and report back to council as soon as practicable how quickly would that likely be able to come back to us sorry go to catch up on it recommendation sitting up there some to a up there and structure staff to come intermediately to lead the process without a car oh and development christchurch to develop the business case for the alternative site including options for a multi-use facility and report back to council as soon as quick as hell all the business class and okay so full-blown business case for a new stadium i think is a fairly extensive approach what we would recommend is a two-stage approach which is probably a strategic assessment and economic assessment with a short list of options and i think that 's probably a six-month exercise to do that property in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding of what the needs of the city are so that that 's going to lead us to decisions about size of the venue it 's going to lead us to decisions about shape and location and consideration of a long list of options in reducing those to shortlist of options so I wouldn 't want to undersell the extent of work that 's got to go into that for the anger project site is here yeah so if we still got on not seeing what comes after what 's on here we 've got to ABC and then if we got three a as it stood in the original set of recommendations staff to prepare reports and options for the demolition of the existing structures and future use does that still follows three at the bottom of the page you could add dumb to see 23 a and make it 3 a and B mr. chairman that would actually then give you the bits that you need can we not to know which covers the business case for the new stadium and three covers the demolition report on lancaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report can come back to was a lot sooner than the full business case absolutely yeah so what I 'm keen to do is so can we scroll down to 3a so we 're saying these are two different ones yeah it 's for the business case for the multi-use arena okay for this one and this is the paper that gives you information on demolition man spec so instructs have to lead a process with a chaperone development christchurch let me to develop a business case for the alternative site in our concluding options for the multi-use facility report weeks ago so that 's about the that 's the business case about what the future looks like so where have we picked up the original wording of staff to prepare a report on options for demolition of the existing structures and future use of lancaster park where is that fallen because that seems to have disappeared yeah that 's right so if we saw his very own and we need to return for e3 be that would actually tie everything in nicely so um I and B are connected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more immediate that 's the March paper yep that incorporates all those things around Kendrell demolition time frames future use and you also need some early engagement with the landlord central his community board just in terms of what that process might look like what that paper like yeah so can we reinstate 3a let 's just work our way through this one step at a time so if we can reinstate 3a and then we need to capture the need to engage with the Living Word central Heath cook community board as part of the implementation of 3a and just to let C into a B and I think you 've got it there mr. chairman thank you okay yeah now that some looks a whole lot better i 'm ed timeframes and to a so yep so time for insta 3a then has a time frame of by March 2017 yes but also time frames for all of the the future and the process and okay so the three a gate so 3a is by March to a is the one Peter that you 're saying will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then to so to a the timeline on that can we say six months easily to and report back to the council within six months yes yep all right so if we lose the woods as soon as practical and put in there within six months that 's fine well if that 's as soon as possible then that 's what we 'll do doesn 't that work already happening what Aslan already started it is a couple of things mr. chairman potentially one under to a that is money that in actual fact sits with the crown at this point in time we don 't have any money on budget for it I do wonder whether we could keep that we recognize if we could keep that as soon as possible preferably within six months would be maybe a better way to do it I just don 't know I can guarantee the other issue and I wonder about it really engagement we are in the process of engaging on on an with a number of sporting bodies other stakeholders and I wonder whether that to be becomes request @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that all right I just um they 're not the key stakeholder they 're actually a local decision maker and a local governments but what it say so my question to you they should have a they should actually be involved in okay and a lot I just think they expect that business case will need a lot of coordination with a lot of key stakeholders because it particularly when you 're talking about a multi-use I just look at this sort of number of people we talk to around the town hall for example and that 's only a small subset of the group that 's potentially going to use a multi-use stadium so there 'll be a lot of them put required even to get that first stage of that business okay okay so rasterizing a point of order they 've got the funding for it to do the business case so rather than kind of being too detailed about how this engagement things going to work we 're going to need to go back to them and get their sign or follow so rather than sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be to work with I put something that you know to develop a business case as per the cost sure I don 't know what can we get some advice on that is right the more detailed that we are here the risk that we get off side with itaquerao end is david seek currently itaquerao give the appropriation to pay for the business case so i would suggest that we removed the word to lead and rather to have work with hurt a crow in dcl to develop a business case for the multi-use facility is proved the cost share agreement we completed ceaseless okay great so let 's remove the words then to lead and to add in to work with instead and that addresses that issue yep great and then let 's come back to to be which was the matter that we were discussing requested early engagement with the lynnwood central heath community board and stakeholders so not other stakeholders but just stakeholders as part of the development of the business case okay right now let 's now let 's move to questions so i 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mike I support the the thrust of where we going here but the thing for me that 's missing out of this whole equation is a step which clearly indicates a desire not to rebuild on Lancaster park and signal to the stakeholders that we are looking at options other than ancaster Park and we 're that with when that comes to pass or how you word that in there I don 't know but it needs to there needs to be a message as part of to be in their engagement with stakeholders that we are committing to something other than Lane testify so with respect I would suggest that that 's not the decision that we 're making today what we 're doing today is requesting the reporting that will then allow us to make that decision once we 've got those reports on front of us I don 't believe we 've got the information to make the decision you 're suggesting we should today that 's a very key part not and are we in preparing the options for demolition coming to that point or are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are I would imagine that once we 've got a report in front of us with options for demolition there 'll be two decisions we make the first of which will be do we demolish or do we not and the second of which will be what of the options in front of us do we take as the option that we choose for demolition and inevitably once we demolish then clearly we 're not repairing but we don 't have the information in front of us today to make the decision that you 're suggesting we 'd should make sure you so by March 2017 we should be in a position to make that decision that 's that would be the intention in calling for that report today okay so that 's the signal that I think needs to be put out that by March 2017 we may be in a position to make that decision yeah i mean what we 're doing today starting in starting a process of which the decision point that you 're referring to will be a part of that process also patently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's in the cost share there was an assumption when the cost share was done that the stadium was a write-off yet a new location was provided for that in the blue friend so there was no sense that there was ever be anything rebuilt from Lancaster yeah so we 're working in the environment where that is the default position we cannot say that till march next year well at some point we 'll make an explicit decision but we need the information in front of us to make that decision in an informed way any further queries sorry you 've been wanting to say to me now I just need to clarify a point you know with Lancaster parking its empowerment neck obviously it 's quite constrained in terms of this feature use the previous council approves the parks department to go out and consult with the sporting community on the sporting network plan and so we heavily engaged with with consultation with the sporting fraternity at the moment I 'm just a little bit concerned that looking at Lancaster park and its future use and isolation may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just wonder if perhaps well certainly mark we wouldn 't be able to achieve that we would have to make a decision that link as the park was going to be looked at in isolation to the to the rest of the Sporting Park network of Christchurch the way that resolution that potential resolution is put in and whether or not we should be focused on perhaps just the demolition approach initially bearing in mind the statutory framework that we 're working in though there may be some that would say it 's difficult to have a sensible conversation about demolition without also having a conversation about future use at the same time given the implications for ownership of the land yes and I think that 's the reason why we need to join the two together and it may well be the conversation about future future use would be an early conversation at that point with further work to be done but at least we want to have options for future use put in front of us at that time because that may for some play into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can certainly have an early conversation but to be able to come up with any level of detail about future use by March I don 't think it 's achievable given the conversations that are already going on with the entire sporting fraternity at the moment so it may well be that you come back to us with some high-level options thoughts things that we might want to consider and that 's the point at which we then start to take a more defined view of what work needs to be done to progress which of those we think in principle we might be in favor of and then we appreciate there 's a lot of further work to be done at that point some of which may be ongoing in a wider context anyway yes thank you okay Aaron years it for me there 's another part that 's potentially missing here and I say potentially because it 's a little odd is around the other potential uses of the site to be up cycled by someone to use for whatever purpose have we gone out and had that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training by police military so on and so forth rescue teams but there could be umpteen uses for something that we think is completely useless and if we 're an environmentally sustainable council would that not also be rather than just looking at demolition as the anything else that could potentially be used for that we have not considered that someone else ago hey better be fantastic as a training facility for demolition engineers for instance who knows so the suggestion that the existing buildings in their current state might be of use for for some purpose that we haven 't felt on beyond just this huge cost of pure demolition so would really really selling the site it could be leased for so many years it could be all sorts of things but we haven 't looked at that which would be environmentally more sustainable use of that incredible resources that are there yeah and I mean there 's a question about what the community 's view of that might be which is a bridge we need to cross at that time would the report that we 're asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings as they stand on the site or any considerations around the sort of things that Aaron 's just talked about yes we can do that and can we can talk about that in the implications for for ratepayers yeah because I mean my view is there inevitably would need to be a conversation with the community about leaving derelict buildings on site from next step for an extended period under the Act anyway so but that would get picked up in the report in 3a is great thank you yani more so I thought we were asking for a report on the processor engagement time frame for the next steps around future use not the actual decision or few TVs in March 2017 because i don 't like think there 's any way we 'll be able to determine that on options for demolition of the existing structures or well maybe we just need to add the words in then to make it absolutely clear and options for the future use of Lancaster Park future use yeah okay I just think we need to engage around the future use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community level as much as a city level particularly in that area because people see it as a community asset and actually the one of the benefits of that site is the good relationship at the local community had with the stadium being on their doorstep so you know that 's a huge positive and it would be a shame to lose that that could well so telling I wanted to ask as i was quite horrified when I weed through it to see the number of things that could have been used and they were just left to deteriorate as have we got a process or is there a resolution that we can put in here that would enable you to go through the stadium and actually reuse or you know just do something around environmental sustainability of not just living all those good things go to waste I mean some of the furniture actually look better than what we haven 't had some of that service centers of it that that would be a conversation for be base yeah we find device so that 's right well I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the v-berth meeting can we pass a resolution because I mean I 'm surprised we base hasn 't done that already to be honest right what I mean I remember six years ago we actually had conversations three users and things are so against it also yeah but so if we were to add something in here today to request the V base board to consider something that would be in order yeah yeah so less less add something so if the council and I mean I just want them to get on and do it but the decision I think we 'd be good to get a memo back from V base on what steps they can take to reuse recycle and reduce waste and so certainly any demolition will take that into account basically everything comes out the middle gets stripped out we know we 've got some people that are interested in some of the bigger plant that 's in me already and so if you made a decision to demolish it you would do it an environmentally since then we 've done a whole pile but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theater and it 's not the different get v base we can certainly and there will be issues in terms of how old some of that equipment is and where was actually usable now or not so if we think of what this might look like request be base to report back to council on the possibility of reuse or recycling of chattels remaining within the building 's chattels and fittings remaining within the buildings in reducing waste so said it with the demolition that would come as part of the report on demolition wouldn 't it weight waist and disposal would come as part of the demolition reporters yep but I 'm certainly happy with them for two going there alright greater there any further questions Glen when the waiting for the record would have come no he made saying years time the conclusion was saying could be fixed in time so that carries the suction so what if anything 's changed well I think it 's fair to say you can fix anything if you throw enough money at it what we now have is a much better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessarily visible or clearly understood at the time so now now through the work that the consultants have done we know what the issues are we know what the damages we now have a fairly good picture of what 's involved in the cost of trying to fix it to where we 're a lot better informed now and has likely been more damage from the June December and subsequent up shops and simply time quite correct and I think unfortunately you weren 't there to see the damage at some know when you know what to look for it 's pretty spectacular ok thank you ok so we 've got these resolutions in front of us on happy to move those do I have a seconder Sarah is there any debate on this Yanni um as local councillor I think you know people will welcome us making decisions has been left there for a long time and it has deteriorated and also you know it 's a bit of bit of an eyesore at times with graffiti and and we 're spending a fortune will be base through council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I think actually getting a decision is really important and giving some certainty over what 's happening think it 's interesting that we talked about engaging with our sporting groups around the future use I mean one idea i had is is it not too late to put the Metro sports there you know we can retain it because the lens probably about the same quality and actually it would save us a huge amount of money as taxpayers in fires in citizens but maybe that that boat has sailed but it just seems to me that um this is a tremendous asset for the city in the past it is an important local asset as much as a we are strategic asset for the city are made Phillipstown and Charleston have lost so much on they 've lost this school yeah I 've lost the post office they 've lost a lot of other buildings so yes again it 's really important what we do here that it does give me that into the community in the way that link has departed so but I think it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the final point is that we absolutely should be taking a waste minimization reduce reuse recycle approach to our assets and so I think it 's really important that we ask fee-based to do that work as soon as possible does anyone else want to speak to us glee thank you this will be a big piece of work for the council discernment most likely has got to this point where we can 't avoid it but we haven 't been able to actually approach it until the insurance resolution I support yannis push that the board is taken on board I 'm not actually through the qe2 president Yanni but actually through the president of the fact that they were there all along over being neighbors to Lancaster park and that integration with the communities I think that 's important also support a good process that isn 't over rushed this is huge and we need to go in with our eyes open you will note that for instance a cupboard stadium won 't guarantee anything the Lions toward this year two games will be played in a temporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended in Dunedin a coven stadium didn 't guarantee them at East the three uncovered other three tests went to uncovered stadiums to in in part one Wellington so please let 's have our eyes open it 's a it will be a big decision to get to but I think the process is key I 'm really pleased we 've got the weave reinstated that the demolitions option because that in itself you know if you take the steps hell of a letter you come to grief so it 's important we just take this quiet and get it right um Aaron yeah just like to briefly follow up on yo knees point about the recycling up cycling and would like to seduce done putting the entire complex on trademe at a dollar reserve must collect else i came in late so i do apologize but there is just one thing that i wanted to say because I guess heaven coming as the mirror in the last tomb it was incredibly frustrating to see how little progress had been made in terms of our insurance settlement and there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the enormous hurdles to obtaining a settlement and when I read the ruling sins report have to say I did see read when it confirmed for me that they could completely dismiss some of the reports that were prepared off a desktop bench I would suggest by the reinsurers that had no substance whatsoever in terms of putting it out there that we could repair this stadium to a standard that would be acceptable to our city for fifty million dollars it was just outrageous that they were presenting that and and now we have a report that makes it crystal clear that the cost of recommissioning lancaster park is a venue capable of hosting tier 1 world rugby test matches as in the order of 255 to 275 million one of the statements that was made when we went for our tour around manchester park last week that really stuck in my mind was that if you were looking at the 50 million dollars you 'd be lucky that that was the cost of reinstating the foundations which i might say the reinsurer is never accepted as foundations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground I don 't know the difference between concrete columns and the ground and foundations when you have to build on on them they are foundations and they 're accepted as foundations but not by our reinsurance and so this the end the point that was made was that you could actually end up with a situation where the where you wouldn 't get a firm price on on purely the reinstatement of the foundations you couldn 't even guarantee that that would be 50 million dollars because what you would probably get is that 's our best estimate and you just keep sending the chicks and we 'll keep doing the work and that really hammered home to me the futility of trying to recommission lancaster park so i think we 're accepting here today that the that we 're not going to be recommissioning lancaster park as a venue we are going to proceed to develop we work on the alternative site and also develop options for the demolition and options for future loose use and a process for engagement and timeframes for the next steps and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today 's debate I apologize that I wasn 't here for most of it but I think we 've got a really good outcome so on that basis i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

NZ,NZ,Christchurch City Council,Christchurch City Council,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZETwErnCvvgbvBbnnHfyxA,15.12.16 - Item 7 - High Street Tree Removal Request,syT9lZ2wy50,20161214,3215.98,"Christchurch, New Zealand",9724,move to item 7 the high street tree removal requests are there any questions for staff on this when we bring staff at the table please so questions from Jamie Jimmy Pauline Phil Glenn and yanni great thank you for joining us so um Jamie first of all thanks injured and if the redevelopment work can 't go ahead without the removal of these trees you know I I do see that as a no brain and we 're not going to start with it and it 's going to be replaced at it cost my query around this though is from looking at the photos I think not identical trees on the other opposite side of the road and I just wonder what your take is on any potential inconsistencies if the developer removes and replaces these trees with more appropriate species will it look out of place in having the original ones on the other side of the road I guess the obvious answer to that is yes it 'll look different out of place is probably best answered by a landscape architect or urban designer to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you always look for consistency in the street this particular Street is obviously very unique we have a arguably very utilitarian building the music school on the northeastern side of the street not a particularly attractive facade so toiletries are quite good at mitigating the visual impact of that the building also casts a high degree of shade across the lower end of high street and for significant parts of the day that Brendan may wish to comment in terms of the relationship between the buildings and the street in the tree so yes you 've identified that you know should this precede the recommendation is that potentially an alternative species be looked at it doesn 't mean that it necessarily has to be an alternative species that Brendan may have a different view on that well I 'm I can answer it from it from a from a kind of historical urban design perspective I suppose because i 'm not in urban design and we did get comments in the report from Hugh Nicholson about urban design issues my understanding of it was obviously the trees the trees will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain level of maturity but once they get to that they their growth slows down and they don 't they don 't just keep getting bigger and bigger so you don 't retain that inconsistency from one side of the road to Europe it will take time obviously for the new trees to its assuming the same species though they were with the same species or they are exactly yeah I thought that it 's in the report the species were inappropriate so they 'll be replaced with a more appropriate speech no but from it from an urban design perspective that the specific trees and visit for that corridor the High Street corridor were those robusta pronounce the name but the type of trees that are there and from it but from a heritage perspective the the considerations of those particular trees in their positions relative to the Duncans facades that 's where to some degree that they 're there with hindsight they 're they 're inappropriate trees because they they do provide an extensive cover to the upper parts of the building so if the staff recommendation has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were Avengers younger and potentially in slightly different locations okay but that 's the thing that at the moment the trees are are relatively because they were placed on the edge of the existing footpath they squeezed up past the edge of the veranda and then the canopy expands so they their potential as safe from a from a visual perspective as to how they interact with the heritage buildings they 're in the wrong I 'm not saying that the trees don 't have value there I 'm totally in favor of putting trees into the streets it 's just that unfortunately they 're they 're very close to the heritage building and there are there are adverse effects for the heritage buildings in terms of their their visibility but also the views and the light out from those bills I 'm sorry to jump in here I just just want to make sure that we 're talking on the art on the same issue because I get a feeling that we might be talking at cross-purposes do you understand that my question is that on the opposite side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building territories now they are both the same the reports is the trees by the Duncans building will be taken out and replaced at the dunkin building owners expense and replaced with a more appropriate species my question is will do see that there will be an inconsistency with the new trees on one side of the street an old trees on the opposite side that I haven 't been touched because they haven 't been removed and replaced yet is there an issue there with consistency and if so and I don 't know it was too onerous or not but would what would you take beyond even the developer paying for the replacement of all the trees in that area because they 're actually a package so you know for the look and feel of that area or as a bridge too far and needless well i say i didn 't i didn 't write the comments for the urban design part of the the report but my understanding is that that the replacement trees will be consistent with those trees because that was the long-term vision for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that portion of the street so we wouldn 't put all the trees in that the the issue is where exactly you put those replacement trees relative to the building facades you can still have that that continuity and that consistency of tree type but it 's possible that you might not put them back right next to the buildings that they were put in in the 90s there was those are much less I supposed flexible approach to Street spaces and they would just put along the curves because that was the the only space you could really put them with a bit more flexibility in terms of how the street is used where the tram goes back in things like that yum you might want to think about putting them somewhere else in terms of how they how they fulfill that role of consistency in the street scene but there will be issues if we if we do complete the tram for example you 're going to have to accommodate electrical wires and you 're going to get potential clashes there with the with the with the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah yeah but I say there are other issues coming in but not a guy I don 't envisage to being a new tree type and that 's certainly the urban design comments in Craig 's report are not to to start introducing other tree types and to break that consistence it 's just exactly where you put them yeah and they look fine with the old trees on the other side you think by and large signaling of we were younger yeah yeah I mean they 'll get they tend to grow very quickly so they 'll get to a certain height and then they as I say my understanding of trees is that they 'll they get to a particular point Craig 's probably better to answer this maybe they don 't just keep expanding and they get to a dance when I that 's fine so they 'll get to consistency one at some point that 's 18 Thank You Jimmy it was reviewed a six point of four and a six point of five particular community view in the preferences in alignment with council 20 policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do too late inclusions oh heck no any consultation but six point of five particularly emphasized this option option one is inconsistent with council playing the policy so you 'd like to how to mitigate this effect so sorry Jimmy is your question what is the inconsistency the inconsistency is normally a recommendation from officers for healthy trees would be to retain the trees so that 's the that 's that 's the clear inconsistency with our policy Pauline thank you I 'm just in relation to a question that Lindsay hiddenness deputation was regard to the veranda he see doesn 't understand why you 're saying this is a new virender is that new or as it repaired and my understanding is that it 's a new veranda at the moment they 've got over under which is supported by pillars or columns and my own son is that they 're doing away with the columns and that should put in a cantilever Rhonda the original original Miranda 's on the building 's way back when they were first created was was a bullnose veranda and they would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1930s they were replaced with a suspending for under which is the ones worthy the rounders can 't leave it off the back of the building I 'm off the facade of the building that the intention we understand from our conversations with the developer is to put back a cantilevered veranda the the explanation from the developer as to why those trees are a problem is in in the support mechanisms that are required for the facade while you actually undertake the repairs behind the buildings there 's very little structural integrity to the building 's behind and the best example I can think of to think about is the is the McKenzie and Willis facade basically you had to put a big frame on the street side of the facade whole the facade while you remove all the back of the building which wasn 't structurally intact anymore and then put your new building and your new structure on the back of the building then you can remove the framework so the developer explained to us that in order for them to do that work they have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the facades and the trees unfortunately are just in all the wrong places all the way down and they can 't brace the facade and you 're talking about bracing it for quite some time while the trees are there so that so that 's one element of their their argument obviously they were order so if we looked at all the options around bracing it in retaining the degrees and it seems to me there must be a way to do that well the argument that there pudding is that there isn 't i 'm a i 'm not a structural engineer so i can 't i can 't really comment to me it 's quite a confusing report because it does mention and 7.16 that the the trees obscure the facade and they create shading when it 's not really relevant to the issue here I don 't know why so much me to think it was somebody want these trees go on anyway well I suppose yeah in the long term the same ones yeah that they they 're looking at it from a development potential and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not working for them so yes they they they say that the report tries to just include all of their arguments as to why that they 're putting this case forward so there is that construction component whereby the trees theoretically get in the way of the construction now as there may well be ways of getting around I don 't know but that 's what they 're telling us that the trees are in the way and then on top of that there are there are longer term issues whereby the trees are in the wrong place in terms of light and and access through views in and out of the building etc on all the other points today did you have some additional commentary on that we have discussions with the developers and they need to put the spray triangular frame up in front a hold of the side so better take out the rest of the movie we would look at what they do it in sections to get around the trees but some of those structural government 's they needed to support or wife in line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frames together and they need to have a certain angle will hold it up so we didn 't look at all the different options one of the other things we will be bringing you a plan that 's winter again you put two tram lines up in put some steps you haven 't seen the final plan for that so there could be some changes around the streets back anyway by the time we do that so the frames in the trees we look at every single option to try and do it the frames and the angles those frames from the structural engineers mean that they clashed with those trees if you want to keep that facade and they have to support the facade while they do the renovations otherwise the whole lot comes down so in the only way they can do it is obviously out on the street they can 't do it behind the building because they 're going to build the building behind the building of that makes it so the answers the question raised in the deputation do they really need to remove the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer to that is yes and the report makes no mention of alternatives well clearly we 've just heard that alternatives have been suggested and considered and we have had some long conversations with them to try and look at alternatives to do that mr. chairman all right Thank You Pauline that was everything that you had yep film and thank you and I just want to ask about the building being a heritage building and with its potential for restoration in the question of it being obscured which um mr. Carswell raised in his view can I just ask you your view and I 've been down to look at the building and we 've got the photos too so just from your view in terms of the of being able to i guess the site and view the Heritage aspect of the buildings are they and are they currently obscured by the trees and your own you um I brought along at the picture and probably should have put this in the report this is a picture taken in the 1980s of off the street I can pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the buildings were constructed in 1905 and for 480 years 80 90 years they were in that form basically there were they were visually very exposed and and visible from the street and then in the nineteen late 1980s early 90s we put in the the current trees so far only the last 30 years of the life of the buildings have they been visually obscured by by the trees the view that you 've got there is how they were originally intended though there was a lot of design effort put into the upper stories of the building to to add detail and quality materials into the facade so you 've got stone where you 've got a big big arched windows they were meant to be seen and yes I in my opinion that the current tree canopies do obscure to a significant degree the trees sorry there the facade so the trees to obscure the facade as say that the it 's a combination of the spacing of the trees and the type of trees which gives you a fairly fairly dense canopy and my understanding again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clarification from Craig but my understanding is that the type of tree does retain its leaves for most of the year they the leaves die but they don 't fall in the in the same way that a typical deciduous trees that the dead leaves tend to stay on the tree so you get that dense canopy so the obscuring factor carries it carries right through the year you don 't get a point in the year where you can see the facades big spin in the other question to really and Craig maybe dancer this is when observe them clearly there are some big gaps where some have been hit by falling masonry is as as said in the report but I 'm just like it I just wanted from craigs point of view as they arborist in fact we took counts of goth asked about consistency with the trees and the other other side but the row itself is it as a consistent in terms of you know a from an address point point of view or in fact should should counsel do something with that Vista anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consistent I mean if you look at high street from not section all the way down to her if its streets and it 's these write English oak so it is consistent with everything else that 's all I 'm not stretch I mean the only consistency is really is the size of the trees the rest of trees are maybe four or five six meters in high whereas these are between 10 and 14 meters in height so if we so if we were to lead the trees as they are would we what we not do attend us to the gaps whether you know where they have come away we would do eventually yeah i mean my understanding is that like Brendan was saying that there is some work that 's going to be going on down there but I think it 's in 2023 and then looking at extending the tram lines down there so that would be something that would look at that time and in your view given that the future plan is for the tram lines to be there are these trees going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't actually seen the plans i 'm not too sure where the trauma is a good on what term I mean the trees themselves are actually a suitable tree for that street I mean they 've actually done the job if you had just a normal english oak with a wide spreading canopy would be all over the building but you know this alright english oak has that kind of like feather-light column you kind of shape to it so you know for that I 've actually done what the you know the idea is for putting them in thank you great Thank You Glenn thank you yeah very curious report just the the trees reach a height of 10 to 14 meters which hype the scaffolding be needed and I 'm not too short I mean one of the options that we explored with the developer was that we would lift the canopy of the trees you allow the scaffolding to go underneath yeah but the issue is is that it 's actually the Trump 's of trees that are the issue and not the canopy right so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to be at height of maybe three three-and-a-half four meters what would be the approximate girth of the trees at the height the scaffolding is needed and they 're about three millimeters or 300 hundred here so is any thought been given to HD integrating both so rather than either or you know using the trees as part of the scaffolding it might sound a bit ridiculous but I can 't see why healthy strong wooden trees can 't actually suffice as part of sniffling I 'm not sure that that would make health and safety knuckle I 'm well no I think inverse you to it outside the square I know but I think it 's good to it 's really a question for the developer to be honest it 's not something that we should comment on yeah I think the other thing is as well as that we have explored the oxygen of retaining sorry removing every Tresor trees two and four would be removed and 13 and five would be retained well it was the same dilemma that they just couldn 't get the scaffold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually have no no benefit to removing those two and four trees it seems the high price to pay for skipper so you want as along with you just to be clear we 're not talking about standard scaffolding here we 're talking about significant steel structures similar to the structures holding up our city at the moment right yeah that 's how you 're talking to scare polling issues but we 're not talking about aluminium piping yeah with significantly engineered steel structures because what we 're talking about is supporting a two-story facade yep that of unreinforced masonry so it isn 't just scaffolding it 's actually a structural steel frame I come through the back way or no because the back the back is compromised well heart of the building that 's all going that 's all being demolished really because they can 't there 's no structural integrity in that so that 's all gone but if you 're going to retain the facade which is obviously the the key part of this building then you have to hold it from the other side right so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process is exactly the same that the back of the building all when year but the front was where the quality is and where the frame was required to hold it while you do the demolition work in the back row so that 's what they 're telling as they need they need that degree of framing to hold the weight and under the forces that are at play in the facade thank you specific engineering yeah so I 've got Yanni Dion and then back to Ann and then Jamie so yelling i was asking not um well concerned that we don 't seem to have any overall plan for I straight and yet we 're making a decision remove trees but we 've heard that you know tram tracks may be going down we don 't know what 's happening with traffic cycleways it is there any sort of overall plan for high street because i guess i would have a lot more confidence in making this decision if we knew actually what the overall plan was for the stretch but at the moment it seems like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we haven 't sorted out those other fundamental clothes I mean my understanding is it 's actually nearly stages of the the design there been talking to the urban planners they were saying it 's he said in the early designers of design early stages of design I think I think there is a vision for for high street that that has been resolved because we we know that the tram tracks are there we know that they 're eventually going to be activated and the tram is going to go down that portion of high street there 's a there 's a specific type of tree so what what this is actually this proposal isn 't isn 't altering any of that what it 's doing is just trying to retain the facade of the Duncans buildings which that 's the primary primary goal of the developers they want to retain that facade in order to do that they have to they have to have some works going on in the street so but in terms of replacing the trees I mean I take on board the caller was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was shading so with what goes back how do we know that it 's going to be something that gives good public amenity versus just something that you know reduces you know those are two things we have got an overall design Tim can give you some more detail about that you will see that we 've designed the entrance to that part of high street and that 's where there 's a couple of traffic lights that have gone on recently and so all the cycle lanes and all that but spin out of that integrated design we are still to pull the tram lines up past arm I 'm just trying to think what it 's caught up us a Vodafone in through the through the innovation precinct but we are probably needing two lines up there because we 're thinking that maybe where the trams will turn or change line so you 've got the two options up there that 's in sort of concept design rather than final design but Tim can give you a bit more detail they are the developer who 's doing these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own the buildings between that and and the Mackenzie Willis building that 's been done and those are the ones that got destroyed by fire they 're going to be rebuilding in the similar front so there is an idea of a precinct that 's going up there that will be orientated towards people so really what this is and middle II it wasn 't until they designed the frame to hold the facade up that they came to us and wanted to remove those trees that 's why it 's a late decision because they do want to go and start building that section if you have a think about that quarter I think the top building is still occupied the one at the top end of high streets still occupied in the trainer and obviously the part that 's owned by ARA is still occupied as well the term could give you an idea a bit more detail if you want goldman on the wii ok where would you put club the new choose not to have a act on the facade in the shading so um last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the central city excuse me I 'm losing my voice is gone so council approved a plan for that bit of high street within an overall cross-section so all of the works that have recently been finished down at San Asif street with the cycleway there in the intersection with high accommodates the cycle route coming through that bit of high street and it is a slow speed street within an accessible City in the streets and spaces design guide and as david says it accommodates the tran coming through there into that section of high street where it 's not there at the moment the tram tracks and not there now but they have been delivered down poplar lane to the intersection with chu and street and that 's where all the signals are because the signals are there to accommodate the tram crossing chu and street the traffic onto m street and then a cycle and pedestrian crossing over to m streets or cycles and pedestrians can travel through this section of high street so the outline cross section for this bit of high street assumes the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the streets and spaces guide they were assumed to be the same species as exists there at present so you retain continuity with the trees further up high street so as as as as brendan has all already said when we get to the point of doing the detailed design for this section at high street because it 's in the LTP for 23 24 then we would have an opportunity to put those trees back on a different alignment within that section of ice tree what unpassable with the other activities I 'm just trying to us then with the tram going down the middle do you have actually capacity to have trees go back if you don 't want to shade the I mean I don 't know what the arborist viewers on this but if if you were going to cut trees back and you didn 't want to shade or block with the side and you didn 't want to interfere with the tram could you actually get trees back in there I i think that the overall cross section for the street assumes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes to reintroduce street trees on that side of high street are almost certainly they wouldn 't be on exactly the same centers where they are now and that may well be desirable in terms of pulling them slightly further away from building frontage so that would give you a better view of the upper story of the building which i think the report outlines well the benefit potential benefit of the trees being slightly further away from the front of the buildings than they are at the present time but the overall design to confirm does assume that they would be street trees still on that section of high straight thank you and Dion and and then Jamie deal you didn 't okay so we 'll come to debate shortly and do you think these buildings will they be used as you 're not sure I 'm not sure we haven 't really been told that what they 're what the likely likely uses is retail that was the original use of the buildings when they were designed small small commercial buildings with we 're sort of storage facilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I think yes they are of mixed use building some of them may well be reached out I 'm sure all right thank you so far from out from a shopper 's point of view having shade there 's quite a nice thing in terms of particularly about you know but concerns about the UV levels and things like that so I 'm just wondering if we lose that what why are you letting loss the trees don 't actually shade the pavement on the verandah shades change the payment the trees actually shade the building so because the canopies is as expanded above the veranda so I suppose at certain times of the day you would if the Sun is is setting in the north west then you might get some shadows but that would be in the middle of winter so you looking at minimum shading requirements and but in the summer the Sun is in the angles are such that the shade is pushed back onto the facade and the veranda actually does the shade thank you thank you jamie back to you just supplementary that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street ring you 're going head and a realignment you know with the tram tracks down there are we going to be ripping these trees out again in a few years time that really comes down to win the trees get put back so i 'm just wondering i think just to just to clarify things because this is quite different and unique normally as i said we would not be recommending removing trees the decision you 're making is really around the ability to restore the heritage separately and a long-term decision so there 's there 's absolutely a drive and desire to have a trade landscape in the long term and all the benefits that come from that but the decision really is around the timing yeah my questions end look I 've I have no issue with us I 'd be horrified as accounts are we stopped progress is a city because they literally can 't restore a heritage building because we were too pity about the trees there that 's just ridiculous but um and I agree it shaves the building I 'm so I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see replacement trees that 's fine but if we 're going to be putting tram tracks down there and actually redoing the street set of this entire area I just hate to see the trees being ripped out again could we not even perhaps take the trees out let them get on with it pull the money the cost for the removal and what the reinstatement would be and then just offset the renewal that we do down the line all at once with their contribution and have something that 's quite holistic in a bit cheaper for us well yes is the answer we will make sure the whole thing was coordinated so if something went back in me that was in coordination with what the final plan was and also the species the other artists we may actually be recommending the right size tree species or whistling we didn 't look about whether you could dig them out but they are the advisors I think that too big yeah and it 's too complicated around all the other services to kick them out and bring them back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want you to keep your options open and it kind of follows on with what yarny was saying about a holistic broad view with us so it would be really silly for us to say you 've got to take that got to replace them to do this or now and then in a few years time it 's all ripped out and then we do an expensive renewal and do something completely different so there 's no point doing that at all we might as well do it once and do it properly do you need anything in the resolution to be smart about how we go about this long-term or is it because I don 't want you to be hamstrung with being pragmatic all I would say as the frames are going to be up for 12-18 months why they do the building and so it 's actually not a decision needs to be made we 've got a nutrient decision needs to be made they would like to start but really came on where but we may block the design done of the temporary structures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that 's when the conversation really started with with us it was out of the blue that 's why it 's that urgent we have been now about 18 months and as we 've said it 's not in our long-term plan to actually decide exactly how the whole so how that looks we can roll with it all those options are still open and taking a pragmatic holistic approach if we go with the staff recommendation that 's there it gives you all that ability yeah and I think that was my vision of actually pulling the money and possibly plant in five trees elsewhere in the city the very next year yo B locates and thank you and we 've hit a long time on it so I appreciate your indulgence and that 's all right and I 'm now going to indulge fulfilling a supplementary question as well I think my question my questions been answered it specifically around other opportunities around the building for the planting and you 're really indicating to us that that is there are certainly feasible when do about since we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other side of the building that will be the east side the were again as part of the discussions the developer offered to plant a number of trees in the car parking area at the back of the buildings which would front on to synthesis street so there will be a line of trees down there where there are currently no trees and no buildings so as an immediate replacement strategy that that would get you some trees back admittedly on a different part of the the rolling Network book so if we were not to approve this today what would be the result then the developer would be unable to continue with this project what would we expect next steps to be how hard to say I mean I suspect what they would what they would then come back is is they 'd come back to me and they 'd say we can 't we can 't adopt that strategy to fix the heritage building so what one of the things they have mentioned in the past is that will will take the whole facade down and rebuild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is actually a risk that their heritage facade could be lost there is a risk that they will that they will say well the only way that we can do it is if is if we actually take the entire facade down store it and put it back up again and but what you end up with then is it is pretty much a new building and as any option been considered that involves taking these trees out and then replanting the same tree possibly even in slightly different location the there 's just too big to transplant you wouldn 't have a so it 's not technically possible okay thank you all right so that brings us to the all yani for the question is there a cycleway going down here is this a major cycleway route yes so we got to trim the cycleways the footpath and the trees and we don 't know what 's going into the Duncans building but it is a choice although speech transit yeah it sounds as though this speaks more to what happens with the replacement trees and the decision to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a decision today to remove the trees and then have no viable option for trees going back in I i do then somebody skate there 's two rows of trees one of the things that terms raised is when we do a new streetscape we actually make better provision for the party to those trees so exactly what we 've said the coordination of that work will get up in long-term a better outcome because we actually specifically design whatever is needed for a tree we can remove our services from that area so there is the ability to do a better overall and greater design as we go forward thank you okay so keen to move this on is there somebody who 's willing to move the staff recommendation Jamie seconded by deal great thank you let 's now move into debate was anybody wish to speak to this Sarah Dion and Phil sailing thank you i 'm i 'm happy to support this I mean I know that and the removal of trees is really difficult and that we love out our treat city but we 've lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if this got in the way of us saving another facade and I think incredibly important in its it 's relatively easy to replant a tree we can 't just rebuilt heritage at you know heritage as is very long term and so I 'm happy to support this and not get in the way of the this facade being saved thank you I think this is a I support this I think this is getting on and getting things done for the city just a little bit of history just for the counselors as well for this there was quite a risk of these Duncan 's buildings being lost if a certain developer was actually going to be the holder of them but or takato who actually owned the building and the land sold it to a developer who all the current developers who actually have created quite a plan for this whole area creating quite a precinct and the precinct actually is going to activate the whole street including across the road where they 've got was it called cpit and they want to create a really as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know unoccupied businesses in those buildings who are you know maybe creative what an example that I was spoken to when I was on site with what the developers was potentially you know sewing you know they have the sewing room of course sewing students across there having little owner-occupied shops and people potentially living above those you know that 's the mixed-use kind of things so if we don 't get on and actually do this those developers don 't have certainty to move on and over five trees I think that would be quite a shame to actually lose that you 've seen what they 've done with the with the old McKenzie and Willis facade imagine that down high street and then the street escaping will come after that you know 18 months two years down the track so i really am keen to support this and i really like the our counselors to support this because this is actually the only Street in Christchurch that hasn 't reopened since the earthquake and this is an opportunity for us to reopen their Street and actually get people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from cpit to the city and I actually want been open we 've got the laneway starting to happen behind that they start building that that 's kind of really activate this area and I think it 's a really cool thing so I want to applaud applaud the developers for what they 've done they contribute into the city and they 're not just in that all this from a commercial point of view they 're looking up from a regeneration point of view that 's actually activating these areas so really really came to see this continuing happen film look I 'm also going to support it it 's kind of was kind of with some reluctance but I agree with the speakers who said look but basically the primary issue here is how we restore this heritage building and that 's kind of the bottom line i guess i would have liked to have seen a clear a process around this because clearly as we 've indicated through our questions the whole future urban design of this part of high street is paramount in terms of Health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this this heritage building it 's a category two building it is central to why we agreeing to have the trees removed and particularly because there is far better scope for the future streetscape that there be other trees planted and it 's worth that in mind that I 'm certainly going to support the resolution Pauline look I 'm not happy to support this at all but I 'm going to have to we are between a rock and a hard place it 's a horrible situation to be and I do not like I know the stuff going either life seemed healthy trees go but we 've been assured and I 'm going to take the staffs weed for this completely that there is no way the building can be repaired while retaining these trees and that 's advice we 've been given and all in all honesty if that 's the correct advice we have no option the heritage buildings I agree a really important in Christchurch and particularly in this area it 's a historical area we 've got c1 over the road and makena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a seat in the future so we have to keep our eye on the future in the end result so I 'm going to reluctantly have to support it Glen and I 'm fine today in our subdivisions over some college football game ready but interfering with our streetscape we 've got the same kind of thing here so when we put these policies in place we need to stick to them it 's not good I think for the council would be having a heritage first tree debate you know two things like this pitted against each other the report itself puts the council into an either or rather than a both end and I do take lindsey castles points there aren 't other options as per the LGA where you must have other options put forward in a report so I 'm not keen on supporting it the information given to us as this seems to be no other way so what do I do I 'm not going to abstain I don 't believe in abstaining but i think i 'm in Pauline 's situations so i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to go with the recommendation yani so um i don 't support removing healthy trees I think you know we 're fast becoming the city of traffic lights and fast becoming the city without any trees and that 's kind of a shame and it just seems to me that um what 's missing from this report is the comfort for what 's actually going to go back in the high street so we heard that there 's a renewal plan and I don 't know if even know if it 's a street renewal or just a immunity enhancement in 20 23 24 I would have a lot greater comfort if we actually had an overall plan of when we take the trees down is that here 's the time frame for the different work and here 's actually what it 's going to look like because at the moment I can 't see any guarantee that we will get mature trees being put back into this into this environment which I think would be a real shame given how important it is to have good shading and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here with cycling and the tram exeter so i just think for me the thing that 's missing is the overall plan for what high street will be there after these trees are gone and the commitment that they will actually be put back because a lot of the report talks about this it 's the amenity of shading that 's the problem and you know i just i think that 's that 's a bit unfortunate really because i would not support removing these trees simply for decreasing amount of shading that some businesses are get it right I think we 'd find a whole bunch of other people in the city to ask them for the same thing it 's pretty booklet okay so I 've got Vicki jimmy and jey me picking I wouldn 't normally support removing trees either but i think if we look at what we want to achieve in the city developers who are willing to take heritage facades and enliven those buildings by putting people in them as always going to come above that and high street has got an amazing history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shops right through to all sorts of things have happened in high street there 's a lovely history of high street actually but we want to get the city open and functioning developers are willing to retain facades which i think you said we 're being this its 1905 oh and the trees have been there for less than a third of that time we actually need people and we need activity and we need life in the central city and actually I 'm willing to accept that we cannot do this any other way the trees need to go and and that 's I don 't like doing that to trees but if we 're going to get high street activated and exciting it sounds like actually it will be really exciting because there 's a whole new tourist attraction of the most traffic lights you can possibly fit on on an intersection which is becoming a zone tourist attraction there 's trains going down there there 's going to be frames that come out a long way there 's up clearly not going to be any room for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a really interesting part of the city and I 'm just really thing that we get on and do it Jimmy I supported the staff recommendation because I consider the sixth the issues because these are actually no trap star also in order to report to us this kind of a nurse CPD area only fueler Public Health the beauty as well important part is kind of tree black those the building about how to you know to in keeping of these two heritage the status of a beauty in this we need to consider but tree is important but the healthy building what is more important consider no no perfect because which 1i considered weighty more more weighted popular Heavy D teach the building more weight and also another one sir key key point is we are not only removed by those trees are we replant the trees a new trees new trees this new species because that particular also need to be consulted with the urban planner Harry step and align with the Heritage status so I think a problem is that the even another based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start Paul Oh coaster to be borne by the apricot so based on these factors i supported the star recommendation and final speaker Jamie thank you I which she wasn 't gonna speak to the exact origin seed and I kind of got the feeling that um that my colleagues will ultimately rule by pragmatism at the end of the day none of us actually want to remove healthy trees let 's let 's be honest about it though when I heard someone was going to be voting against it and pragmatism wasn 't going to be necessary the winner on the day unanimously then that 's formed a meter just add a a a bit or two more and hopefully we might be able to sway him but I don 't have high hopes I don 't want to be part of a council that stifles progress you know at the end of the day it 's actually quite challenging owning heritage buildings investing in them so i think that people that that take that punt and take that risk need to be commended because they 're actually not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're really doing it to add value for the city as well it has a whole host of challenges and ultimately the question is do you want someone to play the apartment helping redevelop a city and invest and some beautiful heritage buildings of which we don 't have very many left and for that to occur there 's going to have to be a couple of weeks broken to make this omelet and I think the the end result is going to be something pretty special and you only need to look around christchurch you know nowadays five six years post-earthquake to to really get a sense of appreciation for the heritage buildings that have been saved and i don 't think you can get much of a better situation than this on balance than the developers here are going to pay for the removal and replacement of something appropriate their staff are going to be working with them to ensure loser holistic view taken so that when the street renewal has done that it 's in keeping in the end that it works but do you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to keep this part of the city in lockdown then you know save a tree or two and I just think that you 've lost the plot a few if you 're advocating for that so I won 't be let 's get on with it great thank you and I certainly also wouldn 't be advocating the removal of perfectly healthy trees in any normal environment but of course this isn 't a normal environment we 've got a central city street which is still closed as a result of the earthquakes we 've got a building owner who is obviously committed to retaining the heritage fabric of the building on balance unfortunately the the trees will need to be at least in the short term sacrificed to allow that to happen but I don 't feel that anybody would thank us for keeping high street clothes any longer than it needs to be so on that basis i 'll put the motion just a possible additional amendment that would allow me to bought it which would be that we asked for a landscape plan to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the section of hyster showing the replace the location of placement troops it will anyway won 't it up is going to be restricted let 's find out if your staff is that something which is proposed to happen anyway yes whether there was an in-principle cross section for the section of high street in the council approved streets and spaces design guide it shows two rows of street trees they 're sharing the space with the tram and the cycleway in the pedestrian street arm the scheme is in the LTP for 23 to 24 so ahead of that there would be planning money for a detailed design around that and so at that time we would be looking at bigger deeper tree pits to accommodate these trees anyway so yes we would certainly be able to do that yeah does that satisfy the master or did you will just move something by way of an amendment you stole everything we just said can we just have that as a additional resolution that there will be a plan a detailed design for the section of high street with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two young maybe remove it not Kevin talk from a team here but maybe a detailed design comes back before council before the trees get put back in and then you can see at least are in line with what 's going we belong to the boat because if there 's any problem alright so let 's get some wording then in that case detail design will come back to Council prior to the trees being reinstated and replanted through we please being partisan in that section of high street yeah trees being replanted in that section of high stracy basically furnace in the middle of summer I presume what a plant in the middle of winter or something on making something up here but yeah just depends on timing I don 't know whether his feelings going to take six months to fix or two years to fix and we haven 't got them details so but that 's why I just prior to us planting those trees and we 'll be doing finishes okay so no one reads that satisfy the issue that you raised yet that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're happy with that amendment to the resolution it 's Christmas why not thank you so much Glen relation to the original pre policy and it was formed the year before these trees were planted I 'm didn 't take into account heritage building so in other words I think we need to bring forward a renewal of that policy with everything that 's yeah let 's treat that as a sledge treat that is a separate issue I 'm really keen to put this motion so that we can move on to the rest of the meeting so I will do that i 'll put the motion all those in favor against that 's carried thank you ok so now and thank you,"(-43.5320214,

New Zealand",3712,and then we move to item three public participation and the public forum this morning Peter stoeckle of the Christchurch yacht club would like to speak with us Peter are you here please come up to the table and you have five minutes to address the council as part of the public participation this morning thank you cross at your club and with me as Joanne hooker thank you for the opportunity to to submit this deputation you should have some background documents a presentation to the coastal pathway Governance Committee and the Hagley pyramid community board and community support letters on Monday emotional support was passed at the lynnwood Central Heathcott community board meeting supporting our deputation the stipulation is to ask the council to bring forward deferred coastal pathway funding to align with this club 's funding and ability to work commenced work on the deck and boardwalk section of the coastal pathway immediately the slide via shows the clubrooms of the public car park the tram shelter is not pictured there but it 's on the left and that 's the current eastern end of the fault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roadway the ramps the walkway the boat shed and decks the public areas are to be integrated into the coastal pathway and will be available to the public on from completion using the existing walking track the sailing club intends to build to the finish deck level but to fir the boat shed the club is asking Council to use coastal pathway funds to pay for the walkway section and the council to use coastal pathway funds to contribute to the public areas this slide shows the history is a historical relationship between the road and the original shed the club holds the historic rights to rebuild the shed in this location in 2008 councils monks Bay to Scarborough Beach issues and opportunity studies identified that there was quote a significant botany on the walking track where it runs past the rowing shed and further stated that relocating their own shed would be of significant benefit to the people of Christchurch in March 2008 the Hagley ferry meet record recommended that the club shipped the shed at least four metres from the roadway and resolved to request staff to assist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mindful of the community benefits the club set about designing facility that provided for a four meter wide walkway between the building and the roadway a resource the club is now achieved under its own initiatives a resource conceived to build the shed decks and portion of the coastal boardwalk designed the structure to councils infrastructure design standards at five kpa coordinated the look feel materials and durability with the coastal pathway group finished all geotechnical testing and site survey driven to see would test piles obtained a building consent from council 10 to the design and redesigned to reduce costs and fund raised more than half the costs to the finish next stage the next step is to convince construction the beneficiaries of this project are the club the community the coastal pathway group and the council the requests to the council is that there is a misalignment between the club 's funding and ability to build this section of the pathway immediately and the council 's construction timeline the club has raised over half the funds they are now time limited those funds will need to be returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opportunity to bright provide a four-metre pathway would then be lost this deputation is to ask Council to bring forward to third costal pathway funding align it with the club 's funding and their ability to commence work on the decks and boardwalk section of the pathway immediately thank you thank you very much indeed an obviously this is a matter which has been in front of the community board as you mentioned so clearly the community board minutes when they come through we 'll have this matter in there which will give us the opportunity for a full discussion on the matter at that time however the presentation you 've made this morning has been great to alert councillors first of all to the fact that that 's coming and to provide the the further information from the presentation that you 've given us today so thank you very much indeed and for the opportunity to hear that thank you for joining us Sarah thank you um what I like is prior to the the community board minutes coming to counsel for for council to have some further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for getting a report on looking at bringing it funding forward and that could align with the river community board minutes coming to council so if we were able to ask for that took the information to come with the commutable minutes and that would make that discussion much easier there that would be fine does that need a formal resolution or is that something that you need a formal resolution it 's quite a lot of work to do and and the process would need to be part of annual paying discussions yep so this would inevitably become part of the annual plan would it be so some staff advice on this would it be better to wait for the community board report to come and then and raise something from theirs or wouldn 't be appropriate to have I 'm just yeah I 'm a way of it and the killer star can provide some advice yeah I 'm just aware that pretty much early in the new year though will receive their community board minutes so it may the in terms of the timing may not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm just really wear that than the funding for the Yacht Club is is really time constrained and I know that with the annual plan process not being signed off till June if we were to be able to provide some measure of comfort for the funders that that we were looking today I mean early nice you 're not not now obvious because we don 't have a report to make him as a dessert decision on but we did something similar worth yeah please don 't I 'm not sure how you can do it outside of the normal process of allocating your funds through the annual plan process yeah so with Mount Pleasant there was a sort of an imprint cipal support when the council have a memorandum of understanding with the coastal pathway group over the that project and without this going ahead it puts the that work at risk this is also a section where the council footpath itself doesn 't exist any longer because there 's the rockfall issues and it 's been taken away yes I think I think the issue is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it will need to be within the process of the yeah annual plan deliberations and counselors may well decide to pre allocate some funding to this yeah but they all need to be a proper council process to do it does need to be and the opportunity to raise that would be when the community board minute comes to council where this is formally raised yeah just as long as we 've got some information windows minutes can so that we can if we can be some Stefan guys at that meeting it 's like the meeting yeah so we 'll bring some staff advice to that meeting so that we can have a full discussion at that time when the matters put on our agenda as a result of that community board minute coming to the meeting right thank you I 'm keen to move on because this was the public participation five-minute item we have deputations to deputations this morning the first of which is from Marie Horton convener of keep our assets so Marie good morning you have ten minutes you 've done this a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have ten minutes and if you wanted to allow time for questions that would be within the 10 minutes thank you thank you good morning this is a branch owner from keep air is it and thank you for letting us speak I 'm here to speak to the staff report on what constitutes a strategic asset which is it says there is item 11 pages 493 to 496 inclusive in your biblical sized agenda and I was informed yesterday that this item has been removed at very short notice from today 's agenda needs to be discussed again of the yet to be determined meeting date and 2017 pending further information however we would still like to take the opportunity to speak today having been given speaking rights to do so specifically the point of the report is to address the question of where the city care should be restored to strategic assets to the strategic assets list as you did with an able last month for what keeper assets congratulate you curls position co a keeper assets is clear on city care we believe that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their setlist we congratulate the council before reversing your decision to sell for whatever reason city care but it needs that extra level of protection afforded by going back onto that strategic assets list we believe and have said many times before that it would be in fact madness for Sydney undergoing the biggest repair and rebuild a new zealand 's history to allow its publicly owned infrastructure and maintenance company to be sold what we put in the position where it might be sold which is where city care will be if it is not restored to that list there is in fact plenty of vital work that needs to be done by city care while is controlled by the council furthermore we urge you to also restore red bus to the strategic assets list public transport is crucial and the new Christchurch that is being reborn and the council must play a central role on that we support your demand articulated many times by the mere for full council control of the bus system not the present half pi Mickey Mouse arrangement you 'll force them to with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pages 493 to 496 inclusive and want to stress one central point them there is nothing on the local in the local government act to prevent the council restoring both city care and red bus to the strategic assets list the axes of the council decides what is this ready to guess it not the government not men not the mayor the council decides the council 's decide based on the council 's view of the needs of the city the staff report whilst recognising that it 's your decision to make does not recommend the restoration of other city care or read Buster the list furthermore the report says in relation to city care there is a healthy competitive market among contractors which will look after ratepayers interests was respect we believe that 's wrong it 's a short-sighted view there 's been very recent publicity about media publicity about a court case where an Auckland City Council official was charged with bribery read the awarding of roading contracts this is not our seven days this should be a wake-up call for everybody in local government and New Zealand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduce the possibility of similar corruption at the Christ huge City Council and the Christchurch City Council would be well advised to learn from the sad experience of Dunedin which sold off its equivalent of city care handed over to private contractors and then there was a disastrous 2015 flood specifically in south dunedin which caused over 100 million dollars worth of damage the cause of which was traced to the lack of basic maintenance of stormwater infrastructure well out said he care and red bus we 're at the mercy of a cartel of private contractors who will put profits before the needs of our city khoa calls on uterus not only restore city care and red busters of gin strategic assets list but to completely remove the issue of asset sales from your policy agenda we reiterate that the local government act makes it clear that it is your decision as councils to make as we 've said before their economic alternatives to asset sales for example to defer and delay major expenditure which you 're already doing to some degree and renegotiate the owner is cost share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election campaign that this will be renegotiated in public wash your hands of some of the white elephant anchor projects specifically for example the colored rugby stadium a staff report suggests that councils first think about quote what you consider to be important for the current and future well-being of the community and quote California agrees with that and wants to be part of this discussion I think to help your thinking on that we will send each one of you a copy of ko 's chatter on quality public services document finally Curren this at the usual sales be subject to genuine public engagement and discussion and as always we conclude by saying it says on the tin keep area sits thank you very much thank you and that does leave some time for questions Pauline coming in just a question your comment on the stadium yeah so you don 't support the as at the project or the sight of what is that you don 't support and advocate rugby stadium he on and what would be your suggestion is an alternative speaking is an atom and resident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D all blokes and walk home again without worrying about packing etc the stadium the reason that say that the stadium is a white elephant and said it here before is that the rugby union new zealand rugby union has made it plain that next year six months away is the biggest rugby event and recent is your industry the lines to a British and Irish Lions coming to New Zealand 2017 for the first time in over 100 years the All Blacks are not playing a game in the South Island right there 's two chiefs and Auckland and one in Wellington out of the three TS and the head of the rugby union said that Christ eh would not get a game because said he 's back in relation to the earthquake all right and then so what about Dunedin which has got new zealand 's biggest most modern Cavett stadium he said that Dunedin would not get your brakes on the lines and 2017 because quote the city 's not big enough to cater for it right so there was a very interesting article following that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good sports writer on the prius wrote and said how long is it going to be before New Zealand rugby goes the way of England with the English team only play all their games at Twickenham that how long are we going to go before it becomes the not Auckland syndrome so the point that we 're making here is here we have done eatin which put its rate payers and a huge debt over that 's that covered stadium has been told no you 're not getting the lines next year they 're using the earthquake as an excuse not to come to Christ huge but you build this covered rugby stadium for which the council 's on the gun for 253 million bucks is half ravines is we 're not going to send your brains across eh because you are not Auckland you 're not big enough and what they mean by not big enough not big enough for the crowds that will attend the game but also not big enough for the number of fans that for example will come with the with the British team pinky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um you spoke about duplicity in procurement in Auckland yeah why would only in contracting company were having a contracting company on our strategic asset register help curtail corruption I 'm not saying the passage City Council is not immune to corruption but at least you will directly control it you won 't be one step away from it so therefore i mean i live in the rowans before i cease away from the railways when things were restructured and i was aware of corruption going on there and relation to sort of dealings with contractors just a bit groceries lower level and then so it doesn 't necessarily make you immune but at least it removes at arm 's length sort of one step away from it as then you were directly in judge would the council that would be my answer their account any further questions thank you very much indeed for joining us thank you here we now move to our second deputation I 'm Lindsay Carswell who will speak to is regarding item seven on today 's agenda the high street tree removal request morning lindsay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you for this opportunity of this is a rubber bait solution here and possibly could have done um I 've ever proofread anyway what I want to say is that just because the treason because the bave of the trees cannot be assessed will qualify them to dollar terms it does not mean that the trees in question have no actual value their value comes from the environmental and streetscape values that the trees provide but I don 't believe that the leaf debris or the obscuring of the facades of the buildings is sufficient reason for their removal there are reasonable gaps between the trees that allow you one to see the facade of the buildings and if you 're going to have a google view of them that 's quite easy really and let 's say that the trees provide I think it 's quite an important part but seen down there nor the beech trees hold their leaves most of a year as the report says things we regard to the veranda I stood up understand what they are saying is this a new virender there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essentially a cantilever and that it does not rest on posts on the outer edge of the park it appears of the trees in the way of a proposed scape old which could be erected of the existing veranda I don 't think they have described the situation well a drawing could have been quite useful to explain better due to developers really need to remove the trees to install the cantilever Brander over the footpath that 's the question really need to ask ourselves secondly the report makes no mention of alternatives that 's elects your requirement under the local government actually should be opportunistic status even if the alternative is that they 'll say that there are no alternatives and why should have been put in so recommendation I appreciate the efforts on the development of these heritage buildings but trees form part of the landscape could we put this matter on hold and see if we can find alternatives to the removal of the trees after all and share an idea what are the recommendations was that what the public wanted was more green spaces that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just pause and just find out books to one side and get more information that 's what you need to do in like you thank you thank you that leaves time for questions do we have any questions call in to glen warning Lindsay thank you I think you are poseable obviously very valid questions you 're aware of any kind of construction and or repair methodology that can get around the situation here with the priests know the skipper I i I 'm not sure exactly what did trying to do that 's a problem okay I had a friend who worked in that area in one of those units here buildings and he said to me that he can 't figure it out what they 're actually proposing I can figure it out over okay thank you q film so Thank You Lindsay if your submission so if for example in the street in the reconstruction or the strengthening of the building it needs it needs for example steel pillows to hold it up in end the staff will probably tell us that it is extremely difficult to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problem is how do we as account so actually have the building faxed by the developer given that there 's very little space with the trees currently been there that 's really saying what I think the staff are likely to to advise us I look I really can 't answer you on that it 's just that sometimes in these sorts of decisions it 's too easy to sort of race and make a quick decision and the answer is 0 remove the trees trees have been there 30 odd years this should I sit back and think about that they do that faith all right thank you thank you,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

yeah so be quick so be quick sorry Phil you had I 've got an amendment to e exchanging it for for something different that will apply to the one meeting that this committee would have right and I think there might also be a request so that CUNY boards are sort of do speak with not one voice all together but that is clear that the view of the board is clear that in fact community board advisors be requested to I guess to compile the key points that the board might like to make to their committee that might might like to comment on it further to yep yeah I guess there 's just bit of a concern that if these aren 't going to the community boards before our committee meeting that we won 't necessarily get the views of the community board open maybe just that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if that the chair and community board advisor obviously detail their arm reporter and then email it out to community board members to get the overall majority of that community board before it comes to the committee okay so is that um it says that here 's the Northern Line and Corey man 's trail south wave routes been to their respective community boards already what the process was that there was a brief into what yall community board members were invited and most community board members were a brew at in there but there wasn 't any formal community board meetings which is why Mike it so I think if we make a note around the and along the lines that Mike suggested to all of these amendments to their all of these the series of these resolutions that should cover the processes so that the the air are clear and fear it 's really just providing an avenue for the community boards to feed them yeah if they want to fear them all right yeah sorry did you have a question yeah just like I don 't see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they haven 't had a formal board meeting to for that board to take a position on it so so some boards have got meetings and I guess within the time constraints some boards won 't be able to make a formal decision well is there not even getting a report an earring your momma got a very good steer from the joint briefing the other day and most of the obstacles they seem to be overcome and doesn 't seem to be many issues in these I don 't need to make something out of this well this is removing community board decision making I wasn 't able I just donate them no no sorry Betty committee used to make these decisions we haven 't established the new committees yet and so this is a real interim procedure just to take care of the Northern Line and Corey man 's trail cycleway roots so it doesn 't get held up but for Christmas under a the my understanding of the impact of this amendment has to remove the ability for community boards to make recommendations which would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process that relies on the chair to resent a view of a board without having any meeting to determine what their viewers how many community boards are there affected least five community boards community boards effective these are two two major cycleways going through a lot of you a lot of this crossing love the city that we do fear this then no we don 't no not at all I 'm I think we should if someone wants to oppose it that 's fine I think we to get this underway and so that staff can continue with this work after Christmas we need to make a decision today to actually set up the committee if we don 't there will be a long delay and I 'm not so I don 't think councillors all this council really want there so that is why I have moved the amendment and if people want to vote against it that 's fine from the staff as to why II was put them in the first place if it was going to risk this project yeah hang on okay but Aaron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so um did you add any other members of the community room yeah so it 's hardly any of them to think investing me tomorrow all right so we 're going to let all of the community board members know that this is on that they can speak through their chair if they want to but they can save themselves to say it themselves if they want to yep all right okay so i 've got a mover and a seconder I 'll put that Brianna yeah I won 't be supporting thus I don 't believe as a as a council that stood on giving more responsibilities to community boards not taking away that II actually is fair with the proposed amendment put in place I think this is taking away local decision-making from local community boards and I strongly oppose that so I won 't be supporting this I can see no reason if staff felt that it was okay to have AE as it was originally proposed in this report why we should then be introducing an amendment to take away the ability for them to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that this is fear on the community boards in terms of local people collecting local community board members to represent and advocate on their behalf then excluded from making formal recommendations to these things ah Sarah thank you i share yannis concerns about the involvement of community boards it 's been an ongoing concern for a while now where there hasn 't been for more reporting and recommendations from community boards on the psycho waste projects I do understand the reasons in this particular circumstance with the Christmas holidays coming up and in the break over the election period but I wouldn 't want to see this continue when the new committees are formed and I would hope that people would support community boards making for recommendations to the new commercially winner when it 's formed and that 's going to make decisions on all the other cycle ways but because there 's the exceptional circumstances and thus one I 'm going to support it but I 'm really foreshadowing stuff for the future resolutions on committees are poorly super quickly look the cycleway process I think has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the committee the AG committee hasn 't been formed yet prior to that they were going to the committee for delegated authority but before that the staff been out with community boards presenting presenting presenting they 've been fantastic they 've held so many public meetings with every single cycleway project I can 't commend them highly enough they 're incredibly patient they 're incredibly a specific and every little part of the project I think they 're doing an amazing job every community board member and every board has ample opportunity to feed into these and will have in the future I think it 's going really well it 's all supported yeah I just like to reiterate the point that this is for these two cycleway routes it is important that we continue with the progress but I would give the absolute reassurance that counts of Templeton 's looking for and that is there the engagement with community boards and that time and the ability for them to feed into the processes is pretty important and we wouldn 't want to see that diminished the delegation will go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets us through that the period as we as it is at the moment certainly isn 't any sort of attempt to undermine what a you know affected community boards but we did the reason that we took the delegation specifically into the committee structure was so that it was accepted that this was a major cycle network for the city and network decisions are a little bit like Metro decisions they 've got to have that wider thing and often there is more than one community board involved so but anyway that 's um I hope some reassurance that this is not going to be the normal way that things will proceed in the future so i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye as opposed i know its Deion 's webs and jana johansson and the next item on the agenda because we 've got no no no no it was just a an amended I guess there 's a reservation yeah I said the whole thing yeah yeah yeah so the appointment of a recess committee now did we get the wording change why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you here over Christmas no well we just need it I mean there is a point where I 'm going to be on the coromandel and cats latina is going to be overseas does anyone you physically here right Jamie 's here okay it Mike 's here okay so all right so a pointer a recess committee comprising the mere the deputy mayor or council of golf and a minimum of three councillors and then the quorum as the mere deputy mayor or council of golf in three councillors why would you say that that 's the quorum winners with this season them up anyway seems odd but anyway it is when you can take more agree that the notice agree that notice of them any meeting be publicized and forwarded to all councillors so it basically anyone who attends can participate on the decisions that 's the point yeah so how do we how do we of it fits fine as it is yeah it 's okay that 's okay yep so anyone who agree that the notice we publicize I 'm forwarded it to all councillors any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that that 's the point so you use all right what are the moment I 'll move the recess committee do I have a seconder Pauline I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye as opposed say no that 's carried and we will now result,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

NZ,NZ,Christchurch City Council,Christchurch City Council,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZETwErnCvvgbvBbnnHfyxA,8.12.16 - Item 28 - Letter of Shareholder Expectations to Christchurch City Holdings Ltd - Part 2,I5vSpr_GHUc,20161208,1157.649,"Christchurch, New Zealand",2460,right so the next item is the letter of shareholder expectations to consciously holding so I 've had some advice which is that the the wording of the amendment that was to be proposed by councillor Johansson would be something that a director of CC HL couldn 't move or vote on and so for that reason I 'm just going to put this resolution which is that we resolve around the environmental sustainability the deletion of where it is commercially prudent and to add the paragraph on remuneration thats ECHL report on progress on this every six months the reason that i would like to progress this resolution is that the letter of expectations can 't wait cch i 'll need to get the litter of expectations out to their companies before christmas and the second thing is is that they have already done a report and i 've received this advice from them that they have done a report on the living wage which is now awaiting the council report itself so that there is a view that these should be joined up so that when the council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which will have a paper on the living wage then the CC HL paper will come to counsel at the same time so it 's not something to progress and this litter of expectations but I think we will are aware that the item is on the agenda and the other thing is is that we didn 't raise it with them when we meet with them last week we did raise the question on remuneration executive salaries executive salaries was very much something that we raised with them and they are very aware that we want to see significant progress on addressing bet as an issue so so i will move that motion and do I have a seconder for it Sarah yani yeah can I something a Christian on that so in terms of the paragraph on remuneration if the only thing that you 're worried about is the living wage aspect of the amendment that I propose then I mean I 'm happy for that to come back at a different date but I didn 't see materially what was wrong with the other one which just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that report and in that paragraph which was just to say instead of a restraint to show significant restraint and it also included the issue of increases in directors fees which has been at the other issue so well and pay equity which i think is just a pretty open thing yeah we didn 't raise pay equity with them when we meet with them I mean I would much rather I mean the suggestion was was that I put this on hold till next week while I have an opportunity to discuss these matters with the auditor whether it 's ECHL but I can 't do that they have to get their letters out to the others of expectation out before Christmas so I can 't hold it up so if you want to if you move an amendment then I 'll have to take advice as to whether you can move that amendment I mean does it is it do you have to die on a Dutch over this i mean is it necessary can we put it I mean can I just I 'm not I need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they give a spec will actually address those issues that Jana is raised like pay equity in relativity if it doesn 't we 're no further ahead and so it seems to me we 've got nothing to lose sure every way with the CC HL when they came to see us last week so all I 'm saying is is that it wasn 't raised with them and I would rather that we just resolve this but if if you are now going to move an amendment so if you want to move yannis amendment then I 'll deal with it separately but the cch our board directors can 't vote which was only mean melt I just I just think for clarity we would i would like to move what counsel you handsome previously advised us really okay well it 's all there so and we could have that if we could have what he put up okay that 's the end of us to say do I have a is there a seconder for the amendment Aaron can I ask you a question on that because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directors fees things because they have a policy that was twenty percent less then market rate so if we 're making yeah no look I 'm Norma 's frustrated by the sort of thing yeah but um well hon it 's been moved by phil clearwater its seconded by Aaron Kuhn but but I want to take some advice because I actually don 't think that this is a resolution and amendment that we are capable of passing if we are to follow good practice with our relationship with the CC HL company which we met with last week and we raised the issue of celery expectations and now this is thrown on the table at the last minute well I guess it 's more specific things a few if we need clarification and terms of following good good process with CC HL I 'm entirely fine with it that we get that advice I think it comes under there no surprises of weeks that no surprises from them and this would be quite a surprise to them because we hadn 't raised us well there won 't be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to individual companies without having I mean that that yeah it 'll be a flow on a feat in terms of thumb in terms of this okay it is under under remuneration and the litter of expectation we we we expect see cheo and the boards and management of CCA geo group to show restraint with the level of senior exceeds a total remuneration I mean we here I don 't we told them that we would deal with that we told them that we would be raising that in the letter of expectations so I need some advice as to whether this is will move on to another item on the agenda but I 'd like some advice as to whether we can accept that resolution whether it 's capable of being carried whether it 's an order okay all right so what 's the next item on the agenda the C&O we 're happy to go with just one on the first one how they are dressing paid within relativity issues because that way they come back to us and they tell us each of the three months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the companies can 't we 've already agreed that we would add the paragraph on a remuneration thats ECHL report on progress every six months so it already agreed that to go on to the original resolution and so now there 's this three-month expectation on on all of these you know six monthly reality and what did what does relativity mean well it 's about equity it 's not about I know but what does it we 've got to give them a letter of recommendation that makes sense so a letter of expectation so what do you mean by relativity yeah if stopping at pay equities clearer I would have understood relatively was that was a rate range of salaries and wages that 's all but if it 's clear clear for people just to stop at pay equity I 'm fine with it too this is closing again no that 's not what pay equity is so you 're either mean pay equity or you mean something else so you 're dressing paper you do not expect the cleaners to get four hundred thousand dollars a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is that pay equity has a very explicit meaning which has work of equal value so that people were paid for the same as others for work of equal value that 's what pay equity is it 's not equal pay it 's pay equity and it 's about women and men but that 's not what I think was meant by but it could be could we ask for a report on how in the litter of expectations could we ask Cici HL to report to us how utter nuts companies are progressing that issue of pay equity okay so can we just put that on the main body of the resolution so under remuneration asks ECHL to report through the hip including it 's just very procedure yeah but it 's not a six monthly report we 're just what we want to report from them I mean Isis if except for pay equity they 're already there but which is why I think people are talking about two different things I see and provide a report on yes see provide provide a report on how I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah wouldn 't it be the paint any hoodie between top and bottom yes I know that 's what you mean but it 's not what pay equity means so which is why yeah well that 's your to taste my interpretation of no it 's a theory to the bridge it 's a deliberate phrase it 's what pay equity means yeah because of some of the three winners a family that they should have a Aaron it 's not that is the point for the discussion but if you you either you either want this line in here about how they 're addressing pay equity or you want to have a line and it asks for what you want which is the I suppose it 's the the celery distribution across the company 's is the term celery celery distribution is it the gym what is it owner but it 's that 's not how they 're addressing it do we want to report on what it what it is modeling gives fear pay so I guess that 's what I 'm trying to get it yes I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're not discussed with CC HL when they came to see so what is the process for us to get that started so that we can at least we could do it ourselves yeah than the organization and I 've already said there 's a report coming back on the living wage which could address pay equity and and we 'll address distribution issues but that 's not being dealt with now which is why I 'm expressing some frustration right about the nature of this amendment if we 're confident that it 's actually in process and going to hip and do we need to put anything and here in my view no but my view is not being accepted by councillors yep they 're getting it does the normal measure used as to look at the so the average pay ratio between the CEO income and the median of their workers social medium woke up seriously and I 'll just check it that so does the average pay ratio of the CEO to the median worker and have we raise that what 's ECHL before I cannot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason why we can 't raise these issues with cch old independently of the litter of expectations reached agreement on what should be in it I really need to do but this is not the end of the world and expectations he will be other processes and above statement of intent you 've got your regular meetings with CC HL I don 't think you need to go down this path to achieve what you guys hang on Lily let 's let 's see if we can find a middle ground so if we go put a note but thank you thank you I 'm just going to try and find some middle ground here what does it says approves the letter of expectations to christchurch city holdings with the following amendments and then an item to requests ECHL to provide a report covering the provider report to council on how the companies are addressing will request leasing out to front on no on well was a provider on not on how the companies are addressing but to provide a report to Council on the what does that salary distribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addressing but requests ECHL to provide a report to council on um yeah help me with some words please recruits eche look it 's got a tie-in with what we 're doing for ourselves and it does fit onto the living wage report back we see CHL to provide a report to Council on on the on the living wage and pay distribution within its companies yeah celery distributions that it 's coming yeah in salary distribution whether that 's company isn 't selling distribution of India will take a beautiful okay remuneration distribution with a nuts companies he poured out of all this it 's just such a few marking the UGC to be competitive it and living wage end yep yeah and that that will line up with the report that we 're receiving as well all right right now we 've still got me moving that and council a Templeton second finger is there any discussion I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye as opposed say no that 's carried oh sorry sorry do you not know more are you comfortable with to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yep okay thank you thanks very much sorry I should have asked that first right vice minister with cgi jose rivas yeah CTO gel directors set back from the table is it I have no passion of a sudden pick an X again no Pat took no part it 's not confident so I 'm sorry what 's the next,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

NZ,NZ,Christchurch City Council,Christchurch City Council,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZETwErnCvvgbvBbnnHfyxA,8.12.16 - Item 25 - Approval for a Central City Landmark Heritage Grant for McLean's Mansion,oZfPAmdfQvs,20161207,3309.63,"Christchurch, New Zealand",8570,order it was but people weren 't available at the time so this is item number clinical 25 approval for a central city landmark heritage grant for the buildings at 387 Manchester Street known as McLain 's mansion if as staff could introduce themselves with we 're just reminding people to introduce themselves for a period until everyone gets to know everyone and heritage Brendan smile and the heritage team leader yeah this is the sound is not good so can we get them to in up somehow yeah okay I 'll hand over to you so we 'll leave it to Brendan to give you the the background yep okay so so what we 're asking for here is the approval of a grant to McLain 's mansion the former home of alan mclean and the the report covers various off various the historical facts related to the building hopefully you all know the building and where it 's located on Manchester Street just in the north side of the central city very prominent building incredibly ornate architectural masterpiece and in a in a sort of a state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously but but a building that has been stabilized and is it 's just right for for renewal and repair and this this report is basically promoting council support for that repair and seismic upgrade and facilitating a new use for the building I can run through a number of the sort of i don 't think i 'll focus too much on the historical history i think you 've got pretty much what the buildings about where with advocating in this report that obviously the entire year 's fund is given to this building and that 's due to the the scale of its building this is a huge building it 's potentially the biggest timber-frame building of the southern hemisphere 53 rooms very very large scale and therefore any any retrieval from from you know a renovation point of view is is a substantial project and we we therefore deem that this building is important enough and of the sufficient scale to warrant an entire years our application fund for the from the landmark grants fund which is 1.9 million for this year yeah obviously if you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and why we 're advocating the level of funding that we are then I 'm here to answer any questions and as best I can we do have the owner of the potential owner of the building a representative the trust here with us as well is is kindly come down to attend the meeting to assist with any queries that you may have but I think the report largely speaks for itself hopefully and is reasonably clear at explaining why why we 're advocating the funding there are some inconsistencies in terms of ownership of the building but I think we probably covered them off reasonably well that was the one question that i had just just to make sure that we are legally on the right ground here yep so looking at the guidelines that says eligibility for grants any person who is the owner of a listed or scheduled heritage building place or object within the central city area council may apply for a central city heritage landmark ground so can you apply when you 're not yet the owner well technically it goes against the policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that section 80 of the LGA because it would be an inconsistency with your own policy and operational guidelines the the ultimate goal is for ownership of the building to be transferred to the McClain 's mansion charitable trust to whom your your grant will be going so that that has taken longer to to transfer the ownership but hopefully think things are moving in terms of financial plans to get that building transferred in terms of its ownership as say yes technically you you shouldn 't be applying unless you the owner of the building but the current the current owner of the building is not interested in saving the billing they they 're a long-term owner of the building for 20 years but for a combination of reasons they they actually applied for demolition of the building through the through the courts and that that stumbled and they didn 't they didn 't get the approvals that they wanted so the building is in a kind of limbo at the moment could I just um note it in the staff recommendations recommendations three a b c and d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made it is sit out and the recommendations would be inconsistent with the policy but those resolutions are there to address that very issue and that 's bits advice that we received from from our legal services I mean I know that we 're pivot I mean that 's why I asked the question so yeah just emphasize again that the grant funds are only other paid out once the the works have actually been undertaken so you know that 's a key protective mechanism in the grand scheme that we don 't we don 't just give the money and then the money can just disappear it only it only gets paid out when the works have been done and certified yep I just wanted this crystal clear we are you know making a significant decision so see I 've just got a question about the the fund itself as obviously initially set up and the the three year plan and then and I guess confirmed in a long-term plan it says here 27 million over 10 years amounts hadn 't been sort of 2.78 year 14 years i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been changed and the long-term plan how much is left over all and how many years that 's it for so we can get some sort of context for that overall scheme for the grant yeah yeah the initial scheme was for 27 million over 10 years and if you look at the table you 'll see that the first its first years allocation was 2.7 million yeah I think fairly quickly after that it was reduced and the songs started to drop I think it went down to 1.7 for a number of years it 's um it 's due to come to an end next year so next year 's of allocation will be the last allocation the 2017-18 at the figures are varied throughout each each year that 's not there isn 't there isn 't there isn 't a 27 million dollars fund no it 's just each year the council at the time decided to allocate 2.7 million to heritage to significant central city heritage buildings in us that 's what led to the establishment of the offer the grant scheme but that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this would take up all this year 's fund yes and there will be one year of funding Richard how much is that oh it 's year at the moment at the moment as a moment if it 's confirmed bini in your team in the in the annual plan that was signed off in June last year it it 's 1.9 million but of course you can make decisions around whether that stays the same and the organization as is looking at where there might be opportunities for savings and there are proposals for you coming forward to you around it ya know cuz there are other buildings potentially that we 're on the original list identified for the fund that I haven 't been funded yet and so yeah just want to be there vested this was on the original list yeah it was yep yeah I we 're referring back to report that went to chewed last year which identified state insurance McLain 's mentioned community of the sacred name fury road and that was the report to support that application the midland club Harley chambers public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wellington woolen mills so that was the that was the list as of last year as to the buildings that would qualify for landmark grant also note that there are it were from from an original list that was prepared when the grant was established back in 2012-2013 buildings have emerged as we understand that the status of heritage items around the city that were not on the original list although it 's fair to say the number of candidate buildings is reducing but the this is that the landmark grant was slightly different criteria from the Heritage sorry did I say heritage I mean to learned my craft no no but I mean it you were saying yeah no different buildings yet yeah the landmark graham was specifically for for central city buildings larger scale buildings that were more problematic because it was in response to the really huge loss of heritage buildings large rail heritage buildings in the central city it 's something like forty percent of heritage buildings yeah um Andrew yani term thank you um the the recommendations in front of us today assuming we passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions there 's also a 18 month timeframe for the work to be done and obviously for the grant to be paid out presumably there is a risk that if the conditions are not met and therefore the work doesn 't proceed there could be other applications for this same fund which we would end up turning down because we allocated the funds to this project which may not proceed either within the 18 months or because the conditions are not met is there any what you might call a safety valve or an opportunity for another gateway to be put in therefore the conditions to be met in a way that means that we can have a level of confidence that the funds will be expended within the 18 month timeframe I 'm just do a little bit mindful that we could end up with a situation where we allocate the funds to this project and therefore other projects miss out but the end result is that this actually doesn 't proceed much as we might clearly want it to that yes counselor there is there is always that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then another one comes along straight away and and you 've you 've used up all your funding we try and we try and gauge the level of of interest in the funding from that the fun doesn 't have a strict application process it 's based on on liaison between council staff and building owners built up over a number of months and sometimes even years whereby we we talked to them and we try to try to get them to reuse their building in one way or another repair their building retain the building often and those conversations leaders to to the decision to to promote a particular building at a particular time now up until hope until now the scheme has worked incredibly well done and the pieces just tended to fall in place that the buildings that were ready for funding were the ones that that that we could support at that time and and there was funding available and we 've had really successful results with the Christchurch clubbin and Trinity and the work is just underway now on set Michael 's old school and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes there is that option for you to to allocate other the entire years or to say well actually maybe maybe we should I don 't know split the fondant and allocates on to other projects I say in previous years we 've been able to fund two projects and sometimes just one but it really does it 's a very variable picture and we don 't always we don 't always have all of the the right the right kind of projects lined up on and sometimes you have too many it 's just one of those moving moving feasts um we are not all real well we 're we 're aware of brendan has hid some discussions with one other possible candidate but it 's probably unlikely that it candidate building unless they were a miracle would would emerge for funding in the next six months so that that building could be funded out of next year 's fund yeah so you 're not aware of anything coming up which would be a call on the remaining funds for this financial year there 's nothing on the radar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the radar but there is complications with that one so they 're always that I say they 're always we 're always got our ass of our contacts and and we encourage people to come and talk to us develop as owners of buildings who are maybe at this point in time finally getting a settlement from their insurance company or working through proposals with engineers and actually really finding out what it takes to do the repairs that they need to do to their building to get it back up and running just dealing with that that 18 month thing the 18 months initially came from minute from the Heritage incentive grant scheme and the reason that 18 months is is that the time frame is that 's a a reasonable level of time for people to actually get the work done because this this is quite a large project and it could be that more than 18 months is actually required to undertake the works but if you start saying okay well you 've got you 've got two and a half years to do the works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want them to actually get on with it and undo the work you 've had reports in the past from from me and other members of the team I think seeking extensions and that that 's the way we do it so if if things start to go a little behind schedule and works aren 't starting but they want to retain the funding then there is a clause in the operational guidelines for them to come back to you and say can we have an extension please things have taken a little bit longer than we we envisage it 's been a bit complicated whatever whatever reasons and they they generally are pretty legitimate reasons of just the complexity of the projects is such that you you can 't just rat along with it it 's pretty rare so the last one for example so Michaels all whole day they had an extension I think of a year because it just took longer it it 's sometimes difficult to get contractors on board or to just work out the engineering and the finance etc so so 18 months I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we can alter it later with your approval um I 've got yani Tim David Mike no there is one of the one of the source of funding which central government were involved with that was the Canterbury Earthquake Harris reporting from you may castles were around before may remember that fund which was a separate fund which was one for one with the government there is still some small level of funding left in that but as far as I 'm aware there hasn 't been any discussions with with central government but heritage New Zealand run that that fond and they the trust members have been talking to heritage New Zealand to try and secure some of the remaining funds so that so the responsibility for that conversation lies with the trust not with your council God no you we need to we don 't administer that form we don 't have anything to do it anymore heritage New Zealand to deal with that and I 'm not sure how much is left in there because they 're allocating it I did meet with the head of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grant funding available not for the pictures but for the ureter to restoration yep no and hopefully not know so there are other funds but it 's not our role to around protecting community exits encouraging equity Debbie any compensation we have and the basis of the use of the building will ensure public access that 's that 's one of the benefits of being a public art gallery you will get public access and the other the other thing that we we 're keen to to see Donna and as part of the the sort of the workings of the the scope of work which is yet to be defined and presented as part of the that 's one of the conditions but the retention of the key Manchester Street facade and the open space in front of that that original front facade of the building and the gardens there so obviously we want to see that space preserved and not just become a either of another building site or a a car park or whatever so that that key relationship with its with its Street and with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're retaining its landmark status if you if you try and you have a time frame or public community day or something wish I mean either obviously that 's very detailed so but at least you 've had those discussions yes yeah and Tim you 've kind of answer my question and we 're just ensuring because it it is an interesting site with regards to driveways rounded etc and just keeping for ensuring that there 's a visual amenity to that mean chester street because it is right payers money and there may be those ratepayers it are not interested and art etc but we must ensure that if we 're going beasts this kind of money that it is at least visible from the street scape so yeah the zoo what i mean at the moment that so got a lot of green space around it but what are the building heights are I mean are there any protections for this that I say that the grant itself is directed at landmark status retaining that landmark status so if if we have a proposal to to screen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fulfilling the purpose of the grant scheme to retain those significant identification buildings the ones that create unique sense of place so we 'd be looking obviously to see that that key facade retained the building was originally on a t-shape section the current owners have subdivided that and sold off the really the part of the site that used to be linking to colombo street yeah but there is still the link to be lee avenue so you 've got a kind of a an l-shaped plan to the building which allows for access to come in from Bailey Avenue and and some car parking to go in there without compromising fully the area in the front of of the building obviously there may need to be a driveway so a part of that landmark as leader does that visual that seen from the street but could you not say that earth for instances proposals to build high buildings next to it that it would minimize that let the impact that it would have on their back and the build-up environment so well are they really care if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next door already well sir what 's a gum a cathedral it 's not the cathedral its subsidiaries yeah but the other side we can 't visit but there 's a section between sat mary 's church and my clients mitch and so i 'm not quite sure yep obviously there 's potential for development to go on those sites and we can 't we can 't restrict those those developments but what we can do is retain the street frontage that 's already there yeah which is is reasonably substantial amount of street frontage which allows the building facade and the key the key facade to be clearly visible and a prominent street scene feature some see being a new integers comment on the building and the seating and is it the seating as well as the building that solicits yeah well but each each each of the buildings in in the district plan has both its itself as a listed item but also has a setting and there are development controls on this setting so a new building in in a heritage setting would be subject to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next minute the setting for this one is is the actual title so it includes the little spur towards be the Avenue includes the portion of the building towards Manchester Street so it 's the whole the whole title and David thank you just like compliments stuff on a reasonably comprehensive report and the recommendations and 1a seemed reasonably robust and if overcomed met I should say do send to overcome the inconsistencies with the council Central City landmark and heritage ground policy but I 'm interested particularly in 1a where we have a relatively new trust and I 'm interested to know what sort of manner matters that you would be looking into to see that the trust deed is satisfactory to the council and all respects to the due diligence first of the matters so I think possibly a colleague might be better place to answer that trust deed I 've read the trustee proposed to trustee and the the key alent the key purpose of the trust is the preservation and retention of the building and there are other other there are other requirements and aims of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reuse of the building yeah i think that the can 't erase maybe misunderstanding the purpose of date it 's the confirming the trust deed is satisfactory not the the trust itself so they haven 't done due diligence on the trust it 's a narrative no they haven 't that 's a new trust so well I suppose that 's probably my ultimate question are we doing some due diligence on the trust itself well it 's not our FS yeah I 'm mr. cash we don 't we don 't pay any money until they 've done the work the trust is in it is an instrument to facilitate ownership of the building in a way that is most efficient financially and allows or the funds to be raised for example yeah but as appropriate for us to look at the terms of the trust deed because it needs to be capable fulfilling the purposes and and that clearly is yes we have it we have read that the trust deed and as I say the purpose the purpose within that has about five or six purposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retention of the building so once that work has been undertaken and the monies can be paid safe in the knowledge that the work has been undertaken regardless in some respects of the ownership so the ownership did change at least you 've got the work completed to the building the building is safer through through that means of ownership what we have had in my time here another example of a grant that was made a heritage grant that was made to the theater down sudden I 'm just didn 't know about no the maltose mold house the mold house and we 've done it twice because the first proposition fell over and there was a second proposition came forward and and we actually did the same with the West Dave and building not that the trust fell but that the ownership that ownership changed and there they came back so that the protections are there we only pay once the works done hey the Millhouse does that right Milhouse whatever I couldn 't remember that yeah it 's a very challenging site i would say from there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the property but that 's not the only consistency it 's also the fact that it 's no detailed and say our scope of scope of works so why is it that they are not able to purchase this property of that out without this grant approval this is I just want to check if it 's I question they 're good we well do we do we want to answer that question is that visit something that we can answer general is that a staff question I guess yeah I 'm a question from from my point of view that the the securing of the funding is is a separate separate item that the other funds that are required to purchase the building and do do the works etc they will all fall into place and if they don 't then your funding comes back and if that never goes out so so so then why can 't we wait until the properties purchase so we can actually not have to go with all these inconsistencies which are quite quite big of an initiative in the actual significant amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are addressed in in am 3 a 2 to see in in fact some resolution for also enables I guess another another chick and the process in the delegation to the chief executive regarding 1a what is it 1a 2c and in two so this the scope of the delegation is to the chief executive regarding the trustee the scope of works and their elements header and consistent with that policy so that 's a another chick for for you as counselors yep but that 's still why could we not wait until the trust is actually purchased the property before we actually look at this ground so although the report identifies that this is staff generated we 're also aware that there had been discussions with the mirror and counselors there was a deputation to cheered last year and so there is I guess there is history and around why you 're receiving this report today and it kind of wrists with those deputations in those previous discussions so staff although staff have have had discussions with the building owner the the report has also been generated by those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of that is that the potential owner is trying to secure as much funding as they can obviously that as we talked about earlier on there 's potential for other people to come in and and seek the same front seat funds from the same scheme so the sooner they secure some sort of funding the sooner they can be confident and get on with the work and actually secure the building so and the building the building any building a vacant building is at risk from from continuing deterioration oh I 've got other people lined up but did you have another yes sir um do you have a rough estimate of the cost to repair this building it 's think it off the top of my head but I mean obviously we 're talking in the multi-millions so I think the figures in then remove 10 million so percentage-wise that means the gram is around the fifteen to twenty percent of the project which is considerably lower than what what the maxims we generally go for which is anything up to fifty percent of the fund is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of levering leveraging and getting private investment into the city Dion and then Vicky okay deal it 's gone through a court process to have protected from heritage New Zealand so I can 't have a consented demolition what would that mean if nothing happened to it so we didn 't give this grant what would that actually mean well potentially the building will sit there vacant if if the ownership isn 't changed that the current owner as outlined earlier on made an attempt to it was actually an archaeological Authority was declined by heritage New Zealand and then the owners took HNZ to court and the court found in favor of hey Chen said so they can 't get an archeological authority for the building they 've never tried a resource consent process obviously they would need a resource consent for demolition of the building but knowing that they couldn 't get the archaeological so the choice obviously was for the the current owners to divest themselves of the building and pass it on to another owner if if for whatever reason that that transfer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have any planned use for the building so the danger is it 's going to sit there for another indefinite period of time suffering from deterioration and the potential risk of arson and vandalism so the sooner it gets so the reality is that we could have if this doesn 't go through and give some certainty to this significant building that a building will set dangerous in our city deteriorated without any ability to demolish to demolition wants for it to go to demolition it it 's not it 's not a dangerous building it 's been it 's been secured there 's a difference between a dangerous building at a building in danger but it 's it 's damaged in the way yeah it 's it 's not it 's not it would be classed I think as in earthquake-prone building but there are mechanisms to do deal with those quite prone buildings and it 's not an immediate threat to the public roadways or anything because it 's set back but obviously the building is in danger of ongoing deterioration if you don 't maintain a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure the water isn 't dripping all over the place in there and keep the vermin under control then obviously you 've got a dangerous building so there is some precedent to exchange act on this relatively quickly then yeah I mean obviously the longer a building sits in a vacant condition we had this with a number of other buildings the fire service in particular have have concerns because a building like that if there was a fire that the fire people don 't want to risk sending their people into a building that hasn 't been used for a long period of time because they don 't know that there might be holes in the floor there might be deterioration that causes the fire people to be hurt in the building so any building sitting vacant for a long period of time is in danger well thank you alright so would someone like to move the staff resolution okay seconded are there any debate Vicky just to remind us of some of the history of this this has come through all of last year and so we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage within looked at the meeting I think before the election at ensuring their respectful systems in the building so that it wasn 't subject so wittily to Assam and we worked with dcl on doing that because Murray was away and we 've ensured that any rate payer contribution is protected by the fact that this only gets paid when the work is done we understand that this is a contribution about about a fifth of the total cost of redoing this and and and we know that there is enormous downside and leaving it an enormous outside and doing something about it particularly for the use that the group who seeking to buy it have articulated for it which has a huge community benefit so it seems incredibly logical to me that we this is one of eight buildings listed on our list of buildings and the central city that we wish to use this money for and it meets all of our criteria I see no problem with it whatsoever I just like to get on and do whatever we can to make it possible Mike Jamie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasn 't on the council last term and did not get that back around wasn 't through that process it look this is a significant contribution or grant and it takes the whole arm funding pot but just because we have money in a pot doesn 't mean we actually have to spend it we need to make sure it is appropriate cause or building I 'm not disagreeing that as a significant building I do disagree that it actually has street presence i think it 's hidden quite a lot I think the grounds have been been subdivided obviously which is actually caused it to be built out so I don 't think it has the presence at once did have I am concerned that the fact that that the trust is not purchase the building yet they do not have a detailed scope of works and although this is a grand they wouldn 't be obviously paid until the works were completed I 'm just very very uncertain about approving this grant with so many inconsistencies although we are trying to obviously look at addressing them through that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this thing it 's not about the Heritage aspect it 's really about inconsistencies in there this building in my opinion is not in a prominent place in the central city it is not well sing and I think when we look at some of the heritage buildings that we do have there are better ones that we can be utilizing ratepayers money on Jamie um well think so that if the history there Vicki as well so I won 't touch over in your that but there has been a process around us and I think another aspect of this process that I think is worth mentioning is that to a certain extent this money has been spent we have allocated Anna budget money for a fund for a specific purpose that specific purpose as completely in line with what this building qualifies for we then went out to the community and we said if we have buildings that are important to us and qualify for this purpose do you agree that that 's good use of that money the community agreed and as a result of that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan we 're now sitting around the table and there 's a building which qualifies explicitly for the purpose of this fund which is to help protect landmark historic central city properties I think is a gorgeous property the staff agree and I think it has tremendous history in Christchurch we 're running really low on these things but anyone that went to the Mona Vale opening a week or two ago I think you can see in everyone 's eyes over there you know these ones mean a lot for the city you know and having a weak piece of history I think is something quite special for Christchurch the money has been spent the community has said that they want this money to go to things that qualify for this and this structure does qualify for it so I think that we can get tied up in the red herrings but at the end of the day do you or do you not want to to have a fun use for the exact purpose that it was set up for and in my view yes Aaron yeah Grethe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do agree with Mike around the visual aspect of this from the street and it would be good to see the plane I know there isn 't one at the moment around the gardens and Herod has opened up to the street so it has seen a lot better but on that I would like to just raise that as a council we have fourteen thousand dollars a year on budget for heritage trees and I think while we 're talking heritage i just mentioned that we should be looking at that because there 's a lot of people that have heritage trees listed on their own properties they can 't afford to maintain them in there as a responsible council of the garden city we should be looking to do something about that now down there we go I 'd like to just voice my support for this application as well I think this is an absolutely you know from that fund that I 've looked at in research this is it you know this does fit that criteria quite well and we 've got to remember that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earthquakes and that the city has cried mourned over so much of the loss and when we have an opportunity to actually protect one of these buildings and actually create a sense of community or a sense of place within the city I think this is really important and and i agree slightly with with what we 've been said about the trees there i 've just been looking on the Google Earth and from the street frontage those trees are massive and they do sort of hide some of that you know their architecture that is there but you do but I notice from walking around the central city that you can actually see those roofs those big high well as those high parts from different areas around the city in it and you quite off and go well what is that and if we do have that this facility open to the people that can go well what is that and then walk to find it and can actually walk in there I think that is absolutely fantastic we do not have very many of those places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that respect I do support this i think the funders is available there but i do want to take a sort of a mention of that we are still hit in a city where there is still a lot of people without their homes repaired and things like that so i want to be mindful that we do need to start continue to think about how we can also look at helping people back into their own homes you know we 're looking at this heritage is a big grant here we do need to be thinking about the smaller people as well and i don 't want to forget about those people so in this decision I will be supporting this but I do want to be thinking about that as well jani thank you um just to speak and support office and I 'm glad that on my colleague mentioned Mona Vale because if you think about motor vowel actually you can 't see it from fin Alton row so actually the idea that you have to see it from a straight for it to have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a very good argument why not to fund something the other there 's so many examples of things in Christchurch so I think we should cherish and protect and enhance and if you think about what makes us unique the garden city but also some of our early architecture and if you think of wicked and house if you think of Alton Bradley and I 've just opened a week fa there and encourage consoles go and have a look you think of mo 'ne value think of this you think of the son of the tiger hey the side of the kiwi and just a few weeks ago I was at the opening of the Avery pedaling pool next to Avebury house beautiful historic character buildings in our city that I think add a huge amount two reasons why people would come here visit and do a lot more for tourism than perhaps big expensive convention centers so that 's my personal view that we should be really promoting a unique culture character and history and buildings like this are a key part of it and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings that have been vandalized our sins etc so I think I already commend the people that have put the work and trying to find a solution for this building it 's early days but I think giving some certainty around the grant is absolutely the right thing to do at this stage so I 'm incredibly supportive of this a jemi based on the up-to-date information is difficult for me to support the list because why that this inconsistent with the council the Denmark have this kind of policy and also still further filter the risk they are not occurring the owner they are the scope of work has not been a fully dirty fine I don 't think so you know a council need to when defending tula a brick and then every kinda try to start beginning order to the prepare those the kind of the scope of work the information they can do in the initial stage and give the counselor overall the picture know why it 's their plan what kind of work need to be repaired it will be upward into Billy news you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean that they have a commitment or light tuna upgrade repair distributed but I didn 't see they just rely on you know Council when they find internet and also I 'm concerned in week when I find it on its own only the one of fifth but just a 20 percentage of how bothered the Rays 280 percentage and also a particular concern 1.9 million dollars whole year the two thousand sixteen and seventeen the central city landmark deputy headteacher qualified we kwenda to this application but if we review in the last five years public every year we went to the 223 the application but right now you acquainted to this application this case how about the other one possible you know the potential application apply for they are all fully consistent complaint to the counselor heritage either a policy sao paulo day miss out so based on this information or still riska so I I cannot support and lately and sorry can i call the point of order I didn 't want to do it cuz Jimmy was on a good run and I want to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was inconsistent it is entirely consistent with the criteria of the central city landmark Heritage Fund yeah I know it was a misunderstanding is not able to be corrected by a point of order no but I don 't wanna I don 't whine this Factory and creeks argument to sway anyway there are other people there are other people who 've offered to speak as a result probably of what council chin seed but I 've got David first and then Andrew thank you look I 'm a good mind to support this application for the reasons that perhaps um councillor johansson and councillor golf have expressed that I do have some empathy for counselor chains position I think particularly the unusual aspect of this application is the fact that the trust don 't own the building as yet but I believe that we have a reasonably robust set of criteria there that will mitigate those inconsistencies and I would just go back and emphasize my desire to see the items listed in 1 a 2 D thoroughly exhausted and that we do have confidence and that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this to the extent that the amount of money which we are investing in this building which when we look at the list that 's provided here today it is probably the most significant grant that we have given out in recent years so I just emphasize again that I really do want to see some fairly robust work around the conditions set out and point one so I will support the motion Andrew this is a significant grant because it 's a significant building I 'm particularly pleased to see this paper in front of us there 's been some conversation for some time about the way that we can progress this I note the comments that have been made around the inconsistency with the policy but I certainly wouldn 't want our lack of confidence to to deal with those inconsistencies stand in the way of a good result we presented with an opportunity today to work towards saving this building and to respect the work that others have done establishing a trust and looking at a future use to save this building and I believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that opportunity today while it 's presented to us I don 't think the people of Christchurch would ever thanked us for passing up this opportunity to see one of Christchurch 's most significant buildings continue to fall in disrepair and not have a significant future use as anyone that 's familiar with the work of the James Wallace trust in Auckland and the the gallery and the other events that happened at the power homestead would it would agree and the the proposed future use of this building will not only add some security from a conservation point of view and guarantee a future for this building but it 'll add a lot to be the artistic and cultural future of Christchurch as well and whilst I support the proposed future use I note that whatever the future uses and it may or may not be that particular use on model and the future use of this building in terms of the conversation we 're having today needs to be one that sees the building actively used actively preserved we all know the value of a sustainable use in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support this I encourage those members who are not feeling those counselors who are not feeling confident to have a look at the security that the conditions that are put before is in the recommendation today and the security that the proposed covenant should the works proceed and that gives us a level of security that I believe that we should be comfortable with we 've got this opportunity today my belief is that we should just have the confidence to grab it with both hands and vote in favor of these recommendations well I wanted to speak in support of the sand to make the the comment in relation to the unconcerned Tibet of unconsciousness resolving in favor of the trust to enable them to get on with the job of protecting this important building that the inconsistencies are highlighted and we note them we recognize that that inconsistency eat enables us to make a decision and favor of this grant it is entirely in line but it is entirely consistent with the landmarked met landmark heritage grant criteria all of the guidelines have been matched the only thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid until it 's meet anyway and the other element is in relation to the scope of works which we are delegating to the chief executive to sign off on our behalf I feel they 're all of the protections that sit around the the landmark heritage grant that that that we 're designed to support the retention of important buildings and our city are protected by those measures so I 'm very much in favor of this I 'm got a bit of a soft spot for the Maclean 's mention and I really related to what councillor swag said in relation to seeing that building because if you drive up Colombo street from the crossing Billy Avenue you can it dominates the landscape and yes it is a building of significant interest and it will be open to the public to enable them to go on and explore it I think that the people that have put their hands up to run the trust should be applauded and I 'd like to thank them on behalf of the city for being willing to do so and and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support the fundraising effort that will obviously go on behind us as well I mean individually as opposed to grants as a city and and also to highlight that Maclean 's mentioned his header has had many uses over the years and there may be people who 've attended the dental school there who attended courses there when it was a training institution all of those different uses that it 's had over the years maybe within those are some individuals that could be shoulder tap for a contribution as well so think that I want to thank on behalf of counselors and on behalf of the city the trustees have put their names forward but also especially Trevor Lord whose book become the advocate for McLain 's mention and we certainly wish the charitable trust all the best so i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no it 's Jimmy chin and mike davidson that motion is carried thank you very much,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Update,SqQ2Kzt7zvM,20161207,1946.71,"Christchurch, New Zealand",5290,might be appropriate at this stage to go straight on to report number 23 which is the water management zone committee update and would like to invite the our young people to remain and hear how their contribution as as reflector than the work of the zone committees and I imagined it would have been music to your ears certainly certainly is and so cheer from Christchurch wiese melton aura pas de ruben apologises is ellen them from someone wife horror but we have Pam Richardson the cheer at mature of banks peninsula so maybe I can just start following on from the children aren 't Leslie would be by the way and I 'm the zone facilitator for Christchurch we smelt and banks peninsula zone committees and so start with Christ to twist Milton and then we 'll just move along the table and once again at the Christchurch we smelt insane committee is as incredibly privileged to be involved with the work that the EOC ecology and the kids have been involved in the wocket in Echo project there 's been a lot of community engagement on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the fact that we 've found their debt reach of the heath get river from basically the tannery up to the 0 power bridge is potentially one of the longest non spawning sites for whitebait in the South Island so so that 's a pretty special resource that we 've got beer to make the most of and we 'd like to certainly design committee would like to acknowledge the trial that the christchurch city is undertaking and in terms of if not mowing those river being so it will be keen to see how that goes and certainly working with the community to let people know why and the council is not mine river banks which i think is very important if we put any signs up I 'm sorry for interrupting but have we actually put signs up along the riverbank you know like every now and again just to say this is why and I 'll ask and maybe two of our council your council offices sitting behind me Keith Davidson and we r l and that 's it God 's got to say if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for have been involved in it detrol that sounds lovely we 've been considering how we can educate the public on this this trial it is just a trial because we do need to test public acceptability when when I kind of question said why do we why do we scalp these river banks you know why we 've done it for so many years it 's because it looks neat it looks tidy and we do it because we 've always done it and and really I think we need to challenge those assumptions and change that in part of that is certainly education so we 're working with our communications team to find way to get the message out there and we 'll be looking for public feedback on on just how acceptable they do find these banks with the longer grass yeah but it 's a bit the heavy thick we haven 't got any signs up we haven 't put signs up as such we 're hoping to get the message out through social media and other outlets but we haven 't closed the door on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potential designers not at all Tim oh no no I 'm sorry I 've interrupted and which was naughty of me it might be better if we do you want to take questions at the end well I mean certainly they took just for a second I mean the benefits are obvious even even to our children in terms of the announced spawning but there 's other benefits too we we expect that we will be able to reduce erosion by allowing the grass to to grow longer and their root systems to take hold better this has been a problem particularly since the earthquakes of erosion and we 're having to deal with that so this should help we 're hoping that we 'll see other improvements with the in the riparian habitat in terms of other ecological benefits and other other species take advantage of that long grass also has the opportunity to fill the contaminant so all the runoff that you get go straight down the banks into the river longer grass should actually help to retain some of that and improve water quality and of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of that 's going to end up in the river and again that decays and that has effects water quality and of course will be interesting to see because obviously with shaved riverbanks that 's an ideal habitat for ducks and geese and so I might be just be interesting to see as part the trial as to whether that affects their behavior and their numbers because obviously they 're there they 're significant impact upon the water quality too so we 're hoping to see a number of benefits but obviously we 're mindful of the concerns of the considerations which is why we 're running it as a trial so are you happy to carry on no at I 'm happy yep we 're in your hands okay all right and so just keep it on the he 's good catchment and the same committee also approved 86 thousand in ecosystem health biodiversity projects at the last meeting three of those are in the upper and he 's got catchment so so we are really trying to to focus quite a bit of attention at the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as that I think the sewing committee would really like to commend the work of the storm water engineers and particularly tried to tackle the worst two tributaries of the heath get and that 's a cute that 's road and hatin streams so there 's quite a bit of we 're going with engineering on those two areas a lot of the heavy metals you know specifically affected by the more industrialized catchment via in particularly a heavy transport links so and the other aspect i suppose that I 'd like to just mention is work that we 've been doing with the University of Canterbury around a model for modeling some of the contaminants of these more urban catchments called Medusa and we had a very interesting presentation on the eddington Brook and about what how much sinks coming off roofs how much copper how much sediment and hopefully we 'll be able to take liat work into thinking about what are the best management approaches so if if you sweep the car park twice in a week with that have a significant effect rather than once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that 's really tired Christchurch Greece Melton same committee if anybody has any questions or will Tim had his hand up before I 'm just just can 't really follow on from you my understanding was that introduced would have fell don 't like the long natural kind of river banks whereas in the the native would have fell actually like those is it because I mean it is the water fell as a problem of their and their rivers is it I mean Greg would you like to comment yes so Greg barrel I 'm a freshwater ecologist I know more about fish than I do about that sell be quite honest about that but there 's my understanding too but I would I would defer to a bird person but the dogma is that if we can get the right sort of educate and we can get the right sort of species here so yes that 's correct Phil Sarah a Erin thank you very much I just wanted to clarify with Keith about the possibilities about more selling the issue of the worst areas like colet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future wetland there or some kind of swale to assist the contamination problem is that a possibility Keith a protocol and comment in detail and that the staff are working very hard to identify all opportunities to find options for water call quality improvement and treatment my understanding is that the number of options will be coming forward through the Local Plan process they 're working very hard to to respond to this but I can 't just offhand comment on that this particular I 'm Sarah thank you i 'm just going to follow up on that an apartment in Napa project as well and we had our presentation to the Lynwood central hits get community board on the fourteenth of November who 's dick Brennan came along which was excellent and she at that point and it 's in the minutes commutable minutes that are in our agenda today and the the board requested that staff work with the AH psychology and developing an operational end communication plan to support the project and and one of the things that the board talked about issue was the signage the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually having some similar format so that when people actually walking their dogs or walking along the riverbank rather than online just with social media that they see the signs and they get knowledge of the air rather than having the disconnect at home on the computer and to walking out and so we were quite keen for for some sort of sign and having the kids involved would be really good giving him to design them and just putting them up on those same to the waratahs them it 's not a bit I 'm Aaron yeah actually a nice we segue from Sarah 's point around the dogs because we have this problem up around the sticks as well is dogs soiling around the waterways and of course people when there 's no and watching will often just walk away and leave it all the dogs and an outer ward way especially around their spawning grounds would it be helpful if we headed dogs on leash policy around our waterways what sort of difference would that make or is it just I honestly don 't know I you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ecologist you know so you cringe when your dog runs through a nesting area of whitebait so yes we fear my dog doesn 't do that because I don 't take a down period that and I think that 's about education and so I am really keen on the idea of education I know internally there 's some initiatives around that I think this concept of the love zone and I I like that and I think there 's an issue about disengagement with their natural environment if we can get people more engaged with a natural environment and these these young people here are showing their I think the general public could do with a bit more engagement to so I think education rather than just strikes that a punitive step well it 's not punitive it 's just dogs on leads you 're not saying she won 't take your dog Leah just don 't let it run through her love zone yeah yeah well that 's well okay so if you 're talking about what BEC spawning areas yeah I can see advantages I don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of defecating on leader awfully the main thing that people have a responsibility for picking up after their dogs regardless they do harder to ignore it when the dogs right beside you want to lead benefits run down the bank and you kind of look the other way what 's really be an option seen it yani then David OC regrets it sugar not just doing the education but I 'm so doing the science as well and so I just wonder if you 've got any other projects and children call saying that wouldn 't know up yeah first you have to watch Dean I have walked by this very question but all the others that you thought about season and soon certainly once again and yes ecology is has lived away in this and they 've given six cuts out to all the schools and banks peninsula for water quality and also invertebrate monitoring so so there 's and microscopes and all sorts of bits and pieces and the cats in terms of banks convention but we haven 't looked in terms of Christ you two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ideas well well it 's really exciting and the obvious thing that people say or ask when they hear about this not knowing along they tell why don 't you just plant it up and of course that that 's part of the long-term vision is to be able to identify areas where we can do that acknowledging that there are multiple uses both aesthetic and landscape as well as drainage but I think that going through this process letting the grass grow long it 's a real it 's a really good test of some I guess in growing culture and ideas and hopefully in the next I guess the next 12 months as we start to get more information we can look towards plantings and it would be a great opportunity I think for schools to get involved because it 's the logical next step so I mean I think that would be a really nice thing to do there are a range of other waterway initiatives that schools get involved with I just think this would be a nice segue for some of the schools have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know because I mean if we want parents to understand that washing their car on the street ain 't a good idea then who better to tell them than the técnicas and on that note that has it she been a suggestion for some biodiversity funding for looking at you know a community car washing area yes that people can can take the car and and clean it yeah yeah no that 's a very good idea I 'm David now thanks a great presentation from some of the kids here and have an interest with the white a curry kids in there our presentation of the love area for the avin just a couple of comments a lot to make i think in support of what they were saying one that there is already some silence there for spawning sites around the avondale bridge but i wouldn 't say it 's particularly effective I 've seen it over the years but the one thing that concerns me a little bit i think and whilst i 'm extremely supportive of of protecting the spawning sites and in that particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's great but i think we need to take the suggestion that the children brought up about having a keep your river clean program and i believe during that spawning season it would have to be still at least monthly or more because one of the issues that that does raise its head in the lower reaches of the oven that 's when we have lengthy vegetation or with via grass or other species along the riverbed they do trap all the rubbish that flows down the river so I think we need alongside this program a program of keeping the litter out of the river because it does get damned unsightly when when we allow the grass to grow longer for spawning and we allow the vegetation to to grow bigger that we have these traps for large amounts of rubbish so very supportive of what 's been presented today that i would encourage that we look very strongly a either a rubbish prevention collection program or some means of actually keeping the rubbish out of the river before we have a problem dear thank you everybody for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got the big residential red zone or area with the Green Zone in the city at the moment and basic we 're having a good conversation about water quality and things like that looking forward into the future can somebody actually just talk to us about what may be the impact of that residential red zone has been on the water quality potentially now and what maybe we can look at in the future that actually would actually support these objectives moving forward into the future that 's probably a question that that would take more time but um Greg and the City Council do the water quality testing I don 't know if you 're quite respond to it i 'm a little unsure about exactly what you mean by sort of the change are you talking about your reduced number of people around storm water quality or yes obviously you 've got a whole little less houses this you know built environment lee and you 've probably got more more runoff edges so you 've got a bit more green space will that green belt and just wondering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noticed there or could there be more to be done my recollection from the most recent round of water quality reporting is that it didn 't detect that there wasn 't a change but that was largely looking at sort of year-on-year so I have to get back to you about the if you like before quake or before I guess people leaving versus after I agree it 's an interesting question and one would think that there you might expect some changes yep we can help over there data just remember we 're here discussing the water management committee and we 've got two more to go so Mike and then Vicky sorry I make it very quick I we heard a bit about the Canadian geese and ducks and I do a lot of walking around the city I 'm seen some for me visually quite a lot of Canadian cases they those numbers exploding getting worse or I don 't know the answer to that I do know that the numbers are managed but beyond that I don 't know do they need be managed more yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game can go co governance committees yeah tect a white horrors where they they sort of tend to come under particular focus because of the lake anyway Vicky thank you I 'm not sure and I just want to clarify whether this is you guys or us and that 's the suggestion of the adopter with a big concept that came up through the schools is that a happening thing or is it something we need to make happen I 'll talk to me I think it 's probably a combination so how best would we make that happen yes so how beast would we make that happen and I can certainly take that idea back to the sewing committee in the community boards that are involved in those those catchments I think I think it will be a combination between the zone committees and the community boards to drive it would you like me to the next time you come back make suggestions to us on how we could make it a shot just for schools but for other groups individuals or anyone sure thank you and I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be exponential so okay I 've got my gum boots on today so we have got some good news about the banks peninsula autozone and that is in that Lake whoa reader has some its sides of me taken down its pollution science been taken down as of the last couple of weeks so the pollution is not as bad as what it was during over the winter months and over the last summer so there has been improvement but why the improvement who knows so it 's a lake that that 's not alone a lot about and in the last decorah mail you 'll see there was an article and they 're from Shane Waters who came to speak to the zone about the lake and how difficult and challenging it will be to to get any good outcomes from that Lake and it will be a long term project if we ever resolve it so but there are a lot of things that the zone committee is doing with its local communities in Little River to resolve it the next book there that we talked about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water supply and of course you 're should know about that that i was actually the meeting yesterday at a an annual plan pre-meeting that we talked about it the zone committee is very supportive of it and as you can see though we have been working a small working group has been working with the district health board and etc John look at that community water supply so the zone committee really has has gotten behind this and looked at how might they move it along so there are a number of other things that that the zone committee it 's all about communities working with the City Council and Environment Canterbury and that 's what happens with these zone committees that they 're wonderful opportunities to work together and that 's what zones should be doing is overseeing a whole lot of projects that are going on but in lyttelton harbour we 've got the araujo lyttelton harbour basin and there 's a catchment plan project going on there members of the zone committee of working on me at the moment we also have got city council working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of waste water to land and the echo our catchment very controversial project and we just need to applaud the work that the City Council staff are doing an hour and our communities and the support from those counselors that are coming along to those meetings and as you can see there at the bottom Elizabeth coming in is our representative to banks peninsula zone committee where we have four in anger that we work alongside so we value as well having Elizabeth there so we 've just been recently in banks peninsula or allocated 103 thousand dollars to five community projects mostly in the copa rota area that 's the little river wye rira area and why nui area and over the hill in was one over hill in the epilogue catchment as well so we 've spent over three hundred and six thousand dollars in the last few years on biodiversity projects so they are welcome opportunities of all working together and I just happened to look at my computer this morning and see is new zealand 's whitebait population fried so it is the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's am quite appropriate that you 've actually got the white bait being talked about here this morning so when it 's fri its meaning the frying cane or its fried by the environment so onwards and upwards very good hey so just a quick question um especially with with pen with you being on a community board i miss one but like some really neat ideas have been presented to us today and it 's great that the zone committee are reporting talking council under stir this and i see some community board members behind you it 's about scope for linking in or community boards around some of the suggestions that we made today would you like to comment on me well i found it very valuable being a member of a community board and a member of his own committee very beneficial because there 's no i can take one thing from one thing to another so in this means at this fusion of all sorts of ideas and things so it is very important that I thought I think it 's very important then we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well we do have a council representative in our council represented on our zone committee bends over backwards to be with us but there 's a huge amount of sharing information so yes there is a good opportunity to have a community board representative on it as well so um so on last but no means least is no diff I 'm fine meat being wayness on the facilitator for that zone the someone who is own committee hears I guess as its goal to get the someone rather swimmable it goes forward so it 's full of would countenance food which is only a handful of kilometers above codes and I think that an Galloway will attest the challenge when we saw when we took the zone committee there at a field trip on Tuesday designing a quarter of the flow then the river that the wars at the same time last year and the real challenge of three dry winters that heaven filled up the ground water bath tub really shows up and not only the load and strengths but also on the lower silver so that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a leadership role into trying to work with a huge number of organizations schools agencies that are really trying to do stuff in terms and make it better the other comment that I did want to make and I know that Ellen would have made it as the chair if he was here zone committee I guess would also like to I guess acknowledge the importance of tea white horeb coke governors then really seriously trying to bring tea wahoo lake hills near back to what it was and so I guess design committee is there and would like to support and help in any way it can in terms of that tea Walker governors of which the counselors one of thank you oh and I just have such happy childhood memories of swimming at Co sport that 's just to you yeah would be a dream come true there is any questions Andrew thank you I 'm just interested in a little bit more information on the the last sentence that we 've got in the report in front of us today the microbial contamination at coast Ford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above Coast fort certainly your aim for coast forward for the Sullivan River EcoSport to be swimmable is great nothing is fair to say we would totally support that what 's the activity that 's happening at Silverstream or further up the catchments which could be or that you may know is causing that contamination so it 's a piece of piece of context so silver string itself Scott three or four main channels ninety ninety percent of the lengths of those channels stock our excluded from yet we still don 't see the drop-off and I guess the peak ecoli levels which generally are flushed down after rain often an autumn or really really summit we do know that within and flying into silver streamers a number of I guess what the farmers would cool drains and so we need to work on the drains and get both stock excluded from them pretty much all the time and but also stop any excess of water into those drains particularly in high flow events so so that 's going to be one of the key pieces of our focus is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much for your time and effort um I 'm just getting this resolution updated so that we received the information and the three water management zone committees reports and I think it 's going to be our attention to invite the zone committees to come direct to council on a on a bi-monthly basis because I think that this level of exposure on these issues is going to be really helpful in terms of public building public understanding and knowledge about what they can do to contribute to the quality of our waterways so thank you very much for what you do but i also want an instruction for me to write to white a curry score and a power school to n do psychology for the work that they are doing to thank them for their presentation here today but really encourage them to continue and these efforts because i really do think that that that their you know their presentations were outstanding and their work was outstanding as well yeah i could write to the all of the schools and and the list i 've got the full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their presentation and Ben yah psychology in the other schools to thank them for the for the ongoing work if it 's if that 's okay so would you like to move that Jonnie [Music] well we did we filmed the whole thing and took photographs so I 'm hoping that news Lionel runner a full story on it as well but I think I think the fact that they 've come here to the council has provided an opportunity for one to be live stream but the media all here and I 'm sure they 're just as fascinated by the commitment of young people as as they are by others who made presentations oh so you get the mere right to watch chuckles call ya 'll psychology and the other one schools yeah that 's kind of missing the point isn 't it for the presentation and full beer in other schools on going hard week yeah but i want to write to the other schools that are listed so anyway look it can we just ya what I 'll just do I 'll just do the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yanni moving it ends I 'm got in sick ending it right so um so I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye as opposed to know that 's carried thank you very much thank you and we 'll adjourn now for a very late morning tea for there 's no morning tea sorry there 's no morning tea we won 't a June unless you want to go and get a cup of coffee for 10 minutes 10 minutes I go back here at half-past

after you present it right that 's great so welcome good morning cancer um 1200 kids across Christchurch have been environment investigators over the past few months and yes ecology the lead organization of vaca anaka are white Bay connection coordinators the aim of the environment investigators program has been to provide a hands-on learning experience for the kids to foster a stewardship for the local environment and to increase in knowledge and awareness of our why Pete species you know so 16 of the school 's the kids are from 16 schools ranging from Kim G 's to intermediate levels as you can see from the slide and they 've been learning about the incredible life cycle of younger their habitats and the threats that they face in their local environment and they are very knowledgeable about younger and are very passionate about having them around in their future they 've been working closely with the younger love zones which are the three kilometers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river meter river water meets the salt water as you can see from the slide and they 've assessed these zones and they 've they come up with a score and relative actions that for the critical habitats and for the upcoming spawning season so the kids are here today to present their action ideas with the hope that council will support them in the work along to work alongside their work programs and to improve the spawning habitat for in anger we do acknowledge that the cancer have been trialing the rivers letting its hairy down and buy and stopping the mowing of the riverbank and through the assessments of the environment investigators their kids and they have found that this has had a huge impact and a huge benefit to the e non responding and as the grass is long and there 's thick root maths and so enormous thorn between februari and june and it 'd be great to see that the grass will be long around this time period thanks to you and I 'm going to introduce white a couscous to give their little presentation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it might be nicer for the counselors this you introduced yourselves are you happy to do that do it do you want to take the mic down in the front of you so know if you hold on to it but boy open up my Play yeah we 're going to give you one minute because we want this to look fantastic and we don 't we don 't want your you we don 't want your faces hidden behind bit fluffy thing that 's better hi I 'm kima and we are year for students at weight Arcady school and recently we have been learning about how to protect our internet um and we have been making presentations and to share today and we would like to share them with you yeah my name is Jimmy and I am a student at White 's have a primary school as a project for inquiry I have decided to i decided to inform you that white bank numbers are declining which is not good for us or our environment this is being caused by the question city council requesting their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habitat of the Illinois where they spawn and lay the eggs is being destroyed we must inform you not to cut the grass in the autumn as this is the season that the eggs are being laid amongst the long grass on the riverbanks we want to make you aware that during late summer and early autumn you must not cut the grass please educate the public so they understand why the grass along the riverbank is being left long at that time of the year you 're sincerely Jimmy searches should be able to get your mouse to possibly the posters are happy my name is teal I 'd like to talk to her about adopting part of the riverbank che we would like to adopt part of the riverbank because we want look we want to look after the white bag by planting trees so they have shape hi we would like to a dot part of the river bed because white they need to hide from other big fish food where you would like to adopt part of the river bank so we could plant trees and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can eat it lay eggs we would like to do not part of it with a bit so you can plan some some more trips glass and like that can my ears in the glass hi my name is Sasha and um I have been doing an iMovie for my presentation and that would a solution here this is what we want our rivers to look like and these are the parts that we need to take care of i thing you could do to help is make a day everyone picks up rubbish in your environment this is what the environment could look like it in your own house thank you for watching my baby wonderful what seemed quite a bit hi I 'm Riley and I make an iMovie about um protecting the white bay and um why these and just lots of facts about them white fat numbers are dropping dropping fast so we need to help them and protect them from other predators and we want to community days so if a buddy comes to a riverbank and helps pick up rubbish white beef and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do plant trees so um the bugs can drop off and they can eat the food and we don 't want to cut trees near the riverbank so they can get the food and we can make meals birds another fish company bus stop us since we can protect them and be by website but it isn 't that why didn 't you move a headset especially thank you for listening and watching our presentations now power scared are going to give their presentations yes are you quite happy to introduce yourselves again as well so powerschool automated my name is aaliyah i go to our power school and I am it use up a group of people at our school had been learning about white bed we went down to the river and imager deGrasse we looked after somewhat bed and after a couple of weeks I set them free in the hypocrite river one day we went for a walk and we did some activities one of the dirt tivities was we got to cut a tank of chocolate fish I kissed a hundred and fifty night there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freshwater and saltwater we also learnt that what they need longer in the love zone to lay the eggs remember not to mow the grass along develop the sir thing we learned was with that we need to protect our wavelength they are very important to us to make sure that the white they don 't get extinct we have to look after them Susi we can stop polluting the river by reducing rubbish picking up rubbish along the river port more rubbish bins along the river bed with lids super me you can reduce fishing of the white paper I only having short white boat fishing seasons certainly you can have the white boat by making more hay bales and putting them along the river while say you can help my fate by listing to us thank you for listening hi my name is Enrico I go to a power school and IM teen years old there are my ideas to keep the room is clean and to keep the white Bay alive we can put our rubbish into bright bands placed around the river it is good that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tall long grass along the river is needed for whitebait to spawn in or a few people are mowing it would be helpful to tell them not tomorrow as whitebait need these long dresses long grass of areas to populate their species we can also have some cameras spot anyone following the rubbish into another which could lead people to people being spoken to about doing this and even find sometimes people feed the ducks a lot this will cause them to constantly poop in the river and if there is too much poop in there other fish living and you could die and or the poop could block the waterways in this case warning site signs should be put up so that people who want to feed the ducks can read the signs and be aware of the harm it causes or dare aquatic life style my last idea is we need his fishing season some fishermen fro the rubbish in the river we can try spreading the word by telling people to put the rubbish in the bin or take it home with them I think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this gives whitebait a safe environment in which to lay the eggs the signs are also educational to people who are unaware as the life cycles of white bear in this warning areas thank you for listening hi I 'm Susan and I got your power circle and I am eight years old and these are my ideas to share with you today we should help keep the white bed alive by putting more rubbish bins by the river because people with Dean stops line rubbish and the rubber as there will be somewhere else to put it also we could put up signs around the river when it 's mating season so that it can remind people to be careful at that time the eggs are laid on the riverbank at the bottom of the long grass so people can not see the eggs and don 't know that they are there most people think that the eggs are laid in the water the signs would help to let people know Ling eat lang season is and when to be careful we don 't want people snooping on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next year to make immediate after and so on um my third idea is that we should stop feeding the Ducks spread as much feeding them so much that will poop a lot and this hope the world lets the water special permission should be bookshelf on someone in charge of their area also along the riverbank is a lot of dog poop when it rains this goes into the river and awesome flute sir this isn 't good for white day and could be another reason for them not returning it would be a good idea to put out what signs explaining this or even finding people at the dog 's poop by the river we looked at how two things can contaminate in the rubber things like chemicals and animal waste from farms rubbish last clippings and poop it could be good as things like this could be monitored more so that we can make sure that I rather stay in good condition for the white day thank you for listening to what I have to say well I have to say that and I 'm sure I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that that those were incredibly professional presentations and we were very glad that young people were taking such an interest and species protection within our river so thank you very much for what you 're doing for the city and I 'd like to hand back to shibor now yeah so as you can see the kids are very passionate about the in anger and the health of their River and they would just love the opportunities to be able to make their River a better place and especially for the you know thank you thank you very much thank you,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

1,JX9QxIUeQ44,20161207,442.56,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1046,the next item is public participation I 'm sad to inform everyone that the cameras aren 't working for the live streaming at this at this moment so which is a bit of a shame so I 've got a dip sorry a public participated a public forum presented first so cool turn a upper noe forward to speak to us but I 'm sorry that the cameras aren 't live streaming because these these are always opportunities to put things and hopefully we 're going to try and make sure that the cameras are working by the time the the young ones come forward so welcome joy oh don 't miss the button yeah good does that help yasuno still no okay so I 'm here to talk about the rail I 'll keep it white sheet again hit the side again please excuse me put the fire game sorry I won 't take all that time off here well good yeah thanks oky short so I 'm going to talk about rail I think everyone 's gotta hand out already thanks Joe so the keikain costings were over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete system for northern rail line is about 2.5 million i gave filled clearwater a heads of agreement on page to a flat fill you 'll see the isset carriage from auckland as agreed at fifteen thousand dollars per carriage not that 1.5 spur cara jersey can suggested and their report so what like the council to consider there 's funding an actual survey of the a pool of North every to find out what the actual usage would be so all the costings of air appellee and dispute but the patronage it would be the thing that is low council to consider is to just buy the rolling stock so the rolling stock rear we 've got at fifteen thousand dollars per carriage for the Essex carriage also recommend buying the ad of a DC characters which take about 350 people are self-propelling so if your head three of those which the financials cater for you 've got carrier over a thousand people a day running three dreams and in three trains out drink if the council doesn 't want to pay the rolling stock and I suggest that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestion would be to form a queue the form a committee to actually get right over happening we have a third major city in the country and we 're the one with how the rail system most of the employment is carried out and the city within 1.5 kilometers of the railway lines so if you 're wondering what that means it 's about a 12 minute walk I think most people are capable of a 12 minute walk I think the biggest objections derail is that it doesn 't get you to where you want to go that 's true but neither does your car because you how doesn 't get you to your desk it doesn 't take you from your beauty at this so every mode of transport has a walk-in component another so there 's not patent to the people and get them out walking so one of the things that 's good about the caribou trail network if we were to put it in place is that does link up with a bus system at our papanui aunt riccarton it does link up with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be running or a cowboy poppin Italy strolling ricketson Howard junction is out as it 's used at that time of day will help the services but in Middleton there is space and Middleton would serve addington and the facilities at home Castle arena and of course more how save and putting one at morehouse ebb puts most of the CBD and sittin with an a 10 minute walking radius of that station so those are the things I 'd like the council to consider and that 's all I 've got thank you very much we 've got an extra minute if you 'd like to take questions them I 'm absolutely shoot alone Pauline thanks Tony just on here I 'm station structure yeah that seemed to be I think a bit about a very expensive costing and the e can study what do you envisage being required because I think you don 't give a lot of cost attached to it do you ok so the platform 's with only be 40 meters long to accommodate those double units so they 'll be fit to purpose and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so if you hear it straight line that wouldn 't need services because it 's just a stop here 's ten have you there was some discussion with regards to buses that could run on rail and then bring that whether it 's ringing or acai foyer whatever aught of further afield of add a field or Amblin cetera and when it comes in they could kind of slide off the tracks and then become buses have you looked at that at all or this area I haven 't looked at it and any sort of depth because we don 't have any around to look at oh thanks much oh good all right well thank you very much much appreciated thank you thank you bright how are we doing what 's the time we 're not live streaming it do you guys want to just wait a wee bit and just see if we can get back on the live streaming we 'll just carry on and do a couple of other items of business is it right I know but they come yeah okay well we 'll go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but if it 's not want to help us team then maybe we could get someone down to a filmer we 've got video cameras you know watching cell phones us everyone 's got iPads right which we 're allowed to use for a while right,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

and I 'm sorry for the wait Paula rolled director and principal curator and Christina Pickford cheers center of Contemporary Art have a presentation for us welcome i think this is the first time that you 've come and presented to the council to this one yes okay right members in the past but rock yeah ok so welcome thank very much for giving us the time today it 's really appreciated I 'm Christina Pickford that going chair of central contemporary art in Palo oral the director and principal curator so we 're just going to share the presentation today and we quite quick I 'm and we 're going to look back over the last six years what we 've been doing but in particular the last year since the gallery 's been open and I 'm going to look more what we did over the period of the earthquakes in a little bit of history about the organization for those of you who don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what she 's been doing in-house for the last year this is the gallery today you can see you can sort of see in the old got a lively cafe on the ground floor which hopefully you 've all frequented and and also not at the gallery inside as well but it 's looking fabulous today and it 's really i think contributing to the gloucester street streetscape so really briefly just a little bit of history and focus that long and proud history started its life as the canterbury society of arts making the early 1880s i don 't know if this might be on automatic is it just going to I don 't anyway um started its life in the early 1880s initially the society didn 't have its own building it is going to just flick through how can I control then sorry that 's just a little bit too fast see someone who can will be at the end of it before oh yeah so started without assigning buildings that just used various buildings throughout Christchurch are we going online Jeff you then I think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time just saw him adapt their way oh sorry why did I 'll try and keep it okay um so it was the first so then that the first gallery Pittsburgh gallery was built later in the 1880s that was a mount for building on gloucester street it was more recently the Environment Court building and it was demolished as a result for the earthquakes and it was first dedicated arts organization in the region and it actually it was first exhibited and clicked works in inflects the canterbury society of arts seeded the historical collection for the christchurch art gallery so it 's got a very long and proud history the gallery relocated to its current home and gloucester street in 1968 it 's an exquisitely detailed brutalist building this magazine I don 't know why laughing an exemplary lot of the movement in Christchurch and opened it was when it opened it was the cultural heart really of Christ Church in a head shows which would see Q 's out to the river in actually the opening show which you can see there if you look carefully the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nolan the australian artist with his need kelly paintings so it had a very very vibrant in rich beginning in it you can see full house it 's the interior of the gallery much as it looks today with ya crowds of people and also celebrated local artists in cutting-edge contemporary shows right through 60s and 70s and arguably the galleries have started to maybe lose its way a little bit in the 80s and 90s is the rise of dealer galleries became more prevalent in the city and apt societies fell out of favor and actually before the earthquakes the board started to look at what the new vision would be for coca and then the earthquake struck the gallery 's first sports clothes in February and luckily we were really well insured and we hit three and a half a million dollars spent on the buildings to strengthen and repair the building and through the 900,000 on betterment to bring it up to the 21st century so that was a big project for the board but we also took that opportunity to really look at what coca should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the board 's time and energy and we took it very seriously so the future purpose was we determined that Coco would become a true center of contemporary art we wanted to put Christchurch on the map for contemporary art one of exhibit curated shows which were champion the best of this regions and thus countries artists the work would be challenging and what excite it would provoke and encourage conversations about contemporary life and culture we determined daily on that the gallery needed to have reach outside of its gallery walls to engage the broadest cross-section of the community as possible this would be achieved with public programs specialist youth programs and by constantly looking for opportunities to collaborate with other organizations and community groups wherever possible and also on that time we we realized that the fiscal wind financial management of the gallery would be really important if we were to achieve all these things so we 've put in place of very very strong governance and management structure to ensure that the gallery would thrive and we 've got a rigorous business plan which would unsure ensure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we 've been open fire what is it ten months mmm fe BRE this year which is about to open a fourth show tonight and maybe there are constant challenges I guess that 's the nature of a small arts organization and we have a small but tremendously dedicated in Cape team yeah and what I want to do now is hand over to caller who talked about how she 's bought the board 's vision to life over the last year and she 's been instrumental to what we 've achieved thus far so this is the purpose and our ambition I think you 'll see that it says purpose and that 's very critical to coca and we have an ambition for the city we also have an ambition for New Zealand we have an ambition for the artists in the community that we serve here in the city as well as the artists that are kind of representing New Zealand nationally and internationally as well yep this statement is that a heart of where we are we are engaging our community and we are enriching Christchurch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to really tell you about what our future it is and what we 're doing now and tell you more about what coke has been up to in the last year it 's been an incredible year we 've survived two earthquakes this building and our small team have managed and the extensive work that goes into actually ensuring that this building is opened again to the public so our history is critical but also our future is critical as well what we are doing we are making contemporary art relevant so the public is at the heart of how we present artists ideas it 's really important was how we engage people in contemporary art because contemporary art isn 't the most natural art form to kind of gauge and understand um and one of the things that we do especially with our volunteers and we rely heavily on volunteers and to translate contemporary art for us and make it accessible and enjoyable and for a wide and diverse audience so I want to say that because actually that 's the role of curators that 's a role of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what artists are creating in the world and to translate those for people to actually genuinely get an experience from as well because your ideas conceptual ideas aren 't naturally translated and artists who are making work today really want to question the world that we 're living in as well and that 's what we do as a contemporary art program in the city and heart of Christchurch now we collaborate with our arts of community this is absolutely critical to my vision of Coca how we 're doing that is that this year we curated an exhibition and called contemporary Christchurch offer that 's alright contemporary Christchurch was selected by curators and in other institutions and art galleries in the city and so we invited the curator curators at Christchurch art gallery I 'll amarte school and physics room to select artists that represent what is contemporary in Christchurch at the moment and also significant to that is that in a sense of collaboration as we go forward I have true ambitions to really see us collaborating together and with our neighbors with our other organizations to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and collectively work together so that 's will be my job in the next two years to really kind of focus on that vision and perhaps even establish a collaboration which could be a festival and events that we all develop together in the city to really engage a new audience in contemporary art as well because that 's at the strengths of kind of really what I 'm trying to do for Coco is to bring a new audience into the city we are completely different to our neighbors but we are together and working together as well um it 's amazing actually that the resources that the art gallery give to us and their team as well I 'm especially vet technician and the support that we get from their production so that is the true kind of collaboration as well what we 're doing also is implementing a program to support young people in the city to really think about some of the key issues that they 're dealing with and that affecting them we 've been able this year and with the support of the City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the city she 's based in the city to produce a series of workshops with young people about the ideas and issues that are affecting them and cardboard confessional is a project that they produced and spent over six weeks with this artist thinking about and spending their weekends considering an art project and my experience of working with young people is that art actually opens new opportunities actually transcends the opportunity to think differently but also for them to think about their future as well it 's certainly all art forms do that but the proactive way the artists work with young people is what we really want to try and enable and as we move forward we 're establishing an associate program for artists and curators in the city to help them and develop their practice their professional careers we live in a very slightly isolated place and as you 'll probably experience and that 's really critical for me I come from a background of actually living in a place very similar to Christchurch as well and how to enable artists and further careers is something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quite sure to counsel helped us do that as well through the support and funding so what we 're doing we 're creating an international centre for contemporary art that every city in the world has an amazing mix of art galleries we have presented not only exhibitions of artists in the city but also artists coming from further afield this is a work by nautical Jonna confer we genuinely had 5000 people experience work of art that was commissioned originally for the last Venice Biennale bakari 's nature which we opened today a strange coincidence and that we open this exhibition um and it is truly about climate change it 's truly about human impacts and I know from my experience of curating it it actually has also opened my eyes to the impact that I am creating on the world and how perhaps I may think about some how I operate in the future so we hope for the audience and the public who we engage with this exhibition to really consider that as well so your contribution is vital your support until now has established the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the public and enabled our artists artistic vision your support into the future it will continue to create a vibrant arts hub for the welfare and well-being of our community help Commission new work and support leading artists and emerging stars helped establish a unique arts education program and put price church on to the international art scene map which is the truly my ambition to do that we believe that art inspires me thinking for our society and within your support and looking forward we hope to build a closer relationship with your City Council so we can offer more to the people of Christchurch and really truly do what a city like Christchurch can give as an experienced a major Center for Contemporary Art in the city thank you thank you very much I appreciate that these small snippets at the beginning of our meetings are probably not ideal for a presentation of this substance so I will take that on board for for the future but thank you very much for coming and making the presentation thank you thanks four times and I 'm right Janet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it Joe Daly is bringing around a copy of my speech the subject is council 's replies to our thank you councils replies to our submissions to the project City Council annual plan submitters to the classic City Council annual plan request more specific replies to their submissions rather than only the generic letter signed by dr. Carla Edwards chief executive her very good letter ends on behalf of the council I would like to thank you once again for the feedback you provided and for taking time to contribute to the consultation process your participation is important to us and highly valued now that lovely letter was sent to all of our subscribers but it doesn 't cover any of my subjects and my submissions for instance I genet being have personally requested a full landscape plan to be prepared for the pseudonym cemetery at 24 34 Reuters street I 've requested that landscape plan in 2014 and in 2015 and this year 2016 thus she is so to have requests be made by Ian hill by the Summerfield residents association and by the spray tan heathcott community board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've tried to get information through the council 's public participation manager died Keenan died has tried very hard to find someone to answer my requests they all just say it 's not unless symmetries master plan well what we don 't know that at the public hearings on Saturday the fourteenth of May to 30 2016 mia leone dau co said that she had been disappointed with the generic reply that she 'd received to her submission to the annual plan and 2015 leanne seed that she believed that this year it would be better David close reminds me that when the wonderful julie said lo was canceled secretary she always wrote specific replies to our annual plan submissions i 'm very grateful to megan Pierce councils hearings team leader for her assistance Megan 's letter acknowledging receipt of our submission number one for 898 also seed I will write again advising you of the council 's decision on the issues race during the submission process now wouldn 't better be lovely Megan very kindly Korean me hard copies of the two volumes of our submission so being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was marvelous thanks Megan please Mirren counselors maybe have more specific replies to our annual plan submissions and I 've just given a a list on page for you some of the people that are contacted who would like to have come and supported this as well because they say you stay breathe I would like very much pleased to have specific replies thank you I 'm coming here with support I I 'd like to support the intention i think it 's appropriate if the citizens take time to make submissions the annual plant that they get specific requests to their submissions our only recourse and is that if if we don 't get a reply to the letter would choose to be custom at the council would be to the loddon request which i 'm guessing with Bobby type more staff time if we make requests for the documentation related council decision making and staff reports and I 'm guessing that you would prefer that it be done as part of the annual plan process that I smoking dividual request information I think I mean I just comment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about receiving a generic reply it was a generic reply pretending to be an individual reply to the specific issues that I raised so we may not have got it exactly right and we certainly haven 't got it right when individuals come with specific very specific issues like a landscape plan for a cemetery that falls outside the the master planning cemeteries plane what you 've got advised you already knew anyway so which was why you were here asking for an individual one so um but but you know the annual plan process is not I mean it will certainly the the long-term plan process but also the annual plan process is not a very good way of dealing with these issues either because I 'm very weird that 's that this is a whole community group that sits behind the desire for the plan around signum symmetry that 's right isn 't it is it said no more Eddington 's in them and and people want to play a bigger role in looking after their local cemetery and I know that there are a lot of parks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think a an agreement was entered into with the AVA even head residents association just prior to the election for them to take over a particular role in relation to the cemetery so these things I think would actually be a much greater fruit if we were to highlight these specific issues and pull them away from the annual plan unless they need budget allocation in which case it is appropriate to put some element on the budget to cater for it but the imported away from the annual plan process so that we can actually have a conversation with the local communities about these issues rather than see them tied up as having been it dealt with a not dealt with by way of a submission because it 's leaving too much to chance actually that somebody will take the time to make the submission on the annual plane and that it will be of sufficient weight as against all the other submissions that come in that it will rise to the to the top and I think that there are some things that come through the annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so but thank you very much for your for your presentation this morning I think you 've given us a very good steer about the direction that we need to go on and and we need to probably work through that with the with the management of the organization can to see how we can get the community engaged in those conversations about it specifically where the leader could I just ask just point out that most the submitters made a submission to the full council and I understand colony would sign the letter my understanding is environment can be de rigueur baisley since I think it 's probably on style but it would be a private since we make submission before council and councils that the mayor send the later as opposed to the CEO not crystals of the CEO actually want to say hey I think it 's the organization wanted me to sign the letter but I didn 't like the liters sorry one of the first day I send a copter from the community ones that I did side so I probably did the right thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a from a the point of view of the council but what we want to do this way better we want to do we don 't we haven 't got it right yet we tried it a little bit differently last time and and we just we just really open to a new way of doing things there 's a new council well I 've worked on well over time so look thank you very much for your presentation but you have given us food for thought that we will take on board and we will address it thank you very much thank you very much now I have Tracy charnock who 's going to speak to us regarding item five options for addressing fast food retail outlets thank you very much for agreeing not to speak last week so that we could hear from you today ok and yours is a 10-minute deputation by appointment as yeah we 're actually speaking to an item on the agenda this time first once I am dead on yep thank you so much for Liam asleep this morning I really appreciate it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all its mother and start on i know one last time I was here I need to find more what a fast food outlet is so I 've got like a Pacific answer here at the moment and it is at fast food our high fetch hi saath con products usually deep-fried Andrea th they include dining options and convenient drive-throughs fast food outlets have a chain of stores throughout the city 's big ever tising largest silage on their buildings that can clearly be seen from like hundreds of metres away and also wanted to talk about how these fast-food outlets are actually quite largely addictive and very expensive and also convenient like fast food is a addiction and it 's a very serious issue in New Zealand just as much as alcohol drug abuse and gamma deductions especially in Christchurch post earthquakes like experts say that people are more likely to be Vonda productions judge traumatic stress fast reductions are extremely concerning as these lead to a serious health issues accounting for eighty percent of preventable diseases including type 2 diabetes heart disease stroke and cancer as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem we face this can be associated with respiratory problems and can play a role in development of sleep apnea learning difficulties ends depression the effects of these health issues over a long period of time can also lead to death recent reports state that one of the three children and new zealand between the ages of 20 to 14 years are obese or overweight most experts believe this is due to living in an increasingly obesogenic environment many studies conducted in New Zealand and around the world shows similar correlations between low socio-economic areas health issues due to poor diet and the amount of fast-food outlets clustered in one area almost all these areas had neighboring schools lynnwood used to be a residential area with Lynwood F school serving the children and the area since then this has been changed by council toy commercial zone fast-food outlets don 't need consent to built and took the other school and now this has been taken over by four major fast-food outlets in the area and tow more to be built in the near future I find this quite contradicting as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast food outlets to build and display large signage and view of skills that promote healthy eating health considerations are important part of the district plan especially for our children the health district borrow the christchurch district health board have included in there three years submission plambeck and 2013 for one safeguard the diversity of food retail around bill areas through its district plans and the restriction of fast food outlets nearest schools their reason for these plans are to promote in the reduction of adverse environmental efforts effects of the half of people and communities and to improve promote and protect the health of new zealand 's through the New Zealand public health act fast food outlets could be regulated under public health bill as this proposed a significant public house as many papers who provided evidence for counsel should aim to reduce significant health risks and the communities and create a healthy place for us to live one way of reducing these health risks with encroached its population more importantly children is to reduce the prevalence of fast food outlets near schools where 's a country estate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action auckland 's that accounts are exploring the idea of restricting or limiting new fast food outlets 20 400 meter radius from skills and early childhood centers by adding a minimum distance requirement and wanaka have a strong group of locals who are gathering a community action around this idea also Christchurch City Council should lead the way by promoting healthy food zones around schools and by restricting fast food outlets in these areas and establishing a health food criteria for existing health food possessing fast food outlets so I say thank you for taking this issue into consideration and listening to me today now I encouraged you to take necessary steps for the future of our children and our city as a whole because certain thank you questions Pauline much I 'm just picking up when you 're coming to that addiction um have you got hard evidence of there where did you get that I 've got research and I can find out and fought that too if you 're like well you 're interested in it I got our tend to agree with you on that yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot and our conversations about this but it 's addictive nature yes yeah that 'd be great thinking yep glendon yani thank you again crazy something I 've been thinking about is that council is about to invest a major asset in the sort of the area and the social context out of which your submission first comes in lynnwood by way of an aquatic center could you see that as a potential build and association with the wider community to address this issue so what I 'm thinking is of can we use it as a you know as an alternative in terms of health all up is a way of do you mean wasn 't a lowered yeah like and I don 't understand what you mean that 's very late okay oh because there 's some wider social issues giving rise to this it 's not just about food it 's not just about food no si what else using it to that well I think what you 're identifying is the confluence of the socio-economic area with the prevalence of fast food outlets yeah we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liquor outlets a supra yeah I understand so I just wonder whether we could build something there that is no promotes health okay foot soulful I don 't understand like oh that 's okay like yeah yeah yeah Danny thank you thanks for the energy and time that you put into the deputation and to this issue I just wondering if you could just um elaborate what the school currently does to promote healthy eating and we have like on a Wednesday and we pay a dollar on a Tuesday and on a Wednesday we have like healthy lunches so and so it 's affordable for the parents fish in a low socio-economic area where they pay one dollar and the next day they get their children involved and the whole so I 'm cook and prepare like healthy lunches for the Wednesday which is a really really good idea they also do have a breakfast and schools and stuff that 's happening breakfast is and stuff like that we also had like a I don 't know what you call it was like a half third day and probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always stalls and we 'll all about promoting healthy eating like it wasn 't just half the eddying I was like brushing teeth and just all healthiest fix and stuff like that and I don 't know also there and girard when he was principal he was and putting forward some sort of half food um like things are at the school diet fur in the classroom so them to be teaching them but it was going to be like a big thing for a couple months i 'm not sure sure that it 's still going to hear i should really look into that since there 's now in pitting our country yeah okay thank you a lot of schools have fun you know that they insists that their children bring healthy lunches so yes in the head sir they have little inspections of their my glass and so they can try can 't bring that on to the school premises yeah good yeah um one of the issues i have is more about sugar and your fast food obviously is a lot of process processed food and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're going to go down this track we need to actually start looking at like sugar because I mean one of the things is when I was younger we had a very poor family and we couldn 't go to fast food but we could go and buy a can of or a bottle of the that one dollar furs which gave us our head and I think that 's one of the bigger issues as well so I mean if you know these kids can go to the supermarket a countdown and boat go by 79 seen 1.5 liter drink of budget lemon Adel 's that look like that from the supermarket what can we do if we 're going to be going down the street just try and limit you know building or allowing a physical structure what can we do alongside their do you think that we can actually start educating people that actually it 's not so much about that food it 's also the sugar content in all this stuff yes well like you can go and I 've actually seen numerous children 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to school you know they 're only a dollar you know they 're really really affordable I think they need to be like promoting like with and the fast food outlets officially around the schools like a healthier alternative that is affordable why Lockerbie and selling my a healthy smoothie for a dollar or maybe a safer more affordable that they can you know and promotional net around schools like healthy lunch options as well wipe that affordable that and the like could be advertised and targeting children so they still use in there because obviously that 's what they 're that 's what the marketing is targeting children but any more of a healthier way fishy around skills and so do you think citywide we could have a little bit more of a something that actually starts to change the conversation around actually what you noted to get their head what 's an alternative what 's no turn to sugar yeah what I smoothies yeah yes I so do you think there 's something why do we can be doing in that respect the other news way that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like affordable healthy earth that 's still like and a zipper times in for the children there is a lot of it though so just briefly following dealings Christian how much of what needs to happen should be sort of like a Kemper and educational trade campaign so people are more aware of how to eat healthily rather and the dangers of the junk food well I think it 's like we 're doing needs like so not that but also um you know this like this one I 'm about more restricting the fast-food outlets and muscle existing ones more place in like a healthier healthier options with them so promoting it like advertising more half the options within fast food outlets you know that full assault on yeah absolutely our effort rising but we can 't do that okay what is it way you can put like a half a policy in place for the existing outlets around schools so they can work with schools and come up with healthy options but even if they work with the schools in the area like we can pass a policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you know the schools are going to have to reach out to the fast-food outlets that are beer and asked to engage with them on exactly this because I mean there is going to come a point i think when somebody 's going to wake up to the fact that the that the tsunami of type 2 diabetes that 's going to swamp our health system as is going to leave our health system and capable of responding to the everyday needs of New Zealanders you know it is that serious and if if they don 't get on at the front of that wave and and actually do something about diverting the worst impacts of it but i agree with dion it 's not just the fair and and the food it 's the sugar as well and there are kids drinking drinks a long time before they ever get to see a takeaway from from one of the fast food chains so we really do need to think about genocide part of the issue that you no idea this could be like something of significance to apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tsunami coming through and people actually scientists realize and see this now be good if we can start targeting this before it does get to alleged or so because we are in the rebuild of Christchurch and we 're about promoting a healthy City yeah I think this is like a good time to start I agree and we are absolutely up for playing a leadership role but communities have got to reach out themselves you know it really has to be a combined effort because we can 't do it for your community but we can help you do it for yourselves okay certainly and that 's I 'm I know that I speak for everyone around the table when I say that people will have different views about what can and can 't be done but absolutely that 's the message and I mean I want to thank you one for all of the effort that you and your school community have them gone to in terms of raising awareness around the sochi because it is about raising awareness I don 't think education is the solution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a horse to water but you can 't make it drink and you can you can have somebody you know I mean you could minimize the the street frontage advertising but while children are growing up knowing that M stands for McDonald 's before they know any other letter of the alphabet that 's television advertising and somebody else 's allowing that to continue to happen and so it 's really going to take a combined effort but it 's people like you who stand up and say enough is enough it 's time for change you 're going to help lead a nationwide conversation that if we don 't have this and find the solutions now and get in front of that wave our health system will be swamped so thank you very much for everything that you 've done and put onto this thank you so much to you guys taking an interest in this and I really hope that we can eat together and like I say as a whole like really address this issue yeah to give it yes thank you thank you","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Outlets,QB3t_HUkqYY,20161116,2264.4,"Christchurch, New Zealand",6175,we will move on to the options for addressing fast-food outlets so move straight on to their right now the last time that we had this come before us we we took the previous paper out of the public excluded section and and narrow it as an attachment to this report which enables everyone to look at all of the issues and we 've got a couple of resolutions but I know that there are counselors who are working up something a little bit stronger to be included as well so actually I mean do you want to does somebody want to kind of run through the the recommendations and just do a brief overview of where we got to or I can certainly do that yeah thanks Richard so there 's you just introduce everyone I 'm just getting everyone introduced for a period of time until everyone gets to know everyone so my name is Richard Osborne and head of planning and strategic transport to my left in the Dell Redburn there 's a senior planner on the street gene transformation group to my further lifters helen beaumont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is clear Brandt who is team leader strategic policy so without further ado I 'll jump in I think you have to reports in front of you one was the previous PX report which is which was released last week and that ostensibly deals with the first question around fast food the second one was the one that was deferred from last week which addresses the specific question about potentially using the great Christchurch regeneration Act will district plan to address the issue of fast food and in particular fast food signage in relation to that particular report our advice to you is that neither the greater Christchurch regeneration ignore district plan are the appropriate vehicle for addressing this issue and what you would be doing in terms of the district plan itself is not the purpose of that act to address this issue and as you know by extension of the order on council out to 20 21 that removes our ability to promote public plan changes to that document once that is made operative but if you were to try and change it within that interim period using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you that it does not meet the purpose of the greater Christchurch regeneration it nor is it likely to meet the necessity test for the minister to exercises powers but in addition to that what you 'd be seeking to do is change the district plan by using that legislation and as I mentioned earlier on it as I advise you that the district plan is not the appropriate vehicle to address this issue so ultimately if you do go down that path and it were to be successful you would be seeking to change the district plan for something that 's inappropriate in our mind so you would end up with something which is possibly ultrafire race though the act in terms of the first report that 's pet something that clear can speak to you but there are a range of recommendations in there in terms of the plane a role that council can and supporting a healthy City promoting a healthy City lobbying central government and a whole range of other mechanisms and needs and Sarah thanks I was just um wondering a comment that Tracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I was wondering hit any comments on that and what they were going through at the moment no so we don 't have feedback on that one we 'll get on to what 's afternoon Erin in Phil 's mind would be a question for Val around planning rules in a city is there any city or district in New Zealand or could we do this thing you have particular planning rules that obviously you have commercial zones but allow certain things within particular commercial zones like we 've done it around brothels like a brothel can 't be within an eyeline of a school for instance you can 't see the brothel signage so on and so forth and we 've done it around churches and things can we do that with a premises that is detrimental to health because we had this issue with bottle stores as well that people want bottle stores only placed in certain areas within the city that is there any way that we can write that into our planning rules except that every single one of those examples you 've used have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation brothels are subject to legislation so 's alcohol outlets outlets and engines the in the district plan it 's only the consequences of noise and you know so you can 't have alcohol sold within particular premises but local alcohol plans can allow for other things but it 's under a statutory framework there isn 't a statutory framework for that harm caused by sugar and fed through the fast-food outlets because you can actually buy them at supermarkets and cut them yourself yes you can but your team to write no no I 'm not I 'm not saying that they 're any less damaging but they don 't have it 's not recognized in law that there is a regulatory framework that restricts or limits or in any way affects their their cell so for example one of the biggest things that could be done would be to catch advertising television advertising in particular of all of those fast foods well afraid there hasn 't even been in an intervention to stop advertising of alcohol on TV so I mean we 're up against it but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can find a way of working collaboratively with our communities because this is a community that consumers could stop the stillness tracks just don 't buy yeah yeah so meta me I think there 's this perception and the public domain that the council 's can allow which businesses go we 're so we have to be really clear that we can 't that if someone stopa in a gun shop next to a primary school that 's okay and if someone wants to put a bottle stool next to a gun shop next to a primary school that 's okay I 'm gun shops are also subject to a separate regulatory framework but I after the gun but is the shop yeah but it 's not just a shop it says it 's a shot that subject to a regulatory framework and yes you can make provisions around the locations of the of anything that 's subject to a regulatory framework but fast food isn 't but we have got rules around signage and I wonder whether some of that reinforces what these kids are seeing on television yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've put signage restrictions in yes but it is memorial avenue just it 's got its own cool everything it 's got its own nation but we need we need more memorial yeah Phil and thanks Richard for explaining the regeneration it better just wanted clarification familiar around this and usually saying that we can 't use section 71 even though like one of the primary purposes is to improve the four well beings for the resilience are their communities and their includes the social part so you 're really saying that although that 's part of the purpose in fact we can 't use section 71 look that 's our advice to you is that would be so they 've been there 's two paths that you could take under the great christchurch regeneration act 1 and we 've attached a couple of attachments which outlined the process for you as part of the report and one of them is section 71 one is use of a regeneration plans but i advice you is that it 's one unlikely to meet the purpose of that act but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the minister to exercise his powers in relation to that particular issue so it 's not just a matter of meeting the purpose of the act the minister has to consider it reasonably necessary for him to exercise his powers and we think it 's highly unlikely but that would occur but ultimately as i mentioned earlier on what you 'd be looking to do is to introduce a change to the district plan which is a resource management inc document and the sequel purpose of the resource management it is to promote the sustainable management of natural physical resources so that purposes about use of resources it 's not about the safety and health of users of food supplies so on all three counts in our opinion it doesn 't stack up yani thank you um I just wanted to check in terms of understand the University of Canterbury and healthy Christchurch have actually done research into this do you have any information have you seen any of the research that they 've done or um talk to them of that what what they may be able to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the location and density of fast food outlets and lower social normal areas and in proximity to schools we do refer you to the research you might be too I 'm talking about it was in a medical journal the link was in the original I think September document today a piece of Gina environment and the impact of it particularly on in the prevalence of takeaways this sort of take away to near schools so that the research has been done and we provided a link to it in the report my understanding from our collaboration with healthy price future is that they 're very supportive of some sort of action and ominous topic obviously gift-giving it we know there really is a serious issue here with health and obesity yeah so just if and um with I 've heard the explanation around the wreath three the greater crusher to regeneration act if it was a district plan change but if it was a regeneration plan that addressed the health impacts of of these given that the research has shown you know that there 's in lower socioeconomic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlets and given that a lot of the lower social areas are the ones that we harvest an earthquake and have a lot of redevelopment going on EG mum would and possibly woolston could we what what I don 't understand is given one of the purposes of the region or the greater crash at regeneration act is the social well-being of the community and that health would obviously fur under that why we couldn 't ask for government to all the minister to do that and why you think that they would that would not be appropriate um in terms of the research from personal perspective it 's not that we don 't think that I don 't think that this is an issue I mean it 's all the research shows that clearly it is an issue what we are saying to you is we just don 't think that it 's an issue where local government has been given the tools to do something about it and we do not think that the regeneration nectars is the vehicle to do it nor do we think the resource @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know that the Act talks about extending repair improving subdividing land etc etc and you know it 's it 's our advice to you and indeed it 's the legal advice that you 've had it as well that the one that does not meet the purposes they date but to it is unlikely to meeting the necessity tests as well so we simply don 't think that that is the way or means for addressing this issue it 's not that we don 't think it 's an issue that 's just that we don 't think that that is the way for dressing so if we wanted to promote a law change or you know amendment to some pink in terms of controlling or regulating the location of fast food outlets either in lower social areas or in proximity to schools so not burning but regulating and controlling the land-use activity around those areas what what would your view be the best way to do that I think I 'd have to defer to my learned friend mr. Thompson on that one because it 's if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it 's not something that big koala fide to answer so would that be acceptable cancel yeah I mean I just I want what I 'm interested in what the solutions are to this issue but there 's always the opportunity for a local authority to promote a local bill in its area for something that it wants to see achieved there 's a process for going through a local bill we need to get a minister on and were a member of parliament to promote it through the house it goes through the normal stages I don 't think that 's really the issue though what you 're asking is asking is whether or not you could do that and I 'm sorry but I can 't give you advice off the cuff on that if you want to have further advice on it ask staff to provide that for you yeah which I think we 're going but just in terms of the district plan or the regeneration staff there 's no other mechanism we have to say actually you know can we have an order in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signage that that would be that we can do no I mean the issue with signage the district plan principal addresses those issues of community but because the purpose of the RMA is about promotional at removing the sustainable management of natural physical resources who go you can 't get to that point where you 're directing that signage would address the the effects of fast food because that is not the purpose of the RMA hmm the purpose of the RMA is about something different so we can put controls in the district plan which address for the immunity issues but not the issues that you are asking us to consider and this is a specific statutory basis for their yeah yeah Richard you are saying the RMA is about protecting resources if could we argue that our children are one of our most valuable resources and and therefore their health is of concern under the RMA again i mean i think it 's it 's not so much that we don 't consider it to be an issue ourselves it 's just that we are advice to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife for addressing that issue and our vices that it doesn 't it 's not something that would meet the purposes of the Act because the actors about the issues that we have just discussed and it 's not specifically about the safety and health of the users of those foods applies so it 's not an issue which is really addressed it does talk broadly about those issues but it but it 's not really the purpose of the yet so i think so i think that everyone 's i mean i think what you 're hearing is is that people want to do something but i I 've one don 't want to be doing something that doesn 't actually solve the problem or doesn 't lead us to mechanism for solving the problem and I can 't see our problem which is massive and getting bigger exponentially bigger all the time I can 't see it being solved by a change to our district plan so even if we do have that available to us it wouldn 't solve the problem it is of such magnitude so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a council as a leadership role where we bring together the that the sort of weight and the benefit of the experience and knowledge within the DHB and maybe it 's the University of Canterbury as well to actually come up with a but it has to be community driven because if the if you know if people are just going to continue to you know except that this is that this is not going to lead to further and further problems I I can 't see us resolving it at all and if we genuinely want regeneration then that 's not a statutory measure that 's actually changing hearts and minds and it 's actually about providing access to healthy options for for eating which don 't mean that children and their families are continuing to to to eat fast foods on a regular basis I mean I don 't know I was brought up in a family that had fish and chips on a Friday for religious reasons so but it was that was our takeaway night we didn 't have takeaways any other night of the week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have changed you 've got in my day mum didn 't work when she had young children and then when the youngest was for mum and dad swap roles so dad stayed at home there was always a parent at home to cut meals you know it 's not like that anymore so I think we have to think as a community a lot more about how we support people because poverty is not just about a lack of income it 's about a lack of hope that 's about a lack of connectedness within the community there 's a lot more that we could be doing together I heard that example of a healthy eating day we 're for a dollar every kid in that school gets a healthy a healthy lunch what about every day being a healthy eating day for families who can 't do they 're on their own that 's something that we could help leaders our city doesn 't mean that we have to pay for it it just means we need to bring together those people that are willing to help others live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people think and feel about this but a change to our district plan might make us every single one of us feel really good sitting around the table or we 've done something and it won 't change a blind thing it won 't change but about the future that is coming our way ready or not diabetes type 2 diabetes it 's entirely preventable anyway well that 's my speech so shall we move to debate we need a bit we need a mover and a seconder of the resolution yeah I mean sounds to me like the district plan it 's not aiding what we 're trying to do which is more community-led planning yeah so all these issue here Erin 's raising alcohol fast food whatever the community 's got quite strong opinions on what they want to see in their community the district plan in the RMA is not actually aiding that so the question is do we need a different type of bill or legal framework so that we can actually do the stuff that the communities want to see whether we 've got this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulatory structures we have which are not joined up yeah and which actually people can 't really engage in and and we 're left always say Oh actually we don 't have the power to do that we don 't have the power to do that and actually people expect us to be able to do that because that 's how they think democracy works yeah there 's a report being released next week which the New Zealand initiative are releasing the next one in their series of reports and I 'm going up for the for the release of that and say it is precisely about this whole question about local governance it 's about how people should be engaged in that whole process and it 's it 's completely the opposite of the top down approach that we seem to have a new zealand and it would give communities a lot more say over what happens in their local communities but while we have a structure that still bids back to the RMA then and as soon as you get them to a point where you 're outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got a judicial review on your hands and and that 's what we 're trying to avoid so I totally support what you say we do need a much better planning environment for local community if we are really to localize decision making Yanni in the moment opportunity if we thought that health was important for district planning then actually we should be looking at a strategy of political engagement with MPs and political parties over China put forward some of the things that we 've heard and I think there is a tight window of opportunity to do that I thought people thought that the regeneration would be able to actually talk with communities about what was going on in areas that we 're having redevelopment and you know it 's I mean it 's a little bit depressing to hear that you know now now that really doesn 't doesn 't work in that way it 's not fear it 's not set up for that purpose you know I I mean if you look at no that 's wrong whoa except if you look at lynnwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for fast food outlets I mean in woolston there 's rumors that have fast food outlets going right next to a preschool why you know these are areas that are being regenerated through the impact of the earthquake that 's the whole reason KFC 's gone from where it was to probably across the road so you know I I do think there 's ways that we should be asking central government to make changes and we should be able to promote at a local level phones that can help but I think the key thing is to get to look at that local bill because I mean that 's what money car did with street prostitution it does seem ironic to me that you can if you take a brothel for example you know you could argue that is less health impact of a brothel being you know in certain areas then then a fast food outlet and yet we can control a brothel but we can 't be covered by legions legend are making so a local bill but it wasn 't a local bill it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of parliament yeah sorry so but i think that there are ways through central government that would enable us to be able to have those conversations I just worry about it 's important that we work with the community but when you take things like land use planning that is a very council focus role at the moment and it 's very hard for the community to have access to experts to resources to actually participate now particularly against things like you know multinational corporations so you know I think we should work with communities around what we can do but we shouldn 't just leave the burden with them it has to be resourced properly pawling and people got questions still because otherwise I 'm just going to get a mover and a seconder of the resolution yeah so whether it 's worth looking broader than a local bill because that this is an issue that 's not just in Christchurch and whether we actually work within an MP to get a member 's bill in there entered you know the government 's asking us to make local decisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all although yeah I know but just because it might take a long time doesn 't mean it shouldn 't be one thing that we also might never happen so I mean I 'm much rather talk to central government about the issues yet and maybe the investigation report back on actions such as proposing legislative change yeah there 'll be the motion of healthy food environments yeah then if we did that then we 're not restricted to a local bill but we could talk to government we could talk about a private member 's bill just opens up the field yep pawling did you have a question your question was just following on from a breath said what it quite like an informal briefing with staff because of your very nature your planners but our communities the biggest thing that idea with resource consents and it 's not just about fast food it 's about there and misunderstanding it 's almost unhemmed stringing them now because if they don 't get a hit planner and a lawyer etc though behind the eight ball and it 's our banners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affected parties that stopped and the commissioners will recognize or whatever so the RMA now I think alienates our communities which actually should be working for so it 's that 's creating a business for lawyers planners of citroen and it 's just the way it is so I 've really liked it too to look at how we as a council perhaps can start the ball rolling looking in reversing this so it 's what the kind of citizen lid yeah the council with local schools in the wider community to car encourage and take action on local healthy food initiatives I think that 's part of part of it as well but you know I mean it 's um Vista gate and report back on actions such as they deserve I 'm just kind of want something in there about the planning environment as well so investigating port back in it on on actions such as legislative change to support a planning environment which allows the community to promote to support of planning but support a planning regime which allows the community to promote a healthy food environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a healthy food environment yep so kind of pick it up right so are there any other questions because considered as part of this I can 't even get them to fast-track the coastal hazards natural policies national policy statement side I don 't know what are you again well I mean I just sorry that was that was very don 't if you go until I say like and alg NZ and you 're talking to other political parties al yinz you know I think the other thing we should with we should be thinking about as talking with econ around the impacts because I think Tim 's right the other thing that really annoys people is these since go through non notified and have adverse effects on people and in this particular case you 've got KFC with possibly an odor so I think it would be good to work with econ around that we have talked about it having that join up consenting around you know air discharge and land use because it does him you know weird that that separated with these sorts of things yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean we are you know this is at the front end off of what is going to have to be a major community campaign this has got to have to be a movement of change it has to be because we 're up against extremely well resourced companies corporations international corporations multinational corporations who will who will take our little Council on they took on the city of New York over the sugar text and the banning of the really large the really large soda bottles yeah buckets yes yeah Michael Bloomberg got asked what he was going to do when he retired as many said he was going to lie on a smoke-free beach somewhere drinking a of diet soda yeah so um you know we 're taking on the Giants and we have to because that 's the only way that we 're going to prevent waters a tsunami of type 2 diabetes rolling our way no I need a mover in a second order just really do that um what now that second bullet point only refers to a planning regime and it is possible to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in one regime by law policy trinket planning and regulatory regime okay to support a planning and end or regulation end or regulatory regime yep no no go back go cut sorry go go back put put your yeah that 's right and go end or regulatory regulatory region and put a little dish a sight thing you know between or yeah yeah wait wait we are working with other local authorities and with local government New Zealand to look at all of the options for addressing the city national level okay so that would include yeah well its got investigation report back on on on actions such as they yeah so that enables you ready to talk to anyone yep yeah all right does somebody actually want to move this resolution Aaron seconded Yanni is there any discussion Pauline thanks me and I think that what 's come out of Tracy 's deputation and in the actions of the local school there has been wonderful for us but we we can 't do this on our own I really support what you just said Lee in the magnitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do include the university of canterbury there got a leading initiative out there on sustainability and they could be invaluable what we have to do is we don 't even know really what we 're tackling it and i like the fact that Tracy came was a definition today definition and I think that 's a piece of work that could actually lead somewhere particularly the addictive nature which may actually lead to some more greater ability to actually legislate but that 's down the track we 're at the beginning of this what a two-pronged approach we 've got a possible legislative tool eventually but we 've also got the proactive side and what we do at council here supporting community gardens and school gardens and strong communities is actually going to really help that nurse 's that but we 've got to reach out and was everybody that we can and Leanne you 've asked the community to reach out and themselves and involve everybody that they can in this it is a sea change as soon as you give up junk food if you like fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food diminishes rapidly and I think voting was the wallets is the way that we will speak loudest but I think this is an exciting beginning for us that we will lead it but we can 't do it on our own I 'll support it yeah sorry I did it it doesn 't matter about that all them and the mix Glen and then fell Mike thank you and partly to try and redeem myself from a hashed up questions of Tracy just let 's do what we can do in our built environment and this is only part of the overall equation so we we have entry points for the community we 've had them for a long time by way of aquatic centers and libraries especially are well-known in the overall kind of health weight loss equation exercise accounts for forty percent nutrition accounts for 60 we now we have fitness centers and cafes attached to our aquatic centers etc but there 's a sense in which we 're only promoting the forty percent we need to promote the 60 the nutrition so what I was trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have in the city what is stopping us actively pursuing proactively the promotion of nutrition through the cafes through whatever else is attached to these places to these places there by championing what we already have in our policy which is becoming a healthy City you know you know that d was entirely any kind of challenge from the the fast food industry so what I was trying to say about the community such as Linwood is when we do come to put something in place by way of built form it 's an all around health center doesn 't just have a gym and a few swimming pools that actually has you know the cafe through our fees and charges we can offer incentives for people to see health and nutrition as you know as a new future as opposed to that the golden arches and everything else that spring up around the place so I think there 's a lot we can do for me I think the horse has bolted over a lot of this with the district plan and all the fast food places you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do and I think we already have our own now outlets actually that that we can let them promote tell so I city support these I 'm just hoping that what we are indicating in the resolutions actually implies that in fact we want to be part of leading a nationwide campaign really around us and although we know that a straight educational approach doesn 't work people don 't really get that and what is required as a form of an awareness-raising for everybody in fact it 's essential that and that the beat that I guess the reverse of the tsunami and in fact that we really need to get stuck into this I think we also and were implying it there that we work with those already have this information it 's clearly the district health board have already done a lot of work in this area and will be working with them too so in effect I would see them as lead leading the actual work on this but that we 're asking for a working group to be set up thank you Mike thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree audiences with around them the other outlets it 's not just fast food this is a big perch no grew up in Washington both post and pre mcdonalds and but it was the dairies that we went to or if our dollar and you can buy a lot with a dollar lots and lots of sugar but I guess what we did back then is we didn 't have Playstations we didn 't have smartphone so there was a lot of physical activity which i think is also missing now from the younger kids they don 't get out and play as much so it 's a combination of lots of factors that we need to address me as a community board you know we 've got edible gardens which we 're getting into preschools and trying to educate preschoolers about actually guarding and eating healthy at that stage as well mmm all right i 'll put that motion and all those in favor say aye maps and thanks all the work on their,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Lyttelton",92hN6AtVqPQ,20161116,1346.15,"Christchurch, New Zealand",3774,"East would like to abstain from casting a vote on that submission right the next item on the agenda is the Heritage incentive grant approval for 75 cent davis street level job thanks very much to everyone would someone like to move that motion Andrew Turner seconded by Deion 's works i 'll put that motion Oh question yep yeah there sorry we 've got questions could you introduce yourselves at the end of the table sorry I thought yes I 'm Amanda ozone with senior heritage advisor and the heritage team thank you thank you I was just wondering Arden this implicit are they the owners at the time of the earthquakes yes as far as I know so it 's obviously a getting a lot of water in grease in there haven 't actually done any mitigating factors to stop that ingress and it 's cause deterioration I think they 've done what they can but due to the extensive damage to the building there 's only so much you can do with preventing water getting in as a temporary measure so one of the things when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repair of 631 thousand dollars to this place which obviously going I think 6.1 says these additions they 're going to be done at the same time and I 've already been settled about 170,000 for the repairs to the stone villa we don 't get the full report of what all this money the 630 thousands going to consider can you know with the additions and alterations so if we had a look at that hundred seventy 1000 which says is for the stone villa and actually took that off the repair to the heritage stuff it actually reduces the cost quite a lot because I don 't think that we should be paying for the full amount when I love this actual peut or the work sport alterations in addition well yeah I 'm sorry the report report it was confusing in that respect I think it 's clearer once you translate paragraph 5.2 and you you go into the table at 6.4 what 6.4 sits out as the total cost of conservation and restoration works as 304 eight to nine so that 's that 's the figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allocating a percentage show so we don 't deduct the actual insurance settlement that I 've received because I 've received 170 thousand dollars an insurance settlement mm-hmm yeah so to me that they 've received a settlement and I don 't think that they should be spending that settlement on alterations and additions to a proper they should be sitting it 's been that settlement on the insurance s the actual fiction of the place the historical areas all at first well what we want we normally do with these dancers we do we do obviously we take into account the insurance and this this is a classic example I suppose of people being underinsured and their total insurance payment is is 170,000 and that includes eqc the total repair bill for the building is about 600,000 so the figure that that we we then base our grant on is the gap so we then refund proportion of that gap in this case they 've also separated out the amount of the works that relate to heritage and the amounts that they 're putting in as in it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know new bathrooms and things like that which are obviously not heritage they 're required to facilitate the use of the building what we don 't we don 't tend to form that component so the the gram covers a nun is aimed at preserving those items of the heritage building which could easily be lost in any redevelopment of the building and that is particularly the stone facade so there is a there 's a focus on on retaining the stone stone work of the facade and its its prominence to the street so we we don 't think that this is a this is a grant that 's you know proportionally out of sync with anything else that we 've done in the past up to this point it 's a these are the kind of buildings that they they are more expensive to repair and they they 're the ones that give you that that sense of identity and uniqueness so sorry I didn 't catch the earlier question oh you know I understand that it 's more around the fact that they 've actually been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me that settlements going to go on a lot of alterations and additions not on the actual repair for the earthquake yeah and we have to ever so to me they should be using this insurance settlement which is now obviously understood as you 've said for the work on the Heritage estic first and therefore we could reduce how much the council 's pain for here are aspects of it yeah there 's different ways of looking at it but we we look at it as a complete package of works that are necessary to get that building reoccupied and reused but at the same time we 're allowing these people to put a new fittings like new bathrooms and stuff we 're not using their insurance payout for the actual here but we 're not I said we 're not we 're not much looting we 're not including that we only pay them a percentage of the the component which our heritage fabric no I am I understand that is where I think the money should go from what they 've been insured paid up yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is we have had insurance issues in the past where people have bought buildings as is where isn 't has been no insurance and somebody 's walked off with the insurance hear the actual owner is sticking with the building and they are putting their entire insurance payout into the building it 's just it was insufficient to do the works that they 're really needing to do to make this this place that somebody could either rent out or live in so yeah hopefully that answers your question any other questions I 'm Jamie just wondering can you put I 'm not sure if the policy allows us to do this or not but can you put a condition as that they actually trim the trees because I kind of think this is a beautiful building but what 's the point in time was money if you can 't see it yeah the only thing I could say there is probably in it the maintenance has slipped over the last few years I can 't imagine that that hedge was was ever normally that high that landscape we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aliens Nathan no not really but it 's in their own interests in terms of getting light into the building and views out that they will I 'm sure they will trim the hedge you would think so yeah it would just be disappointing if we 've got public money going into that and then though yeah and then we cut you can 't actually see the facade yes I 'd imagine that just it 's just got out of hand all right I 'll go around with a prune or I don 't thank you tell me what kind of following on from Jamie 's Christian if we are giving in paying surely we can put conditions and that enhance what we 're paying for because I find it ridiculous that we can 't for the condition of it I mean obviously we have to have a balance with regards to its the property but inside it we are investing money they are getting a rebuilt heritage building and a toilet it 's loving everything but the mass base i would say that to trim the hedge so there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street to show off this historic building would be a fear and condition I realize it 's overgrown in it but there will be others that may have this issue but I find it odd that we can 't reveal we couldn 't put a condition like that and because we are paying the money there for a mob sense well we pay the money and this is one of the conditions now if they don 't like it here we can negotiate height at all that type of thing but I totally agree with Jamie and and there is there is a solution to and that 's to put a clause in the covenant which we hopefully will be able to do just saying that you need to retain the visual link between the roadway and and the facade but would we put the condition and prior to pipe agreeing the money because as soon as we pay the money and grito is if they don 't want to put I can agreed for the condition to read the second one that the payment of the ground is subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the sign covenants having the council seal affixed rifle registration against the property title so you 're saying that we could add to the it yeah you could put in a recommendation that that there is a clause in the covenant which clarifies the requirement to maintain the landscaping between between the front of the building and the roadway I don 't want to obviously it needs to be carrying carefully worded so that you don 't dictate how they use the rest of the site but just that prominence so can we just hit some quick words there and just use it put the put at the end of that on Oh puddin number three delegate to two so we could delegate to stuff because stuff and come in with just a poor there but I think we 're all on the same page with it and bring the night I tell you that you probably agree with me there as well that I you know that we we want to preserve heritage but the most important thing is that once it 's preserved that people can appreciate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave it to you guys but you 've heard from the council that we want that included that there 's a line of sight connection from the public realm do the Builder do somewhat maintaining visibility of the bodice then the railway no it 's not to maintain landscaping is it that 's a visibility it 's to make same visibility of the facade not surface I because you know and i think that captures as well you know they don 't we change or something you know down which doesn 't to make maintain visual look to a visibility government of the facade yeah we could maybe qualify with stone work force ours from the front of the building because that 's where that 's where the uniqueness of this bill visibility up the stonework yeah the stonework and it was a dying so sad over ground is that sounds no from the street from the street yeah 3 you lien can the cloak to us the peps and future that you guys be that in mind just that there is probably a desired from the council to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where there may be potential to not have that line of sight the wizard some of it here I mean first to look at in a more strategic sense as well great thanks yeah because the the whole point of a you know public contribution is that there is a public benefit I mean I know that when I went to the Christchurch club when it riri established they were they were very complimentary about the nature of the grant but the quid pro quo was that they have open days where the public come and enjoy yeah the facility yep in along those lines will he be a plaque on the outside of the building so that people who are walking paths can get some sense of the history of the place and some information we don 't we don 't specifically put plaques on like that heritage New Zealand do just I suppose there 's probably better ways of doing it in terms of the technology these days available to have some sort of link that somebody can check and find some history of the building uh yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it 's a really good point no one 's no one 's raised that before and the time that I 've been here I I like the idea I mean I 've been to other places we have got a little little flat where it says the legend and yeah and and I always take photographs of it along with the I was just going to UM so to the counselors that we 've hit a discussion with huge New Zealand who acknowledge that and in effect we were in a similar position that as a result of the past six years there is a lot of information that enables a range of stories to be told around the heritage of the city and so we 've had an initial discussion with heritage New Zealand about how we might collaborate in a network and so perhaps we can have that conversation and maybe brief you um probably after Christmas your nose know about we are going to locate it for good I talked about that being a long-term project that we both um both organizations work on yeah out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good situation cuz over in England you 're wandering around and you know we can hit lengths and eliciting thing but it 's actually quite nice to have suddenly kind of been outside a house and it 's got a plaque so that 's legend etc I think it would be a really and then we 've got some cool history and it 's not all kind of part lot old history in the sense of you know we 've got the love expensive hours but you know if there 's a place where they actually did things as an it was a base I mean why not celebrate it you know and i think you know having a hero to trailing could be quite a good you know tourist yeah all right okay well I 'm i 'll put the resolution this is any discussion Mike I can 't support this now i understand it comes from a fund and this obvious substantial amount of that that fund to me there 's just too many questions around the the insurance side of it and we 're they 're actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ md value of the the place because obviously they were under underinsured so I can 't support this Andrew I would draw councillors attention to the value of this building as a as a really good example of this type of heritage in Littleton possibly as a unique example of this type of building draw council 's attention particularly two clauses four point three point one and claws 6.1 which refer to the unique heritage value of the building I also think it 's important to know that whilst building might have heritage values the future use of that building is a very important part of the maintenance of those heritage values so I appreciate the comments that have been made around the overall budget and what that over or budget might be used for but we 've got in the report a list of the Heritage items that we 're funding and it 's fifty percent of the the funding gap that we we are funding I would urge counselors to think of the future use of this building as a part of the preservation of its heritage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andrew oh sorry you are Aaron or you call me madam me Oh as my punishment all right Thank You Metta me um I should prefer I can call you missed him here but that would be completely different debate and shown any signs at this point be highly challenging for me to respond yes um I the idea of the debate that we have around these is if someone holds a strong view they try and convince other councillors to vote in the way of their view now Mike 's made a or counselor Davidson has made a strong argument around the insurance settlement and I for one would like more info around that and would be inclined to light will request that this lay on the table until the next meeting until we can alleviate the points that he 's brought up because we are mean to be prudent stewards with the city 's money and this is part of that money and i don 't know if i don 't think the building 's going anywhere in a hurry would that be an issue or is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't be in order to ask a question during the debate but well he spoke after the so he could oh I know if anyone else was convinced by mikes point but that Mike 's background for the last few years has been working in their insurance field around earthquake places so if he speaks up on that issue I 've been plying to listen well so I 'd like to move in amendment yet that we lay it on the table till the next meeting and we get the information around there and then if we 're convinced otherwise we vote for it if we 're not we may never vote for it and do okay do I have a seconder for that right all right so you want to enter the debate now okay Danny old this year where 's four arms as well it 's been right about something outreach efforts to the new facet leave a comment I think I understand so I know other people happy to support their address within my pond on that basis of good ideas about the new cancers in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right well Jamie 's yeah I think it 's fair for me to speak to us briefly if I 'm going to vote against it I hear and appreciate what might concede and which so what aaron has said in to be perfectly frank there 's not any any part of their argument that I disagree with but I think if I 've learned anything through my time at counselors that sometimes you 've got to look past at the initial niggles and take a high level view on matters and the high level view for me is at the end of the day does this building have significance does this building warrant a grant for it to be saved at the end of the day my vote is yes I think that there is historic significance in this building I think that there is cultural and community benefit from this building being retained and the question for me is do i or do I not want to see this building retained and the answer for me as yes so i 'll be voting against the amendment on that basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we don 't have a lot of heritage left but I think what we do have we need to we need to protect and we have a fund for this very purpose and it most certainly qualifies for it so also don 't disagree with the argument and I appreciate the points that have been made I think from from a high level perspective the retention of building is like this and the historic value is important for Christchurch thank you and very briefly because of course when I spoke the amendment hadn 't been signaled my belief is that we need to look at this through the purpose of the fund which is to preserve the heritage I think we need to respect the fact that the owners are committed to this building and therefore they are there they 're applying for the this fund and they 've this grounds and they 've worked with our staff to achieve this they haven 't done what some other owners are difficult to repair and restore heritage buildings have done and take the insurance money and go off elsewhere leaving a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so on the basis that I think we need to be sending a strong signal that we want to be preserving the remaining heritage that we 've got left in the city and particularly something as unique as this I 'm not in favor of the amendment would be against up all right i 'll put them on the same basis you can speak to the amigos um I 'll put the amendment all those in favor say aye those opposed say no no that 's lost people comfortable or do you want to record those who voted how people well that 's what it sounded like to me alright so against okay that again holidays against for Hanson each camp the temperature for together cancel the chain oh for for that amendment in 13 weeks all right that is lost oh I 'll put thee I 'll put the resolution and i 'll put the resolution all those in favor say aye those opposed say no and mike davidson record oppose vote right","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

and their feel it feels therefore appropriate that I ask all councillors and and our visitors here to stand while we observe a minute 's silence and respect thank you very much oh I would also like to invite dave edamame who is the controller at the moment to peps come forward and and provide us with an update on the situation thank you d thank you very much um I think most of the cuts are where we 've got a control center set up down in the function room at this point in times probably 30 people working at the moment but the mere 2 cleared a regional disaster and signed off on behalf of the region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a center principally 12 hours but we 've it 's been occupying around about a hundred staff but one of the big tasks we did have was looking after the evacuees that came in fear ship yesterday and so basically arrangement through obviously red bus go bus very good coordination to give the people and their luggage and they seem to have a lot of luggage and dogs and other things to appropriate accommodation arranged accommodations and at fairly short notice so that went I think most of you will have seen something in the paper today is gone very well but I must submit it 's a coordination of not only our staff but a huge amount of volunteers a huge amount of companies a lot of logistics are pulling the whole thing together and the feedback I 've had to date and I muscle that I came through the Horncastle this morning it looked it actually looked like and it reminds me the comment you made about the Town Hall look like someone 's sitting room it was actually quite comfortable when people seem to be quite relaxed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had most people cleaning up to give you an idea of numbers 449 came up on the boat and of those we estimate 300 of God would travel we have we put 165 into Island into the University which went really well and we put another 65 and dispenser park and the reason we went to those two facilities is that we could get a bulk of facilities at close proximity we knew we could house pets we knew we could house families together and certainly at times you don 't want children over here or mum and dad have them to split up and things like that so that worked pretty well we did have good support from in fact basically Foreign Affairs and embassies because the majority of the people were tourism and I would have said fifty percent of them would have been overseas nationalists so very very good coordination between those people on what do you call them interpretation services and things are there we have closed form castle everyone has moved from there we thought there may be a second ship coming in but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Curie 's will come through the the flying out or will be brought out by truck or bus or whatever probably on Saturday so we may have to look at the logistics of doing something for them when they message so um yeah just a quick update on other things we have 50 other people were out on site elsewhere doing things quite the majority of them been in Kaikoura including building inspection staff operations staff engineers that sort of thing we 've got quite a number up supporting her annoying at the moment as well and we are just looking at roster ships we are moving into the sick and roster shift for building inspectors we 're just waiting for some information or whether they want a sick and roster shift for operations staff and i 'm hoping to get that clarified today because our team come off friday so they 'll be back here probably five o 'clock friday but we have to know whether they want another team to go in and take their place so it 's really what we 're working are happy to answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks out to staff worked incredibly well I want to put out a big thanks to the organization for supporting the people in doing that a huge number of volunteers that really I had volunteers arriving home kastle this morning what can we do what can we do what can we do and a middle him a lot of that came through we did go to organizations that had organized volunteers rather than us tried to organize volunteers so we went to the lights of the student army the Red Cross and those sort of people our trained civil defense some volunteers because they came organized had a hierarchy of structure and things like that so that that we 're quite well want to thank V basis they did a very good job they pulled down from a big conference at very short notice and they 'll being able to set up for a kid 's Christmas party which i think is happening today so we slotted into a little get that they had there but they they did a great job for us Airport Judy monitors we help people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get them there just in time for the airport connections and the airport put on specific judy managers to help manage them as they came in one of the problems was coordinating their luggage really the almost luggage arrived at the airport at the same time the plane was leaving but they coordinated as far as i know we sort of got rid of some of the logistics about that people hate flying without their luggage as you can appreciate really want to thank the accommodation police 's making themselves available so we will get a big list out probably next week and then call those groups yes quad core is going to go for a few weeks months you know it 's it 's a big event small community we will be in the support background but I 'm hoping we will probably wind that down a little bit from next week the declaration I think goes till Monday so whether another declaration happens or it will well no it probably will they happen locally whether it happens at a regional level that decisions still to be made thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a comment no just essentially I think I also like to thank staff who have gone above and beyond working very long hours and but really been very supportive in terms of volunteering and offering these support and expertise and as we say we 've got about fifty seven people up in Kaikoura at the moment and you know another 50 to 100 in our Emergency Operations Center here it 's gone incredibly smoothly from our engine terms of working and support and this I think since you 've been to the people who have volunteered to support this but also the people when the rest of the organization have support you know the gaps when people have moved up to kaikoura an ongoing work and i think that the logistics been very complex working really well with our regional colleagues both neighboring TLAs and also it can who operate the regional approach to this as well i think that 's a very good point that regional liaison between you know basically the council 's that are impacted and then the ones and support has worked very well under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best part of the organization collectively is to do whatever tasks needs to be done hmmm i was going to comment that the high commissioner from the ua tweeted this morning with some photographs at the wan castell arena a very good organization by Canterbury Emergency Management and Christchurch City Council precessing tourists at Horncastle arena and I was at the singularity University summit for the last two and a half days and it was unbelievable how quickly they were able to transform a conference venue and to a reception center for the evacuees from it 's just amazing so I think there does need to be you know credit where credit is due but the element of your report that I just wanted to comment on was the fact that you listed the organizations that you went to for assistance and included amongst those was the student volunteer army which didn 't exist it at the time of our didn 't exist at the time of our earthquakes and in fact was created out of the fact that they weren 't an organized volunteer trained you know set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they just you know sort of clipped into into role and got those pools of residents prepared and assisted with the luggage as I understand as well and we 're just extraordinary so it and it just shows where we 've come to as a city that from our experience we 've created or the community itself has generated its own capacity to respond to people in need and I think that is going to be one of the most powerful legacies of our experience so thank you very much and and one of the things i had the student army the luggage was one of the logistics it fell into the place at the last moment to get how are we going to get it off because they were going to drive trucks on its going to happen at five o 'clock in the morning people don 't want to write one and sit around for four hours for their luggage and the student army we only contacted them about ten o 'clock said can we pick you up in a bus get you to the pork nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could use for manual labor so if they hadn 't volunteered I was going to bring you answer is out yes so that that was good and the flexibility and nothing seemed to be a problem okay thank you thank you very much is it well just wanted to pass on obviously gratitude for what you and the organization that 's been doing I 'm the only thing I just wonder if you could just maybe give a very brief comment there has been some reports in the media around things like shortages of food possibly but can you just give a kind of brief view on in terms of freight coming into Christchurch sorry Adam yani that 's a regional question kept when we can we this was a briefing on our local interaction with the regional response this is to do with kaikoura itself so I mean this is this is our it was just an update on what 's happened here in crash edge right so if we could just leave that take that offline we can get those answers for you from the regional emergency Coordination Center thanks very much,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"
NZ,NZ,Christchurch City Council,Christchurch City Council,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZETwErnCvvgbvBbnnHfyxA,10.11.2016 - Christchurch City Council Meeting,oKEMA0VLVT0,20161109,4680.51,"Christchurch, New Zealand",9899,because it happens within council jurisdiction and I think real of all of the understanding that the council takes an interest and the protection of community values it also presents unique responsibilities for the council excuse me because the industry and its jobs create a demand for compliance checking ensuring that all dogs are registered which is already a duty of the council as of utmost importance we would like the council to one start seeking weekly and jury reports this is a common practice in America not that that 's probably a place you want to meet you right now and insist on a list of microchip numbers of the dogs racing each week the christchurch greyhound racing club will be required to present this information to animal control as a way of assisting the council and meeting its requirements of enforcing dog registration perhaps a by law requiring the club to comply with ensure that this happen in closing I 'd like to put to the council some food for thought a subculture that trains the world 's fastest dogs to chase things cannot be regarded as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty to place those same dogs into urban communities and retirement thanks for your time we 've got a couple of minutes of does anyone have any questions ref hi there are there any implications from the recent rulings in Australia implications from the overturn the New South Wales are for the dogs and the New South Wales well I think I don 't have I wasn 't prepared for questions so I don 't have a lot of information with me to answer a lot um but what I do know is that there is varying feelings on that recent tune of the law some considerate to be wrong doing for the dogs some consider that it could actually end up being good in the long run and the long-term prospects for the animals and that it would require more from the Breeders pulling I know that we have rehome the greyhound here Christ you or New Zealand but do you think that they take all the animals or do you know what happens to animals if they don 't go there and they 're past their use-by date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year we do know that from steps that have been taken from just last year alone but six hundred dogs approximately 600 dogs have gone unaccounted for and so they have they 've taken the statistics of the animals that have been breed and the animals that have been registered to breeders and then those going into rehoming programs and there are 600 dogs presently unaccounted for well thank you very much that 's some zip need considerable food for thought thank you very much Thank You education I 'll come back and collect it later on yeah I 'm just not sure what get get can you can you just have to leave a petition form you could take the clipboard and and thin individual counselors that want to sign it well we can we can send it back to you it has to be and it 's actually being presented to Parliament on Wednesday so in order for me to get it up there I probably have to send it up on Saturdays it possible that I could pick it up later on today yeah sure yep yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay MPs somebody can let you know we 've got your phone number so it can give you a ring with us when it 's available thank you now we move on to deputations by appointment and we had Tracy charnock who has presented before on the item on the agenda item number seven options for addressing fast food retail outlets I 've shared with her our approach that we intend to take with that and so she 's going to come back next week and present at the beginning of the meeting next week so thank you for that and now you 're definitely on the agenda so you 're well intruded here item number four is presentation of petitions and there are no presentation of petitions at this meeting then we have item number five the report from T horn on our council papa te Runanga committee with a revised draft relationship agreement between the Christchurch City Council and now property for ruining our the I 'm simply going to provide for the report to lie on the table until a future council meeting to allow all representatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the papa te Runanga is not available today and so we do want to progress this and so we are going to work very closely with the chairs and see how we can bring that item forward I personally would like to see it result before Christmas so that we can start the new year with the agreement signed the next item is the report from Memphis structure transport and Environment Committee the infrastructure design standard 2016 and Dave are you coming to the table for that the infrastructure design standard is that you yep there 's two David 's and David and ends at the other david sorry of what i 've been doing at the beginning of these meetings because we 've got because we 've got new counselors we 're just asking that people introduce themselves at the end of the table so that so they 're all councillors know who we 're meeting with so morning on Dave Adamson I 'm the general manager of city services along David Guth way I work in David 's team and I 'm the strategic asset planning manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an overview of the infrastructure design standards and what they 're for so infrastructure design standards are primarily directed at people that develop new horizontal infrastructure so the best thing to do in your minds is to think of new subdivisions and developments so that 's to do with roads sewer water pipelines etc so what we like to do is that we like to have those developments done to a particular standard the best standard that we know of because what we do is we inherent inherit those bits of infrastructure so the developer develop tourism we then take them on they become part of council assets so why you like them to be in a good state because at the end of the day the ratepayer then pays for the ongoing maintenance associated with those assets so what our infrastructure strategy does it gives the guidance and standards to the consulting engineers and contractors is what we require of them and that goes out with a consent notice for the conforth at subdivision to be able to be developed and the consent notice makes reference to the infrastructure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ update the standard because life changes new designs come in new materials come on to the market and if we take the instance we had recently of new technology going in the ground was the vacuum pump wastewater systems that were being implanted those previously would referenced in the old infrastructure design standard and they now get incorporated into the new one what we like to do then what we like to do what we required to do is come back to council on a regular basis give their notice of updated standards that we would like it then to be adopted by council that we can then make reference to the new standard in the new consent that are given out for construction absurd it 's fine I 'm so would you like to move that I move the recommendations and seconded by Tim all right our Pauline thing yani us so these are design standards if they previously been signed off by council and now you wrapped up the steering group to hit the delegation to sign them off and you 'll report back to council on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's the main difference now you want the delegation to the steering group interested my understanding is that they were originally developed and about the first lot 1 2010 before the earthquake in there were changed rapidly after the earthquake as new technology evolved ever since so why we 've got on our website a version 2015 i think they are we are wanting council to sign them off now to be integrated in sign off a process it would be fair to say every week we would get applications for new products new ways you know there 's an amazing range of new HTTP nine holes out there that will just save sorry outside high-density polyethylene manholes out there that will say a phenomenal amount of time maintenance a wide range of sorts of things so those are the sorts of things that we are getting in to put in there so that we can do it and then bring them back and just get all those changes so that you as counselors on a regular basis know what those new if you 're interested what those new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our website so they are publicly available and so that any designer doing anything can use the latest technologies so you don 't see any risk as elected members and us not having oversight in the first place but the steering group having a delegation to do that the biggest area reviewer and put it at a governance level is when you do a resource consent and you will say that it needs and I 'll make something up here to footpaths down each side and it needs you know street lighting that keeps the night sky clear and all the rest of it then they will go away and say well how do I make two footpaths down oh okay they have to be 1.2 meters wide and all the rest of it so we 're providing the recipe book you 're providing the recipe almost and so that they then mix so these are very technical ways that people can apply them to deliver the outcomes that you 've done it a governance level when you apply any of those consents or um approve any of those major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think it 'd be useful or helpful if you could just give a brief explanation as to arm skirts involvement in these design standards given that they don 't capture skirt repairs so obviously there 's been some concern in the community around the lower level of standards of some of the repairs and this document is sitting you know I guess a high level a higher standard of things that we want for the city so can you just explain a little bit about that that difference in standards the majority of spirit work will comply with these standards particularly the big infrastructure projects are doing however at the end of the skirt program to actually meet the requirements of the legislation there was an agreement that we would go in and do repairs of infrastructure that would fail in the next five years as part of the joint funding between ourselves and government now this doesn 't talk about these standards are for new infrastructure they don 't cover repairs so there were separate standards delivered and develop between ourselves the crown and skirt to deliver the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was these keys don 't really cover like I say the kind of small repair here and smaller appear here small appear there they are more designed for when square replaces a wide range so they will apply them where we have a total replacement they will be absolutely applicable and so the majority of the works get has done will have fully complied with these standards and one of the things I would say is a lot of the upgrades of this are some of the solutions that they have innovatively through skirt designed got approval form and end up being applied in the network so I just I was really really clear though that approving these today is not reducing the standards that we already have in place because have found a way to do something cheaper and less than what we actually would want as a City Hall of school work is fully designed and it 's at construction and so basically we these standards lift the standard of what we 're applying it lifts the environmental standards that lifts the performance for ratepayers it 's got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the play both probably definitely work best national practice but it will bring lot of best international practice too so I think you 'll find that these are probably as leading edges everywhere as anywhere in the country of the matter did I hear you correctly and saying that some of the standards that have been written unto this we 're actually utilized by scared and delivering a new way of delivering things that were never covered by standard so we 've actually we 're adopting standards that brings in this new practice through different systems that have been developed by by scared a very good example would be scared of put in a number of five glass manholes throughout the network and I happen to be at a conference and they had all these photos saying that looks as best practice showing the rest of the country this is all that 's impressing this is over let 's Christchurch and that 's Christchurch and that 's Christchurch and that 's Christchurch and so it was quite amazed how well that 's proven it 's good technology we have applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we did give you a list of 50 or 60 different changes that have happened in the standard since the last ones were adopted those successful solutions have been incorporating to the standard so it doesn 't mean that people must put in the five Wales manhole a concrete manhole will do however we are saying that if you want to put in a fiberglass one in certain places it would be a better solution a cheaper solution and a longer lasting solution for us I think picking up on just the other point that you animators do you think that we should consider whether base design standards should should be more applicable to renewals and to repairs the real issue that you 've got is a renewal and repair sometimes a bit of a bespoke solution depending on what 's been there in the past you know a good example would be we can reseal after a certain number of reseals however we need to rip and relay and so you depends on what the depth of reseals that you put on there depends on what mix of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes you 'll get bleeding through it so it 's quite hard to say one now you will find there 's new zealand standards that cover renewals for example of pavements there 's new zealand standards that talk about realigning of sewer pipes as new zealand standards and we learning utilize the latest standard in that appropriate area and that 's really what gets tied into our construction documents so if we were going to do something we would have another sweet i would say and not an ID yes i don 't know what we call it we call it the repair you know design standards which would then document all of those documents probably that we use and that other side of it so to be a separate document but we do you actually have a good practice guidelines on that and thinking very much of it because I must have met that sometimes these technical reports can be a little bit challenging but I think you 've really helped certainly may understand all of the detail yeah Glenn thank you just a couple of quick questions here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subdivisions so if we 're considering say bit way street which is going to be rebuilt these won 't apply there no so that its new i gave the new subdivisions as an example yeah yeah so effectively as a new infrastructure that would actually go in that you inherit or we design or put in ourselves that we have to then look after so this will apply the user rebuild if we 're rebuilding a standard the same standards really apply we will reference a pavement strength than these documents and that will be the pavement strength that we will do and then when you you know the the solution will be different because like I said it 's a recipe book it 's not actually saying you know take shelf one and that 's the answer to all your problems it 's not quite as simple as that but we will be using the same underlying technical references whether it be a repair or whatever in the delegation what changed the consultation process with the residents yeah and I like didn 't know you 're going to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole of life costs would be lower moving to these standards yes so the idea is that we 're constantly raising the bar through these standards as we bring them through on a year-by-year basis so we were learning we as we see examples both nationally and internationally of better practice so their idea is that we on an annual basis one biennially update our our standards to implement better practice into the community quite a good example would be speed lighting and we 've had a significant change in these documents around street lighting but I want to go out and just have a look our effective LED lighting was and basically I got reference to all the new subdivisions around town not any the old part of town you know we have a little odd part where we 've replaced some of the old systems but if you want to see some good effective LED lighting you 're pretty much go to the new subdivisions because that 's where it 's been installed in its been installed to a reasonable extinct you know I could take you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know six or eight or whatever but if you want to see whole streets of it that 's a good example and that gives us a lot better lifetime costs far better energy efficiency and so they have been applied effectively already really very good Erin did you I 'm just did it apply to trace that we don 't plant large growing trees under power lines and also if we have a major in your land a street with heritage trees let 's pick Sabine streets and Albans that we would underground the wiring just in those streets to protect the trees yes obviously not all strengths that 's silly so there is a whole section on trees and what their classifies inappropriate trees so the idea is that as a subdivision plane comes back they would have actually made use in reference those if they 're wanting something different they have to motivate for it in their consent application as to why they would want to change and and then the ideas that winced when the subdivision is approved and signed off then our obvious go out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consent stage or actually the trees that are in the ground and have been planted you 'd have to recognize though the subdivision standards don 't allow overpower overhead power line so basically everything is underground and new subdivisions so existing parts is a little bit more tricky because basically it depends you know if you 're only doing the pavement in actual fact there 's no reason why you would apply the rest of the standard because you 're only doing a part of a contractor so it depends on a horse for a course really and so new subdivisions won 't have overhead services really any more thing of the past yeah and the reason I asked is because we don 't have a tree policy yet so it 'd just be which one comes first the the the tree policy or this one which one would override only for the renewals are those major tree streets which aren 't that often you 'll find in the IDS there is a tree policy in there and as if you have a look a good example would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were looking at the size of the trees as part of the revamp and you 'll see the site that the the plans that you sign off actually have each tree species to find what we 're taking out what we 're putting in one of them Victoria Street was a good example because we did get a lot of feedback about the deciduous trees and we 've got a lot of feedback about stormwater problems with them but we also been people recognize if you don 't have deciduous trees you then also have an icing problem which is a health and safety problem so whatever you do is a trade off from somewhere if you want trees and the street and it 's a balance but we do get specialists like that part of of the of the guidelines yes of all the streets you could have used an example but I we won 't go there yeah um so that 's been moved and seconded I 'll put that motion Yanni yeah and um I appreciate that you know we 've gotten our dynamic process to up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it I think it 'd be really good to breathe the community boards because many of the local issues around new subdivisions only having foot piles on one side of the road or you 've got you 've got areas where say the lighting for example some of the glare from the new LED lights has been problematic so it 'd be really good for the local community boards as well to understand you know if there are issues that need to be addressed through that how we can do that I think the other thing for me is that I mean I am concerned I appreciate that there 's some new innovation that skirt are doing but I am concerned that the repair standards don 't match these standards because I can 't see why would be spending money doing for new things and then spending money having things that are repaired that aren 't repaired to a new standard and you know if you take things like ash faltering of Cola sex or places that had a sh felt that now get chip seal but if it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away with that so I think we do need to think about just having a clear mechanism to align the standards I don 't know if it has to be a separate document but there should be something that explains to the community why they getting standards like petrified streets for example rather than the infrastructure design standard streets that we expect others to do so you know I know there 's a lot of work that 's gone into this um there 's a number of things that you 've said through my questions that are not appropriate to race through here the number of traffic lights on intersections on for example or off-road cycleways along state highways those are things that I 'll pursue through other means but I do think you know if some of the conversation we 've had today it is these are really this is a really important document for how the city looks and feels and it 's something that public should hopefully have some greater understanding of through our local democratic processes because it actually does make a huge difference to people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it 's not done well we get lots of issues of concern like the Nova subdivision and you haven 't touched it or not but I know you 've mentioned to me that you think these new changes will provide greater safety assessments at the start of a subdivision project rather than at the end where should lead to better safety outcomes and community outcomes and hopefully that 's one of the legacies of the noble subdivision which was very contentious so it 's good to see that you 're learning and putting into practice these new new ways of doing things that will improve the outcomes and I 'm quite happy to take that on board that we will go around the community boards and I think probably David and need one of the two people that should do that and as soon as you approve them they are ready to go up online the existing infrastructure design standards are online so that our available public document will replace those ones with these ones and I just don 't have a timetable for that but hopefully they don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so as soon as they 're up online then it would be a good time to go on to looking into boards about what 's in them and then anyone who 's got a spear five or six days could read through them haha pic I fell well I think it 's good we 've had this discussion I guess the previous that he can might agree so learn to love this by osmosis and it 's it 's good seeing the report and dave has reiterated and in fact this information we sign it off will be up on the website for people to see and I think that distinction between new work and repaired work is really important for us and so that 's perhaps another area where we need to consolidate and have some information so there 's clarity around these things so I think that it 's a good report and I think it 's been important though for all councillors and for the info elected members with the boards that in fact we are across us so thank you for the report and work okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say aye as opposed they know that 's carried well I have seven options for addressing fast food retail outlets now we had a good discussion about this because what we realized is that receiving this report and public when the previous staff report was dealt with in public excluded because it included a legal opinion as an attachment it actually created a vacuum in terms of the information that was available publicly in order to debate these issues and that 's why I asked Traci if she would come back next week so the resolution that I would like us to consider today is that we release from public excluded the staff report considered at the twenty-second of September meeting excluding the legal opinion so that still protects the legal privilege that sits there on the options for addressing fast food retail outlets and then leave this item July on the table to be reconsidered at the council meeting scheduled to be held on the seventeenth of november and i might actually add some words which is alongside any additional recommendations that may assist progressing thus the progressing list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could do as a city but it 's not something that the council can do alone it absolutely needs the joined up approach of the Ministry of Education and the depend the DHB and what between the three of us I think that we could make some incredible progress in terms of leadership in this area but if people are generally happy with that as somebody happy to move that motion yani second does Erin any discussion I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much appointment of a proxy for annual general meetings of crashes to the holdings limited and Christchurch Development Corporation holdings limited and we 've had the offer from Andrew Turner who has held this responsibility in the past and I 'm pleased to have held the responsibility in the past but I 've got to UM now let you know that my often needs to be rescinded because I 'm not available for the CC HL meeting on the friday due to another engagement so whilst I would have been happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do it who 's available referee you available on friday for the UM friday the twenty first visit and it 's in the morning i think is it or is it the afternoon is in the afternoon yep so councillor ref Minji and you 'll still you 're available for the CDC HL yes meeting ok and do we need to put an auto ok for a little just in case and who did we have as an alternate that another i can 't i 'm a derivative cch oh I could be an option at the CDC if you want but that Paul Monroe 's been put down as an alternate for nice that 's fine see dchl well what about Davis or anyone someone that 's not a curry aren 't you on the board no our CC HIV was neg negative 6 th 0 so I 'm alternate councillor David east on CC HL are we happy with Paul Monroe being the alternate on CD CHL yep alright with someone like to move that term second Dion I 'll put that motion all those in favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you our performance report for the three months of 30th of September 2016 others would normally go to stratagem finance but as coming directly to council as we haven 't established our committees ute Dame would you like to come to the table is there anyone else that Peters the way it should be there to provide support for the grilling that she 's about to receive your your support from the sidelines it 's a sort of support there bet you need Diane you 've been hung out to dry that 's okay okay are there any questions Yanni in particular on the roads and footpaths I was keen to know it says here that we 're benchmarking it and we 're using the 15-16 benchmark rather than the 14-15 so I was keen I was keen to know why we 're using why we were using the more recent benchmark rather than one before it 's given yet it 's on now and I 'm part of Peter God 16 so to answer your question Yanni the changes are mainly Corrections or tardy ups and they 'll always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the previous year we could we put the corruptions through you 'll notice a lot of them are either making it tighter or reflecting the change in housing or tidying up be based wants to reflect their statement of intent as regards why we 've used the benchmark I 'm sorry accountants that I would have to ask Dave to answer that please coronary painless be advised once the beach one in 60 what we are advising now is we are going to the plus set and put in the biggest is only baseline of your mouth off is a pretty box so we didn 't have a target on the air now based on without putting r great we 're putting in a target we 're told that we didn 't meet it in 1415 so we must have had a number of complaints in 1415 why aren 't we using that as the benchmark for the five percent reduction rather than using the 1516 one which again didn 't meet the five percent reduction and complaints so what seems to have happened with roads and footpaths with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're using the highest number of complaints as the benchmark to reduce from rather than going back to what the original year was in 1415 I suppose we a realistic we no way the present plans party activity management plan obviously we 've got no six months I suppose of scoop doing summer of years and then we are still doing a lot of our load the structure appears screwed anyway so what we say is we have had an acceleration of this we could actually set a timer based on your level nothing the essences is that part receiver adduction reveal a year and we are as it is coming the first up from the baseline privacy over time for ten years ago is actually measure sleeping rubbish and litter collection too agreed standards so we 're not meeting the greatest agreed standards because we 're failing in that performance report it 's the second quarter that we 've failed in that so rather than just like keep failing I want to actually address why we 're not meeting that standard and what resources you need to actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of complaints in which I actually you know don 't support so what do you need to actually get on top of that channel sweeping litter collection and rubbish rubbish collection to actually you know reduce the number of compliances specific report and they 've asked for that report to come back to you in December which is what we are targeting that doesn 't only cover roads it also covers parts and reserves because there 's an overlap took me around litter and my team and mirrors team are pulling that report together as it is you did ask for it I can 't remember a meeting or two ago and you said you would like it back for the December meeting so that 's where we 're targeting that exact report okay and can I just just fine finally on that specific issue and have one other question around just the general book changes to the organics collection and the other ones but can I just check because we were told at the community board that we 'd change those levels of service had been changed to reduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the level of service the rig the frequency of channel sweeping you get more complaints so I would like to propose that we actually reinstate the level of service the higher the frequency that we had rather than have a reduced frequency because that seems the more sensible thing to do to address this issue okay but basically we don 't want to sweep streets that don 't need sweeping and we want to Street the streets that need sweeping and so basically can we do things far more intelligently with GPS look at the amount was collected from those various streets on what frequency what time of the year what time so we believe we can lift the level of service by doing that and that 's what they are looking at that sometimes we 'll go and we 'll whip you bin and it 's only a third empty or thick full and others will go and will empty your bin and it 's overflowing this and so how do we make a service that gives us better value for the amounts mean and that 's a report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to you as part of that good okay and can you just give an overview around the changes the level of service around the consent compliance for the operations of the organics plant the recycling plant the residual waste and collection disposal isn 't there 's a number of changes in here that you 're proposing and some of them have the target has been zero and you 're not changing to make major and offers system up to significant or repeated so can you just explain what that 's doing in terms of and again um Dave can answer better than I but looks to me like we 're making it tighter which would surely must be better if if I can say counselor that we can answer these far better if we get them in advance because then we can have a chance to investigate it and come back to you with all the answers it 's quite hard to have the top of head answers to all of these some of which are quite detailed them very last night just to get a bit more rational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of those in a consistent methodology that people under a terminology that everyone understands but they are a tightening of those rather than a then a wicking of those and certainly wild Peters not here run our corporate performance planner is a pretty tight on on actually making sure that he believes that that 's what we 're doing so we are certainly not bowing away from performance we are I believe improving the measurement of performance on all those measures but as you 'll see there 's consistency then across that the whole of those resource consent issues Glenn and then four key a couple of questions under the financial summary over the capital expenditure just to say I 'm not convinced that we will catch up so it says look under four point 17 I look there proposes okay rodeo page 59 and 60 so it proposes that we will spend another 450 in three quarters I just can 't see it happening based on TV hey 61 unless that 's straight out accounting as opposed to actual delivery I can 't see how that way at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage of the year we tend to report what the capital program people believe what happen and I know there 's a lot of work going on bringing a lot of the key projects forward because we do expect some of the program work to fall back later in the year right now I 'm not panicking from a financial point of view and well reported as the year progresses but Dave I 'm sorry I cut across you 're going to say some programs around about seven months ahead of where it was if you look at the amount of the program that 's in the market all been left than what it was this time last year and so we believe some of it a good example would be all the reseals some of the reseals didn 't go out last year until March it 's all out of the market all been done it will be done over the summer months because it 's a better time to do that part of work so you will see that that work done so if you look at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gateways we are well ahead of where we were last year and we are also now brought forward our program for the 78 year we 've drawn that program down to project level ninety percent of it and we did that beginning of november so we are ahead of not this year 's capital program but also the following years capital program in the pipeline really go of development and you know the pipeline involves consultation that involved land purchase that involves design prior to your natural fat procuring because it 's not until you 've a cure and construct that your starts beating the big money but the pipeline is pushed to here and so that 's why that that team has that confidence here okay so it is an accounting matter will resolve itself I believe so possibly being Australian lovely who 's obviously he 's far more cross it that I am but I just look at the history and I know what tends to happen is that a lot of work is what is delayed for good reason I accept clearly they 're ahead of where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those projects do get delayed and so I 'm expecting it to fall back and nine with budget okay you know I just hear one more 4.13 page sixty as well the initial rate strike was higher than budget it sudden said in a stage whether this is a permanent change or just wonder what that means with the term goal of on them so we 're writing more than what we actually you need is that what they 're saying and the implications are vet for the next annual plan and provide technical I thought I think that needs a higher than that 's not worth five dollars it 's worth he bit rough on your equipment but um yeah every second is it fixable now am I know probably do it now service we do have that order in council still in place which means that we can rent properties as they are completed you a call after the earthquake there is the order in council which said as houses were demolished you reduce their rates down just to the bare land and the reverse of that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and houses and buildings some of the central city are being completed we can rate people during the year whereas in the past it was only every July so when we set the budget we try to estimate the amount of new work coming on at the moment we 're slightly ahead of where we thought we would be but there is a fair chance that that will drop off as the progresses because when i first read it it could look like we are collecting more money than we actually need at this moment we are about haces and particularly now the central city starting to be finished you know like the building where Price Waterhouse are for example it 's hard to estimate when that might happen yeah okay thank you I 'm Vicki and then Sarah a general process one and it may be more to cali nor the end and just in terms of these measures so for example in the vehicle fleet we 've got a fit-for-purpose compliant vehicle fleet but one of our ambitions is to sort of take leadership on electric vehicles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that our streams and waterways are much clearer and I 'm just not sure that we 've captured in these measures the objectives that we have and I know when we come to do these measures that it 's sort of at the end of the budget process and we look at them and think air and I 'm just wondering if we couldn 't sort of drive through the objectives that we want to achieve into these measures so that we 're actually measuring the things that are most important because some of these when you look through all the things that we measure up perhaps not as important as they used to be and others are more important I do know that something that Peter Ryan is very focused on a very much across and 30 carlene that is sorry so we 're reviewing those now and be helpful to head those directions so that we can incorporate those and objectives into that but and what we want is really to check we measure a lot of things and some things actually we can 't measure so their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you measure relatively easy and what will make a difference I 'm just wondering if there 's an opportunity at some stage prior to the whole budget being done to actually drive through the objectives into the things that we do measure yeah because I think sometimes mr. that 's deep mmm we might be able to do that as part of the annual plan process this year yeah thank you Sarah thanks I 'm just got a question about the level of service and housing I 'm sorry but it 's late and I 've just come up with it now and we 're looking it and this is identify options for council to facilitate the development of youth housing delete the Tigers no longer relevant due to the transition of the chip and yet last wait we established a new housing policy what talks about youth housing and so let 's page 72 I 'm just sort of looking at whether we need to keep those kind of things in there if we 've got and now a new priority for Council on those or whether the housing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we want to the chip yeah I 'm sorry I can 't answer that now but I do follow up on it and convict you because there 's a few housing ones in there that directly relate to the new housing policy in this interview of a conflict with where it lies so as part of the annual plan review will also need to look at those things yeah and what that 's appropriately outside the organisation in what supports our housing for instance the housing policy yeah great I 'm completely overlook their work just in relation to that one I think the tenant satisfaction ones can easily be easily go to the church go to the chip the provision of youth housing is probably not one that you want to delegate because actually as a council we can do a raft of other things and some of it will be funding and that that won 't be there in the chip for quite some time and I 'm not sure that you want to drop those ones out just yet having adopted a policy a week ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sign off in such japanes just which demands to talk to each other in chapter 13 so you open excellent yeah i think the tenants could easily go there not the policy ones because there will be means that we can do that by as a council as well as future we know exactly you want to retain 18 I 'm on page 72 of multiple iPad 1801 318 point 0.6 18.0 point 12 and 18 point zero point 13 okay so just leave them on we can deal with them in the annual plan so it 's only a few measure of the 1806 is a relationship that we have because we had a whole pile of hid tendencies in our social housing which we 've transferred that to the church and that was related to the our relationship with the houses that they I can rent it off so 1806 may need to go right but 12 and 13 when it 's fine yep so it 's just that point 12 and the point 13 yep all right okay I 'm sorry I 've got Aaron and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety one and around our ability to deliver services like street sweeping mowing lawns so on and so forth and it 's kind of how many people does it take to change a light bulb one to do it to the say are they doing it safely and the other night I got a surprise when I saw a street sweeper sweeping the street and a really large truck with lots of flashing lights on it there 's a white truck doing 6k an hour or whatever they do and then there was another truck 30 yards behind with light saying there 's a truck ahead sweeping a street of lights on it and it 's that 's got that 's two trucks to do one job and when your mole lon it 's three because you have the mower then some 150 yards behind saying there 's a mower and then there 's one a hundred yards behind saying there 's a truck same as a mower so it 's so I no denying one 's been around longer than you the new health and safety legislation but this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years it 's actually just the way things are done we the rubber sweeping wants you to first on two trucks sweeping no one sweeping to Robbie pointed this out to me the other night as well so I mean I do we have I do that is my point I 've had a truck you 're going to probably not relevant so we could take it offline Hey look at it I have to look I know it seems ETA policy will find out what else there are certain requirements is national standards about how you do that sort of thing but this is a lot of stuff spotted game take it offline it would be good to have a report back on that because I mean it 's just it does seem to me to be dangerous for me mo ME mo yeah a mimo any lovely thank you because the public are questioning it a lot I don 't rule so my husband 's name brother public so you 're doubling the doubling the odds of hitting a track because you 've got two tracks because when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you put a warning sign out to say these warning signs to say these warning signs you 've actually tripled the amount of timing on the road putting the warning sign up anyway it 's not a it 's not an issue for this report but it is an issue ref how to follow up on that page 67 bottom of the page parking the parking measure so it says optimize operational performance whatever that means so for off-street parking a fantastic KPI of sixty to eighty five percent and they were all quite like if it is that big the occupancy level was 52.5 to set and the reason given is that the old brewery site was relinquished but wouldn 't you take that out of what you like my report doesn 't have page numbers I 'm sorry can you tell me parking to us all right it 's in the the section of the report judgment aid yep the appendix a CCC level of service exceptions so what was the last part of your question again well so it says occupancy has fallen since the old brewery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I me if you take out some parking sure you take that out from your database but we 'd have the old brewery sign it had a very high amount of parking in it so we 've taken that out which was one of our higher performing because we 've lost it 's one of our higher performing car parked so on average the rest of them drop I think well that doesn 't make sense but I guess my question is I mean we if it 's got eighty percent and look I don 't know the exact figures it 's got eighty percent but the rest of them are only averaging 40 percent the average overall will be sixty-five percent you take out the eighty percent performer then suddenly the average drops to 52.5 percent so my question is are we over charging for off-street parking the answer is yes but wise wise the Ottomans even wise no convincing to the other side forty percent three dollars teen and our it 's really expensive a Sunday afternoon so won 't you know one way to increase demand is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opening in partnership with them with cat it some free car parking up until over the Christmas period so we 'll see whether what occupancy rate we get there fortunately the notices will be informing people of it up a bit put out a press release yesterday on it so that will be part of our it is restricted day to two hours so that you don 't get people coming in there and engineer but it might be free pixel it 's not on so you 're bringing on some new free supply so that would suggest that your demand for the current off street parking will go down ignore this is right in the middle of town and we just don 't have very much and by Christmas I 'm going to lose also the part where the hoyts to theaters going ya know this is to do a transition period to get people used to parking in there and then gives the some other parking in there will work she eventually you have to go back offline because it needs to be rich fitted with some equipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that demand yes there 's a relationship between ourselves and and tartar and part of that agreement that 's good it 's slightly not quite the question I was talking that which was actually i 'll be charging too much while street parking yeah okay not only that one thing but you see the fees oh really okay and okay so that 's pretty easy out of the face shipping process if I 'd like to be movement Rizzoli we delegate the start but annual plans based on demand huh we delegate at the start of flexible fees based on demand so it should be going down if the occupancy it isn 't good and it would be good for like this report to have said something like as a mitigation measure we 're going to reduce the amount were charging but there 's other places in addington as well we help officer ii part is not just central city we 've taken leases that are costing us a lot of money so it would be good to get some hang around though we 'll follow up on the parking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't actually have to deal with everything on the first three weeks of the new council meter so we 'll give you all right so would someone like to move that we receive the information and the report but that we amend the removal of those two levels of service so that that needs to be documented that the lip because we 're this just receives the report but we 're not we need a resolution to remove the to retain two-year to retain the two levels of service that we identified before sorry I 'm wat faces yeah I 'm I agree Diane these levels of service changes we 're we 're about minor sort of technical amendments I was a little bit concerned about the district plan one as well because it refers to an interpretation of the greater Christchurch regeneration act which I 'm not a hundred percent convinced as one that we necessarily have to accept so oh yeah which number is it Jonnie go on page 72 so I just think we need to have a discussion as a council about that work program it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we will change the cns but before that door I don 't know whether this is the appropriate place to do it that 's what I 'm agreeing with you who can 't believe I just a bit 9.5 points freaks so you did ask you to edit them to look yeah yeah cool and I 'm happy to second to you yeah that 's great thank you okay so ok so now who 's moving us Glenn and Sarah Glenn and Sarah I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no carried ok sorry every time thank you no thank you Jane thank you appointment of Representatives to the Christchurch public joint transport that 's a mover and a seconder if we got it we 'll hang on you got a hit you 're gonna have to put them now that 's it when it would actually quite like to name them so here they are appoint the mayor and councillors clear water and cover for the greater crash each public transport Joint Committee and that 's moved by Aaron seconded by tim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aye as opposed they know that 's carried and I 'll move that we resolve to exclude the public for all of the reasons set out on the appropriate part of the agenda do we have anyone that needs to remain for any purpose note so we can just deal with the standard form of the pages 96 to 97 of the agenda be adopted and do I have a seconder for that Andrew I 'll put that notion all those in favor say aye as opposed say no that 's carried thank you so that 's 11 you,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

2016,RmKF7jDFziY,20161109,1666.78,"Christchurch, New Zealand",4522,our performance report for the three months of 30th of September 2016 others would normally go to stratagem finance but is coming directly to council as we haven 't established our committees you dine would you like to come to the table is there anyone else that it is the way it should be there to provide support for the grilling that she 's about to receive your your support from the sidelines it 's the sort of support there bet you need Diane you 've been hung out to dry that 's okay okay are there any questions Yanni in particular on the roads and footpaths I was keen to know that says here that we 're benchmarking it and we 're using the 15-16 benchmark rather than the 14-15 so I was keen I was keen to know why we 're using why we were using the more recent benchmark rather than one before it 's given yet it 's on now and I 'm part of um Peter got 16 so to answer your question Yanni the changes are mainly Corrections or tardy ups and there 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the data from the previous year we could we put the corrections through you 'll notice a lot of them are either making it tighter or reflecting the change in housing or tidying up the base wants to reflect their statement of intent as regards why we 've used the benchmark of sorry adults that I would have to ask Dave to answer that please the coronary painless be advised once of each one in five or six so what we are advising now is we are going to replace that and put in the biggest boost on the baseline of your mouth off is a pretty box so we didn 't have a target on there now based on sale great we 're putting in a target we 're told that we didn 't meet it in 1415 so we must have had a number of complaints in 1415 why aren 't we using that as the benchmark for the five percent reduction rather than using the 1516 one which again didn 't make the five percent reduction in complaints so what seems to have happened with roads and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of complaints and now we 're using the highest number of complaints as the benchmark to reduce from rather than going back to what the original year was in 1415 I suppose we 've got a realistic mean we know improvement plans party activity natural pain obviously we 've got another six months of sales of scooter in summary years and then we are still doing a lot of our road structure of pierce through detonated so what we 're saying is we have had an acceleration of this we could actually set the timer based on we are the side we know the essences is that partisan production deal here and we are say yes it is how we we first up from baseline privacy photographers two years ago sleeping rubbish and litter collection too agreed standards so we 're not meeting the greatest agreed standards because we 're failing in that performance report it 's the second quarter that we 've failed in that so rather than just like keep failing I want to actually address why we 're not meeting that standard and what resources you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher level of complaints in which I actually you know don 't support so what do you need to actually get on top of that channel sweeping letter collection and rubbish rubbish collection to actually you know reduce the number of complaints Pacific report and I 've asked for that report to come back to you in December which is what we are targeting that doesn 't only cover roads it also covers parts and reserves because there 's an overlap took me around litter and my team and mirrors team are pulling that report together as it is you did ask for it I can 't remember a meeting or two ago and you said you would like it back for the December meeting so that 's where we 're targeting that attack report okay and can I just just find finally on that specific issue and have one other question around just the general book changes to the organics collection and the other ones but can I just check because we were told at the community board that we 'd check that levels of service had been changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you reduce the level of service the rig the frequency of channel sweeping you get more complaints so I would like to propose that we actually reinstate the level of service that the high frequency that we had rather than have a reduced frequency because that seems the more sensible thing to do to address this issue okay but basically we don 't want to sweep streets of don 't need sweeping and we want to Street the streets that need sweeping and so basically can we do things far more intelligently with GPS look at the amount was collected from those various streets on what frequency what time of the year what time so we believe we can lift the level of service by doing that and that 's what they are looking at that sometimes we 'll go and we 'll whip you bin and it 's only a 13 to go thick full and others will go and will empty your bin and it 's overflowing this and so how do we make a service that gives us better value for the amounts mean and that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing that back to you as part of that good okay and can you just give an overview around the changes the level of service around the consent compliance for the the operations of the organics plan the recycling plant the residual waste and collection disposal isn 't there 's a number of changes in here that you 're proposing and some of them have the target has been zero and you 're not changing to make major and offers system up to significant or repeated so can you just explain what that 's doing in terms of and begin um Dave can answer better than I but looks to me like we 're making it tighter which would surely must be better if if I can say cancel that we can answer these far better if we get them in advance because then we can have a chance to investigate it and come back to you with all the answers it 's quite hard to have the top of head answers to all of these some of which are quite BTW i did put them through last night just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are timing and it brings all of those in a consistent methodology that people under a song terminology that everyone understands but they are a tightening of those rather than a then a wig mean of those and certainly young wild Peters not here our corporate performance planner is a pretty tight on on actually making sure that he believes that that 's what we 're doing so we are certainly not bowing away from performance we are I believe improving the measurement of performance on all those measures but as you 'll see there 's consistency again across that the whole of those resource consent issues Glenn and then four key a couple questions under the financial summary over the capital expenditure just to say I 'm not convinced that we will catch up so it says look under four point 17 I look there proposes okay rodeo page 59 and 60 so it proposes that we will spend another 450 in three quarters I just can 't see it happening based on a 61 unless that that 's straight out accounting as opposed to actual delivery I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting can i say at this stage of the year we tend to report what the capital program people believe what happened and I know there 's a lot of work going on bringing a lot of the key projects forward but we do expect some of the program work to fall back later in the year right now I 'm not panicking from a financial point of view and well reported as the year progresses but Dave I 'm sorry I cut across you 're going to say some programs around about seven months ahead of where it was if you look at the amount of the program that 's in the market or being left than what it was this time last year and so we believe some of it a good example would be all the reseals some of the reseals didn 't go out last year until March it 's all out of the market all being done it will be done over the summer months because it 's a better time to do that kind of work so you will see that that work done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital program is through those various gateways we are well ahead of where we were last year and we are also now brought forward our program for the 17 18 year we 've drawn that program down to project level ninety percent of it and we did that beginning of november so we are ahead of not this year 's capital program but also the following years capital program in the pipeline wing league of development and you know the pipeline involves consultation that involved land purchase it involves design prior to your natural fat procuring because it 's not until you 're back yer and construct that you starts beating the big money but the pipeline is pushed to hear and so that 's why that that team has that confidence here okay so it is an accounting matter will resolve itself i believe so broadway being australia lovely because obviously he 's far more cross at that i am but i just look at the history and I know what tends to happen is that a lot of work is is delayed for good reason I accept clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a lot of the projects do get delayed and so I 'm expecting it to fall back and nine with budget okay you know I just had one more 4.13 page sixty as well the initial rate strike was higher than budget had sudden said in a stage whether this is a permanent change or just wonder what that means there 's a two dollar on there so we 're writing more than what we actually need is that what they 're saying and the implications of that for the next annual plan and provide technical I thought I think that needs a higher than but that 's not worth five dollars it 's worth he bit rough on your equipment but um yeah how many seconds is it fixable no our mind i 'll probably do it now service we do have that order in council still in place which means that we can write properties as they are completed you recall after the earthquake there is the order in council

out from your database we 'd have the old grandson and had a very high amount of parking in it so we 've taken that out which was one of our higher performing because we 've lost it it 's one of our higher performing car parks so on average the rest of them dropped I think that doesn 't make sense but I guess my question is I mean we are if it 's got eighty percent and look I don 't know the exact figures it 's got eighty percent but the rest of them are only averaging 40 percent the average overall will be sixty-five percent you take out the eighty percent performer then suddenly the average drops to 52.5 percent so my question is are we over charging for off-street parking the answer is yes but wise wise the organ emergency and wise not convincing to the other side forty percent three dollars teen and it 's really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to increase demand is to maybe cut cut the pro morrow we will be opening in partnership with with cat it some free car parking up until over the Christmas period so we 'll see whether what occupancy rate we get there fortunately the notices will be informing people of it a little bit put out a press release yesterday on it so that will be part about it is restricted day to two hours so that you don 't get people coming in there and I 'm an engineer but it might be free pixel Sodom so you 're bringing on some new free supply so that would suggest that your demand for the current off street parking will go down even more this is right in the middle of town and we just don 't have very much and by Christmas I 'm going to lose also the part where the Hoyts dude theaters going ya know this is to do a transition period to get people used to parking in there and then gives the some other parking in there will work sure you eventually have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fitted with some equipment but basically is to get us over that period in that demand yes there 's a relationship between ourselves and and Carter and part of that agreement that 's good it 's slightly not quite the question I was talking about which was actually i 'll be charging too much for off-street parking yeah okay not only that one thing but you see the fees oh really okay then okay so that 's pretty easy out of the face sitting in a procession I like to be moving resolute we delegate the star annual claims based on demand huh we delegate at the start of flexible fees based on demand so it should be going down if the occupancy yeah isn 't good and it would be good for like this report to have said something like as a mitigation measure we 're going to reduce the amount were charging but there 's other places and addington as well we help officer it part it 's not just central city we 've taken leases that are costing us a lot of money so it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the parking is part of the annual plan you know we don 't actually have to deal with everything on the first three weeks of the new council meeting so we 'll give you all right so would someone like to move that we receive the information and the report but that we amend the removal of those two levels of service so that that needs to be documented that the lip because we this just receives the report but we are not we need a resolution to remove that to retain two year to retain the two levels of service that we identified before sorry on what faces yeah i agree Diane these levels of service changes we 're we 're about minor sort of technical amendments I was a little bit concerned about the district plan one as well because it refers to an interpretation of the greater Christchurch regeneration act which I 'm not a hundred percent convinced as one that we necessarily have to accept so yeah which number is it yummy go on page 72 so I just think we need to have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be that we we do change the yeah I think we will change the lives of cns but before that door I don 't know whether this is the appropriate place to do it that 's what I 'm agreeing with you who can 't believe I just did that 9.5 points freaks so you did it edit into the yeah yeah cool and I 'm happy just second to you yeah that 's great thank you okay so okay so now who 's moving this um Glenn and Sarah Glenn and Sarah I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no carried okay sorry every time thank you but no thank you

2016,efQoWtgwf5o,20161109,1280.169,"Christchurch, New Zealand",3752,signed the next item is the report from Memphis structure transport and Environment Committee the infrastructure design standard 2016 and Dave are you coming to the table for that the infrastructure design standard is that you yep there 's two David 's and David and ends at the other david sorry of what i 've been doing at the beginning of these meetings because we 've got because we 've got new counselors we 're just asking that people introduce themselves at the end of the table so that so they 're all councillors know who we 're meeting with so morning on Dave Adamson I 'm the general manager of city services along David Booth way I work in David 's team and I 'm the strategic asset planning manager that 's right and yes if you could give us a bit of an overview of the infrastructure design standards and what they 're for so infrastructure design standards are primarily directed at people that develop new horizontal infrastructure so the best thing to do in your minds is to think of new subdivisions and developments so that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we like to do is that we like to have those developments done to a particular standard the best standard that we know of because what we do is we inherent inherit those bits of infrastructure so the developer develop them we then take them on they become part of council assets so what you like them to be in a good state because at the end of the day the ratepayer bean paste for the ongoing maintenance associated with those assets so what our infrastructure strategy does it gives the guidance and standards to the consulting engineers and contractors is what we require of them and that goes out with a consent notice for the conforth at subdivision to be able to be developed and the consent notice makes reference to the infrastructure design standard what we do is we constantly have to update the standard because life changes new designs come in new materials come on to the market and if we take the instance we had recently of new technology going in the ground was the vacuum pump wastewater systems that were being implemented those previously would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get incorporated into the new one what we like to do then what we like to do what we required to do is come back to Council on a regular basis give their notice of updated standards that we would like it then to be adopted by council that we can then make reference to the new standard in the new consent that are given out for construction absolutely it 's fine i 'm thure would you like to move that I move the recommendations and seconded by Tim all right appalling thing yani I just into us so these are design standards if they previously been signed off by council and now you 're up top the steering group to hit the delegation to sign them off and you 'll report back to council on an annual basis and this is something significant report so if it 's the main difference now you want the delegation for the steering group my understanding is that they were originally developed and about the first lot 1 2010 before the earthquake in there were changed rapidly after the earthquake as new technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ website a version 2015 i think they are we are wanting council to sign them off now to be integrated in sign off a process it would be fair to say every week we would get applications for new products new ways you know there 's an amazing rain new HTTP nine holes out there that will just say sorry outside high-density polyethylene manholes out there that will so a phenomenal amount of time maintenance a wide range of sorts of things so those are the sorts of things that we are getting in to put in there so that we can do it and then bring them back and just get all those changes so that you as counselors on a regular basis know what those new if you 're interested what those new sort of changes are what is to keep them on our website so they are publicly available and so that any designer doing anything can use the latest technologies so you don 't see any risk as elected members and us not having oversight in the first place but the steering group having a delegation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a governance level is when you do a resource consent and you will say that it needs and I 'll make something up here to footpaths down each side and it needs you know street lighting that keeps the night sky clear and all the rest of it then they will go away and say well how do I make two footpaths down now okay they have to be 1.2 meters wide and all the rest of it so we 're providing the recipe book you 're providing the recipe almost and so that they then mix so these are very technical ways that people can apply them to deliver the outcomes that you 've done it a governance level when you apply any of those consents or um approve any of those major development thank you yani have you got your speaker yeah I think it 'd be useful or helpful if you could just give a brief explanation as to arm skirts involvement in these design standards given that they don 't capture skirt repairs so obviously there 's been some concern in the community around the lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ document is sitting you know I guess a high level a higher standard of things that we want for the city so can you just explain a little bit about that that difference and standards the majority of spirit work will comply with these standards particularly the big infrastructure projects are doing however at the end of the scoop program to actually meet the requirements of the legislation there was an agreement that we would go in and do repairs of infrastructure that would fail in the next five years as part of the joint funding between ourselves and government now this doesn 't talk about these standards are for new infrastructure they don 't cover repairs so there were separate standards delivered and develop between ourselves the crown and skirt to deliver the outcomes that we could get subsidy for so basically it was these keys don 't really cover like I say the kind of small repair here and smaller appear here small appear there they are more designed for when skirt replaces a wide range so that will apply them where we have a total replacement they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works get has done will have fully complied with these standards and one of the things I would say is a lot of the upgrades of this are some of the solutions that they have innovatively through skirt designed got approval form and have been applied in the network so I just I was really really clear though that approving these today is not reducing the standards that we already have in place because have found a way to do something cheaper and less than what we actually would want as a City Hall of school work is fully designed and it 's at construction and so basically we these standards lift the standard of what we 're applying it lifts the environmental standards that lifts the performance for ratepayers it 's got better energy efficiency it brings in all the state of the play both probably definitely work best national practice but it would bring lot of best international practice too so I think you 'll find that these are probably as leading edge is everywhere as anywhere in the country of the matter did I hear you correctly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written unto this we 're actually utilized by scared and delivering a new way of delivering things that we 're never covered by standard so we 've actually we 're adopting standards that brings in this new practice through different systems that have been developed by scared a very good example would be scared of put in a number of five glass manholes throughout the network and I happen to be at a conference and they had all these photos saying that looks as best practice showing the rest of the country nonsense on that 's impressing this is over let 's Christchurch and that 's Christchurch and that 's Christchurch and that 's Christchurch and so it was quite amazed how well that 's proven it 's good technology we have applied it we have adopted and if you have a look we did give you a list of 50 or 60 different changes that have happened in the standard since the last ones were adopted those successful solutions have been incorporating the standard so it doesn 't mean that people must put in the five Wales manhole a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to put in a fiberglass one in certain places it would be a better solution a cheaper solution and a longer lasting solution for us I think picking up on just the other point that you animators do you think that we should consider whether base design standards should should be more applicable to renewals and to repairs the real issue that you 've got is a renewal and appear sometimes a bit of a bespoke solution depending on what 's been there in the past you know a good example would be we can reseal after a certain number of reseals however we need to rip and relay and so you depends on what the depth of reseals that you put on there depends on what mix of the old bitumen that put on the what kind of because sometimes you 'll get bleeding to it so it 's quite hard to say one now you will find there 's new zealand standards that cover renewals for example of pavements there 's new zealand standards that talk about realigning of sewer pipes as new zealand standards and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that 's really what gets tied into our construction documents so if we 're going to do something we would have another sweet i would say and not an ID yes I don 't know what we call it we call it the repair you know design standards which would then document all of those documents probably that we use and that other side of it so it would be a separate document but we do you actually have a good practice guidelines on that and thinking very much of it because I must have met that sometimes these technical reports can be a little bit challenging but I think you 've really helped certainly may understand all of the detail yeah Glenn thank you just a couple of quick questions here so just a double check this only applies to new subdivisions so if we 're considering say bit way street which is going to be rebuilt these won 't apply the you know so that its new i gave the new subdivisions as an example yeah yeah so effectively as a new infrastructure that would actually go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves that we have to then look after so this we will apply the user rebuild if we 're rebuilding a standard the same standards really apply we will reference a pavement strength than these documents and that will be the pavement strength that we will do and then you you know the the solution will be different because like I said it 's a recipe book it 's not actually saying you know take shelf one and that 's the answer to all your problems it 's not quite as simple as that but we will be using the same underlying technical references whether it be a repair or whatever in the delegation what changed the consultation process for the residents yeah and I like didn 't know you 're going to say that but so I did have just one more obviously the whole of life costs would be lower moving to these stand yeah so the idea is that we 're constantly raising the bar through these standards as we bring them through on a year-by-year basis so we were learning we as we see examples both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we on an annual basis or biannually update our our standards to implement better practice into the community quite a good example would be street lighting and we 've had a significant change in these documents around street lighting but I want to go out and just have a look our effective LED lighting was and basically I 've got reference to all the new subdivisions around town not any of the old part of town you know we have a little odd part where we 've replaced some of the old systems but if you want to see some good effective LED lighting you 'll pretty much go to the new subdivisions because that 's where it 's been installed in its been installed to a reasonable extinct you know I could take you to parts of the existing city where we 've got you know six or eight or whatever but if you want to see whole streets of it that 's a good example and that gives us a lot better lifetime costs far better energy efficiency and so they have been applied effectively already really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply to trace that we don 't plant large growing trees under power lines and also if we have a major renewal in a street with heritage trees let 's pick Sabine streets in Albans that we would underground the wiring just in those streets to protect the trees yes there 's me not all strengths next summer so there 's a whole section on trees and what they classify is inappropriate trees so the idea is that as a subdivision plane comes back they would have actually made use in reference those if they 're wanting something different they have to motivate for it in their consent application as to why they would want to change and and then the ideas that winced when the subdivision is approved and signed off then our obvious go out and confirm that those are trees that were agreed at the consent stage or actually the trees that are in the ground and have been planted you 'd have to recognize though the subdivision standards don 't allow overpower overhead power line so basically everything 's underground and new subdivisions so existing parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know if you 're only doing the pavement in actual fact there 's no reason why you would apply the rest of the standard because you 're only doing a part of a contractor so it depends on a horse for a course really and so new subdivisions won 't have overhead services really any more thing of the past yeah and the reason i asked is because we don 't have a tree policy yet so it 'd just be which one comes first the the the tree policy or this one which one would override only for the renewals are those major tree streets which aren 't that often you 'll find in the ids there is a tree policy in there and as if you have a look a good example would be victoria street there was a tree policy around there we were looking at the size of the trees as part of the revenge and you 'll see the site that the the plans that you sign off actually have each tree species defined what we 're taking out what we 're putting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we did get a lot of feedback about the deciduous trees and we 've got a lot of feedback about stormwater problems with them but we also then people recognize if you don 't have deciduous trees you then also have an icing problem which is a health and safety problem so whatever you do is a trade off from somewhere if you want trees and the street and it 's a balance but we do get specialists like that part of of the of the guidelines yes of all the streets you could have used an example but I mean we won 't go there yeah um so that 's been moved and seconded I 'll put that motion Yanni yeah and um I appreciate that you know we 've gotten our dynamic process to update it I just think we should pay more attention to it I think it 'd be really good to breathe the community boards because many of the local issues around new subdivisions only having foot piles on one side of the road or you 've got you 've got areas where say the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LED lights has been problematic so it 'd be really good for the local community boards as well to understand you know if there are issues that need to be addressed through that how we can do that I think the other thing for me is that I mean I am concerned I appreciate that there 's some new innovation that skirt are doing but I am concerned that the repair standards don 't match these standards because I can 't see why would be spending money doing for new things and then spending money having things that are repaired that aren 't repaired to a new standard and you know if you take things like a sheltering of Cola sex or places that had ash felt that now get chip seal but if it was a new subdivision there 's no way they would get away with that so I think we do need to think about just having a clear mechanism to align the standards I don 't know if it has to be a separate document but there should be something that explains to the community why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the infrastructure design standard streets that we expect others to do so you know I know there 's a lot of work that 's gone into this there 's a number of things that you 've said through my questions that are not appropriate to race through here the number of traffic lights on intersections on for example or off-road cycleways along state highways those are things that I 'll pursue through other means but I do think you know if some of the conversation we 've had today it is these are really this is a really important document for how the city looks and feels and it 's something that public should hopefully have some greater understanding of through our local democratic processes because it actually does make a huge difference to people at a local level when it 's done well and obvious it 's not done well we get lots of issues of concern like the Nova subdivision and you haven 't touched it or not but I know you 've mentioned to me that you think these new changes will provide greater safety assessments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end which should lead to better safety outcomes and community outcomes and hopefully that 's one of the legacies of the noble subdivision which was very contentious so it 's good to see that you 're learning and putting into practice these new new ways of doing things that will improve the outcomes and I 'm quite happy to take that on board that we will go around the community boards and I think probably David and Yvonne of the two people that should do that and as soon as you approve them they are ready to go up online the existing infrastructure design standards are online so they are available public document will replace those ones with these ones and I just don 't have a timetable for that but hopefully they don 't happen within the next sort of week or so so as soon as I wrap online then it would be a good time to go and tell the community boards about what 's in them and then anyone who 's got a spear five or six days could read through them haha pick our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this discussion I guess the previous that you can mighty resale learn to unless by osmosis and it 's it 's good to see in the report and dave has reiterated and in fact this information we sign it off will be up on the website for people to see and I think that distinction between new work and repaired work is really important for us and so that 's perhaps another area where we need to consolidate and have some information so there 's clarity around these things so I think that it 's a good report and I think it 's been important though free for all councillors and for the info elected members with the boards that in fact we are across us so thank you for the report and woo good i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye as opposed they know they carried,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

NZ,NZ,Christchurch City Council,Christchurch City Council,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZETwErnCvvgbvBbnnHfyxA,20.10.2016 - Item 10 - Hearings Panel report to the Council on the Freedom Camping Bylaw 2015,UTRTy1pamrg,20161102,912.38,"Christchurch, New Zealand",2424,agenda as the hearings panel report to the council on the proposed amendments so the freedom camping by Lord God hi I 'm just getting everyone to reintroduce themselves because we 've got a new council so thank you yes my name is Ruth little wood and I 'm a policy analyst with the strategic policy team and Helen Vermont we 've already met it is manager thank you um so Andrew you set on the you cheered the hearings panel is that right yes yes yes I 'll leave it over ta alright so I 'll just make some introductory comments then thank you so it 's important to note this is an interim review of the bylaw we 're all very aware of some of the problems that happened with freedom camping over the 2015-16 summer and the reason for this interim review really was to resolve some of those issues before the start of the 2016-17 season that 's the reason for the the relatively yeah the relatively minor nature of the the changes that have been made which really are to restrict freedom camping to self-contained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to restrict all freedom camping at the areas which are temporarily closed which were previously the areas where non self-contained freedom camping could occur so that 's a French farm winery win support Park addington and sticks Mills so those are the five areas where last summer we did have problems with a proliferation of non self-contained freedom camping what the changes we 're making today assuming this is approved would be would be to restrict all freedom camping in those places to prohibit freedom camping in those places now the recommendations also this is number four in the recommendations in today 's agenda recommend some other issues that be considered for inclusion in the full review of the freedom camping by law that will take place at the end of the 2016 7 in summer season there were some things that we perhaps would have liked as a hearing panel to even have included and make some changes in this partial review but time didn 't permit that it 's important that we get this in place in time for the first of December for the new season and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I certainly look forward to more work been done around some of these areas that we 're suggesting by way of that recommendation so that we consider them fully as we make perhaps more substantive changes to the bylaw in 2017 at the end of this season so I think it 's important to look at what we 're doing today in the context of there were some things we need you to do on an interim basis to be fit for purpose for the upcoming summer season and there 's a far greater review of the whole by law coming up which will also give us the ability to make some further changes at that time so you 'd like to move the resolution yes please and do I have a seconder term Scandrick so questions Pauline did you talk about foot please does it stick snores it 's not broccoli no problems wasn 't it never run the original wasn 't it I sorry I think he 's infusion I just wondering why not cuz it was a bit of problem area last year so the the been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the non self-contained will not be able to park up at brooklyn 's it just as they can 't count anywhere else right yeah I mean apologies if you 've answered this question in the report somewhere do we have enough facilities for non self contained campervans I mean where are you planning that they should go well the the amendment mean that they won 't they won 't be there won 't be food and camping with in christchurch city on the class ship city controlled land so in effect if they wish to freedom camp as opposed to go to a camping ground or on private land then they will have to do so outside counsel controlled land okay maybe I 'll rephrase that slightly say I mean do we have let 's say other enough simple cam sites like a doc place where they can still go in there are toilet facilities and rubbish facilities now that 's something that certainly needs and and the council 's already indicated we need to look at to see whether there are other other options you know appropriate places that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were submitters who offered to create basically low-cost camping facilities for iron self-contained and clearly in the review we need to look not only yet what if any needs to be changed about the bylaw but what other options what are the non-regulatory options if that are needed I know it 's people were sending me those types of proposals that actually all you need is you know the shower facilities and this facility in that and keep it quite simple yes okay so i can so in approving this which i 'm quite happy to do what 's the message we 're going to send out to them as I don 't come into christ church or just go to a normal camping ground well we we do have we do publicize the opportunities for camping with in christchurch and for non self contained oui oui there are quite a number of camping ground facilities available yeah okay okay thanks will you will you ask as part of the the full review will you ask what the impact of the freedom campaign was on their turnover of the of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to camping ground owner within the city boundary who said that it had a major impact on their turnover huge yes it down a dude down on the year before if that 's certainly one of the things we 'll be looking at end in terms of some of the camping ground managers owners also are looking at providing you know facility specific to this particular group of campers who perhaps don 't require the same range of facilities as you know your typical key week a big holiday provides well Wellington has one right on the central city which as you know it 's got a small fee attached to it but all the facilities are there and ppl park up and they go into town and they spend money you know ever have a great time so I think there is a sense that we 'd like to get to that sort of model so that freedom campers get the message that they are welcome in our cities but that the that the counter to that is that they were not the counter but the counterweight to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment that that everyone else has to live on yes and I think no doubt that the monitoring showed that nearly all the campers were compliant and were respectful they were just far too many of them yeah they chose to go they prefer to well quite a few of them prefer to be in groups with other like-minded campers yeah and they wanted to be close to facilities or needed to be close to facilities and they overwhelmed that facility yeah yeah that 's true question Yanni stands one was um just in relation to the preferred option under legal implications there 's no mention of the Bill of Rights have you done a bill of rights assessment on prohibiting the you know um non self contained camping yes yes and indeed it there we received advice legal advice about that there is no actual bill of rights to for example stay overnight in a particular area that 's not one of the rights under the Bill of Rights its freedom of movement it 's not actually freedom to locate so yes there has been a bill of right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um I think you 'd have to I 'm sorry it will be in the report and the yes that 's right the partial review of so I 'll just flip through to the no that 's cool that 's fun um um yeah attachment to see and also the requirements of section 11 two of the freedom camping Act okay that 's that 's fun um and then the second question was oh I 'm just concerned around the lack of infrastructure so if we put preferred option one it doesn 't seem to me that people will stop freedom camping in Christchurch but they 'll just go they 'll get places but maybe not concentrate in the areas that we see we 're okay as we did last time so if you looked at the infrastructure that 's associated I know you 're going to do that on the peninsula but I 'm worried that you 're not doing that in the city as well are there any areas in the city that you 've thought it would be good to have a bit more looking at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more staffing resource in terms of Park Rangers for example just to kind of actively monitor what 's going on the eye I guess the implementation of this bylaw is something that staff have been thinking a lot about especially after last summer 's experience and I know that that we there 's a meeting of relevant staff tomorrow to start planning for that I would just you know feel comfortable that appreciate and that 's as unique situation in terms of its infrastructure which opens like wastewater but I think there may be some areas in the city that also on the fringes of the city that may have may have similar issues and I just like to know that is thought you know we 're going into that um I guess the answer to that is yes in terms of I that clearly will be part of the full review to be looking at where there are suitable areas for camping low-cost also be free and infrastructure of course is a key part of that one one of the sort of changes that 's brought about by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether someone is and complying with the vial or not because it 's quite clear that you can 't non self contained vegan camp is in city and it 's a it 's a very clear message to send to people so so if you catch someone like you know you got a winter ball park and there 's someone there and there there 's a car they 're not knock on the window you can 't sleep here you need to move on that is there a fine that you give them more how do you actually enforce it and really yes there is a fine two hundred dollars and I there and there will be monitoring as there is for our other battles and I understand that our compliance monitoring people have budgeted for compliance and monitoring up for the freedom camping by law well there is a budget that for compliance you but that is the existing one that 's not changing as a result I know but the thing is is that you know I just think that it 's important that we kind of move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasn 't totally some frustration number four out of your to that you nominated yes I 'm all their kind of related but I 'm just the infrastructure have we approached central government for access to their infrastructure fund for tourist facilities and there is a whole process that 's been going on in relation to it because there 's a separate infrastructure fund for tourism I mean I symbol the idea of putting infrastructure in place for freedom camping and easily but is it any work going on around these theorists there is I can tell you that because we 've already been talking to the all of the Canterbury mears about access to that fund because there 's more than just our city that 's am responsible for this and as I have seen on a squillion occasions we need a more joined up approach at the visitor experience should be the same throughout New Zealand that this is another one of these examples of things handed to a local government to deal with on an individual basis instead of collectively thinking up the solution Phil did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been probed where it 's now prohibited that in fact that they won 't be considered as future options in the future you can 't rule out future options well ok no not not under this process and the next process when we do the review that is the appropriate time to raise that ok well I understand exactly where you 're coming from and I think that we were overwhelmed by numbers that we hadn 't anticipated which is why we 're in the situation we 're in but we are going to go through a full review process and that will enable us to go through all of the issues under budget e but i think that the other thing is is that it will give the government time to potentially intervene and and play a more a stronger leadership role so that we can get a uniform response to this so that our visitors feel welcome but that our environment is protected that 's the competing trust that we 've had described so i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much we 're just about to get two pigs and then a June for lunch so just bearing that in mind the next I,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Policy,7ev5WjMbDGo,20161101,2062.3,"Christchurch, New Zealand",5438,"item h proposed council housing policy cool and clean would you like to um would you like to present this yeah thank you this policy really is the culmination of the previous tombs work and arguably some work prior to that two terms back when some of us initiated homegrown housing summits so that has partly fit into this as well we often find it easy for the words Christchurch is a great place to live work and play to roll off our tongues but what does that actually mean how can we give effect to Christchurch being a great place to live what is it that can sit beneath that statement to actually deliver that this policy firstly is underpinned by a human rights quality over access to adequate housing for all it describes what the council can do across the housing spectrum not necessarily to build all the houses our stock and trade has been social housing but actually initiatives over homelessness right through to affordable housing where sometimes the best thing we can do is actually get out of the way to ensure that people can access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christchurch being a great place to live what can we do by being providing an affordable environment by supporting initiatives for trusts to develop housing over affordability by having a thriving set from City we have a target for 20,000 people central city it 's a big it 's an audacious target by ensuring that anyone who is homeless has options so that no one is sleeping on our streets you 'll see the stakeholder information provided there i 'll pick out just to quickly the DHB notes housing is a key determinant to the community 's health the christchurch youth council surveyed its own members and found actually housing affordability came out as their number one priority and they admit that took them by surprise this the policies in two parts these actual policy itself which can be reviewed every six years then there 's the list of action priorities and that can be changed any time for my mind that list of priorities could serve as actually a program of work for the committee into which this policy will lend this terminal we get to decide on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions to tease them out yani has an amendment to come into the action part so we 've talked about that with Paula I 've set thee or the addition through there to recognize some of the one of the stakeholders consumes so it 's a big piece of work but I think it 's good for council to be seen to take the lead very good I 'm now did you have a suggested amendment to yes I think it through to all right sorry sorry sorry yep we 've talked about it and it seems it 's more going to land in the action part of the policy rather than in the in the the guts of the policy itself I will annoy and yanni of talk this through but that can change any time yeah yeah that 's because I think you were the rain I did think that it could fit under range of responses but I don 't hear was picking up on the point that it does need a specific attention so if it goes under a deliverable under the goal the abyss this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's just made is that actually consoli work with young people in organizations because his organization 's other than youth organizations that are looking at solutions to your housing issues and opportunities so I just yeah popping relevant that would be relevant to organisation yeah that is fine I 'm just I mean I just really want to say the youth council did a lot of work around the housing policy I just think this reflects an opportunity to kick that dialogue and conversation going to look at what is a really important issue which is youth housing and so I 'm really would really encourage people to consider adding this to the policy okay so so you 're moving up and who wants to seek in la prepa 272 happy to second Yanni all right so is there any any further discussion Aaron questions to up with equations no that 's fun the just around your affordability model and that you went for a notice question why you use that as the model that households earning up to 120 percent of median household income why is it not just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with lots of money things become quite affordable it 's we need to worry about the people with not as much money in response to I think each release challenges we just decided to do the issues so if that 's the case is that not saying that its board of them because that 's your affordable mark this isn 't yet million-dollar homes and northward vs and you 're saying that only twenty odd percent of the population can for home lets out working model over twenty five obstacles we take back cities right because I noted that your price which the affordable one is three hundred eighty-three thousand yet the average income in Christchurch 's 1265 a week which ANZ will give you 160 thousand dollars you need a lot of deposit you need 223,000 alright for orders in there so this reference is effectively do so in other ways to control game miss DC is this case in question 2 we found a risk is off line and slice is it every well doesn 't help sixty sixty-five percent of our population well except that it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're on a lower uncommon picks them up it 's a standard measure of affordable une what it 's fine if we renting but the reality is appear on the average income in Christchurch you can 't buy a house well the government put in place some lending rules after this policy was first drafted they 've used a big tool to taken will not only speculators but the average Joe Bloggs wants to get a house so they 've made life pretty hard so you know we 're doing out but but I think they have a few questions to answer as well yeah it 's not my that 's not my point I 'm not having a go about its not doing a better this is a good start yes opening the train go the problem is that when the average person who might work as a panel beater or even a placement doesn 't look at this and go I that your numbers don 't relate to me as as affordable piano soon and that 's because they can 't say for a deposit more then because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team took these numbers are talking about a city that most people don 't live in is what I 'm saying but I think yeah we are on screen to a question perspective at dallas arboretum spot yeah because it 's thirty percent of your income so whatever your income is that amount that dollar amount is going to change yeah so you 're really talking about the ability to buy a house yeah that can what is affordable if I work here jobs i can afford a house yeah and saving for that deposits going to be so it 's the deposit gap that 's the that 's the that 's the kicker isn 't it will end there in the entire shape of the market this doesn 't work well let 's let 's hope that someone thinks of a solution for the deposit game well people can you know use their KiwiSaver for yeah there 's also yeah but anyway all right Vicki oh it did anyone else have questions Phil John David just briefly Paul like it 's been a huge amount of work going on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look that the Hulk the concept of urban design that there should be more incorporated we 've been able to do that you think yes we 're a team to acknowledge some of those response submissions certainly fill around quality in design so within attachment to their which shows you what the plausibility a proposed policy will actually look like we 've shaded the the amendments or the additions or clarifications or tweaks to emphasize certain points so I think you 'll find that uh your points there have been highlighted there if you like a cup of times throughout passing new technology thank you oh god David thank you very well written policy I just wondered some of the conversations we 've had in recent days regarding being a subject or a citizen whether there is any thought giving given to including in this policy what we as the city may expect and return for these for the provision of affordable housing what outcomes the city would expect from the provision of affordable housing higatv for the well more you know places we are engaging in the provision of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that provision contributing to the city should we be looking at that longer term in their policy you can start to replay it on a little bit well rest rest speech the other that he gave to us the other morning about and I like the idea of sort of we are subjects of the sitting there we need to be citizens of the city will you potentially expanding my place are we and I always look at social initiatives yes as being a hand up not a handout yeah so are we reflecting that sort of Emma jamia in their policy but at the moment we 're having questions to all I 'm asking the question no but that 's not a question you ask staff it 's a question to debate with your colleagues so what about them so so we 'll leave it to the debate so there any other questions for Paul just right okay now Vicki you wanted to contribute to the debate of affordable available housing in a community as a community that works the reverse of that is the current situation you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you cannot afford to be a teacher or a policeman or anything else in oakland at the moment and the situation is dire you need a two-hundred-thousand-dollar deposit and you need eight hundred thousand dollars and borrowing to buy a house that is not the situation we want to be in I like the spectrum there that has been developed here and I think we have a range of things that we have to do one in relation to the homelessness we are in a situation where we can actually make sure that there are no homeless people in crash and that 's a fantastic situation to be in and one that we have to act on to make sure we achieve that 's our responsibility these are our okay with our citizens that the people there people 's kids star people 's parents though they 're part of our community they should not be living on the streets at all we have tried and and failed with the infinite hearings panel to try and make sure that in the rebuild of so many homes in Christchurch that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement of expectations meant that the independent hearings panel did not adopt that which is almost criminal I think but but it hasn 't happened the other one and I like yannis amendment is that we are acutely aware from our last public hearings on housing when we were about to set up when we 've just gone through the process of setting up to trust as a result is that the issue of youth homelessness is severe and the issue of young people living in homes where they are not okay is still very real in this city so we need to make sure that we include the youth issue in relation to the affordability I think it 's actually very very important that people can afford to buy their own homes I don 't agree with errands figures at all you can buy with a 20-percent deposit so you need to save 74k on the average honor the host as a starter and casts in christchurch and that 's actually doable you can get a few couple you can get 20k and on the government 's home start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we 're currently seeking to achieve is a home state initiative for Christchurch using some of the government contribution for their housing court so we 're working with government on attempting to get that into Christchurch that would mean that people then borrow on your figures about 300k which if you look at a four percent and that 's currently slightly over there is about a thousand a month that they 're paying an interest and an interest not capital repayment but interest which is actually doable and so we are still in the situation where we can have a city where we have really good housing and if you look at the most basic of our infrastructure and it is actually beyond Orion and roads and footpaths thats actually housing that is what determines people 's life outcomes it determines if you look at the research their educational opportunities it determines their health opportunities and it determines what they will be and the possibilities that they can realize in their life so homes are the most important infrastructure that we have in the city and one that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the framework of a policy and now all we need is a whole pile of actions that flow from that we 're good yani Dion Jimmy 31 was that actually housing is it is really about in my view it 's actually about a home so everyone deserves to have a secure safe and comfortable home in Christchurch I mean probably in the world but that let 's focus on cottage so we are unique and that I think the quality of life that people can have in Christchurch because they can access affordable secure warm comfortable housing that contributes to having a sense of home and also a sense of community is a pretty compelling reason for people to want to live here but we are I think at a crossroads and I think the emergency housing really needs to be addressed and a lot more of a holistic approach and this policy hopefully gives us the teeth to start doing that for example in Seattle they have a downtown emergency services center that actually took in the top so many people that were costly to the welfare department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it gave them a home each and it really wrapped around services for people and ended up saving the city of seattle a huge amount of money because the cost otherwise to those people was tens of millions if not 20 million dollars more so there 's new ways of doing things around emergency housing and actually housing for homelessness effort for homeless and for people that need it that goes across government departments and across city and century government levels that can get much better solutions than what we 've currently got which we tend to spend a lot of money on band-aid solutions rather than solutions that can actually make a lot better outcomes and the third point I wanted to make is that one of the really interesting things in the history of our city is the amount of land that 's been resigned straight after the earthquake for housing and I think we 're really at a crossroads and I 'm really supportive of the inclusionary zoning to be a mentor to be a higher priority because actually this is probably in the history of Christchurch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got going on but the issue with that is at the moment what we 're seeing is that there 's entire new subdivisions that have no affordable or social housing going on in the north and the west west and the southwest of the city where you 've got a huge concentration and some of the central and eastern suburbs and the problem with that over time is actually it creates a huge social problem for our city you can see examples of this happening in America and tech places like Texas and McKinney where they actually found that there 's not an increase in racial tension because of the fact that so many social housing estates have been concentrated and very small dense parts of the city and things are saluted from other parts of the city so there are counties in the states that have addressed that Montgomery County in Maryland one of the most diverse counties in a mirror one of the most fo and in 1974 for an inclusionary zoning law requiring there to be moderately priced units and their projects and it 's been really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now 's the time to be looking at making sure that social and affordable housing just spread across our entire city not concentrated in just a few pockets that it can exacerbate social problems so strongly support this being added as a higher priority and think that it 's really important that we do think about where the future of affordable in social housing goes in our city so very happy to endorse this policy I think it sets and in place a time to start an action stuff start doing some work which is incredibly important around the future well-being of our city down I just want to say that I 'd support this policy from the limited time that I 've been here but I 've been around a number of the organizations from the outside who have been working on creating this policy and from what I 've seen with the inclusion of the Human Rights Commission and some of the other organizations it 's really good to see that collaborative approach to actually starting to sort out some of the issues not just that the council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passionate about doing that stuff to look after our homeless people in our city and make sure that they did sorry that there is that security of tenure now I 'm really concerned in my view moving looking at the future of disruptive technology has been mentioned before about the potential for people losing their jobs to technology and what that means for people who have mortgages or rents to pay and those sort of things so I think this is a really interesting time that we actually need to start thinking about those issues homes and my opinion are the most biggest reason for inequality in our whole country probably in the whole world the the difference in you know using that as a collateral and and you know all those kind of things that make that issue and I think this is a really good way to start making that a bit more even for people who can 't get on that letter one of the things I really came to sort of see as we start becoming and looking at the city of opportunity is to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity aren 't lifting our most awful houses possible or if there 's any of those sort of things and I don 't want people coming to christ church looking for opportunity and being left out and looking for housing and not being able to find that when they want to find it and there 's also one other issue that I want to bring it up is the s 's whereas housing and I was just looking in the policy hold on technologies a bit slow the location housing that provides for physical safety is away from locations that threaten the health of its occupants and allow access to services one of the big things that I 'm really are concerned about is moving forward we 're going to have a lot of ezard 's whereas houses in our city and I want to make sure that those houses are safe for people not necessarily for people who have bought them to own them to do them up but I don 't want people to be left in those houses who are vulnerable people in our communities that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not habitable so I think we also need to think about when we enact this policy to actually start looking at those things and I think this is a really good thing for the Central Ward as well we want to get more people living in the Central Ward and I think having a diverse central city is what 's going to make our whole city at really vibrant and lively place to live so I think I on those bases I do support this policy and I think I want to put some congratulations to councillor Livingstone for making it heaven all team if it over something so I think yeah all the people that have been involved i think is really cool around you have done them yeah i think it 's absolutely fantastic Thank you Thank You Jimmy I beliefs on police issue because I only 11 where if every thousand households in the end so we need a wet reckless I just base housing prices and also this policy angel even a little late releases from signal council like that into account and also at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the issue all people in culture and forsake the housing that is secure safe affordable water right so we will be human rights kind of evidence compromise the human rights otherwise that these are policy actually together the concert decision protection especially we review those that are containment this kind of separate us you implicate Oh mark mark ii hope housing affordable housing and also the social awesome is made of all kinds of people in a church community needs and also this one particular son of speaker nation we have consultation is asia before all those kids they odors EK CDHP i just use council and fiber communal member in the some other canada such a jury 's candle of sitting white color masa and get a rebate we have men are mainly impulsively very good but also try to emphasize you need regular schedule one less kind of the reason for our commonly considered how to implement in the future more efficiently more effectively and the base on these the other priority but also this palace is high-level strategic allure a document the implementable continue to follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason I support this one thank you right yeah thanks yep I 'm very supportive of this policy I mean I think it 's clear that housing policy has been just a massive failure of government over the last eight years and that 's created the huge problem we have which is where we we have to talk about affordable housing as if it 's something that is you know kind of unusual I think you know to address Dave 's question about you know the contractual aspect well the problem is government hasn 't fulfilled their side of the bargain but i think you know in terms of having a different approach to tenancies and having longer tenancies and building a culture or being long-term tenants will hopefully help to build better neighborhoods and actually ultimately people will take more pride and care of the places they live and i think that 's what we would hope to to get out of this one thing I 'd like to see maybe a little bit stronger in here is actually building some houses so is the army said you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we don 't have a lot of new houses which is exactly what we need councils have been responsible for some of that with restricted planning processes and urban growth boundary you know pushing up the price of land which is ultimately the big problem we have so I 'd like to see a little bit more focus around actually how we 're going to deliver a lot more more homes and there 's lots of ways of doing that so I think this is a great start and I think it 's going to be a very important area for us to focus on oh good all right Erin yeah I just don 't start by just clarifying the figures i use before they were based on the average income and if you ring New Zealand 's largest bank which is ain 't even ask them how much money they 'll give you a few of 1265 dollars in your household a week they said it would be more which of 160 thousand dollars so that was where that number came from that I was using yeah sorry not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now because they were one bitter for me I 'm okay with this policy I 'm not they 're excited because it doesn 't have the measurables I 'd like to see which is around our social housing and the and a clear policy that would show that we 're going to grow our social housing at the rate that we 're growing our population I think the only difference between christ church in auckland as far as the housing issues goes that their populations growing faster so their problems bigger house was growing that class would be in the exact same problem because no one in christchurch is really solving that problem it 's good that we 've got a start point that 's at least something but we 're just lucky we don 't have that population growth there needs to be more houses built and I think they need to we need to start talking smaller rather than just more and that 's where the real issue is it 's an environmental one as well as an affordable one just the sheer size of them so we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of houses that have been built and seeing it delivered in the paper potting that Jonnie referred to in the different neighborhoods it 's weird that we would sign off a subdivision somewhere that doesn 't require saving scene of the sections or or a number to be to go into social housing and however that 's done the developers could sell their wares sections first up straight away someone would be buying them it would make sense but it should be a requirement because that would be the better way to live I 'm not sure how many here have lived in a state house I have in that sucks it was a real crappy neighborhood with lots of cars on the front lawns and stuff like that when you put all the people with lots of problems in the same neighborhood just get lots more problems and we should be undoing that in people products the way to go the smart parts of Europe have done it some parts of America and we will eventually learn the lesson very good all right Tim so just quickly there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to findell to other areas there were in cloves of social housing and it worked really well so somewhere along the line someone had a bright idea that that took that lens too expensive the other Soviet government actually all sorry I didn 't want to give you an end here but that 's okay I mean that the true and go back to davis point in part of refs thing if you give a child a true home and a roof over their head you will give them a sense of belonging a sense of Worth and that will turn them from a subject to a citizen and dead as we should be concentrated it 's where we should start and that pepper potting will ebb stead to that so I think this is a good first step but that is exactly what it does say and think it all the work done I 've now been forced to say something when I wasn 't going to and what you know I just think that one of the one of the you know I agree with what Dion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will leave our city but there is something else going on that I am deeply uncomfortable about and that is the way that the there 's been a separation between those the qualification mechanism for a state house and the delivery of the state housing so housing New Zealand no longer have a say over who goes into their houses it 's all done through MSD and it 's all based on a roof over the head while they need the financial support and then off that is not about building communities and it doesn 't work here I don 't think it works anywhere but I can only speak for Christchurch I think it 's hugely damaging I 'm already seeing the results and some of the neighborhoods where we where there are large collocation of state houses which have had the benefit of a community renewal approach over a more than a decade which has seen a fundamental change to the way those neighborhoods are and how they feel about themselves you know I mentioned that annoyed community the affirm festival you know what a powerful word of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their community housing New Zealand well that the Ministry of Social Development is destroying the very essence of what makes that community work by actually putting in place individuals who require considerable degree of support or supervision I say carefully because of the nature of the backgrounds that they bring into a vulnerable community and I say that that 's wrong you know so I think that Christchurch having a strong housing policy will enable us to go to central government and say to them if you want out of building communities then we we put our hand up we can help you we can take over housing New Zealand houses we 've got a Community Housing Trust now which is at lums length from council it has only forty-nine percent I 'm holding give us the responsibility because I don 't think that any one of us wants to see what has been an incredible effort to build communities and build resilience and I know some people don 't like the word but to build resilience within those communities just to have a policy that completely ignores that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know so I 'm just aa got that off my chest now so on that note i will put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that is carried unanimously thank you","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Plan,5PtFAKgeE6U,20161101,540.32,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1385,it 's the North Haven Road burn your skin plan item number seven there were this more than one community board involved in this and there was I think a suggestion that we add some wording just to make it clear that should any changes in terms of scope or budget be required in order to take on board in order to progress this because that I mean that the document itself does identify some issues in relation to potential budget and scope issues that the the measures be referred back to the community board before they come back to Council so that the the community boards the the first port of call before it comes back to Council not the AG committee which the committees are not yet established but the community boards are so following the receipt of tenders that any proposed changes and scope or adjustments to the plan renewal program budget yeah or adjustments be referred to the joint community boards for discussion and their recommendation recommendations to come back to Council right to the council yep just too many voids now sits in us in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's that it 's now just the two that 's the joint community boards but it 's the relevant the joint two and meeting yes to a meeting council to come to it a meeting of the council for decision or a meeting of the joint community boards for their for discussion in their recommendation yep alright yeah the of the relevant of the relevant to a joint meeting of the relevant community boards and I 've moved moved the weird joint to a joint meeting of the relevant community boards that 's two yes two sides all right yeah right okay Oh Yanni yeah I just wanted to add an additional resolution around just seeking a workshop with a Ryan to discuss undergrounding of wiring so I recognize that it will be to avoid be able to be done in time for this street but actually it was raised in the submissions we did ask for information back from Rome which we 've had and I think it 'd be really good as a council to meet worth a Ryan to get a kind of just a discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know it 's something that 's worth doing or maybe not but actually would be good to update it we used to have a policy where we did it on minor and major arterials and council cut that budget a few years ago but I think it is time we to have that conversation again yeah I actually support this I think it 's a very good idea for us to have a workshop with Orion the reason is is that I mean I know I 've got I 'm a big fan of Iran so you know they spent a lot of money many years ago building resilience into the network which has which saved actually our city from being without power for over three months that would have been the effect if they hadn 't strengthened just the substations alone they 've reinstated would have created what they 're calling the northern loop which has actually provided for mechanisms for redundancy right throughout the network so if one area goes out they can rejoin somewhere else I actually think that the whole council would benefit from meeting with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done but at the same time address that assured that yannis raised which is can we get more underground the cost of going underground is hugely significant and you know I always wonder why it can 't be done at the same time as enable going down our streets but maybe that 's something that we could ask and have answered at a at a seminar yep and i can tell you support that too but clearly from what you 're saying julia and this has to be discussion with Orion would need to be in the context of of the cut of the current an underground I guess the underground underground in a strategy or policy that we already have yeah but the issues of undergrounding services it 's in the context of what of their entire work program because I think people actually need to know what they 've done in order to build resilience into the network going forward I mean they had to I mean there are regulated entity they had to prove to the Commerce Commission that some of their pricing wasn 't taking advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to improve the resilience of the system I mean we are very fortunate that that we have our own I 'm worried about other cities perhaps not being as well prepared as we were look there 's no doubt that the work that they did it for it reinforcing the smaller substations really saved us over what we 've been through but I think we 've also got to be realistic with regards to what we 're doing for the future you know we want to keep rates down we want to do a whole lot of things but the expense of underground when we meet with Iran which i think is a really good idea when will the work programme be back to normal for us as a city because if you look at the cost per kilometer to if you do 10 kilometres it could be a community pool you know that those money doesn 't it 's not magic money we 've got actually pay for all this we are in a tight position we 've got to look at what the priorities are for our city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can get the undergrounding at some stage but right now I don 't think it is a priority for our communities yeah no end to agree but it 's not it 's not the point of the workshop alone and I want it to actually reflect that so hold a workshop with Iran representatives to discuss to discuss the network because we actually need to understand the network and the work that they have done to build resilience into the network post the earthquakes and where that leaves us with respect to issues like the undergrounding of services I think that 's really good because the other thing that is there is an issue with mature trees so if you think some of the special immunity areas or the areas that have those huge mature trees and the whole health and safety now the way in which those trees get maintained so there 's a lot of other issues and other than its not just a case of putting things under because it looks better but actually there 's things around Network resilience urban amenity in terms of trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good to be informed it 's not to take a position one way or another but somebody to understand i 've got i 've had a literature search done through the library and it 's interesting their oath really you know different views around the benefits of it so i just think it would be really timely for this knee out sort of get informed on it and end and their program of undergrounding the undergrounding the lines is it or underground services services so the increments make the point again that in fact what counsel your hands to just referred to really their background to that must lie and air current policy so it will be clearly when we have the workshop it we need to understand their context if it will get a briefing before that before the workshop okay so that 's that 's good all right so would someone like to move the motion Yanni second up by dion is there any discussion I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye as opposed they know that 's carried,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

2,c-FbOzR88UM,20161101,1368.95,"Christchurch, New Zealand",3757,we 've got two items we 've got the notice of motion from councillor johansson with respect to city care and I think as I 've said on a couple of occasions already you know we 've got a new council there isn 't a lot of background you know the in terms of the history behind the significance and engagement policy which we 're required to review every three years through our lpp process and in terms of what constitutes a strategic asset so without without so instead of the report just talking about the requirements around consultation that the suggestion is that the resolution also refer to what can constitutes a strategic asset for the purposes of the significance and engagement policy and then I think picking up on some of the points that were made in the presentation before what obligations arise from being a strategic asset as opposed to being a significant asset that isn 't on that on that list what difference does it make and I think that 's going to be quite a useful report but generally but i do want to mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enable because that one I 've actually gone back to and you might have guessed that from the questioning that I put forward in relation to to enable and that is is that I 'd rather than look at it from the point of view of it having been raised as a matter and the annual plan last year I 've actually gone back to the original decision and that was in relation to the long-term plan and in the long-term plan process we certainly were very clear about being able to proceed with sales without going back for a further console the ltp process was sufficient to support the sales that would occur enable was explicitly excluded from that because there was no intention to sell any shares in fact we said we couldn 't even contemplate that until 20 21 so I would much rather then get into a detailed discussion about what makes an asset strategic or not and the absence of a paper that gives us that opportunity to really consider what a strategic and modest and come back to reinstating enable to the list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy on the basis that the council decision to remove it could be considered to be unconcerned with the consultation document which precluded any consideration of selling any interest and enable until at least 20 21 and in that way it 's not referring to the annual plan consultation that 's actually going back to the very beginning and then we can have a conversation as a council about what is the strategic asset and what 's not and we can do that off the back of the paper that will come back to Council as a response to younger henson 's notice of motion well the theory this there 's more than one so if is if council Johansson are you happy for those two additional criteria to go into your notice of motion okay so um so do we want to deal with the with the total together or do we want to deal with them separately okay all right so um so if we could so I think that you you want them voted on separately or should we deal with them separately because I watching were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to okay I just I just don 't view city cures strategic assets I know but we 're not an see we 're not we 're not having that discussion today i no understand it what we 're doing is we 're asking for a report that talks about what constitutes a strategic asset for the purposes of the significance and engagement policy and then all of the other issues yeah so the decision on siddiqui i will i will vote for this notice of motion i think this is a good way forward and it enables the real assure around the difference between being a strategic asset and not being a strategic sh gives us an opportunity to thoroughly debate that in the public arena which i think is a good thing to do the reason that i want to put take the what I think as a decision that that could be challenged the original decision to take it off the strategic asset list I 'd much rather reinstate enable as the basis of that decision not being one that could be well it could be challenged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list and we can have the debate some stage in the future you know when we discuss what 's a strategic asset and what 's not so we 're not discussing whether enables a strategic essays or not we 're discussing reinstating it to the strategic asset list so that we can start from scratch in that regard yep right so they 're two separate things so Yanni you would like to move your notice of motion so do I have a stickin to afford that Glenn well Glenn got his hand up first and and so do you want to just deal with that first or do you want to deal with the two of them together I 'm happy just to deal with two of them together I mean I said time ok so I 'll come to the two you owe it to that my my wording which I I i will move my Widow don 't have a seconder for my wedding hendry it was sight unseen yay good cool alright so now does anyone have any questions of Ian in the meantime because if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only question I have is the the timing around the report back on city care and the ability for the discussion that Leanne referred to on what is and what isn 't strategic how quickly are we likely to be able to get that report back am I just for fear to my colleague in and colleague down below if I said before the end of the year is that enough time because we still have a few things to do either there or well gosh wouldn 't November narrow aren 't we so and the last meeting before Christmas I thinks the 15th yeah so what if I undertake to bring it back to you for consideration at the meeting of the fifteenth of December yeah now that 's fine I mean you need the time it takes to too we all need the time it takes to do this thoroughly so that we end up with the right answer having gone through a good process so that 's the time it takes then that 's the time it takes to oh but wait unti no just a point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does that mean that city gear status remains where it is or is that still challengeable yeah yeah yeah in both instances it stays that as it as but I think the chances of that I 'm bailing a pretty low just so yep cool right so any more questions so that the notice of motion doesn 't change the status of city care it asks for a report which we have now been told will be reported to the meeting on the fifteenth of December so could we have that on there no no no no no oh yes meeting to the council meeting on the 50 yeah yeah I mean that 's the purpose of the report I mean I 've made it clear that I don 't support the reinstatement of City care to the strategic assets list but you know that 's a discussion that we can have but I 'm still going to support the notice of motion because it 's asked for a report around a number of details and I think this counts on new council has to have a discussion about what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arise from the classification of an acid as a strategic asset all right so um yeah Liam would you like to start off the debate yeah um thank you so as has been noted this is calling for a report we 've got we 've got a report in front of us but I appreciate that we 've got new counselors who don 't know the full history of what 's happened in terms of the city care sales process in terms of that capital release process and also our significant and engagement policy so I actually do think it is prudent to ask for that additional information to come back to strengthen that report so that when we make a decision all councillors can feel comfortable with a level of knowledge about it my personal view is that now that the sales process in terms of the offer was not accepted sooner we can give certainty to the fate of city care the bitter and if it 's putting it back on the strategic asset list then I think that 's a good thing to do but again I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think the other point that comes through in the report is and that 's really the crux of d an assessment around whether or not previous consultations we had sufficient information so what you find and in the report was that both the consultations in 2015 and 2016 the majority of submissions on the proposed kapil release program opposed council giving up ownership control of its strategic assets at which time city care was a strategic asset and again and it 's all associated I report a decision to return city kill or enable to the strategic asset list would reflect the views expressed by the majority of scimitar so you know I think if we wanted to we could do it now but people want further information and that 's fine in terms of CITIC here in terms of an able like I just think the way it was taken off certainly I don 't think people were clear in terms of the consultation document and I think it 's really important given that we had deputations or submission through our annual plan this year that we respond to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please put it back on the strategic asset list and therefore I am more than happy to do that today because I think that 's a really clear response to submissions and I just think enable is an accusing important asset for our city a strategic asset and we should actually list it on our strategic asset list now as the point has been made that doesn 't stop you from selling off the assets but what it does is it actually goes the community and the public a level of I think confidence over if anything 's going to be done then there is a degree of public consultation and engagement that would have to occur and it 's a highest threshold in terms of having it on that list than not having it on that list so I can 't see any reason why we would not put it on the list and if we need to deal with it in the future then we can deal with it and so forth so I 'd like to move these notices of motion and I think the additional one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think but fundamentally as part of the annual plan or the draft annual plan counselors will need to approve another or make amendments to the sentiment and engagement policy so I think it 's timely that we get the information that by the end of the year then that can inform the draft annual plan and we can go and have a conversation with our community if we need to pick up ref yeah I 'm very supportive of this I think clearly enable is a strategic asset as a piece of core infrastructure for the city I 'm also supportive of the the motion around city care I think I mean I don 't think it is a strategic asset but I think it 's important for the public to be able to have a conversation and actually understand more about what is strategic and what isn 't and I remember in the course of the last term doing a cup of a couple of public sessions with people about the capital release program and you know a lot of people came up to me said I wasn 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that I didn 't understand it so actually the more conversations we have with the public about these assets the better decisions will be able to make in the future I 'd Jamie I would ask that you sounds like you 're putting them separately and that 's good so I will be supporting the motion to reinstate an able to a strategic to the strategic asset register for the reason that just as ref said end and I believe you know why you were moving this is that I believe it is a strategic SE that 's it 's a tricky question when you ask someone you know what makes a strategic asset strategic and and obviously the notice of motion here is going to impart answer that but my view is the discrete EG guess it it 's not limited to but it 's generally a piece of key core infrastructure monopoly and what makes the strategic assets strategic in my view it 's in steam which our shareholding is society achieve its wider goals so our seaport our power port our data port all of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supporting an enable being returned to the strategic asset register as the disruptive technology that exists absolutely but I think there 's you know good chance that disruptive technology it 's guaranteed will always be invented but it has to plug in somewhere so if you 're talking about data it doesn 't matter how how wireless you go in this you can first find something that 's fast in the speed of light I always see fiber being relevant as far as ask a question of what effectively constitutes strategic asset I won 't be supporting that because I just see no point in spending time and money trying to answer a question that I already know the answer to a contracting company in my view is not a strategic asset simple is there so I can 't see why we 're going through the motions and spending valuable resources just to entertain someone that wants to in my view mate political points so I think it 's a nonsense and I won 't be supporting asking that question but I will support the miRs move to reinstate an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jimmy what 's next yeah I support least my main reasons at least 10 in person start report the sufficient information to us in December total system twister significance in engagement Thomas give it a metaphysician of the inconsistencies firstly on sentence regarding enable or the city care this he said but we might be taken the negatives issue sometimes because different review how able I was impressed the last week they invite us to the city of atl was the wedding impressed know their classification last year this year 61 seventy percent even scarves education 74 simply singer it also else except a de facto anything stiffness of humor undress is your counselor control our skillful and therapeutic and also create the day party but it 's not meant as a courtesy here main purpose it this is more inconsistent with policy so how supportive thank you I 'm entry day on clean I 'll deal with city care in the notice of motion first and I think it 's important that councils focus on the matter that we 're actually considering today the matter in front of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or whether it 's not the question in front of us today is do we want to have a report so that we can have a sensible informed debate about that and I think it 's important to note that we 've got a number of new councillors around the table who haven 't been part of the previous discussions around what constitutes a strategic asset and what doesn 't and I also think there 's some some history around you know conversations about city care that we had in the less council term that need to be socialized and need to be known by those new councillors so there isn 't an asymmetry of information or even a lack of information around the table that feeds into what needs to be a sensible informed and measured debate and it 'll be great to have it in public about whether city care in fact is a strategic asset or not but that 's not the question we 've been asked today the only question women has to deal with today is whether we want a report in my view to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if that wasn 't supported to be honest unable I certainly agree with the approach been taken and I 'll be supporting obviously the motion put in front of us today there 's an interesting comparison between Orion and then able and if Orion is a strategic asset as a reticulated of power then surely enable must be a strategic asset as a reticulated of information data and fast information and data at that so I think if we needed to get into a substantive debate about whether enable was strategic or not there 's one clear answer again the way that the motion has been put today we 're not needing to get into that debate and I certainly agree with both the the process and we 'll be supporting that outcome and Dion I just want to say thank you to the people who presented before but also thanks to the council for giving us the opportunity while giving me the opportunity to understand a little bit more about what actually as a strategic asset because I 'm not one hundred percent sure and I 'm sure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not know so I think as we learn boy as I learn I think actually we can actually take our communities along that journey as well because enable is quite clear cut about being strategic from what councillor Turner just said before but the red bus and the city care are not as clear-cut and I 'd like to understand a little bit more about those before we can actually make decisions on what happens to their future and as of what counselor Jay your Hanson said before about giving those companies some certainty about moving forward we need to make sure that the people that are working then those organizations do have some very good clear instructions about what they 're doing into the future because we are moving into a period of our recovery in every generation where we do need to have some certainty about what 's going to be happening with our infrastructure and our our transport systems and those sort of things so I think in these conversations that we need to have about what is a strategic asset and how that actually contributes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our communities on board with us on those conversations will be really important so thank you good Glenn okay thank you just part of your response my friend and colleague councillor Jamie she would spend a bit of time and money on this simply because we are new council and we have five new councillors we did in the previous term spend considerable time gathering all the financial information which we needed for people to arrive at I 've the decision making and I think its not only political there 's some other considerations as well and we need that wider context so I know you you might have your view on that I totally appreciate it but I think for the new counselors in all fairness it would be good to provide that that wider context this seems to me a reasonable move to support having a report so that we can eat at least out of the starting blocks with the same information in heavy level playing field so I would support us doing that and with an able yes no question being strategic very good so i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ johansson i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no no so to know though councillors golf

NZ,NZ,Christchurch City Council,Christchurch City Council,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZETwErnCvvgbvBbnnHfyxA,20.10.2016 - Item 9 - Submission on Proposed Block Offer 2017 - Part 1,yIF_x2h3dTk,20161101,2594.81,"Christchurch, New Zealand",6668,I 'm right can we move now as a as a council to the submission on proposed block offer 2017 item 9 on your agenda and could we have staff at the end of the table this is a because of the brand new council could staff introduce themselves when they come to the table that would be great good morning on Helen Beaumont hit a strategic policy and I 'm Diane jalandhar I 'm in the natural environment team in Helens unit and we do we do have a couple of updates to the paper if you 'd like us just to touch on those yes please we said yes one is regards the Paris agreement that was recently ratified it was ratified after at the paper was submitted for this council meeting and just a suggestion that that might want to be included in the submission in particular the national targets for the medium and long term thirty percent below the two thousand five submissions by 2030 eleven percent below 1990 by 2030 and fifty percent below 1990 by 2050 and the government proposes to meet these targets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participation in international carbon markets so that was that was one the other was mentioned in the first deputation and that is the MFE report on our marine environment 2016 and again this came out just last week and it was after this paper was submitted in particular in that report there were a couple of things of interest that word not in the submission that relates to exploration and extraction and this had to do with sediment plumes and the extraction process what the report says and I 'm just reading part of it the burning of fossil fuels is major cause of anthropogenic global warming and ocean acidification on a local scale the extraction of fossil fuels such as oil and gas from ocean-based wells can have environmental impacts oil and gas extraction can adversely affect the marine environment although the effects are localized potential sites for mineral extraction are being surveyed and explored sediment plumes produced by the extraction process can affect an extensive area as the suspended sediment spreads the plumes reduce food availability for some species smother seabed species such as corals and reduce light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are residues from extraction and effluent can harm plankton and fish species this is a direct from the report that MFE released last week so you 're suggesting that they 'd be included in the submission does create very good does anyone have any questions a poor lane and then phone it last one to see Sarah Louise may explain what they are um well it 's I 'm assuming it as part of the drilling drilling into the seabed the report itself doesn 't go into detail so I 'm just making some assumptions yeah yeah yeahs our foe and then Sarah join can I ask you there 's been some discussion about how long it might take to if in the event of a of our spell to actually fix that wall plug it and but I know Tony report a comment from Dane Maxwell really saying that in fact internationally there isn 't actually equipment available which would deal with any spell because of the depth of our ocean and the roughness of the ocean I just wonder if you might comment on it yeah that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the matter um yeah the challenges because of the depth that some of these wells would be executed hm wheels or production wells we would be placed in around our coast um there 's a much more challenging environment than most of the other places where oil is is extracted and even where the equipment does exist it actually will take some time for that equipment to get to where it is in the closest location is Singapore to get to New Zealand get placed get set up and actually start to mitigate for example a a blowout in a well so it 's there 's quite a bit of time involved in just getting the equipment and the reason for that is it 's that equipment is quite specialized it 's extremely expensive and the government the country does not have the resources really to try to build its own to have on hand which is why we have international agreements with those that do have the equipment so even where the equipment is available there 's still that risk in terms of the time it takes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San chrétien excellent good thing Green does they stop everyone right Thank You Don you mentioned the Paris agreement that can you recall in the Rio is sumit back in nineteen ninety how how high petroleum exploration featured in terms of conversations around climate change at that time was that oh I might defer to Helen on that I don 't recognize but it 's fair to say that it has been on the agenda on the international agenda for discussion for several decades the Paris agreement perhaps indicates more willingness to actually take action rather than talk about it so potentially reaching back prior to Rio in 1990 26 years ago okay thank you there any other questions Yanni see anything as a council from central government around what the ratification of that agreement means for us this there 's a lot of information on the Ministry of the environments website around what the ratification of the agreement means but it is it is a national set of targets in commitments rather than specific targets that are rolled down to local government and the primary mechanism by which local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy with the rollout of the emissions trading scheme so the emissions trading scheme is being reviewed and potentially expanded into sectors that have previously been excluded and it 's also being reviewed in terms of ensuring that the price of carbon isn 't undermined by changes in the international market so it 's the emissions trading scheme that will change things across the country rather than a specific direction and targets for local government just following on from that because it 's certainly our intention to sign the compact of mears at when we are in a position to do so so in terms of the you know I always worry about this idea that all these frameworks are government government when actually at city to city that you can make the most difference and you can actually achieve the outcomes that actually a country can 't achieve on its own not unless it 's got a lot of cities on board so would that be a better response to the question around you know whether the government 's Russian to us telling us what we should be doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and telling them what we 're doing to actually implement our obligations agreed in the competitive Mears is indeed a way that christchurch canceled show that leadership as a city and a commitment to that transition to a lower carbon economy both from how the council behaves but also how it provides incentives to the business community to behave thank you yeah all right um so now Vicki you 've got some enim and amendment to us so before I open it up for debate will just because I think there 's a certain direction that we 'd like this to go so oh nice it 's just big diaper so essentially do you want to just speak to what you 're proposing hope you might wear your you can move at them Castle strengthen its position so that it 's take fool me it 's impeccable opposition to oil drilling off the coast of Afghan group NH meeting where else and that at us he came to also certain at a time sorry I 'll move that that the council submission is adopted but that it 's actually strengthened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something that we really don 't want to be polite on this is and so that the what I 'm suggesting is that we strengthen a position position so that we state and play our implacable opposition to oil drilling off the country coast that we ask again who at the moment have not yet made a submission as i understand it to also submit and also ask nighter who are there only other people eerie and happy who are allowed to and that we delegate to a committee of Pauline Sarah term and I to actually strengthen us in time it will still state all of the same things that are in there but it will just have a very clear message that this is not what we want from Christchurch and the reasons for that I think we 're covered incredibly well bassiana and fall and by many others that the whole thing of this is complete environmental and economic lunacy and we cannot for a moment think that this makes any sense even economically just even if we could put the environment aside for a moment even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tourism all of those things depend on our clean green almost or not image but at least the image is is there if we destroy that we actually destroy the economy of Canterbury we 've seen that what happens in a disaster in this case the oil companies apparently have unlimited liability and I can imagine as an oil company how they 've limited that we have no capacity as a country to deal with an oil spill if you 've seen the Deepwater Horizon movie even though it 's a movie what happened there was days and days and weeks and months of oil spilling in and it spun out and that it just cannot be this is a deep-water alongside a marine mammal reserve a marine sanctuary the oil doesn 't know that the sanctuary starts there and even if it did that the risks associated with this are just too too revolting to even contemplate we cannot as we understand it refine any of the oil in New Zealand so even if the argument were that we could become independent in terms of oil it makes no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are sufficient reserves of oil that the world cannot process cannot use if it actually wants to keep this planet livable so this to me is like a nightmare scenario that people would come in and think that our coastline our water that is so much about of us was somehow for sale to oil companies to come and do what they want with none of us having the capacity to actually a deal with any of the consequences it 's it is complete environmental and economic lunacy and I cannot believe that a government that has ratified the Paris agreement that comes into effect on November the 4th that the world has adopted and that we are going to be part of a major climate change strategy as even contemplating drilling for this oil it 's it is lunacy there is no other word for it so I 'm happy to move dear would you like to see him there are there any speakers Yanni Glenn thore oh right I 'll come I 'll get you I need a pin can I say I totally support the resolutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we make very strong reference to our opposition to me it 's really simple the exploitation of our earth for economic profits at the expense of our environment is short-sighted is fiscally irresponsible and is morally wrong it is totally unacceptable sadly what we know with this government it 's a strong supporter of asset sales and it has and will continue selling off our most valuable and yet most vulnerable asset which is our environment it has no shame in privatizing the benefits of doing so while at the same time making us as a city in a region in Heroes unfairly the ongoing liabilities risks and consequences in the hypocrisy of this edit doing this with little to no democracy over the decision-making in this regard it excludes the public from making submissions and ignores those who selectively requests it to participate so this is like deja vu every year we put a submission opposing it every year the government keep saying we 're going to go out and do more I think that 's really sad it 's sad because in Christchurch and Canterbury it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic human rights to participate in the things that affect us and future generations have been taken away by those in the Beehive simply because we as a city and as a region believe in enhancing and protecting our environment rather than exploiting it look at the second of a can over water I think that this submission is really important that we are very strong worded in terms of what we say the current course of action is of great concern by this government the cost to our city and our country not if but when something goes wrong we 'll be horribly expensive and long-lasting it is simply unacceptable to what our future at risk with activities that harm and hurt rather than help and nurture our planet so I would encourage everyone around this table today to make a very strong stance in support of the representations we 've heard from the community I thank those people those citizens that have taken the opportunity to come and talk to us today but also the citizens who have made ongoing efforts to raise us in terms of public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be great to Cindy unanimous signal to government that we are totally opposed to what they 're suggesting Phil gleam in Andrew thank you know I want to thank our staff for Nixon report and for that the people who citizens who made such excellent submissions today I think it 's a really sad irony actually that while we 're discussing this issue about reducing carbon emissions that as we 've been told a new zealand as not only as a signatory to the Paris agreement which that and it 's been ratified but I think it actually comes into effect this coming Friday and there 's what a huge contradiction aziani is indicated in Vicki to how our central government have signed up to the Paris agreement to reduce carbon emissions and at the same time government wants to exploit fossil fuels honor and I seashores so it 's really important actually given the lack of democracy in this that our Council exercise our authority from from us as citizens and the leverage that we have as as we 're able to make a submission and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of public consultation and implicitly democracy because clearly the oil companies they all have the essay but there 's no chance for ordinary citizens to even speak up about this some glad people have made their submissions today and we know from evidence of the oil drilling certainly there is the potential for an accidental spill there 's history to that and the clear harm to our marine life and at coastal seabirds and all that as well as the human impact in terms of the potential loss of our tourism so and like the wonderful asset that we do have out with the bank 's financial and Marine Sanctuary that should be that should we should be extending this it shouldn 't be that marine Sankri shouldn 't be threatened with its extension so and there is the question to edits on the report around what insurance would we have and I think the section 3.3 refers to the oil companies having unlimited liability but the report also raises the question about how can you put a monetary value on the impact of a major oil spill because and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be high in fact the consequences and the impact on all spilled in the words of the report could be catastrophic so I feel very strongly about this I think it 's really important that as a council we exercise our decision today and in a sensible way thank you thank you i have a few points which i 'm going to frame is rhetorical questions the first of which is how does the use of fossil fuels actually line up with our approach over future energy consumption the second what is sustainable about drilling for oil even at the risks were put aside my third point it 's been more than 26 years since that is summit in rio and as Helen has indicated and dying as well these conversations over sustainability and climate change have actually been going on for decades we 're pretty out of step fourthly there is another disconnect we 've talked about on the one hand signing the Paris agreement and on the other pursuing this block offer there 's at least another that the government or this administration conferred marine sentry status in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drilling for oil in that same district there 's a real disconnect inside the administration and I think there are inconsistencies throughout their whole worldview they just can 't have it both ways so i used your full support on this and rugby league tombs when you hit back strongly they call it the big don 't argue and i think we should do that today and as vicki has said absolutely strengthen our position staking clearly our implacable opposition to this thank you injury thank you I 'd like to start by thanking staff who worked on the submission and also thanking the people that have come along to speak to us today as well it 's unfortunate this is the only opportunity to make a stand on this and I think it 's great that the opportunity has been taken to speak with us today I 'm in agreement with the submission in its content I 'm certainly in agreement with that submission been strengthened so that we send as unequivocal and stronger message as we possibly can that what 's proposed here is unacceptable and I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intending to proposing to delegate delegate approval to to do that too I would draw em councillors particular attention to paragraphs 3.12 3.21 in the submission that 's the part of the submission that specifically refers to the banks peninsula marine mammal sanctuary in including the list at three point 18 of the banks peninsula flora and fauna which could be put at risk by this activity it 's absolutely absurd that this type of activity could even be countenanced let alone proposed to be allowed in a marine mammal century the Texas dolphin is possibly the most obvious of the endangered species that we 're putting at risk here or there 's a proposed to be put at risk the sanctuary is valuable not only in terms of its environmental values but also is social values and it was mentioned earlier that we 're here as representatives of our communities we 're also here as representatives of the whole city I don 't out for one minute that the people of banks peninsula would support us agreeing to anything that put that amazing natural environment and everything that not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city love about that natural environment of banks peninsula and its beaches in its coastal environment I don 't believe the people of the peninsula would support is putting that at risk and I don 't believe the people of the city would support us putting that very special landscape and that very special environment at risk so I support the submission I supports it been strengthened as much as it possibly can be and any additional information been put in there that supports through the submission and strengthens it I take a strong position of opposition to this block offer and I encourage my colleagues around the table to do the same David and then Sarah I 'm going to be the renegade of the party I 'm not at all support of on sorry I 'll just so I 've got three main points to race here firstly i 'm not at all support of political parties where interactive activist groups using the city council as a platform for promoting a political viewpoint an earlier speaker said we should have a special concert consultative process to ensure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'm totally in support of that sort of approach and it 's not reporting the view of a vocal minority of their or vocal section of our community secondly i consider us a bit of an alarmist position and the probabilities are extremely low and certainly climate change in my opinion as very cyclically and as been occurring for millenniums i would have liked to have asked one of the earlier speakers here he would have reconciled the fact that geological and fossil evidence substantiates that the level of carbon dioxide and air atmosphere was greater in Roman times than it is now I believe there 's probably more chance of a supertanker crisis off the coast and that would be a mishap offshore at present time rightly or wrongly we are reliant on fossil fuels for a huge part of the world economy and New Zealand 's and dependence from the variances of crude oil prices would be a great advantage to economy Vicki made reference earlier to Cantor v being a an economy that 's totally reliant on agriculture tourism and a couple of other things I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on fossil fuels to generate their the income that they do and thirdly I think this is probably the most important point in my mind disruptive technology i believe will in a relatively short time substantially remove the reliance of fossil fuels and the gate the issues that a lot of people are talking about the huge advances that we 're now seeing in solar energy battery storage and a lot of other energy innovations will substantive lee reduce our reliance on fossil fuels i believe in a very short span of time I also believe that we 're on the verge of a new technological age that will radically change our energy options so in summary I believe this is not cool business for counsel technica logical advances will an all probability make offshore drilling in New Zealand an economic and utilizing Council time on these matters in my opinion is unnecessary and unproductive so I will not be supporting the resolution Sarah thank you um I 'm really happy to support this and we looking forward to strengthening our proposal both in the way of objecting to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both environmental and economic impacts they have impacts broader than just can 't agree though anything that happens to us happens to the country of our image and reputations damaged spills spread a long way and also the climate change impacts I felt not just locally but globally the same goes for oil drilling anywhere in New Zealand and I 'd like to see a strengthen it to object to all of the block offers because whatever happens to any other part of the country should there be a spell and their emissions from climate change happens to us as well and it impacts the image of the whole country and it impedes us so I 'd like us to not just oppose the ones off the kinder be coast but actually nationally I know thicker you mentioned it briefly and your earlier comments as well there is one thing I did agree with David on and it was the fact that these new technologies are going to actually stop our reliance on fossil fuels we don 't even need these oil explorations and it 's folly to continue with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be said has been said today and I applaud David and his pointing out of why we shouldn 't support drilling off the coast and this roundabout way it was a good way of talking us out of it David thank you and if 0 points out the the technological advances as well as the David but I did watch a program late last night on BBC world where they were making mere electric cars and China using so much coal to feel the plants to do it that the amount of carbon that you would save by using an electric vehicle versus a petrol vehicle was negated by the how you been to get to making that vehicle so let 's be careful which road we go down to get there and speaking of roads this will be the one question I would ask my fellow council members before we support this which no doubt that will be pretty well supported with the exception of one I believe and that is I don 't believe submissions actually go that far to talk the government into changing their mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or walked to council today or this week or will intend to do so because actions speak louder the missions congratulations Mike oh great three quarter there now though I 'm Pauline think you look like Phylly as the Court decide believe at this council cool business when in the report and number two the local government at 2002 states there and performing its role a local authority must act in accordance with the following principles and taking a sustainable development approach a local authorities should take into account the social economic and cultural interests of people and communities and the need to maintain and enhance the quality of the environment and the reasonable foreseeable needs of future generations so we 've heard the risks of the environment it 's our duty at local government level to protect that and as far as the foreseeable needs of future generations I think we can see the way forward that we 're not going to be needing the oil so i will be supportiveness all right so i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye aye those opposed say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those that came and presented to us i think that was incredibly good and end this as a way of putting these things into the public arena and having that public conversation that otherwise we wouldn 't be able to have so thank you very much could I now call keep our assets to the table so you want to marry Horton and Brian Turner welcome good morning morning and i would say for council of children 's benefit i did biker here this morning but then I bike everywhere so thank you very much good morning and my name is Mary Hortons is the river and Brian Turner who 's here is my spiritual advisor okay so I go off message um representing keep eres its canopy and we did not ask for deputation to this meeting because we felt that our position was perfectly clear on this issue but we did actually this morning receive an invitation from the mere to actually make a deputation here we 've had no chance whatsoever to prepare anything so I 've scribbled some notes on an envelope and my only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title is self-explanatory it 's what it says on the shirt so keep air assets I mean it 's pretty straightforward to sum it up we want the whole issue of asset sales taken off the agenda of the Christchurch City Council full stop completely removed not just picking here and there I realize that what you were specifically talking about today on the supplementary agenda paper is the vote to put enable and city care to be restored on to the strategic assets list we think once again this is very obvious that those assets should be put back onto that list should be restored leadless they 're both infect vital parts of the infrastructure not only of christ church but of any modern city as you 're probably aware that we campaigned for something like 18 months against the sale of proposed sale of city care I 'd like to congratulate the council for whatever reason for deciding not to do so it 's their first opportunity to do that and we sit at the time and we say it again here now for example that city care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selling off an infrastructure and maintenance company the equivalent at the local level of the good old ministry of works at a time when the city is undergoing the biggest rebuild in New Zealand history it would be madness to actually that fall under private hands enable broadband infrastructure is the the digital future of not only Christ huge part of the nation it was a very wise move for the council to get internet so city care represents physical infrastructure enabled represents digital infrastructure both of them should be restored onto the street you guess eh list and while we 're at it redbus should also be put back onto the street you guess it 's list and i would say i would agree we would agree with the mayor who said in various campaign meetings that she wanted cross eh to have control back over the buses we fully agree on that that it should be taken away from ekeinde and christ shall be controlling its buses again and those buses should remain in public ownership and they should be on strategic asset list having actually read the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual public consultation on removing an able from the street again strategic assets list before that was done and 2015 but one of the options put in front of you here today is that maybe the public should have to be consulted and before it was indeed restored we would urge that you adopt the option in the supplementary agenda paper of simply voting today to restore an able to the strategic assets list and it 's also worth emphasizing the point that being on that list does not emit self-protect assets from sale it simply means that they have to go through in the case of what is it now orion little import company chrysler jeep or company and apparently eco central they have to go through some kind of public consultation process before they 've been sold its root for the railways in the 1980s so i have personal experience of quote-unquote being consulted before major decisions have been made I mean I see some knowing smiles around the table we 've been through the consultation stuff in the 80s and 90s I know what it feels like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been consulted thanks very much goodbye um the other point we would like to make we 're very pleased that the discussions here today on an able and city care have been removed from and restore removed from the public excluded section of your making and restored to the this public section we think that decisions on any potential asset sales should be made an open session not in public excluded seasons that we believe that the council should function as a parliament not as the board of directors of a private company that you are in fact our public servants let 's have an open government ethos let 's have a public service ethos restored to the Christchurch City Council that open government is fundamental to democracy and we believe that democracy is our greatest asset to complete so what for the council do instead of selling assets well you 're doing it right for a start the priests all over the front page quite recently within the last couple of weeks highlighted that you are infected deferring and delaying major expenditure already on some projects that 's one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second thing is renegotiate the cost year agreement and abandoned some of these ghastly white elephants such as the proposed covered rugby stadium I speak as a rugby fan who went to the final on said denied in ellington I 'm very pleased to study interneting dinner eliminating that I walk to and from the games it 's very handy lesya that 's perfectly sufficient abandon that white elephant note the fact that the biggest event in New Zealand rugby history the British oil the British Lions two are happening in 2017 the All Blacks for the first time in 100 years are not going to be playing any games in apparently South Island we planed to an Auckland and one in Wellington the rugby union which controls us is they wouldn 't come to Christ huge penis the city 's buggered and can handle the Barmy Army of pajmhi fans but I also said they 're not going to go to Dunedin which has the country 's most modern covered stadium and most expensive why because they said d 'Alene not big enough to handle it so effectively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ syndrome so forget about things like rugby stadiums and then in 253 million bucks for that renegotiate their cost rate agreement with the government and not conclude by saying as it says on the shirt keeper is it thank you very much system one questioned in relation to to enable you did you feel that during the consultation process we went through in 2015 to 2020 foot on the 2015 25 long-term plan that there was any indication that we would be looking at the its location on the strategic assets list because we weren 't contemplating selling any shares in it I mean it just occurred to me that perhaps that was the that was potentially you know that people would have felt that they hadn 't really been consulted on it coming off the strategic assets this because we weren 't consulting on selling any shares another I think the the impression that we had uncertainly other people have had wasn 't it sort of a bit being removed from that lesser and slip through unnoticed I mean it hit it I mean I just wondered if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not proposed to explore market opportunities at this time to sell any interest and enable services limited to provide part of the council 's objective to achieve a realization of capital and at that time up to 750 million dollars consideration of the sale may be given after 20 21 when the network is fully built a release from contractual obligations to the government has negotiated and if the council 's need for capital still remains but the release from contractual obligations to the government and some elements as as resolved because we 've now bought out the government but we still have contractual obligations in terms of the delivery of the ultra-fast broadband but I just wondered whether one of the one of the I 'm actually being helpful here I think is that is that perhaps the public didn 't realize that we would look at taking it off the strategic assets list when we made it abundantly clear that we wouldn 't even consider selling any shares and until 20 21 when the network was fully bold as I understand it the purpose of the certificates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are deemed to be strategic and so by rights it just has a consultation requirement so one more step no no it 's it 's the same step it but it 's called the console it 's called a special consultative procedure but it is all it means is that you have a special consultative procedure as opposed to an appropriate level of consultation which is required under the Act anyway so it actually makes very little difference just to the nature of consultation but what I 'm trying to gather from you is whether you because we weren 't actually going out there to say that we were going to sell any shares I mean another instances worth city care we said that no further public consultation would be required so that 's so people wouldn 't have been a surprise that we put that out for sale but they would have been surprised about an able because the neighbor wasn 't up for sale at all none of the shares were as I say I repeat the point that by being removed from that list it gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it can be sold without consultation that 's the public understanding yeah it certainly was made clear in relation to certain assets but not enable which i think is a justification for putting it straight back on the list today absolutely yep green I guess I would because it just that two-step process yeah how clear that was so yes we consulted on selling them but the mechanism by which to remove them how no no no I think if you if you actually look at the but within your we 'll deal with that when we get to the paper because we 're going to get to the paper right now so thank you very much and thank you for taking up the offer of coming too because I really did want to make the point this is a new council this isn 't the council that was here before we 'd like to develop a strong working relationship with all of the groups that care our city every single person stood for counsel because they care about our city and we know that at the heart of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so we want to develop a

NZ,NZ,Christchurch City Council,Christchurch City Council,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZETwErnCvvgbvBbnnHfyxA,20.10.2016 - Item 4 - Public Participation,q7Mpt2C5ZO4,20161101,1270.59,"Christchurch, New Zealand",3363,"to public participation and we have no public forum presentations so we 'll move directly to deputations by appointment and we have two deputations by appointment in relation to the submission on the proposed block offer 2017 and then we have an additional deputation from keep our assets on the item on the agenda in relation to the significance and engagement policy list of strategic assets and so it is my intention to begin what the two deputations by appointment and then we 'll move to the submission on proposed block off a 20-17 and then we 'll hear the submission or the deputation from keep our assets and we 'll move then straight to the item on the agenda in relation to our the significance and engagement policy so um so that 's our work cut out for us and we may even stop for morning tea at the end of that so if I could invite Seanna Fitz John at fitz john and dr. Paul Brody to speak on behalf of oil free auto tahi regarding the staff report on the submission of proposed block off a 20-17 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think we 've got four minutes to submit that it would be environmentally irresponsible for us to open our offshore waters to the possibility of oil and gas exploration and possibly exploitation and this is for its aim on the deviation time as ten minutes but we do know sceles yes so for that four minutes for me I then I Honda don 't hand over to Sierra shy I chased the lucky one with six minutes it is fine I know but but do leave some time for questions of if possible no I fed you but you know started start the clock again sorry it was my interruption okay I 've got thank you yep well I was submission others said is that we think it would be irresponsible to open up for oil and gas exploration and exploitation for environmental reasons you might all have a handout I feel naked without a handout and among the from this is a diagram of what they call the earth system way planet Earth functions hugely complex all these interacting factors and you 'll see in the middle a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those activities have an effect on the whole earth system and it has an effect from the global level to the regional level to the local level let me start with the global level and I 'm sure you 're all very familiar with this but any oil and gas which is removed in our offshore waters will eventually be burnt it will add to carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere and as I 'm sure you know and co2 levels have now built up to over 400 parts per million from 280 parts per million before the start of the Industrial Revolution and this is having an effect on global temperatures global temperatures have increased by about 1 degree centigrade over the last century warmer temperatures are also occurring in the ocean ninety percent of the extra energy that 's captured by the atmosphere now goes into the ocean it 's warming the ocean it will be changing the ocean currents it 'll be changing winds which stir the ocean so the ocean is being mixed in a completely different way and these changes will increase going into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a huge effect on the biology in particular it has an effect on the microscopic plants that the the food won 't there is evidence that the growth of these microscopic plants is decreasing if they decrease there 's less food through all those other organisms in the ocean fish shrimps birds marine mammals so that is a major concern going into the future it would be irresponsible for us to put more co2 into the ocean it all contributes to these effects the other major effect of increasing co2 is acidification of the ocean and again you probably aware that in fact last Friday local people were told in article in the press last Friday which you might have seen pensions acidification of the ocean the editorial in the press last Friday mentions global warming acidification of the ocean and more local effects of the possibility of oil spills as a result of oil exploration and those articles were in response to a ministry for the environment report which summarizes effects of environmental change including global warming acidification on our marine ecosystem for better than I can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up last week New Zealand is slowly becoming much more aware of these issues so there are major issues with relation to warming and acidification there 's also of course if exploitation of these reserves does occur there 's the possibility of all spills so this is where we think the precautionary principle ought to hold in other words if there is an oil spill the effects could be absolutely devastating on the marine wildlife and this is from marine mammals such as the Hector 's dolphin you aware that the Hector 's dolphin population is very low it 's under risk of extinction and birds becoming oiled oil and drifting onshore smothering seaweed bets huge possibilities of devastating damage to marine ecosystems I 'll finish though thank you very much I 've had the four minutes thanks yeah thanks cool cured everyone my name is cyan Fitz John and this is the third deputation I 've made to a local council on oil and gas block offers so over the last five years we have spent a massive amounts of intellectual energy opposing deep sea exploration and New Zealand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drilling goes wrong it will wreak havoc on our marine ecosystems if it goes right it will wreak havoc on our climate oil and gas of fossil fuels so let 's start with climate change the Intergovernmental Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report stressed that if we are to avoid catastrophic climate change eighty percent of known fossil fuel reserves must stay in the ground yet we have a government that is proposing that we look for more the World Health Organization predicted that from 2030 an extra two hundred and fifty thousand human being for year are going to lose their lives to malnutrition malaria diarrhea and heat stress as a result of a changing climate we can no longer hide behind a screen of scientific uncertainty climate change is killing people but we hear this kind of information all the time and human lives are fast becoming a statistic while science can tell us what we might expect that can 't tell us how to care so let 's look at the economics there 's a huge economic risk associated with oil spills and those are borne by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk posed to all industries that rely on a functioning marine ecosystem our laughably low royalty rates ensure that we 'd see pitiful rewards for plentiful risks even within the neoliberal economic model exploring for oil and gas during a climate crisis as akin to flogging and a came horse it 's up against absolutely all logic to risk the health of our oceans to pursue a fuel that is changing the chemical composition of our atmosphere now when we make reputations to counsel it is tempting to do what I just did outline all of the intellectual reasons the oil and gas exploration is a singularly stupid idea deep-sea oil and gas exploration what but also that can come at the expense at the expense of our emotional understanding of this issue deep-sea oil and gas exploration is not still on our government 's agenda because of a lack of scientific understanding it 's still on our agenda because of a lack of empathy for too long we have let people in power dictate what counts as a sensible submission against their senseless proposals economic arguments are the veil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their behavior keeping emotions out of reasoning is a way of keeping ourselves emotionally insulated from the impact of our behavior Western industrial laser net industrialized nations have to stop pretending that our industries and lifestyles aren 't causing immense harm to human and non-human beings climate change occurs because of the cumulative impacts of decisions made in rooms like this deep-sea or drilling threaten spaces that we love and creatures that we know with a disaster that they would never recover from now if that 's not a good reason to be emotional I don 't know what is and when we talk about the impacts of climate change we 're talking about the mass suffering of human beings and an emotional response to that is completely appropriate we 've let science describe climate change as a story of rising co2 in the atmosphere when it 's as much a story about capitalism colonization and exploitation we will not be affected equally by this crisis peoples of experience of climate change are going to depend on their race their gender and their privilege or lack of it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dunedin but to some it 's going to feel like starvation climate change will sound like burning forests that will taste like dehydration and it 'll look like dying crops I don 't know what 's more shocking that one species could change the composition of an entire atmosphere or that we know that our habits are killing people and we still haven 't managed to change them we need to start taking responsibility for the effects of our industries and our behavior we need to recognize that the 2016 oil and gas block offer is an act of slow violence this is because burn fossil fuels exacerbates the crisis that 's bringing displacement disease and death to a lot of people so either we have a government that cannot conceptually link deep-sea oil exploration with the human impacts of climate change or we have a government that can and they still pushing ahead regardless either way that 's deeply concerning our coastlines should not be put at risk to prop up a dangerous industry that 's in its death throes I can always feel were to happen off Canterbury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotional aftermath we 've experienced the trauma of losing a city do we really want to invite the trauma of losing our marine ecosystems because I guarantee you it won 't be the oil executives or the national MPs that are clearing oil and dead dolphins from the beach it 's going to be us as you all know the public aren 't permitted to formally oppose any of the oil and gas exploration processes so we are relying on all of you are elected local body representatives to be a voice of moral reason oceans and coastlines are our home they 're precious to us and to all of the other life-forms that live along them putting living ecosystems a risk to pursue fills that jeopardized humanity 's very future on the planet is a very unique kind of insanity the decisions that we make in today 's world will affect people where we will never meet we will never love and will never laugh with but they 're still people they 're still human beings and I think that we have responsibility to look out for one another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ block offers in the Canterbury basin but to take a strong and morally guided stance against the government 's entire deep-sea oil agenda because no amount of black gold in the world is worth worth rescuing human lives for I think it was such a strong submission that it actually would be diminished by asking in equations so thank you so much for being so passionate about something that really me too thank you and could I invite some with Brian Johnson hi guys Brian Johnson I can 't respond or reply to what was just been seared it was just the rantings ever made religion or me to speak other though it was under budget excuse me for a moment I just want to say that everyone 's entitled to come to the council and express their views so we 'll hear those days you know I 'm talking to you yeah no no I 'm talking to the audience I 'm just asking them to just listen to lightly thank you thank you the council have been quoted in yesterday 's paper is saying they are opposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elected as independents including the male who happens to have a labor background that 's not independent when the council make a decision we 're not going to do something they were elected by the people to represent to the people you should be going back to the people for a decision it 'll either have to be a sophisticated pole or genuine referendum the people will make the decision that 's the only way can go I 'm not opposed to the oil co 2 is not a problem we could take it to 2,000 parts per million will live quite comfortably there 's no problem dr. Patrick Moore you can google of Norway is sitting on a sovereign fund of eight hundred and fifty billion dollars state-owned oil ninety-five percent of the world 's oil is extracted by state-owned government 's new zealand australia and the dopey five percent now we can fight against this drilling and news and the whole lot will go to foreign owners ExxonMobil the other sisters we 're going to lose out completely or we can fight for our ownership or out share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three tenders we will own the company we will own half you 'll be amount going back to the country whoever wants the other half come in the sisters weren 't involved the next tier of 20 oil companies all over each other to be involved we can strike a good deal we have to fight the New Zealand ownership museum and participation and lock their to go down the drain the current government key English if hot the cinder debt for a hundred and twenty billion we 're technically bankrupt we can 't keep going on down the wrong path nor eight hundred and fifty billion dollars the world 's biggest sovereign fund certainly outside of China as any questions i don 't think i can say much more except to start repeating myself I don 't want to do that yeah perhaps if I just do a bit of an explanation that we 're not we 're not the decision makers we are making a submission on the government 's block offer proposal and with the people the public are denied a direct and put unto that which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer in the recent past but this is a new council and the new council is making the decision on the submission today so I just wanted to make that that that all hear that and by way of the council does have a bias for you that they are opposed to it that the previous council was completely opposed to all of the block offers that came up during our tenure and I believe that this council may well adopt the same position that certainly the that 's certainly the way that council have prepared council staff have prepared the submission for us but the debate will occur next so you 'll hear what individual councils have to say but if people have questions that they 'd like to ask well I could add one more thing before I go I better squeeze this one and the royalty system is not working in our favor on oil it 's a secret what the world royalty is no it 's possibly as why was twenty cents a barrel when the price of oil goes up and goes up through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a percentage of the welfare part hasn 't changed in 20 or 30 years there multiple we are being losers but five percent Australia gets eight to see Norway gets one percent because that 's all they need one percent over huge amounts a lot of money so they only get one percent yeah we 've been gouged by the old temple fight for air share Alfred L fifty percent 100% the group of businessman came from Australia to new to Taranaki r IW o australian worldwide all i think they 're cool they poured in a few million they got the whole lot back in 30 six months in we got to do something for ourselves here guys yeah there 's a quick yeah a bit that the only question that I 've got us what about the Brask I mean you didn 't even work there was an oil-rich the oil spill would kill our is no real spill over the North Sea you can stand on the beach of California even see the rigs out on the ocean they 're just SAT there like a containership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the countryside it can we got to get it right guys but if there is a spell what happens to our region but not see no wall street now you 've got to think right you 'll lose the fight and have nothing if you try to stop it 'll go ahead if you don 't want it fight for our sheer and 10 million yani okay I guess just examples of you know North Sea in California they 've got the facilities here at their worst pool i 'm not sure the history there they 've got the equipment to go and take reaction here I think it 's seven days before we could get anything here probably 10 days before anything could really be done and on average i think we 're pumping and our wells and i 'm sure they repair 100 people here that can correct me if i 'm wrong about 10,000 barrels a day so by the time of there were an accident by the time anything could truly be done we would have a hundred thousand barrels of oil floating off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endangered hector 's dolphin etc I mean does it we 've got health and safety legislation which in workplace we have to take steps before we do anything and yet for oil it seems that we don 't achieve to do anything to contain something and what will you can react rather than correct what you 're saying is other countries in building other countries have got an instant response and we take a week that means we 're up wrong metal we just want to change it temple right well thank you very much for coming along I mean we are very open to hearing everyone 's points of view that 's what a council is all about so thank you very much for making let 's get some money in the bank guys thank you thank you right so that was the last 30 years the lottery win win we don 't don 't don 't engage um right can we","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

fact a challenging and exciting one and one which actually gets a lot lots of thanks i 've been so grateful to the many people who 've come up to me over the last three years be it in the street the malls around the park the gardens just to say thank you to me for being their mayor and offering me words of encouragement and support that 's actually what 's kept me going i want to thank my campaign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has offered me so much personal encouragement and support over the past three years i stood here three years ago full of anticipation for the opportunities that lay ahead and as a council we were instantly engaged in the enormous sense of possibility that lay ahead we had so much in common we all wanted to achieve so much i pay tribute to that council who worked tirelessly on getting our finances in order and our insurance settled and i 'm putting the city back on track to take advantage of all of the opportunities that recovery and regeneration offer us all no one should underestimate the importance of what we 've achieved we have regenerate christchurch jointly appointed by the council government and naitahu a partnership that has community engagement embedded in its mandate together we have laid a firm foundation for the city 's future and its place is the international gateway to the south island of new zealand and of course i will add antarctica

setting setting for this for this term with a huge amount of confidence we have already met informally as a council and we are ready to go we have highest aspirations but we also know that the basics need to be done the underground work is almost done so we can put our foot on the accelerator for the roads and footpaths we 'll start to see fewer and fewer cones on our streets and when we do it will be the broadband coming through our description of our city is evolving we are a city with opportunity open to new ideas new people and new ways of doing things a city where anything is possible

got time because i 've told everyone to be very brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term but i want us to have shown at the end of the next three years that democracy means much more than a tick on a ballot paper it has been hugely challenging but enormously rewarding to lead the city through the first stage of the transition from recovery to regeneration now it is time to build on the foundation that has been laid and start to deliver on the promise of the sustainable yet dynamic 21st century city we can become and where the well-being of our communities is always paramount nareda tanakoto tanakoto um so may i invite andrew turner to come forward thank you thanks i andrew david turner declare that i will faithfully and impartially and according to the best of my skill and judgment execute and perform in the best interests of the city of christchurch the powers authorities and duties vested in or imposed upon me as a member of the christchurch city council by virtue of the local

period and also through the last term of council being a family member of a council is not easy for a number of reasons and i 'd like to thank those closest to me particularly my partner glenn for their unwavering support of me and their ongoing confidence in me i look forward to another three years of performing the role of councillor or maybe more correctly i should say performing the roles of councillor both representation and governance the people of banks peninsula can be confident that i will continue to represent them well to ensure their issues which are often quite different than the issues facing the rest of the city will be well heard and well understood and can be sure that by working as part of the new community board i will ensure that banks peninsula issues are resolved and that banks peninsula 's aspirations are met equally my commitment to the whole city is to be good and prudent as a governor to absolutely make the most of the exciting opportunities which are in front of us in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure that issues are resolved and that excellent outcomes are achieved in the next three years for the whole city not just for the city centre but also with a strong focus on our suburban centres and their redevelopment as well areas like littleton sydenham woolston linwood and bishopdale christchurch is in a very exciting period in its history particularly in its transition to a rebuilt and regenerated vibrant modern city and we need to ensure as a council that we take every opportunity presented to us in this term to make the most of that opportunity i look forward to working collaboratively as a member of this new council to playing a role in ensuring that we work together as one effective team to deliver for the city that issues are well debated and that well considered decisions are made and ensuring that the outcomes that were talked about so much during the election period among them equality fairness equity openness transparency engagement accessibility good governance and good stewardship are core planks of everything that we do as a council today 's inauguration of this council marks the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward to it just a warning the rest is in alphabetical order so could i call vicky park i vicky susan back declare that i will faithfully and impartially and according to the best of my skill and judgment execute and perform in the best interests of the city of christchurch the powers authorities and duties vested in or opposed upon me as a member of the christchurch city council by virtue of the local government act 2002 local government official information and meetings act 1987 or any other act something about that declaration can i um first of all say thank you to my campaign committee who had to work so hard you did a sterling job um and secondly i want to congratulate both leanne on being re-elected and i particularly want to congratulate andrew on being deputy mayor and i 'm just thrilled that you are andrew i 've wasn 't a job i wanted and i have to say i 'm delighted that somebody else is going to be doing it so my heartiest congratulations to you i recall actually my dad who actually died about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was embarrassed to tell us that when he was in the army he was called up on a charge of dumb insolence because he laughed at the person in charge of the army and i actually thought it was fantastic and he had such a healthy disrespect for any hierarchies or titles that i see has been genetically passed through our entire family and i 'm hoping i 've passed it on to my kids as well i 'm pretty sure i have so um so i 'm i 've got no problem about what people are called or not i think within each one of us is the capacity to do magic and that resides within you regardless of where in any hierarchical situation and i hate iraqis that there is so i just want to say that i think the best asset any city has is its people and it 's always going to be the people and it 's the brains and the innovation and the creativity and the compassion and the kindness that those people have that make such a huge difference and one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout the city every day the magic that people have worked in this city is absolutely extraordinary and that 's what 's making this city a city where it really is a city where anything is possible and i think that 's the cool thing i have to say just in relation to housing that the chip registration came through today which has only been three years in the making and is absolutely fantastic um in terms of the challenges that we face for the for the next while um given that we have the capacity to do things climate change is going to be one of the huge challenges of everybody not just the city but everybody one of the things that you don 't know and i 'll be incredibly brief is that local government is really very exciting now we keep that incredibly secret so that so that people you know don 't know that but it is actually dealing with really fun things and the capacity that you have within local government to make a difference to people 's daily lives and to the essence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think we all have an amazing opportunity to make a difference and i just particularly want to thank the staff of this organisation who i think do an amazing job every day who are actually really passionate about what they do and who have amazing ideas and innovative ways of doing things themselves which we need to release upon upon the world so thank you and good

current guardians but these guys are the people that are going to take over the bat and they are the ones that are going to inherit the city so i would like in this term to actually see that we as a

information and meetings act 1987 uh and or any other act thank you okay um well thank you for the opportunity to say a few words um i just want to start with a maori proverb it says if you know who you are and where you are from then you will know where you are going as a young boy i lived in bamford street in a small workers cottage that was old and cold i walked the length of garland 's road every day past the unpleasant and obnoxious smells from the industrial sites over the busy railway tracks and across the narrow apala river footbridge through henson 's park on my way to school it was a journey of interesting perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grown-up as a parent and as a city councillor a journey that highlights the importance of representing an area that has a number of competing interests that impact on the well-being of the community across the economic the cultural the social and the environmental spheres and while one 's perspective with age may have changed one 's memories of what they experience can mold them into who they are today being sick suffering from asthma because the air i was breathing was no good and the place i was living was not ideal and yet at the same time also remembering as a young boy floss and griff the warm-hearted retired couple next door who lived in a modern brick house who often invited us over for homemade baking and to give us fruit from their many orchard of fruit trees that warmth and kindness of others who shared with us who were less fortunate than themselves actions such as those are what led me to get involved in politics it what it 's what led me to joining and being a proud member of the labor party standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fair deal for all it 's been and is a privilege to serve this city this term of council i 'm committed to working hard to fix our broken streets and destroyed communities to give a living wage to council employees and contractors to have a sustainable city that protects enhances and nurtures its natural and cultural environment such as trees and heritage a city that shows empathy and equity in dealing with those who have been impacted on hardest by the earthquakes and a city that cares values and involves all of its citizens in transparent and accountable governments that puts people and community at the heart of local decision making on the future rebuild reconstruction and regeneration of our city takatini it is not my strength alone but the strength of many that contribute to my success so i want to thank the people 's choice the labor party my friends and my family for helping support me to be elected to the linwood ward it is where i grew up a large part of my life it is where i have started my family and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where my heart and passion is to serve thank you very much and congratulations to all my colleagues who have been elected and to be sworn in today and to the mayor thank you thank you councillor aaron kuhn um i aaron kuhn to clear that i will faithfully and impartially and according to the best of my skill and judgment execute and perform in the best interest of the christchurch city of christchurch the powers authorities and duties vested in or imposed upon me as a member of the christchurch city council by virtue of the local government act 2002 the local government official information meetings act 1987 the treaty of waitangi in any other act first thanks okay i had a prize for the shorter speech and aaron aaron just won it so there you go councillor glenn livingston i glenn wallace john livingstone declare that i will faithfully and impartially and according to the best of my skill and judgment execute and perform in the best interests of the city of christchurch the powers authorities and duties vested

the new colleagues and returning colleagues technically actually we are all a new council a special special congratulations to the mayor congratulations to deputy mayor as well leanne and andrew and we look forward to working together my family a lot of them are here today going from right to left one of my brothers andrew my wife anthea joshua brianna matthew pete olivier uh judy and eric at the back thank you all for being here you 've always been my support crew uh anthony particularly has had to endure some very interesting occasions during the campaign uh upon which i where i said well do you think the other guy will get me but it turned out that 4947 votes later looked like it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and jeff who 's here as well in graeme they formed my kind of close we campaign team we worked out what we wanted to do jeff and graham hadn 't been in political campaigns but i valued their view from the outside uh to try and get inside the shoes of our constituents and to see what they you know how they would like um a candidate and an incumbent to campaign so i took it seriously i do locked on the final morning of the campaign uh i always do that that 's just me i know vikki 's giving me funny looks that 's that 's just me i guess a couple of things i 'd like to say is that i think we still live in a city six years on from the quakes and it 's a kind of a state of an amplified hierarchy of needs so on the one hand we 've got the big picture reaching for the stars which we must do and continue to position ourselves um strategically but on the other we 've still got to fix all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas so we 've got to somehow hold both in tension together and i really want us to nail these roads and footpaths this term please and to really focus on the most damaged parts of the city the other reason i say that is according to that hierarchy of needs when you actually hone in on that you get greater buy-in and i think people are in a better space to really get onto the big stuff the other thing i want to say which came out of the youth council forum which they hosted a few weeks back when they asked how would you unite the the west and the east of the city i i said i would unite them around the avon or takaro river corridor because i think i want us to really for once and for all break down this east west thing and and get children students of all schools participating in that that whole corridor whether it 's a flat water lake or not whatever it is get us all together and um you know put an end to this which school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'm from the north island so i can say that but let 's just get it together eh and i think the unity starts with us with our awards too your water is my ward my water 's your wood let 's do it for the city so thank you this is a privilege and an opportunity to be in this role and i look forward to our time together thank you councillor raf manji i raph alfred mangi declare that i will faithfully and impartially and according to the best of my skill and judgment execute and perform in the best interests of the city of christchurch the powers authorities and duties vested in or imposed upon me as a member of the christchurch city council by virtue of the local government act 2002 the local government official information meetings act 1987 or any other act good afternoon everyone um i 'll be very brief because i 've got to get on a plane and go to auckland uh where tomorrow i 'm talking at the national infrastructure conference about financing infrastructure i get all the fun jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important and one of the things i 'm going to be talking about tomorrow to them is that infrastructure is not just roads and pipes infrastructure is libraries community facilities youth facilities skate parks hot water swimming pools and anything basically that enables the community to do stuff so there 's a lot of talk about better business cases i would like to see more better community cases when we talk about infrastructure that is something that we have to finish off here and i 'm hoping the next council will get that job done i 'd like to take the opportunity to thank everyone who has supported me over the last three years in this job it has been a hard three years and to those who supported and persuaded me to do another three years i 'll let you know later thanks very much councillor tomskandra i timothy peter scandret declare that i will faithfully and impartially and according to the best of my skill and judgment execute and perform in the best interests of

those supporters those friends but most of all my family carolyn isabella and george so thank you very much i was asked the other day by a nine-year-old what i won by how many people voted for me and i won 't go into the details of the conversation because i didn 't come out very well but i think it is a reflection of the work that i did as a counsellor for the old sprayed and heathcliff award and what the work that i will do and the faith that the people have in me in the new kashmir award but also it 's a reflection of what we as a council have done for the past three years and hopefully we will continue as a team for the next three years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ councillor for those communities and all our communities i want to thank our ceo our executive leadership team and all council staff it is a team effort and there have been frustrating times at times but um it has been an amazing journey i have to say and i am still the only council who has the privilege to say that i have

thank you to the people who voted for me in the central ward it was a it was quite a um a good battle with some really competent people who are um in the ward and or trying to be there so i 'm really thankful for those people for putting their hands up as well to be to to be a counsellor um i really want to say a big thank you also to my team who was working with me and to my family who can 't be here especially my mother my grandmother and my great-grandmother who 's nearly a hundred years old she wasn 't outdoor knocking but we always had food in the kitchen and we always had food when we came home and it was absolutely fantastic to have her and my whole family been involved unfortunately my father unexpectedly passed away late last year and he couldn 't be with us he wanted to be here and be part of my journey in this and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving me the drive and the passion he was a selfless person he gave never had anything but always gave and that 's taught me some really true values about community and and actually being able to give something back even when sometimes you don 't feel like you 've got anything to give i stood for council because i wanted to be part of getting things done for our city as the rebuild moves into the regeneration phase this is the time to create unity and a vision for our city to bring together the fundamentals that will drive our economy and the people moving forward i envisioned i envision sorry i envisioned a vision a lively city that 's got a heart that 's accessible safe and spontaneous where people live businesses thrive and recreation activity activities are aplenty alongside this the resident 's red zone plays a key part in activating this and i 'm really excited to continue the work that i have done with community people who have got such passions and ideas for that area and i want to give them a voice our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communities some of them still have some major issues that need to be resolved as an example the linwood linwood community village it 's a seemingly forgotten place people there deserve to have some investment and deserve to have some attention done right i envision i see these communities have pride proud to be local and they look after each other that takes a lot of effort but it can happen insurance and repairs are still a big issue for our city and this is a problem that i 've been working with our communities for a long time now and we cannot drop this drive we need to make sure that these people are still looked after no one should be left behind in our recovery i foresee some issues around as as whereas houses and i do want to see the city council start looking at what we can do so that we can ensure that people aren 't forced into unsafe and uninhabitable homes roads are also a big issue and that 's been said before we have work to do i 'm really excited to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city of opportunity a safe city a yes city and a city that people want to live in so thank you everybody who 's um been supporting and and congratulations to the fellow councillors as well thank you and councillor sarah templeton i sarah louise templeton declared that i

imposed upon me as a member of the christchurch city council by virtue of the local government act 2002 the local government official information and meetings act 1987 to territo waitangi and any other act i 'd like to start with a really heartfelt thanks and gratitude to those who 've supported me through the last few months to my campaign team and to my family and friends who 've always been

residents of the heathcote ward i don 't know the exact number sorry for your trust and your belief in me as i serve and represent you around the council table thank you the last three years as community board chief hagley fury meet have been an incredible experience stimulating and rewarding though at times frustrating and they 've been excellent grounding for me as i move into council while we work on the repair and the rebuild of our city continues we face other challenges too the biggest of these is climate change and with its sea level rise as a city we must work together to both adapt and mitigate the impacts not just for us but for our children and for the future generations who will call christchurch home while we have our major projects such as the cycleways which are already working towards this end it is in our communities that i see huge potential my journey to council started in heathcote valley with a protest about the demolition of a local facility one that is now nearly rebuilt these local facilities are essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local shops support our economy and enable us to walk or cycle instead of driving and also need our support a connected community is much better place to deal with the challenges that are thrown at it and many are well on the way as we can see with the proliferation of community gardens and orchards around the city but while the focus has been understandably on the rebuild we must also not forget those who never had anything to start with those individuals and communities that are struggling with income with housing and with isolation let us rebuild an inclusive city an innovative city and an optimistic city for a future that is going to be very different to our past and let us do it together let us all play our part in whatever way we can whether we volunteer with a community group write submissions advocate or protest report graffiti or potholes run a business pick up litter start a garden or stand for office we 'll play our part and as i look forward to the three next three years i am optimistic and yes realistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and playing my part thank you take them off oh please take your

NZ,NZ,Christchurch City Council,Christchurch City Council,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZETwErnCvvgbvBbnnHfyxA,29.09.16 - Items 6 & 7 - Coastal Hazard Assessment - Land Information Memorandum Revision,gYk5vTq8c10,20160929,3879.349,"Christchurch, New Zealand",9945,"um the so items six and seven I just I wonder if it 's easier to deal with the two of them at the same time yep so we 'll just deal with them as as one recommendation that well I 'm going to deal with them together because that that why two different subjects well one is so completely one is simply receiving the information and a report and we 'll put the put them separately please welcome I can put them as it might seem in terms of the vote I can put them separately yes but let 's deal with the two of them together discussion was fine but as a resolution separately you say absolutely no that 's that 's no problem I can put them as separate resolutions but I 'm going to deal with them together sorry if I didn 't make that clear yep right so perhaps if I could invite the chief executive to speak to the report um thank you um met Amir this thing I do empathize with the position and concerns raised by the current landowners our thinking years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it 's important to clarify the purpose of the land information in Miranda and the notations limbs are provided on a property when there are requested generally by a prospective purchaser is discussed earlier the provision of lungs as an administrative function of all councils and is legislated by the local government official information in meetings act so don 't contain information that a council holds about a specific property and under the legume Oh act any council must include any information that it has about any special feature or characteristic including potential natural hazards that might affect the land and there are nine to the council but are not apparent from the district plan as you know the coastal hazards chapters not being hated on tour after the replacement district trainers in place so these potential hazards cover a large name number of hazards for example the more than 50,000 lungs and Christ ship that you conclude a notation around the flood management areas which are properties vulnerable and a one and two hundred year flood almost every one of those properties covered by the coastal hazard notation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land property in Christchurch at least all east of the airport is also in a liquefaction management area which has noted on a lung as if it 's requested indeed much of the residential land in Christ you to subject to some type of potential natural hazard with associated notations on the lung including for example flooding liquefaction of mention sloth instability rock full risk soft ground and many properties also have multiple limb notations for a series of potential hazards including things such as potential contamination from prior land use so council has a statutory obligation to disclose information about potential hazards that it has and even if it has some doubts about the full accuracy of the information and it 's supported by case law limb information is disclosed so that those interested in a property can inform themselves about the property and as was said in the where case the lung was created to empower purchases in the real estate market by giving them access to information so the council can 't unknow information losing a limb recipient recipient to the existence of a report their council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the report it 's simply disclosing the information it holds on the hazards identified in the report additionally this is not a negotiation process with property owners or equally prospective purchasers about what 's included in their lungs this doesn 't include any other of the other limb notations that we have on our lungs so the notations need to be factual and presenting the information rather than a motive and description and whilst the peer review of the tonkin tato report identified some issues that also identified many positive and correct aspects of the report so the entire report is not discredited and I know that we haven 't had discussion but there is comment and the handout around potentially being discredited the panel will actually come into their executive summary that the panel finds that a report could and should constitute a suitable and robust technology technical basis on which to proceed towards the next stage of the development of the coastal hazards maps for the district of Christchurch after recommended modifications are made later in the executive summary they specifically refer to the positive expects of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by council an area susceptible to coastal hazards including coastal settlements settlements located on unconsolidated shorelines and paying close close attention to documents directly relevant the technical expertise in exercise that they were undertaking notwithstanding this we committed to getting the technical information is accurate as possible however the real focus must remain on the community conversations and decisions that collectively we need to make in the coming years on the basis of that technical information how we respond and adapt to hazards as the real issue to the people of Christchurch so get you to the current notation you will recall that we reviewed the various technical reports available Council in case floor and a balance those of the broader issues of transparency safety public good statutory and community issues I discussed the draft notation with your work the informal meeting on sister September and I made changes to the notation following feedback at that meeting not all the feedback that you gave us but certainly feedback that are balanced those issues I 've just rose as you know the revised notation notation moved from being for specific notations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states the position fairly in my view some property owners have actually feared that they that they would rather we stayed with the earlier more specific notations as their feedback has been that the general notation incorporates their property and to a wider potential hazard area so as such it 's really hard to satisfy all property owners and council has to remain transparent and fear and providing that note a duels understand that the information provided on the website is highly technical when you look at it and so we will provide a simple statement that alerts interested parties to the basis of the science and the issues around the various reports and the concerns that have been raised so that it 's easier for people to understand rather than him to try and read the document the mirror had subsequently raised with me advice that she has received regarding a further Tonkin and taylor report for the ministry for the environment which contains their view that a safe harbor or a period of grace should be allowed so it 's enabled community engage in a discussion about technical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll take an advice on that but it doesn 't change the current situation that 's a future state but as something that we should be thinking about the limitations will be revised once and Earth new land information becomes available to counsel as a result of the theatre work to be undertaken as recommended by the pier of you I 'm also aware that the ministry for the environment is due to release its guidelines for local government and coastal hazards including sea level rise by the end of this year I would expect that there may be some relevant information that we would need to consider and if applicable will reference this material as this illustrates information that the council knows will always change and as a result the content of alums will be reviewed whenever new information is available moving forward the Muir has outlined a process of engagement with the various communities and the affected areas to work and improve detailed understanding of the potential hazards as well as working with central government on national consistency in options for action or mitigation and this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm heartened that the feedback I 've received is that the most recent meeting of the reference group in the nineteen certain was very productive and constructive and I think that that was part of the feedback that we received this morning as well I 'm committed at Council playing its part in ensuring constructive relationship on this important issue as we stole only at the early stages of what will be a very challenging and road ahead thank you thank you very much I do want to comment on this Tonkin and taylor report which came to my attention just a week and a bit ago and i wasn 't aware of it but it was only published in june this year but it probably is relevant in response to one of the points that was made in the deputation and that was a desire to move away from taunton taylor i think the opposite is true i think that it 's absolutely vital that we remain with Tonkin and Taylor because they 've been engaged by the ministry for the environment to provide a framework for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the RMA and given that they are going to be leading this work for central government and their report absolutely confirms the view that we have held right from the get-go that there needs to be central government guidance so that these issues are not debated at a local issue at a local level merely the the education is certainly local but the guidance as as national and the point that they have they have made the mfa intends that this framework will become the foundation for a possible new national policy statement and other national level guidance or interventions on natural hazards providing consistency across the country and they make the point in the introduction that living on a young island nation on the backbone of the Pacific Rim New Zealand as a subject daily to the risks posed by natural hazards there have been attempts by councils to manage risk associated with natural hazards through a risk-based approach but approaches have tended to be ad hoc and often with varying degrees of success but what really compelled me in relation to this report is that they have talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it is exemplary and they highlight and Christchurch and karpati why having this obligation around the poems and the lumps actually undermine the the capacity for a community to have a trusted conversation with its council and I think that 's a significant issue we recommend that other interventions be considered as required to establish a safe harbor and that 's what the chief executive referred to in her commentary to allow information on natural hazards to be obtained shared explored and communicated to all parties without prompting unnecessary premature and unhelpful alarm and possible outrage about the nature of an inclusion of information on limbs and the challenge of its impact on individual properties and property owners and they talked about them the the conflicting needs and obligations are about engaging effectively with stakeholders and communities of interest about information on natural hazards for the purpose of developing appropriate planning provisions under the RMA and the obligation so they confirm the obligation under the LG or legume o as we not to disclose information they have about properties and lumps and to a much lesser extent on homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea and Christchurch case studies demonstrate how this can play out and significant anxiety and outrage and derail effective planning processes in our view and intervention is needed to provide an opportunity for councils stakeholders and communities of interest to engage constructively and build their collective understanding of natural hazards and it goes on I 'll circulate this to members but the reason that I 'm raising this was that in all of us you know it 's been clearly understood that this is an administrative function of the council what goes on the limbs belongs to the administration side of the council so the chief executive has provided us with the report and that 's where it stands and we receive her report today what I 'm going to recommend to counsel at the conclusion of the discussion around this is that we write to the ministers of local government and the Minister for the environment in order to alert them to the that the real conflict that arises when the real focus of our attention should be on developing the coastal hazards chapter rather then on on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter which i happen to have drafted ahead of the meeting and and and we can discuss that as well so I just wanted to update people on where we 've got to since the last time this was placed on the agenda Glen and then David thank you so just to clarify we 're into discussion device oh I don 't think has anyone got any questions like I don 't have any question does anyone have any questions David David I 'm just a question of the chief executive I appreciate that don 't particularly like that the local government of the goner act Cara fication making this an administrative matter but be that as it may that 's the way it is my question is twofold really the deputation has highlighted in 2a and 2b that they feel that the current wording quote into a cusp unfairly casts uncertainty and a to be there under States the major assumptions and Christian they have proposed some alternative wording which i think you know they would be a lot more comfortable with and my question would be would would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to address the points that they raised in 2a and 2b unfairly casting and certainty and understating the assumptions and question and I think maybe we could get a middle ground here on a wording that may be more palatable to both groups so I don 't think it 's appropriate woodsmith what 's on the lungs by committee and I think there are issues with the the wording that suggested and certainly my things as that actually makes it less clear and that it is it 's important that it 's as clear as possible we actually reduce the clarity by reducing the for location down to one in an effort to make it more acceptable but my senses wording is actually making it less clear but I will ask the team at the end he expects any comic used I think beyond and the the comments that both the mirror the chips you could have made and in the introduction and I think that and the challenges and ensuring that we end up with legally compliant wording and that is both fear and accurate and but also the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's possible to assess boy everyone or nothing and the challenge will be a reality that not even will agree on these it routing because the incentives and expectations of people are different ever felt Phil Phil Phil and then yani things been I just want to ask a question relation to the second report the program in on page 51 there 's reference to the work that we done on the coastal inundation hazard zones and clearly from there that 's and that 's and that implies to me that the be like a whole multi has an approach to assessing it whereas with the open coast coastal erosion parts it seems that the to be some difference in the work I just want to make sure there 's enough money on budget to deal with this early invited our Peter kingsbury to the table and if we need for the tip applause and Helen Beaumont as well but and if the question is is non-technical as is there enough money on budget and the council Rob 's you need to ensure that it follows through in does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick and if we do have money on budget to complete this work and we do and I guess my other question then is is that can be sufficient to give a full assessment as the budget can be special the budget won 't be a limitation on giving a scientific and information great things mean the only thing I had to that as we do intend to ensure that the the program of work that we 've defined with Tonkin Taylor does adequately address the recommendations of the peer review panel report and to ensure that it does do that we will be engaging dr. de jure heart from the University to review that program of work before it starts enter the part of the peer review process through their work and at the end as well so the review as a review built in thank you yeah that says to me that they expected to occur in late 2016 is not accurate merits it 's probably March April 2017 yes correct oh yeah we 're looking at roughly a six-month period of work to complete or to address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take us to well if it starts at the beginning of October which is doing what we 're aiming to sort of March yeah by March yep so can you change that too I think wriggle rooms required so just march april twenty seventeen or is that the first first quarter first quarter of 2017 I don 't know general yeah March April 2017 yeah apologize for the confusion that because of the different timing of the two reports i think the recommendation for important number C button is match 2017 net simply reflected that and we 've done where the timing of the ministry for the environment local government guidance and we also it was the point that work made have built-in sufficient time to her to ensure that we go through and the most robust process possible including ongoing peer review so so that the okay so it 's actually the revised advice from the ministry for the environment that will be available in December 2616 that 's the plan if they ever released advice on time before I mean what 's the probability of better carry we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their work that they are doing oh no that 's good that 's good to hear I 'm a dog excuse me for my little slightly facetious down but you know we 're here about reports that are due particular time and haven 't seen many that you know arrived from mum I mean that because it is so technical and everything so yeah Yanni was next I think had several questions um I was just worried in the limb bleeding so those ones check that the chief executive has seen what was proposed by this group or is this the first time that you 've seen her some time I saw an earlier version this is slightly different version so I 'm just trying to understand whether there 's any process that we can agree to today that could take on board the proposed wording and reflect on it so we it 's it 's the chief executives role I understand and to get to the proposed the wording that we 've got to vino process of looking at the reports that information that we here in balancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bec that we 've got so we think we 've got a legally found robust notation yeah and I 've heard your explanation before as to how you 've got what you 've currently got on the lump I was just wanting to know whether it was worth taking on board the you know if there was any process but if that 's the answer no then I think that 's very clear um I was concerned in the peer review particularly that the section that really commented on being misleading and I just kind of wondered how we were addressing that through the through the lumps because it doesn 't seem to me with the wording that we 've got that it kind of makes that clear that the pair of you identified that some of the reporting was misleading the the report doesn 't discreet it the first time grant taylor report it also talks about the positive aspects of that and it talks about areas we are there as more work to do and that 's essentially what we 're referring to see okay um if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the indicated coastal erosion hazard zone for all harbour sites including avin history and Brooklyns lagoon are misleading in many locations they are not indicative of likely erosion hazard so are those properties still having a notation on that doesn 't make reference to two there and are they still being met in the same way or has the map and women religious yes I think the challenge is similar five-page period peer review report that the council has received and adopted and what we received in and now he 's an opportunity to accept the staff recommendations to and go forward with those recommendations I think and the challenge that we face it out of 75 pages is you will find words in your behind paragraphs that can be read in different ways and selectively taking me out and words or paragraphs and I don 't think that is ultimately useful I think you need to read the report and totality and is the chief executive has said in totality the report isn 't at the same stage is some other examples from around the country and initiative Ziggler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the report as an meta pase of the lung and the Lynn and provides the reference to the report it 's not intended to duplicate or include the technical information or subsections or quotes from the technical report on the month no thank you I understand that but what I don 't understand is why for those properties that have been identified as um not indicative of likely erosion hazard and if n said you know are misleading so it 's as its effect not a question why there 's nothing on those people 's lungs to identify that that has been raised in the peer review I would have thought it was it that the current lung refers to the peer review report and tuber and that there were concerns raised with the token and taylor report i think you know i mean we 're asking questions which assumes an influence that the council doesn 't have which is why i do want us to write to the to the minister 's but let me let me just I 've asked that we review the the wording of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff will review and revise the coastal hazard land information Miranda notations again following the completion of the revised coastal hazard assessment stage and I 've actually asked the chief executive to pick up on the words that she used during her speaking to the report which is noting that the limb notations will be revised once enough new land information becomes available to counsel as a result of the further work to be undertaken as recommended in the peer review that means at any stage between now and the end and the final position which is when we 've got a district plan chapter and place for coastal hazards at which case it 's nothing on the limb because it 's dealt with in the district plan that what that enables us to do is to take an assertive approach so that if information comes to light during the course of all of these elements of the work program then obviously the chief executive can review the position at any time yeah I simply don 't understand why this particular specific area zoning hasn 't got reference on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done be by implication because it refused to both the tonkin and taylor report into the end to the so to the peer review yeah but the advice that we 've had is it in there is the current lung yani says that it 's possible possibly affected by coastal hazards and the future yeah I just that might might be helpful and until we 've carried out the further work we can 't identify those properties that where that notation in terms of you know the changes to those areas affected by erosion we can 't identify those those properties in the meantime until that through the work is completed but as you complete that work then you would you would certainly reconsider the limb under there so you wouldn 't wait to take something off the limb or to refer to it not no not not being susceptible in that regard it wouldn 't be until March when we have the final report final revised report it will be in a position to make those changes okay look I just don 't understand why if you 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adequacy of the report the original report and it says that something 's misleading if you were buying a property why wouldn 't you want something they might be buying a property under site special on on the loan that said the peer review found for the ceh said that many locations are not indicative of likely erosion hazard and form it more work will be done to reassess would any one of those properties not be covered by a flood management area are very few so if it 's not erosion there would be a nun dae shin notation on the alone yeah but a current is the same currently no I 'm inherently yeah that 's right I 'm just a second question I had was I think when this originally came to us we 'd ask that the work program we thought that well I thought that their community reference group had worked quite well they 'd had a lot of input into the peer review seem to be quite a good process my understanding was we were going to go back and work with the debt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what feedback have we had from that group ah thank you for that question yes we have had feedback from the group we met with them on the nineteenth of September and we talked through the word program with them then subsequent to that we 've had feedback from work schaeffer 's and we have also responded to some of those suggestions including a rolling peer review of the work as well as looking at the additional scenarios for the sea level rise as well come sir david oh just the final question was just on the UM the request for going out for for the contract in terms of doing the peer review so going up to open tender and also just the need for expertise for the community to be involved in this process are you referring to the further peer review yeah yeah fine when Tonkin and Taylor 's finished the report there will be another pair of you there will be and it won 't be we don 't anticipate that that would be to the same extent as as having a five-member panel what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked to dr. de jure heart and she is keen to be involved in the process both from the at the beginning but through the work and be the peer reviewer for the final revision as well David asking questions on the web program as well yes work program and the 3.8 and in the report task or sale Oh 3.7 sorry it 's anticipated the full scope of all technical work will be completed by March 2017 what confidence can we have there this is an extremely complex piece of work and you 're you 're basically telling us that you can do all this work and a couple in a few weeks but it once you 've set a work plan a few bugs you just really just bit just to be clear and what we 've a layout for is six months to undertake this work and so about 26 weeks and what the workplane refers to the recommendations made by the peer review panel there in their words must be done immediately so the recommendations beginning with 222 in their peer review report and so we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made by the peer review that must be completed immediately and let 's not to say that 's the only work that will ever be done here the peer review also quite clear and there 's a bunch of recommendations for the reassessment and a period of years and so I don 't wanna give the impression that match will have all the answers that will even need this is in fact an ongoing programme of work what will heaven in March and as the position to complete their and questions and the issues that were raised by the peer review report which will simply take us to effectively and having and the technical information is beast is what we know at that point in time that em it 'll be a turret of and continual process after then as well it just seems to me that by much you are indicating that you would be in a physician to effectively validate the current tonkin and taylor report no will be in a position and that we would have responded to the recommendations or the view of you I wouldn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up there outcome of the work and but and if it 's if it if it gets too februari end and they still a lot more work to do were more inhibitor keep council well informed and but to pick up the point that work made earlier and we 're not going to rush this just ahead an arbitrary march date so if it takes longer than that then it takes longer than it and I think that 's quite propria well with respect the one of the critical areas of consideration for this for the peer review where the coastal has has its erosion provisions which really sort of predicated pretty heavily on sediment budgets and studies of what scenarios may flow out of the Waimakariri river but it particularly i find it somewhat hard to comprehend that this information could be accurately there is it region markedly not even a question hey so how can you assure us that this critical factor of sediment budget can be appropriately addressed in a matter of weeks months to me it would be it could take a year or more to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the peer review panel are recommendations to sediment budget one is within the actual recommendations the other is about route that can be done or should be done within a 10 year framework work within the ten-year framework does talk about cinnamon budgets and the need to have a better understanding of sediment supply that is work that he can does on a routine basis in terms of beach profiling and as at this as it last week he can are about to release their latest sediment budget for Pegasus Bay so we 'll be in a very strong position to or a good position to include that information and the work are to be done by March and my last question on surrounding the peer review process itself we don 't appear to had any input from the affected communities into the choice or appointment of a peer reviewer for this process and in previous issues that we 've had in Council we have had problems where shall we say the peer reviewer or the experts that have been consulted have been sympathetic to the council 's position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices around the appointment choice and appointment of a peer reviewer in this process well I think dr. de jure heart and as an independent peer reviewer so she was obviously a member of the original peer review panel and not did the independent review panel have any any any input or process and the appointment of her to do this work going forward no no the lobes think right now clean thank you believing me change my mind just said one point here now to on this and I I don 't necessarily have difficulty with with what we attempting to do it 's not that it 's more the the logic around it so the government removes the coastal hazards chapter but the report which informed that chapter is not removed so even though case law is appealed to in eluding a limb recipient to the existence of the reporter councillors not warranting the accuracy of the opinions and the report it is simply disclosing the information it holds on the hazards identified in the report then later this is page 45 6.8 it is acceptable for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council may have doubts about its accuracy what my question on the logic of this is as I 've said before the truck and trailer effect so you remove the chapter but the report that informs that chapter and the information which is also under question remaining I can 't see how that stacks up and actually is that a fair go you do summation of it is crypt that you can do that in terms of the factual presentation of what occurred you are correct I think the answer would be meadow speculation about with its if you go or not but the reality and Judith will confirm and the requirements for the council to provide an information on a limb that is known to the council Staind notwithstanding and that the requirement for the coastal hazards shifter to be part of the fast track to HP process was removed yeah okay just looks like a cake and having it too because you remove the chapter 4 theta informations Daisy I 'm not necessarily questioning to the information and the TNT report though it needs to be question has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me is later that she isn 't healing to like to the minister 's is going to address the unfair issue that you raised yeah okay there is I mean it 's always a balancing act but anyway so the the motion which I would like to move is that the council receive the information in this report note that the limb notations will be revised once and if new land information becomes available to council as a result I fear that we can 't see but to be undertaken as recommended in the peer review and right to the ministers of the environment and local government to request an urgent response to the safe harbor proposal to enable local communities to engage in discussions over the coastal hazards chapter do I have a seconder for that Phil yeah any discussion sure and this is both reports together but resolving one at a time oit is there to me no no well we 'll do that with the second one so I need a mover and a seconder for the second report so can you pop the second one own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be debate them together okay so i would like to move that the coastal health assessment report stage 2 will be revised in accordance with the recommendations of the peer review and receive the technical investigation work program you 'd like to see in that second up by glenn so i will open that up for debate Glenn yeah thank you i still have oceans over the logic around this as you 've seen in and we all know where with bringing both reports together i think it 's important at this stage to acknowledge the difficulty we 've had in relationship with our community and for me a lot of this is coming down to that relationship and this is alluded to in the mezz draft letter where the concept of a safe harbor for dialogue in the future over this is talked about for me it 's not only necessarily just the information that goes on land information memoranda it is how the conversation about that happens in the community and I think we have to be broader than just whether or not we 're going to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is that of the CES it 's about how this is done there is hazard across hazards across the whole city if you look on the the Hale register you 'll find where we 're sitting right now is an identified hazards site but we need also to broaden our minds and not also talk about our hazards but opportunity which is what the programme of work signaled by region will be about in the future it 's how to make opportunities out of these hazards in terms of dissemination I proposed after conversations with leaders in South new bright and last year a community hub because they wanted to break this dynamic of public meetings where people end up pitted against each other at actually as one of the representatives and i am the other representative of the bill would pegasus ward until october the eighth I i want to put an end to this I want to propose a way forward where we sit down together and I 'll take on board the comments of the deputation today this is difficult stuff and I want to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at each other on what is to sit down the new brighton hub i think is a great place where the community can walk in and take on board disinformation and dialogue with region the council other community members DCL it 's a place where the commissioner for the environment genright has suggested we could have the maps this will be an iterative process the community can take on board this information they 're intelligent they will walk into it they will make up their own mind over it there is time to do things you can settle in that in many of the coastal regions say as a young family today and establish I 'm in the lifetime of an acid a home or a council asset is 50 years it was still time to do things there 's no need to panic I also pushed through the community board after this process last year a concept which died Keenan and her team raised I would like to acknowledge dies work on this and that is the community leaders kind of peer reviewing a different sort of peer review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the community because i think it 's it 's not only just been what does or doesn 't go on the limb that is to fall short of what we 're trying to achieve it 's about everyone working together we have to put an end to this either or them and us it 's got to be all of us working together one thing I have picked up from another part of the ward and that 's in deling t 'en and Sutton Place a comment from a resident there that when the council kind of puts out promulgates all these layers of hazard and risk or whatever the comment was when you when you do that to us and I think that sums it up and I think that sums up the dynamic of what happened last year and that 's what we were guilty of when we did it to them so we need to learn from this and we need to kind of like do things together and work through this information I 'm glad the peer reviews been undertaken it needed to be tested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a limb we all know you can 't have a blank sheet of paper but we we also need to acknowledge we have hazards and risks across the whole city it 's not only in the coast award so thank you to our staff to the community for all the work to date it is an ongoing one and I think what 's in the draft leader sums it up when it talks about a safe harbor that 's what we need going for but please let 's put an end to this them and us and it 's worked together yeah i 'll put the motion Oh David thank you I 'm not going to sit on the fence on this one this whole sorry saga strong drool on a long time we 've had a report that was put together in three weeks the chapter planning chapter was withdrawn the document still remains as Glenn eluded peer review came up with 20 odd recommendations a recommendation significant one to remove the mapping references and a recommendation that the limb should be referencing the limbs should be removed I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for rewording I do appreciate that this is an administrative situation but i find it off on that somewhat uncomfortable that it is a administrative matter i found there the community request that sort of just to change things where unfairly casts uncertainty on on properties end or understates the major assumptions in question and in fact if you look at section 44 3a sorry 44a of the legume section 3 in addition to the information provided for under subsection 2 a territorial authority may provide in the memorandum such other information concerning the land as the authority considers at its discretion to be relevant well when you could have all sorts of connotations there i mean i could say that tomorrow we could have a major flooding in the Waimakariri and at the same time the southern milk fault ruptures the stock banks get annihilated and christchurch gets flooded so should we be having a notation on every lemon in christchurch that there 's a susceptibility to flooding of the alpine fault ruptures at the same time as of waimakariri flood so I 'll leave that at that and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am rather concerned about the timeline that 's being allocated for this work and and their ability to actually complete this work in a manner that 's going to have boy and all around and lastly i think the peer review process going forward it is with some concern that that here we are again appointing a peer reviewer in an area that we 've had contention with for four months and months and months and we 've had no consultation with the affected group as to the that appointment process so regrettably I don 't think I 'm going to support either recommendations today yep I 'm yani then fall thank you I just was very happy to speak in support of number one I know we 're doing the two so it 's a bit hard to UM going to go highlight but yeah two meters so I 'll just stick to the first one I have no problems with number one and number three but IM can i 'm still really concerned that we 've basically got a limb that doesn 't make reference to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zone that has been labeled misleading because i would have thought that that would be the right thing to do I acknowledge that it 's not up to us to make that decision but I just think that it would be really good to try and work through this sooner rather than later given the significance of that statement in the peer review so I I don 't yeah I I don 't support the process of what we 've got for reviewing the limb notations I think there needs to be a bit of process if we can around that given the seriousness with which the peer review identified some particular and I note that 's not all but some particular sections where it made very clear statements about them being misleading and not likely being in those areas that that are in that report it also made reference to removing the mapping so I hope that that 's been done for those months I 'm going on to the work programme my view is very simply that we actually achieved a lot when we recognize the fallacy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it slowed down and put into a more timely and considered fashion that is something that I strongly support as a council in terms of our district plan and it shows you possibly i think the benefit of us having sovereignty over our district plan or land use decisions rather than having other people to putting us on a very strict timetable and in very strict processes but what it does I think show is that the measure of us isn 't about defending things when they 're wrong but it 's how we actually acknowledge when mistakes are made and how we put things right that counts and I think actually the first peer review that we did from my observation over the collaborative process with the local community was actually excellent not everyone would have been pleased and got everything they want but actually the process from what I saw actually was a very good process in terms of community engagement and so I feel somewhat concerned that we 've had a deputation today that has raised concerns with the way in which we 're doing this work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to propose an amendment not wanting to lose the goodwill that 's been established with that group that we do actually think about not agreeing to number two of item seven but that we actually asked stuff to go away and work through the revised work program with it with the community and report back to the first meeting of the incoming council to me that would actually send a signal that we do hear the concerns that they have the extensive efforts that they 've gone through to make a smaller a deputation to us today and I think that it would be a really fair way of doing it and so in conclusion just to say that you know this is not an easy issue is a difficult complex and very technical issue but actually if we can get the process is right around how we engage and collaborate with communities that are impacted thus then that 's an incredibly powerful way of confronting what is very challenging and so we 've made a good start I think there 's still some things that we need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we ask that the staff continue to consult with the community around the revised technical work program and bring that back to the new council an amendment on this because that we 're just simply receiving the technical investigation work program I thought the group and I 'm sorry for interrupting but I just want to clarify I thought that the group that was set up to work you know that has representatives from across the coastal areas I thought that was still continuing so can we want Kelly as an addition can we simply notice and receive the technical investigation work program which will address all the relevant recommendations of the peer review panel noting that this is an iterative program and that ongoing ongoing engagement with the what 's the group called but there 's a community reference scrutiny I see reference group that will continue I need to clarify that because the community reference group was set up specifically to do the to manage the peer review process their time has has finished but the discussions that we had on the 19th with the community reference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group or similar to move forward through that process of the pit of the completion of the report through to community engagement and to their notice this is an iterative program and and therefore a a community advisory group has been established or as being established to support the process will be you will be a step yeah yeah all right comes so i can I just have it clarified then that the concerns around who gets appointed who does the work and how that happens are they able to be addressed through that community reference group that 's been reestablished or newly who gets appointed well if you look at the deputation you know they recommended that we change um Tonkin Taylor and we 're not we 're not debating met this that 's the matter that 's already been determined that 's their report that has to be amended so there are other questions as well around who did the peer review independent experts etc etc so I 'm just asking if the things that were raising the deputation can be actually raised through that community reference group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those and we 've already addressed address some of those and may work program yeah sorry I 've kind of interrupted the debate and I didn 't want to do that but I also didn 't want to accept an amendment that wasn 't it wasn 't reflective of weird things that actually got through our fill look I 'm I think it 's good to know that in fact the work that the local community group has has done so well and where they 've been fully involved in fact that will be extended and it 's clear that in fact that the a wide range of cumulative groups now need to be represented and those further conversations and that 's implicit on the report because clearly the coastal hazards in the future will affect all of Christchurch and that 's what we decide today is really really important that we and I agree that we need to have those wider conversations around these processes to but I also think that you know council really as Colleen advised us we have to include the information on the limbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think that in terms of that of the wording that it may be susceptible to coastal hazards in fact that 's quite reasonable it 's also very clear that further work will be done and and Carlene pointed out too but in fact we 're required to put some information on our limbs even if there are some question around the accuracy of their and we already have that information on it on cross-checked property owners limbs for all all sorts of other hazards which were outlined earlier and like flood management areas of course can extend right throughout the city I by a buyer from a property whether it 's on the on the coastal area or or on the west side of the city has to know information about potential hazards they 're entitled to do there and I believe that as a council we 'd be failing in their duty if we if we weren 't to support that these recommendations and I thoroughly support the further work being done and thank the staff for that and particularly the inclusion of of this local the coastal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide personal just want to thank the community for driving us to where we go today and I remember meeting of work last year or knitted the shiver it was at some point not long after we accept the top and taylor report and the issues he raised where we had made mistakes we know that now we 've made mistakes to counsel and it was true to the fast track process so we recognize that and we 're starting to address them i 'm pleased to see there will be sir another group set up to actually oversee some of this work and the continued involvement to the wider community and we as remember us just not New Brighton that gets affected here it 's right around coast comes right up and run up to close to Central City so it 's a large area eighteen thousand households and so we 've got to make sure ever we do here going forward is right and isn 't subject to criticism Judah inaccuracies so I 'm supportive of getting more information I 'm supportive of actually working through the issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to do this as a the on our own hmm an isolation from the rest of the country when we are small island and we are all facing these issues right across the country so that 's a disappointment and if you look at a number of issues we 've had to deal with alcohol policy shopping and Easter freedom camping these all major issues for this for our city so you know I will support this today and I know David 's not going to support but I think we do need to get him we do need to get up behind we need to make sure we bring the community along with us and I think that 's really really important and again thanks to the council for actually taking the time pulling it out and reviewing it and getting to this point today it 's important thank you i just want to conclude the debate with a comment which is that this process began when we were under the pressure of doing every single chapter and our district plan in a truncated time frame the the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and engage with communities over the the issues around natural hazards for the flood management areas and we actually had really good public engagement with a presentations run over a full day where people could come in the morning or the afternoon and they were excellent we had speakers from externally with speakers from within the council and it really helped people understand why we were putting in a flood management area as as we were and it was replacing a pre-existing one that worked that this coastal hazards one it didn 't because there was no time no time for the report to be developed and I think in a way tonkin and Taylor 's become been on the receiving end of criticism that isn 't desert Tonkin Taylor has an exceptional record in terms of understanding the nature of these environments in his studied our coastal environment and in fact knows more about our and then then I think our land is the most studied land and the entire world i mean in terms of liquefaction lateral spread and the other risks that it does face these are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm now involved in and that work as well so we know more about our land but and this is a quote from their latest report to the ministry for the environment community or stakeholder engagement is critical to best practice natural hazard management good stakeholder involvement leads to a shared and better understanding of the risks faced and the range of treatment options the process of engagement should be iterative it should be early it should be active and it should be time rich we take our time communication and consultation are a necessary part of each step of the risk management process that 's that 's what 's not been done here and it is this report that recommends that that that government issued guidance or change the law so that there can be a safe harbor where information can be gathered in order to develop that communication around the risk and have that really deep and time rich conversation with communities so to those that made the deputation earlier on this this isn 't over this isn 't at all over and I think that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be reviewed as information comes to light it does enable us to move on to the next stage but again highlighting to central government that they actually have to step into the space and recognize that our coastline is shared across New Zealand and it is something that requires national guidance and support so on that I 'll move the I 'll put the first notion which is item number 6 i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye that sorry oh you 're sorry so record yannis vote against two and record David East vote against the lot so is that that was all right yep so that 's I 'm carried thank you and then the item number 7 i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye

Zealand",1170,"the next item is the annual report so that 's my so we 've got a recommendation from the audit and risk management committee so I 'll move that second goodbye Jamie are there any questions yani yes you know the whole I just think it 'd be really good for us to get a bit of a explanation around that because yeah I don 't understand what the annual report is not an opportunity to ask questions about the issues that get reported to individual committees or to the council through other means this is about the the technical aspects of the the report and and the you know the purposes of the report itself sorry so you don 't want any questions I was a report here that yeah you can write matters that would lead to a qualified opinion valuation of writing network and stormwater system so I was just trying to understand given how much assessments skirt has done around our infrastructure to come up with the infrastructure repair program why we 're still in such a state of understanding devaluation of our own assets it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not done that 's causing the problem it 's the assessment by our own I said owners and the sorry the waste water and water were the first two that were addressed and both of those have been valued and the valuations have been approved by audit stormwater is the very last and that 's being locked up this year and roading which is the one in the middle and we 're having an issue around with assess the condition of it the problem were having us trying to relate the condition to the period of which it should be repaired because that 's not the normal methodology for assessing the veldt the age and condition of roads it 's like what are they mean for us by in terms of the possible valuation well we 've got a valuation if we just haven 't been able to get it to a point that audit can accept it so it means were there 's not more work to be done this year because without roading without getting roading valuation approved that we won 't be in a position of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite a lot of work last year we got it to a reasonable point when we met with the expert from Wellington from the audit office he was not uncomfortable with where we 've got to but it was it was that last five sort of that last 5% that needed to be connected and we were unable to get to that point in the time available and we had the added complication that staff member who could have assisted us most was off sick on extended leave so that 's important to a halt so the likely outcome possibly is that herb roads are not as valuable as we think they are because of the repairs that have been done no we know the condition of them normal eroding when Rodin 's valued a new look at the age of the road in you go that 's a soldier we replaced here is the order to be replaced here subject to its condition we are trying to value my basis we 're looking at the condition of them and going this bad means you need to replace it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years it 's it 's trying to connect to those two because nobody else values their roads that way because no one else needs to and then just the other question I had was around the whole skirt the work-in-progress balance of 54 million yes what 's going on with that the issue is it 's a difference of opinion between ourselves and the Audit Office as to the treatment of it we have treated at all the little part of the capital work and skirt treated that way as well so they sweep the cost up and capitalize it as part of the completed projects the oag has the the understanding that it should be treated as an expense so we 've had a lot of debate on us to come and we have in the end agreed to disagree but again can I just say to you the course skirts work will be finished this year we expect a lot of those problems to have gone away for the this time when we 're considering the 2017 accounts we don 't expect to be looking at these same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just in terms of the remuneration bands i know the 2015 bands are different than the 2016 bands particular on remuneration of council employees and I just thought had two questions on that one is why are they different until have we done any work or are we considering reporting on pay relativity across the organization across the oven on I 'll answer the question on the fish on the on the band 's the bends sit down by legislation so we have to go and twenty thousand dollar bands up from 60 if you don 't if you have fewer than six people and a band you can combine them hence why you don 't necessarily get the same bands here on you and that 's why you you can 't do it that way it minutes to protect privacy it 's one of those reasons for doing you can have less than sex a new top band but you must have at least sex and every band going up so hence why as you see as you get to the higher bands we have I think you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wider than 20,000 in order to get that sex and the second question about relativity is a difficult question to answer you be more specific about relative to what sorry just just around looking at the relativity of who 's paid wall so rather than just bends but looking at the multipliers from the lowest paid to the top classified sorry I 'm not even sure if that helps really relativity is a general sensors you looked at with regard to that level of work against a different entity so that 's something that could possibly be looked at but I think that 's what you 're asking you 're asking for the difference between the top and the bottom all that information would be available within the report if anyone wanted to calculate it although I would question the validity of that type of approach any other questions so i 'll put that

New Zealand",3683,"move on to the public forum and I 'd like to invite David Dunn would like to speak to us this morning good morning morning everyone thank you very much for allowing me to be here and listen to my request I 've lived on Aven side drive for 33 years in the same house and as you 'll be aware ninety-five percent i would think plus houses have disappeared on either side of the river from the Darlington bridge all the way down to Brighton the sure that the land where the houses are sitting is between 20 and 50 kPa and described overall is extremely soft and the concern is that traffic and movement are not going to help that 's that land becomes stable and and to give you some idea to put in normal foundations for a house at the moment you have to have a 2200 kpa kpa as a minimum otherwise you need special engineering foundations so it really protect the foundations the road as well is very very damaged the rotors half green and then half red and the half red part is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tides or very high rainfall I think the maintenance cost of repairing the road and be maintaining it on words would be very very expensive but I 'm not an expert and the issue has come up several times in the last couple of years with council about closing the road partially or fully and it 's it 's never been resolved totally I don 't think so it 's not a new issue to you all it 's probably one that you 've heard about in the last couple years and I understand from talking to some of the traffic engineers that the road serves no network advantage it could be closed and it wouldn 't really inconvenience anybody to any great degree because it 's really just a shot cut between the Darlington bridge and why not avoid so we 're looking at from the Darlington bridge up to Porat park and then on to the Darlington bridge one of the solutions I had was that would suit everybody is to close the road on either side of the care the the band rather an agent side drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stray on either direction and not go around the corner of a crash that will allow the footballers and all the people that use the park to build the park there when there 's not flooding going on and and hopefully that would resolve it but thank you very much for your time okay questions head inside drive yeah in which exact section it 's between the Darlington bridge and and where my houses or the road you mean that I don 't know with the race okay yeah sorry where 's my house yeah okay from the Darlington bridge going towards porec park just passed know your industry where those trees on both sides of the road right so that Beth Greene and yeah or in over the riders yeah just before you get to the first entrance of the park two houses prior to that that 's where the Reds on stars right so then you have the one entrance to the part and then round a corner of the football fields yeah and then all the rest shred and paula park of course has been destroyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have you seen the new curve in general going down and even side right yes I have yes looks lovely yeah we 'll just need to ascertain how far 'd that go onto the onto kurz road as well and further down yeah the trouble was is that the curse road I mean because of the you know the division because of wooden road been closed a lot of people were traveling down key road onto avonside drive and then hooking back onto wine only Road yeah so there 's a lot of lot more traffic using back section which is actually the red zone section yeah absolutely our street even say dried has got enough like traffic now and particularly large trucks because what I 'm would shut yeah so that will be the case till at least the end of the year so I 'm I wouldn 't advocate causing a van side drive until all that 's been fixed so that people have an inconvenience again yeah look thank you very much I mean that 's just perfect timing and it really very much appreciated okay thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next person is Bob Todd than what Boston pole hello good morning madam near thank you for the invitation to be here having had considerable involvement in the construction of the previous woolston lynnwood pool and the positive impact it had on the community may I think this council and the local councillors yarny Johansen and Paul lon style for working together and finally getting the necessary funding on budget for the loom would Wulfstan pool it has been a long journey to get to the stage and this council should be proud of the fact of investing in such a needed facility in this area it is pleasing that it 's going to happen with funding and a firm commitment to build it residents in the community are excited and a keen to be engaged as soon as possible as over 50 years ago when the old pool was constructed so I commend you and ask that you keep the momentum going with it as expressed in the annual plan I urge you to keep the wider community engaged as to progress progress will help to raise the community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the pool would be the old reserves the pattern on the corner of smith street and linwood avenue they have now moved and that would be an ideal site the present that 's a real eyesore and I know from experience that the Lynwood rugby league club are looking for a site for new club rooms and a new pool and limud League club rooms on that site next to the wood park would be fantastic thank you okay any questions yeah history of the area some 50 years ago the owner of the grocery shop on the corner of howard street and ferry road approached one or two of us and said that what was lacking in wilson was a swimming pool so we got many of the residents together and decided yes we would approach the council to build a pool suitable pool in allston park we propose of council however they demanded that the the community contribute towards the the cost of that pool so we we got together and raise sufficient funds to funds towards the cost of that pool that satisfied the council at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was well used but unfortunately during that a period when the oil prices skyrocketed the council claim that could no longer afford to heat the pool and as a consequence many people not keen on swimming in cold water and the pool became virtually redundant and regretfully was demolished yes 1107 sec okay thanks bob has anyone actually spoken to the lynnwood leagues club without being involved possibly involved in a kind of coventry you might be juices that i have and i think counselor Johansson was Lisa and another keen oh yeah Eureka and do you think they would be you know financially contributing as well so just received insurance money from the form of building which was wrecked than the earthquake right in the lynnwood school theater they hit the pool sorry lynnwood school do they have a pool I have a pool but it 's only yeah it 's a little one it was right they did have been walking distance to semester so you know what what is required is a decent size colorful and that yeah jiggler area what I 'm saying is good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you see it yep I 'm not sick how do you just stay on the road great okay thank you I think there 'll be quite a process to go through in terms of site selection i know that and the eastern sport and Rec one you know community joint community community board group was set up a working party and they looked at a number of different sites before they decided on the qe2 site which should be announcing a contractor anytime soon so does this this is a project that 's on budget or not some and its preceding so as I say we certainly appreciate it and look forward to it sir conclusion than likely great thank you yeah but I think there 's a process to go through and we do need to engage the community and a conversation about the best location you know I mean I was in at the library and and the mall you know and who would have thought that putting a library and more would increase the foot traffic by thirty percent they 'd 1400 people and to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been dramatic so you know I think talking to other clubs about what their needs for facilities are that 's absolutely the way to go good thank you thank you very much great and now we move on to dictation spy appointment and I 'd like to invite Tim centers and Warrick Shaffer from cci you re item seven and eight good morning marriage counselors our pastor is right over to work Schaffer who 's going to read out a report and we 'll go from there questions after we 've got time thank you but thank you for hearing us and just before I start I wish you all well with the reelection hope to see you all back a few months time we 've got a couple of topics set up I 'll up coming up today one is the limb notations and the other one is the talking to Taylor reworking you have a copy in front you 're not going to go into every detail because I don 't think was enough time so to start with the limb notations this report should not be accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for further consideration and consult in consultation with effective community now this is the interim limb we had a limb when the tom taylor report came out after the peer review that was there was issues found in that limb and so there 's an interim one while re work is done we think that interim lynch could be improved we feel that the current dilemma is not clear fear or balanced as it should be a limb must be accurate state the position fairly and must not mislead now just to be specific in the current limb we feel that the words this property may be susceptible to coastal hazards unfairly cast uncertainty over the property we in keeping in mind the peer review says things such as the hazard areas be variously revised recalculated discarded and or reassessed before they could be used for planning purposes another point the words that identify some issues with the report this understates the major assumptions and questions and minimizes the amount of rework required to get the tonkin taylor to a point where it can be used for planning purposes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with effective community when setting them notations we feel strongly that this should be done in this case and would result in a better outcome and I 've just put a small notation there to a relevant legal decision good point their interim legal advice we have received suggests that given similarities with a capital where case it is not mandatory for ctc to refer to a discredited report on a limb there 's some details there on the second page as a suggestion or a starting point we 've created them based on the Kapiti example that we think would be fairer and clearer you have to imagine a limb situations with someone selling a house in someone 's buying a house the lawyer needs to see it have a exact and clear and fair idea without having to go to the background documents to really understand what is happening here and it 's quite important that balance is struck between the buyer and the seller and that 's what we 're aiming and get and would like to work with you on it the second what topic I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rework the token taylor rework should not be rushed the original tongren taylor report was fast-tracked with disastrous results we should not do the same with us rework now this just before I get started this is not a swipe at staff by any means we 've actually enjoyed working with them and as we work our way down a collaborative path it 's been very good in fact we don 't actually have a pathway to build it as we go but it 's quite exciting for the feature future and I think if we are given time and space to work with staff we can produce something that 's really good for everyone I 'm just saying here that this this work program needs to go back to staff and I mean need to be given enough time to work with community to come up something with something that we can both sign off on you don 't want us back in six month time pointing up problems third point is we have time sea level rise as a slow onset hazard we have time to come up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a collaborative way the work has bit the work to be done the work to be done now as a critical first step collaborating and consult consulting with community after the job is done is pointless so we need to be working together on this from the beginning and what 's actually done is a critical part of that the point for an independent experts select by the community and representing community interests should also review and comment on the rear proposal point five areas that are at risk now mostly if not all will be earthquake affected areas need to be isolated and focused on we have the zero sea level rise maps from the interfering panels these show exactly where these areas are we do not need to rush into signing tompa and tater to progress this the key is that these areas need to be separated out from those that will only be affected by celia will rise the drivers are very different and the response needs to be different western sex should talkin and taylor be doing the rework the community would be much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that another firm starting a fresh would dramatically increase the cost this should be put to tender to find out 192 250,000 a lot of money up to me anyway hastily signing a contract Tonkin taylor as unnecessary and would be a mistake over side of the rework will be by para peer review community need to be confident that that will be regular rigorous and critical community should have input into this in particular f Tonkin Tate are going to do the actual rework with respect the current candidate would not be acceptable one example of a gap in the current work proposal is that Celia will see level rises scenarios are too limited the current proposal is only looking at two maps based on our pcs 8.5 and 4.5 we also need maps using currency level trends to give a base case we need to know what areas will be at risk of sea level rise simply continues at the rate it has over the last 60 years having this base case is essential if we are going to take an adaptive approach to mapping these hazards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for thank you very much we 're gonna trim is lifted yes do you want to say anything else tell no just we did wasting time in case you wonder ask questions sure there is one small point I should just add on the limb topic is that there is a case I didn 't mention it for setting a top and taylor report aside while we do this reword take it and fellow thank you um can I just ask you in terms of so what are you asking should be or suggesting should be on the limb at the stage from you have speaker yes so our suggestion and it 's just the suggestions on this back page here I can read it if you like the council has a report koso hazard assessment stage to report that indicates this property or part of this property may be susceptible coastal hazards if in a model of worst-case scenarios see light sea level rise see live were to rise one meter over the next hundred years sea level rise is currently approximately two millimeters per year so what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ context here rather than something that 's quite uncertain it may be susceptible well what does it really mean it 's you know it 's quite scary for house buyer or a lawyer potential we just want to make it more clear so you get the fierce go over why would you refer to the current rate when all the science talks about the impact of you know ice Melton and things like that which don 't affect sea level rise moment I mean why would you make a reference to the current rate when it 's the future rate that is the subject to scientific inductions yeah well that future is very uncertain in particular with eyes that are you trying to minimize you know i mean i just i want when i looked at the actual wording i wondered whether you hadn 't actually gone a step too far rather than look as I say it 's a there 's a suggestion and it 's something we should discuss and all I 'm really asking for today is the chance to do that and that point may well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question to like could you you see really like clearly the review of the tonkin and taylor report other scientists care carefully and critically reviewed it so you 're already saying that the tonkin and taylor say should not be doing involved with review so what were you coming from shins of your qualifications to actually say that they shouldn 't be shouldn 't be able to do this so it 's not about the review the review has happened it 's the rework to fix the final report so what are you saying what are you basing it on in terms of say your qualifications or what scientific evidence are you putting up that this group shouldn 't be doing the job well as i said this is the things i can see as a layperson and i am actually asking for I think point for that the community has an independent expert to look at this report and make sure that the rework is going to achieve the result we want absolutely we should have expert opinion not just people like me thank you yeah clear sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it comes to limb notification not know that people are reasonably happy to accept their I mean there 's risk across the whole city and the inland areas not only coast so are you sensing you know the community community is happy to acknowledge that but you 'll try to convey some context around it is that yes like we understand that council has to notify community about hazards and sometimes it might not be news they want but it just has to be fair and accurate for both parties and that 's really what we 're driving for we don 't think the balance is quite right yet it 's it and so it 's not yeah and not only what physically goes on it but the process by which we land on there too well I think so yeah I think you know this can be a useful contribution from community in many and many areas and this is another one I just add to that typically there 's still a lot of uncertainty out there and with through everything because there 's no clear answer at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only people are really effects in the eighteen thousand homes is the people that are buying selling or building the other people that really affects property prices are increasing noises end differently chose insurance is still available to well we 've reached the 10 minutes so um ya know I 'm gonna love to hear that through the conversation but these things are rather restrictive ugly appreciate your time so you very much thanks very much all this let me point thank you","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Report,OmX8S9T3L4Q,20160922,656.04,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1777,"we 've got the chief executives report to come back to and I just before I hand over to Colleen I just want to make one point and that us is dead when we became the council there were no chief executive reports and this has been an enormous hey there wasn 't give executive but still there wasn 't a chief executive well the particular chief executive at that garden leave when we became when we were elected but we didn 't have a chief executive report on the agenda and it has been a substantial advantage I think not just to counsel but to the public in terms of seeing the the work that we 've been doing and it has it 's been reviewed and and upgraded as we 've gone along and I think it 's it 's really looking like a a good report and I think about you know the chief executive has gone to a lot of trouble to make sure that it 's constantly being re-evaluated so that the information that 's coming out through the report is as I say not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the public so now the counselors never sit near gender either so that 's a welcome change that it 's the whole agenda setting his own but it wasn 't that was my am i doing yeah what did you do not that a team and BTW ringing and also thank you and it is constantly involved evolving as we 're getting better information about things being reporting ways I just want to draw your attention to the last couple pages and just outlining some of the awards that council has received I 've been finalists for or one or highly commended I think it just reflects that despite you know that people raise issues about council actually we have enormously talented staff and they 're very professional in the way that they do things but this really benchmarks the work that happens within the council against the best and in some cases the council 's being seen as the best and I think it 's really important just to acknowledge that in that their external agencies are acknowledging the things that are happening in the way that Starkel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a good example of just just the links that people were going to and the work that we 're doing and I think it 's really useful thing to to nokia and acknowledge that yeah so I mean the reason that I wanted this down the agenda was that it anticipated the Thomas Edmonds pain returned a decision that we were going to make later in the agenda so I thought it better to have it after the decision was made but we were all confident that that was the decision that was going to be made but questions are pool it 's not actually a question I 've just got to lighten my agenda just to thank the staff for the great work because obviously the awards that are all the nominations rewards is the outstanding there 's quite a list of them and so I just want you to pass it on back to the staff tell you no good week we just did a quick scan so they may well be thin ones that witness thank you yeah Danny yeah thanks um I just wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community project that would previously asked for the product projects in terms of the capital so we 'll be putting on too the Internet our watch lists so that people can actually see the proposed dates for consultation design execution in construction and so forth not so they would be coming up shortly okay and then just the issue of the cost share refresh and the report that was done around the anchor projects that has i understand it being released to a local Member of Parliament and that we had previously asked Lauren didn 't get have we received that and if so are we able to put that will make that available to the community to say given the high level of interest yes so um by the time the MP asked for substantial amount of time had gone by and because we work very closely together we had much of that information anyway but we had got that report and that 's available great and just in terms of the caution refresh Oh as government allowing us to do that in public we 've already see them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ originally planning to complete the refresh prior to the election we had a discussion about how it would be dealt with and public and no we didn 't get permission from government to do that we advised them that that was what we were going to do and but now that we 've made the decision to hold that over until after the election it will be a it will be in public when we debate the cost-sharing refresh if it 's concluded but I 'm sure it will be I think it 's also important to recognize that some refresh and updating as opposed to renegotiate isn 't a renegotiation okay um thank you and just the final question for me or request as as part of the community board minutes there was a request to get staff advice on what was happening with Ivan side drive between gloucester street and one only road and i was just wondering if we could get a report back the 29th of the timber meeting on on that because that yeah essentially be good just to finish that loop ok I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get you an update of time frames and if we can give you new information for the next meeting will do they know I 'm quite keen on this one too because I was at the same meeting that Jonnie was eight I think a couple of others where as well that the issue basically is that we agreed I think maybe about a year and a half ago to keep some roads open in the red zone um some of that work hasn 't been done yet and in the meantime this thing I guess other ideas for what we might do in that space particularly navin side drive cam the impact it 's having on local resumes it the particular area babe inside drive though as their area that leads down to wine on a road yeah and it 's red zoned on one side it 's got pirate park on the other I mean it 's a mess and there is a community facility that 's operating there but it 's technically red-zoned but they 've been allowed to continue to operate for all the right reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but but it 's you know when you look at the age of the people who go to the facility every week and the state of the roads and the footpaths I mean it 's just it is a very challenging environment yes as well and yeah kids coming from the schools all come down from the gloucester street bridge either by vital care to they get to the rink the time it 's taking four would 've rode as part of the problem as well yes yes yeah so it would just be good to get what 's actually happening there but maybe a maybe a more comprehensive overview of the area because that wouldn 't how long 's would amro going to take you know and it 's the multiple use and it 's just because people keep using it it 's just degra degrading all the time it would be good if we could somehow break some of these kind of you 're gonna need so i know it 's not easy over the red zone and the roads I know I don 't understand what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to go yeah that 's right and we 're stopping it 's a whole lot of its really know hey I you know those interdependencies overstock being some things yeah they are all interdependency and its future use as well no yeah yep so a year okay if I just a wee we would just do that but you 'll just do that okay let 's go alright so Pauling the patinack delights hmm because it was incredibly well attended and justified be so because it wasn 't just a wonderful show this is an option to extend the running time of that all right I 'm suit I 'm sure that 's an option they would need to go back to the people that organize it and thinking about how they manage their yeah i mean the feedback I 've had from a lot of people was that was really wonderful but solar crowded and 75,000 people throw in five days as a considerable number of people it goes exit that by the next one we will have the uplighting in the Botanic Gardens complete anyway so it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the uplighting that we 're doing in the Botanic Gardens will start in February so by the time of the next botanic delights what it looks standard not if they don 't need to they don 't need to there is money on budget there 's three years money and there 's no no no this is not connected I know I know well no they want they will be related be complementary but I think Pauline 's pointers is that with the short period of time it 's to the trait I 'm in thousands and thousands and thousands of people it 's been tested and I think these are all reviewed each year so we 'll take that into account way of limiting numbers that go through you I mean it could be a point where you have too many budget all rights so would someone like to move that the report be received David second appalling I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye as opposed say no that 's carried","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

NZ,NZ,Christchurch City Council,Christchurch City Council,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZETwErnCvvgbvBbnnHfyxA,22.09.16 - Item 51 - Submission from the Christchurch City Council on Better Urban Planning,X2Gh39kjRnM,20160921,787.11,"Christchurch, New Zealand",2105,the submission from the crash it City Council on better than planning draft report prepared by the New Zealand Productivity Commission welcomed with some one night to move the approval of the submission ok ok you 'll move it moves up seconded by David and yeah Vicki Vicki Vicki in relation to the intent behind this because I actually read most of this document and I actually got the sense that it was kind of designed for Auckland Tauranga Hamilton and I didn 't get a sense of the rest of the country really being included and what felt to me to be a very narrow economic sort of economists view of how the housing market works so I mean I also worried about our the letter from you and Colleen saying the cancer was to some extent at the forefront of urban planning and then quoting that we have an independent hearings panel which I would not put at the forefront of isn 't planning in any way shape or form actually and not one I would wish on anybody and but I just I just it just felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how you thought about it or whether you 're allowed to have feelings about it I think I 'm allowed to have feelings um I think you 're certainly quite a few of the examples they use do seem to have an autumn theme to them and obviously the land supply issuers there 's probably more acutely than others in other parts of the country and you would have seen that submission we put on on on the drive national policy statement which sought to address that and that that did seem again to have a bit of an Auckland flavor to it but it 's not unique to Auckland other paths the country do have land supply issues obviously as you know from our submission on that document where originally flash in terms of land supply here both from an intensification and a Greenfield perspective so I think that is a reasonably fair reflection of the document we have met with the Productivity Commission on a couple occasions they have come down here spoken to us they do have a keen interest in what 's happened in Christchurch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japan or was that it appears to us that that 's where the government has movement they have signaled that and some of their changes so that the that the river there there was one of the things that was horrific yeah about the concept any idea that the context doesn 't change if you cross out that first line yeah so it sees a replacement district plan delivered within three years because I think the issue is is that it 's a balance you know you go through a long process that what takes you know like 10 years for our first district plan a full replacement plan with two planes moves I personally wouldn 't recommend that to anyone in the future to go through that and such a truncated period but to have a plan but on three years I mean that 's the that 's the trade-off yeah um yeah but I agree with them Vicki I think that I thought it had my time again and I would choose the religious that are bright and let the government take full responsibility because as you highlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive recommendations from the ihp they make decisions yes sir it 's different to the Auckland Council my HP yeah the process of them yani I just wanted to touch on that as well that I think one of the major issues with the ihp is the fact that government appoint those commissioners as well so they 're not really independent and we should be quite I personally think we should actually be quite critical that that you know hey I don 't believe we should support independent hearings panels but they that are not independent of their appointed by government and if citizens of the city have no accountability to land use decisions then why would we adopt that so I also think it would be good to have put some comment around the inability of communities to participate in any real sort of meaningful way through the ihp process because it becomes like a court rather than a conversation and that actually excludes a huge amount of people you know and if you look at what happened with intensive residential housing and lumbered for example the views of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost completely discounted in favor of lawyers and economists and i think that 's that 's a major failing and it doesn 't really come through strongly enough in this submission I think the only other thing is that the idea that I don 't think you can separate this from the context of local government changes but the idea that the government can do statements of expectation around how councils should do their district plans I think is incredibly alarming and our experience shows that even though the majority of people in Christchurch supported getting better bebin design principles the the statement of expectation removed it without any public consultation with our community yeah and energy efficiency so you know I just think we need to be a lot more stronger in our own criticism of this failed experiment here in terms of the impact on local citizens which has been to basically exclude them from the things that they want I agree with that because Christchurch 's held up is the example of how we fixed housing and actually none of the things that they said they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the country to believe that and to adopt things that are detrimental to a community well-being in the belief that it will fix housing so I would be much more critical of and I mean the questions they 're asking is so stupid anyway but the lack of community engagement in the process was one of its biggest flaws you know I mean in a any environment engaging with the community about the kind of place they want to love you know it 's pretty fundamental and in a post disaster environment it 's even more important you know so um yeah I 'm kind of with yanni and Sookie yes so wrecked and then fill and clean yeah quick once a question 10.3 around the alternative funding systems you think we could actually say in paragraph 2 there is also a strong case for government to make a contribution you put there is a case yes which is all because you given that they 've sort of step so you 're tentatively into that space yeah yep Phil and then Glenn think thank you Richard um I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's an open bottom paragraph to about the community feeling really disempowered and I think the only refer to some aspects of the amendment or the local government act of the amendments the submission is to New Zealand Productivity Commission I know but could we also refer to it to the other I guess changes the government and making is well you know that in pet they are all rather aligned in alarming yes and I think that was what we attended to get across there I think if you look at it item 4 on the covering letter in relation to links with other reforms going on there there are a lot of documents out there obviously they 're looking at the the resource management net there is the MPs and there 's this and there 's other work streams been done by local government so it 's a matter of kind of they all have a similar theme to them and it is you know consistent with the approach that that Vicky referred to earlier on in terms of you know where the government 's move into on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around it yep and clean oh thank you I sets the frustration in our submission in 4.7 Roman numeral 3 page 9 20 over land supply so seems to be a bit of an obsession with this have you picked up any hint from the Productivity Commission over a piece of work towards construction costs in the housing sector there are any hints that that could actually be awesome oppa the heart of the equation doesn 't seem to the last time we met with them was some time ago as I just mentioned earlier on there are examples around the country where land supply is particularly acute we 're not one of those places oh we have a huge amount of green fields in intensification available to people I 'm not sure if the the construction cost was a particular issue that 's not me left I look at a little bit closer that certainly at land suppliers are keen focus but I think if you think back a few years ago the the narrative around that the issue particularly in relation to all comers all of our land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the issue is far broader than that that is one of the problems undoubtedly in Auckland and the unitary plan up they are sought to address it but but the Auckland 's of that the problems are far more complex than just about land supply and so yes okay what I actually wonder whether there should be a sort of a paragraph offered on the new regeneration planning process I know because I mean I mean I think if we don 't mention it then they may not actually see it as the it as another way of doing things that has you know community engagement built into the decision-making framework and it 's almost like that 's the alternative for objections and legalistic sort of processes that in hearings and then a you know obviously a sign off but a restricted sign off from from the minister in this case it wouldn 't be the minister for the I mean it probably would be the minister of the environment or and other cases in terms of RMA i would guess if it was being seen as a model for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tick if it meets the policy objective of the legislation and that that 's you know I think we could put that in as a very positive framework that we had here in Christchurch yep I can add a paragraph in my life internet cool so um so can we don 't need to brighten the specifics of the changes you have noticed although I 'm just thinking approval this is obviously a draft and your van for some changes of me so I 'm happy to put those in but a bit good to have something on the delegations really approval the final version if you want to delegate that to the CEO or delegate that to when does it jump to the Ambo about next week what 's the closing date for there 's October fourth I think okay so but will it will all be around so there 's a meeting next week so we could just sign it off next week so on off next month yep okay said alright that 's fine yeah I july though Gino sure giving a long long the meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the yeah if everyone 's like oh yeah that seems like a best idea so so so what do we want we 'll have fun do what would do we just leave it lying on the table until its amended or yep thank you okay so that that the council requests that the amended submission be brought back to council on the twenty-ninth 29th of thumb 29th of timber for final approval thank you so I 'm happy to move that second does Glenn I 'll put that notion all those in favor say aye or

Paul 's Trinity Presbyterian Church this comes through essentially through me because it 's the Christchurch earthquake Merrill relief fund when the simples Trinity Pacific Presbyterian Church originally applied for this grant that was approved back in the 26th or November 2015 it was towards the building of the church auditorium and site works I was it was a multicultural event center rather so if you look at 4.1 it was for a a different purpose and in a different place and so that that the nature of the request now has changed and my preference would be that we defer making a decision on this today but our staff to work with some fools Trinity Pacific Presbyterian Church to align more with the original request i think that the purpose of the donations was for community facilities that had be all community community things that had been lost in the earthquake and that this has become quite church pacific rather than community-specific so and i think that with staff working with them very genuinely and openly we can get to a good result where the intention of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they are able to provide so I 'll move that motion do I have a seconder for that Glen sitting bet cookies a Presbyterian minister Oh what is the right okay all right so seconded by Phil right Yanni so just a question on the stuff they were asking to work with them I can understand the funding stuff but you know if you look at Mount Pleasant one of the really beneficial things was a project manager mmm so is it possible maybe just two so they specify that we 'd also asked if they could just provide some support or yes did you want to come up to the table of it and I think it 's a very helpful suggestion yani that 's that 's really good yeah we we support the approach that the council is considering at the moment would ask the community governance team to work closely with the with the organization and contract any appropriate resource to undertake work required rather than be specific about contracting a project manager I think if that 's lived with us we will make sure we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outcome that the council values are seeking yeah okay oh yeah tomates not at a community Gump 's level that 's the issue it 's actually at that project management so if I can respond to that about under that yeah that 's right they are ok so the community governance team includes people on the ground not just if you were in a governance role and community development and and we can contract additional workers such as project staff and order to do that so that comes within our unit in we would do that okay so is that the people out of the facilities rebuild people as well we would contract internally oh yeah yeah definitely the internal staff absolutely okay yeah I I think what would I think we can give an undertaking that we will bring the right resources to the job in order to get the outcome that 's being sought so as long as it 's you 're honest yeah okay yeah yeah well i mean i think that what maybe if you put them brackets afterwards noting the the the project management approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mount Pleasant first year understand it and then you 're then you you know that you 've got their range of options at your fingertips yep yep cool okay alright so i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye there 's a place they know that 's carried thank you very much,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

and transport changes team of people here we start off with them are there any questions well good with someone like to move the recommendation Pauline someone like to second the recommendation go yani just to speak whenever that all that yes go first my legs have moved it I don 't think that there 's some there 's no questions or anything like that will just go straight to debate yep appalling would you like to lead off then I just to witness came to our environment committee last weekend the main I think the main thing I took away from that meeting was that incredibly happy that the people we were consulted with about the whole process that they really felt they will listen to they felt that they were changes made in response to these submissions and they were generally very happy with the outcome with the as the second option not the second option but what we 've ended up with and to me I 'm seeing this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ processes we had a good one with the panera parallel this is a good one too and I think it 's reflecting a very big change in the organization and I just really want to thank stuff on all the work they 've done on this and it 's been really tricky one they have been parking reductions but to the levels that people are finding manageable so I think we 've reached a good compromise and we 're getting the outcome that we want by reducing the number of cars as well so I just want to congratulate stuff on a really good process Phil look I would think staff to for a huge amount of work enormous and and i think i agree with pauline that the this is really a good good outcome in fact i 'm pleasantly surprised like and i think there was some quite a lot of misunderstanding in the first place by some groups that in fact we 'll be like Caffrey it was never going to be that in fact it was always going to be a public transport route like it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great thing though like last evening I had a conversation with what the person who made the submission from spokes who 'd been really concerned about where cycleways foot and he understood and agreed that in fact there would be a place for psychic for likes that in fact you know and he was also pleased and in fact their concerns have been heard and we 'll make sure that you know cyclists are as safe as possible particularly because this will be a 30k speed area and particularly in what the way we I think we got agreement from the different different views in the community was in fact the main goal of achieving a huge reduction of the number of cars going down there like reducing about 10,000 in fact that can be achieved so I all together I think we 've gone a long way to getting satisfaction with it what the victoria street plan yep um yani yeah Oh to ending David yeah I don 't support this project I have a lot of concerns about the design the ultimate safety of the design with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of congested into the the one area and also are unconvinced of what will happen with the traffic and in that northern part of this area around be liev Montreal straight I think that there needs to be an overall traffic plan and you 'll you 'll see that there was a report that came out from government around the accessible transport plan and the rustic around it not being fully funded they 're not delivering on the benefits I haven 't actually seen that report yet but i but i await a copy to meet we actually need to have a much more holistic approach to what we 're doing with traffic coming in from the north my understanding is we 've got something like forty thousand extra vehicles coming through the northern right away and extension into be liev or into that vicinity and that 's all going to need a lot of thought about what we 're doing the same time we 're slowing down traffic the central city so where is that traffic going to go um but putting those safety concerns to one side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City which as you know was done a long time ago and needs to be updated and rethought within the funding constraints the biggest problem I have with this is the amount of money this is over eight million dollars being spent is 7.2 million for this specific project and in a few years time in the year 2000 18 and 19 another million being spent on intersection improvements for this area as well so eight million dollars I don 't support eight million dollars going into Victoria Street the issue for me is that there is much more higher priorities in our city at the moment we 've just had one for Midway street that you 've just voted on before that is where our money should be going fixing the streets properly in the suburbs rather than gold plating the central city streets that actually don 't need this amount of money spent on them now and if tight and time there 's the luxury of having extra capital to invest in these things then that should is when it should be considered but at the moment i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our suburbs that are getting poor pet repairs done and giving local residents an awful degree of amenity that will now not be funded for a very long time to be fixed properly and that 's what concerns me so i won 't be voting for this it 's a huge amount of money four years worth of our footpath repair budget in one project and that 's why I 'm not supporting it David I think you look I just like to sort of complement the process that we 've gone through with this and we heard something like 18 submissions the other day and I believe in the end we we came to a resolution that pretty much satisfied most of the submitters that came before us I would like to just reiterate one point that I made at the meeting the other day whilst I supported the direction of the the plan I do have an ongoing concern about the propensity to throw our bike lanes of and our bus lanes together and when we don 't seem to be thinking outside the square and trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love to see this project flip the cycle lane into a shed footpath in a social way and I appreciate the explanation that I was given about trying to have cycle safety with cows opening doors and separation between the two areas and we have that we have the prospect now of cars parking and they 'll have to bike across a pack back sorry across the cycle lane to get into carfax so I don 't think we 're actually as a city thinking enough about trying to maintain separation between cyclists and vehicular traffic and if there 's one thing that i would thoroughly recommend going forward that we do give more concern i know it 's a bit more expensive and i 'm sure there are ways to meet mitigate those costs but surely the ultimate aim is to provide cycle ways that are safe for our cycling population and avoid throwing them into the same sort of pathway as buses and other traffic so look I am going to support this recommendation I did make these observations when we passed it through the Ithaca mitty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this works to redirect the bike traffic off the bus lane a lot of things I would certainly encourage it all right i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye as opposed a note or two sort of

programme,jgDX8PKqmRs,20160921,359.58,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1066,Midway Street renewal an adjustment Stu the street renewal program move by Pauline seconded by Glen sore just an unchristian yeah a question yet so don 't come forward so thank you I just want to check if we approve this resolution today that we haven 't finished the North even road consultation but when that report comes back to us if we approve this is there any risk that that project gets delayed even further given given that it 's possibly got a request for additional funding as well so let 's pump this protein earth project here what we have what we 're doing is we obviously had the opportunity to combine the Midway Street bringing the curbs in as part of the the replacement of the pump of the land rail or the installation of pipe on demand rains recovery program as that 's going to be a very wide trench they could have built a new pavement so we 're taking the opportunity of because I 'm the land drainage project they 've got to do about nine meters with the pavement with bringing the curbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some funding for word from the 18 19 year and supplement that with some voices shifting the program for North Haven Road out over the two years that was going to happen anyway because of the consultation process we because the position were in with the consultation process now we didn 't envisage being able to construct northaven or start construction till about March 2017 so it will practically have to roll over two years anyway so this really adjusts the program were there any changes to what is currently proposed under North even whether something comes up through consultation the requires an amendment of that I can 't predict that we would have to deal with that at the time of the conclusion of consultation right so just so in terms of North avin it does say slight delay one to two years so that brought that 's not really correct yeah sorry is probably confusing terminology what it affected all with what we 're trying to communicate there is instead of doing from one year is now going to be over two years not that there 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to start in this current financial year just a bit later than was originally intended because of the consultation period falling within within the election time frame as well so certain given that that project is it 's kind of you know what you 've done with this one which is quite good on page 50 for is it possible to get that for the northaven road project as well so that we can understand when we when it comes to the community boards around you know the different funding sources to meet the design then certain it is that yes okay when it comes back I think that would be useful yeah that 's great coach so Heather moved and seconded Pauline just to point out that this is arguably the biggest piece of workers and that these are these great big massive massive they 're not really pipes because the rectangular they 're going right down the street they 're going to take any future flood event waters strike down there to the aid one so this is a significant piece of work that to me has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flooding so I 'm looking forward to it getting done thank you right I 'm gleam gleam Yanni thank you yeah i see is with what Pauline said this is the main point of difference over this road it really is the end part of the flockton solution there it 's also good when we look at other pieces of work and council today and join them up so we 've just approved before the variation of the lease of the shirley tennis club for two extra courts just around the corner and would choose the street so if you look at the good news for the community today and the hard-hit part of richmond it now falls into the new Central Ward I think this is a good thing that we 're doing and I like to really appreciate give thanks to that the staff member can 't remember her name who worked on this with the residents it was a pretty sensitive issue she was excellent and good board prices too so fabulous because of this room so good good PB yeah um yeah I think it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i guess the content the wider context as it 's a shame that we haven 't been able to do this for other streets that have had their appears and and actually done done the full job but that shouldn 't detract from this one having the full job done it is safe at the same time it just obviously makes financial sense energy gets a bit of outcome in a long run I think we do need to be mindful of the fact that we actually should set up a process by which others like wooden road is another one where we 've got major works and no funding for the footpaths and the renewals to be done alongside ER so it 'd be good to have a process around how those projects can be elevated so that it actually happens rather than just be left to the you know either to the last minute or for people to complain it in come back later so I 'm really supportive of this this is actually a very sensible thing to do it 's the right thing to do and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it now rather than do it later and we should take this approach to a number of other projects on these writing and infrastructure repairs and these eastern suburbs and possibly others if it 's so required so very supportive of this excellent all right i

comfortable with us it 's been through a good process would you like to move it yep and seconded by pauline phil and although our committee and approved this and i 'm in support of weight of the location i reached on a chick with staff because I 've got a bit of disappointment about the final design if you like and I know it went through a hearing spin all but can you just clarify to us that in terms of our public transport systems what I suit what a super stock really needs to involve so you so essentially what we 're trying to try to prevent provide with the super stop as a platform that provides an additional level of comfort that you might normally expect it and also a high liver capacity and I guess and another sensor provides an opportunity for enhanced services such as potentially Wi-Fi and I to related services in this case essentially that that shelter and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shelter provide additional shelter from the weather and the end the size of it means that time it has the ability to accommodate a high number of users so Ryan with this construction in the design for example would we be able to have safety glass in front of it in places so that in fact people sheltering are protected from the east leaf so I would Edward requirement an element or redesign I 'm not sure how with that without speaking to the designers I 'm not sure how practical that would be against an example we will use that type of setup is on a Northland super stop where there 's a bit of glass that 's guess along the sort of curve line to give some particular firm the wind net itself Hembree right some issues around swimming areas with buses and that type of thing so the advantage of not having that is that gives that sort of clear zone around the cube builder to board at various locations and and and this one is there still any opportunity for the design of the actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your day is location of the stops and is part of the process the design we were asked from the hearings panel to go back and work on design with the locals this this is what the the team and the locals have come up with so got general agreement if without knowing more details of the design and made it possible to retrofit something to the front of that to give some shelter and then why not change the appearance or the location obviously of the other shelters to the extent that it goes against what 's already been agreed think stiffen and although I have sported the suit committee stage and I 've now got some concerns of it being a super stop if in fact we don 't pass us today will it slow slow the whole process down so in fact there 's a slower build or what would be any any likely delay it would it would certainly and delay in potentially complexity as to to have otro carro deliver their Manchester Street project in that they presently constructing that wider Manchus district project and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivering this shelter is part of that process thanks Ryan okay any other questions so you 'll move to second it by pauline i 'll put the motion oh it 's speak to it your phone yep look it 's attached to you with quite a lot of reluctance that I I do continue to support it I 'm aware this has gone a long way I guess when I I look back at what we had started with with the Ripper the original concept and the earlier design this is quite different I guess what we all want to see is the best public transport system we could have can have and that includes our infrastructure so it 's with some disappointment that in fact i am moving this and supporting it because we you know i believe that for future decision-making we need to get really serious about having the best public transport we we need to and this was outside area of governance and visitor of the CBD but however I just do add that I would hope that with future bus shelters and stops that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath you 're very quickly I mean having been on the the hearings panel for this I think this is a good outcome so good job from staff and happy to support it good just a little clarification it was a second sorry okay there is a central barrier that will stop net wins I get Ben shoulder on either seems very very helpful that not at the appropriate times yep just with regarding the concern of the Eastleigh the easterly windows is she just more of an irritant when it 's up and running the bed where that really comes from the Sutherland this really does cover that so I 'm I do think and I agree with riff this has been an interesting process but we 've got to a really good end I do think and done everyone 's on board with this like it 'll be great to get it up and running it 's certainly better than having nothing it 's for sure

NZ,NZ,Christchurch City Council,Christchurch City Council,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZETwErnCvvgbvBbnnHfyxA,22.09.16 - Item 50 - Compliance with Drinking Water Standards - Northwest Christchurch,_d6Dzog4hOw,20160921,706.75,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1990,buried so it 's we 're just receiving the report we 're not we 're not X we 're not yet received the information and this report and now we move to item 50 which has really superseded the earlier report what which is why I 've dealt with it in that way and it deals with the main recommendation of the original report which is to bring the drinking water supply well improvement program for the northwest of Christchurch to bring it forward for a target completion date and I 'm going to ask some questions about that but also just to indicate that that it 's my intention to remove yeah remove the reference and be to consideration of temporary color chlorination of the affected zone until the deeper wells are commissioned and 2017 but at a new recommendation 3 that staff report back to the council by the end of november with the response of the medical officer of health to these measures because there are a number of measures that we 're taking and i believe that in terms of the you know the approach in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requires some discussion with the medical officer of health as to whether these measures had met the concerns that were originally raised so if you 'd like to introduce the paper and you want to or do you want to just take questions I can in a hot topic in the media of recent times so that 's on everyone 's mind across the country okay thanks John so as we 're all aware we have pretty good secure water supplies in most of the city with the exception of the Northwest catchments of the water catchments that come from shallow bores that can be affected by surface activity there 's been a program turn to deepen these wells and that program was going to be completed in 2018 so a lot of work to be done on that most of the holes of wells have actually been drilled so it 's just a matter of proving those wells and completing the head works all the mechanical electrical and technology that goes into that talking to the team they can accelerate that program with no great risk to the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ march at 2017 but what i 've said generally by the end of the financial year jun 17 we could have the deeper wells and have that a far more secure source and we have we comply with the drinking water standards because even though we have shallow wells we do comply with the drinking water standards because of the actions and our water safety plan that says we do all these things to mitigate the risks we do daily testing on the shallow force we inspect the head works so it 's a quite a tight regime that we use to manage the quality of that water and reduce the risk what that the events up north have caused the medical officer of health to question the water safety plan and he 's asked a question do you still think it meets all practicable steps for managing the health risk in that community a fair question to ask so we 've gone back and looked at and we look at the legislation it says that we should take all practicable steps to protect the community from health risks chlorination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a professional engineer that 's what my recommendation was to the 80 committee now I understand that there needs to be there 's a huge public debate to be had about whether we chlorinate or not and again so that 's where we came to the point we 'd go out and engage with the communities what their needs to be as a bit of an education campaign about the residual risk that the public actually faced there wasn 't a clear understanding and havelock north that the delay between the time you take a test and the time you get a result there 's a 24-hour period where you have to incubate the bugs to actually show whether you have a contamination event or potentially a 47 our potentially longer it 's a minimum of 24 hours oh it 's so that 's the residual risk we 're talking about so well while the the likelihood is low the consequences are quite severe as we 've seen so that 's why the community and public health have asked the question and so we 're working with them on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supportive in the way that this is being managed so I can accept the recommendation but I do have a duty to say that chlorination of the Northwest supply is a practicable step it would be my recommendation but I understand the need for community engagement and then particularly getting the medical officer of Health on board as well now that 's absolutely accept women and there is no question that it 's you know it 's your your public duty to provide professional advice and that 's what you 've done so there 's no no question about that at all the the question for me though as has the risk changed has the rest changed in the last few years and when did it change the risk hasn 't changed how have a lot North hasn 't if you haven 't done anything particularly different we were quite comfortable with the level of risk management we were doing with the city 's water supplies so that it 's the perception of risk that 's now heightened drift but the and and really your professional advice is based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's right yeah but but it wasn 't to the front of mind before they have lot North incident that we weren 't doing everything practical that 's right so the water safety plan issue is that is the key to it yeah that the medical officer of Health was satisfied with the water safety plan it it mean it meant that we were meeting the requirements of the Act the events up north have given them cause to reflect on that so that 's what we 're doing and that 's good because we want our you know medical officer of health to be alert to these matters as well Phil so thank you John and like in addition to the monitoring reports which you 've provided to our committee when you 're with your three water 's report this I guess increases the information and what I just and also though besides the monitoring which you 'll continue to do that I would assume that information would also go to the medical officer of health and in turn the medical officer will let us know if in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes now that that engagement is is going on all the time in fact I spoke to the acting the Alice 's replacement just this morning and they 're very comfortable with the the approach that we 're taking bye thanks John ref a quick one I mean I agree accelerating the program is appropriate shutting down shallow pools where necessary and increasing the testing but one thing we don 't really talk about is you know if chlorination was introduced even for a small amount of time I mean that has potential health impacts as well on people who suffer from impacts of chlorine is that something that we look at when we 're considering that the overall health issues it 's very rare that there are allergic reactions deploring so there 's a very very small part of the community the biggest risk forest as those who rely on the water for for medical procedures such as analysis other parts of community who may be breed tropical fish but those sort of people they will be affected by but very very rare skin related illness from chlorination but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon sweet I don 't know the whole history but prob very very long time yes it Yanni have you got your big rock sorry what page was a yawning page 392 what your two reservoirs sorry eight is happening you going back to the future so much the only thing yeah sorry i just found the solution because it 's on us so much yeah i just basically not wanted to know what the time frame was for those two repairs being done and whether those are new facilities that have just been built or whether that old facilities that have been repaired oh there 's a whole lot of crack repairs going on in all the reservoirs and and the team here are actually have a program for putting impermeable barriers on all there is worsen so these are these are new buildings or these are old buildings are all of them so it 's one of the things you 'll find from those previous results that there were a number of the contamination issues we got were from reservoir so we are tightening the roof so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things entering into those reservoirs so we are locking down the all the potential contamination routes really into the into the network as part of the repairs okay yeah i mean i 'm trying to understand like when that work will be complete we can come back here and little bit you or what about it we 're talking about the same time frame bye-bye you know the jun 17 pulling sorry as a wee bit late bacon I hope you haven 't covered this already but in the meantime power viable would it be full council to provide water stations around out there that people could actually if they chose to fill up drinking water containers would that be a very big cost burden for us to to be so that we could carry on at the level of risk but if people chose not to take drink that water that we provide them with some other water did you I think there would be an unnecessary step but how viable what it would it be very costly for us to do that if we wanted to know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the user quite simply we had water trucks around for a while well all I would be suggesting as if people wanted to do that they could certainly no I 'm sure most people would have a friend who are outside of that area that could actually go and fill as many water containers from another part of our network if they wish to that 's true yeah because it might be a way around it for people to if they didn 't want to take the risk then they just drunk different water it 's only the drinking water that really is the risk isn 't it it 's a risk when you clean your teeth and so it 's all that sort of contact it 's whatever goes into your mouth really it 's that yeah yeah ok thank you yep all right um so I 'm I 'm happy to move the recommendation do I have a seconder right oh yeah is there any discussion I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much,"(-43.5320214,

and Julie comfort of David level Smith speaking to item 48 all small commons homestead development contributions from russian application thank you know me he knew II Alton Mario counselors and thank you for your time today to discuss our admission application i 'm nita for mall at mccormick lord and I 've got Julie comfort here from davie level Smith Simon mortlock sends his regards from Washington DC despite the distance he is obviously very interested in the outcome of this meeting the remissions application report made a number of points which I just want to touch on to the ginn width firstly that the council has the ability to remit development contributions and exceptional circumstances the council has also requested through the financial information and we 're happy to provide this on request the Heritage Park which will benefit the development and the community as the matter of the remissions application and that the statement of commitment that was signed by danny mora made no provision for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual charging other development contribution I just want to start with a little bit of context about the development horse or Commons this development is an exemplar development identified through the land use recovery plan it is unique and then of the six proposed exemplar developments initiated after the earthquake this is the only private one proceeding in by far the largest scale the remainder who found the exemplar proceeds to complex expensive and time-consuming thus exemplar development is offering a mixed medium density development incorporating affordable housing with high public community it is a resin out of a commitment from the Christchurch City Council to work in partnership with Denny Mora to provide a role model for future developments in Christchurch some examples of exemplar elements of this development include the collaboration with the food resilience network to create a network of community gardens affordable housing scheme collaboration with Wayne Francis Charitable Trust which will provide affordable shared ownership housing arrangements for low-income families public spaces which will be funded and managed by the residents of horse or Commons both residential and commercial all homes will be a minimum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathetic to neighboring dwellings the commitment between the council in dannemora has led to the signing of the statement of commitment this document was entered into on the expectation that there would be no development contributions available for the Heritage Park and in return Danny Mora is not seeking any contribution from council for this reserve which will be developed which will be managed by the developer and the residents association while the statement of commitment doesn 't make specific reference to this agreement it doesn 't discuss a heritage park in detail but rather talks about higher level commitments to the quality of the development and this document was considered to be a living document where by the parties would work collaboratively to ensure the success of this exemplar development and work in good faith to overcome any problems the agreement not to challenge development contributions for the Heritage Park was seen to be a given the proposal at hand currently is not in the spirit of this agreement and the working relationship we 've had to date Danny Mora continues to be committed to the exemplar development and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as affordable housing and have residents managing their public space in order to increase the quality of the amenities beyond what the council has capacity to provide currently Denny more is providing enhanced amenities at horrible comments at extra little extra obligation to our council just to be clear this request for remission of development contribution is only in reference to the Heritage Park the circumstances surrounding this application for remission are unique this development is the only private exemplar development and anymore again to no economic benefit from retaining and developing the lodge as a cafe in fact they will be doing so at a significant financial loss how we 've earned they see this development is providing a significant community benefit providing the area with a real point of difference by retaining some of the heritage as this area 's had very little retention of heritage buildings the development of the Heritage Park is not integral to the horse all comments the development already has sufficient amenities in the adjoining commercial area the council and anymore view this heritage park is providing a vibrant and distinctive community hub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic perspective it would make more sense for Danny more to demolish the building and either provide a for purpose modern building not develop the area at all or fill it with housing however we are committed to creating a trend-setting development which incorporates desirable living elements I also want to note that the development contribution which is proposed in this report is based on a special assessment for the transport component which results in significantly high household unit equivalent figure for the cafe in comparison if the assessment had been for a cafe that was located in the adjoining commercial area or under previous development contribution policies under either of these scenarios the proposed contribution would be some hundred thousand dollars less it really puzzles us why the decision for a driver to turn left rather than right would result in the developer in carrying such increased costs we wish to end this on a note that should the development contribution be charged in full then the council would not actually receive the advantage of this contribution as the project just cannot proceed there is no scenario where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is just not feasible for Denny Mora should the remission be granted or a significant reduction then the benefits to the council and the residents of Christchurch can enjoy include the retention of a heritage building and the creation of a vibrant community hub in the horse or Commons we remain committed to providing an exemplar development with council as per the terms of our statement of commitment and we look forward to working closely with council on this measure we 're open for any questions councillors may have visions that gleam so can you give us an indication please of what the Affordable component so that 's twenty two percent the owner of the overall development what you anticipate the units will go for or we 're be aiming for with end without the dc 's so so we 've got two components are affordable housing yodel that 's working with the way in fastest charitable trust so that the this remission is in relation to the cafe it 's not in relation to the affordable housing they 're not seeking a remission and relation to their house environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let 's split into two parts one is ten percent of homes this by the way is all in the statement of commitment will be signed last year and and we 're looking at those homes having a capital value of up to four hundred fifty five thousand dollars and which will be under a shared ownership arrangement with the way in francis trust and the focus of their charitable trust is actually to benefit young people so we 're looking at ways to help young people get their first home or young families to ensure healthy living suit ancestors with families and the other sort of part component is what 's called appropriate scale by design so they 'll be sort sort of houses which by design will be more affordable because i 'll be using materials or design techniques which allow them to be cheaper and these will be ranging between these are sort of more smaller apartment units and it 's two hundred thousand to three hundred and seventy thousand dollars to 200,000 to 370 okay yep is what we 're hoping for okay thank you that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same lines and just if I could give us some further clarification about those so are you saying it to it was a twenty percent of them would be small units the twenty two percent will be affordable housing and that 's mixed into two models one is cheaper by design the other one is to create sort of a shared ownership model where the wine francis has helped soon families into highness and the price range that you 're estimating for those would be within that figure gave us two hundred two three days but we 're currently aiming for our course and about what we the size of those units so again I would highly recommend you check out a statement of commitment but we 've got an a selection of different types of units we 've got three bedroom units with 120 square meters internal that 's over two stories we 've got two bedroom units at a 90 square meters in total which again is usually over two stories we 've got some two-story apartment buildings and which will all be a joined units and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housing as well there is a lot of detail about that proposal for the affordable housing in our statement of commitment yeah but as you say this this is not a request and relation no I not own this actually I think they 're here to what council is a king to see is that is the development in its context it 's wider context from it but but this issue is about losing the Heritage Park which is a spread and lodge the lodge is a heritage building but it 's not here to listed building so which means that you could knock it down tomorrow without it clean and to be honest there is a huge financial loss here anymore in carrying out this case a project but they do see this is a huge immunity to the development and two people in Christchurch yeah I agree so yeah I 'm not sure why you didn 't bring it to us on also don that you 've included a formal healthy housing the context why in fact you didn 't see you as a key factor to apply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dc 's is just for the here to here so just this isn 't this is just as anybody else but yea trained and lodge spreading lodge is not on our list list of heritage buildings and in a way if it were then we would be having a slightly different conversation but you could knock it down tomorrow we you don 't want to and you 're telling us that there 's an enormous additional cost to the development very mature actually do what you 're proposing to do and you 'd like us to remit the dcs on the basis that it 's an exceptional set of circumstances and it 's the only remaining exemplar project would that be a fair enough summary in the context of the wider working relationship with council on this development affordable housing to be one of those examples we 've got a fantastic working relationship we are really trying to set a new trend and development your prostitute and here is an example of how we can do that yeah I mean I 'd love to see an exemplar inside the forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those at one point but I 'd love to see that but you know I mean all go I mean we 've got to the 10 minutes but you need a question okay Panda are fully finishing or just the reduction our preferences definitely a remission you 're a value calendula the pc or no hotter difference between the fully the remission and also the reaction but well in the end of this project is not financially viable so anything that we can do to make it more likely to go through would help so full remission would mean that we can push it through as a project which shows partnership between counsel and Danny more on a reduction it would still would have to crunch the numbers and see if it sticks up so if we turn is that is that done questions because thank you very much for your presentation and we 'll get stuff to the table to take your place thank you thank you count every time this morning and we 'll go straight to item or 48 and I think that there might be somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of development contributions is there any one of their mind I 'll Vicki buck would like to move that would Jimmy Chan like to stick in there yeah bye they like to ask the purchase stuff yes still would like of you are you happy to see kim to the notion to approve the full russia of the development contributions okay staff Jimmy yeah right I just want to know that if we take the option to you know that either cancer a pool fully remission whether the data are total consistent with the DC plan the word for promotional or only the option mystery and option one is compared with the DC policy other option two so that 's the the decision that needs to be made today so it 's consistent with the DC policy of the council consider it to be unique and compelling circumstances for thus remission so there 's what needs to be decided whichever way you go it is consistent with the the policy if you decided meets that Clause is it the only exemplar it yes the only remaining there was a proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Riccarton racecourse was going to be a second it 's an exemplar okay but regarding to a fika between the full easy mission and the sheet actions regarding TC the revenue for council how much difference okay okay the support of the first one so yeah so I 'm right so yes this is unique only it simpler that is left I 've met with Simon and others summon Motlop and others on this I have to say it does not make financial sense to do what they are doing they 're doing it to create immunity value in their subdivision and I like the fact that they are doing everything that they 're doing in this exemplar six star has six style home star was actually what we sought in the district scheme remember and the government decided it wasn 't a good idea and the whole community gardens the affordable housing the first example of shared equity on any scale and Christchurch which I love the affordable housing I think this is stunning and as in direct contrast to the earlier development over the road which was devout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this has thought through how you develop a community how you build a community and that way it is unique and compelling and this does not qualify for a heritage or historic places grant because it is not listed as one but is highly regarded within the community and as definitely worthy of conservation and of creating the amenity value that this does I 'm very happy to move the fall yet the council approved a full promotion because of the unique and compelling sentences yep um Danny then Glynn oh sorry we 're debating it now Oh honestly we thought nobody nobody put their hand up for other questions but he when she said I 'll move it and debate it okay well I 'll debate it like so I think I 'm I understand all the reasons why they would like a DC rebate and I do think it is unique and compelling but I actually think the bigger question here is how on earth are we calculating a hundred and forty-three thousand dollars of development contributions for a k5 like that is to me an absolutely incomprehensible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know a massive supermarket shopping mall complex but a hundred and forty-three thousand dollars being charged for turning an existing building into a cafe I just cannot comprehend it also the question I was going to ask that I won 't ask um but I think that I think that actually the reason why I 'll support this remission or waving or whatever you want to call it is actually I just can 't justify this contour of DC and you know if you align that to this is the only exemplar that 's going on I think it 's worthy of support my understanding was that we could do development agreements with developers around different aspects including the level of DC charges and I so I 'm a bit puzzled as to why we couldn 't have sorted that out through that arrangement rather than a formal report to Council but that being said um you know I think it 's important to acknowledge that the building itself will not retain its significant heritage but but it will actually be kept in the scale and the context and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of heritage buildings is to get a practical use and sometimes we have to compromise and obviously in this case that 's what 's been suggested so you know I think it 's really good and I just want to end with the comment that was made about that Aiden fields development for example where we had a beautiful old farmhouse wouldn 't it have been wonderful for that development that kept that as a market garden or a cafe and the character and you know there 's local shops and the local cafes that people really like instead what we ended up funding a memorial and its place while it was demolished and housing went on it so contrast that approach to this approach my preferences for this approach and I 'm very happy to support very good clean take you i know this is about the cafe but the original recommendation gave us some context where it said as part of the hallsville commons exempla medium density housing project for me it does meet the test of being unique given that it is the only exemplar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we know from others that DC 's on this could be the maple rate of the project and gary moore for one was happy to have that conveyed today over his over his attempts to try and get affordable housing across the line we note in here too that with the cafe with what we do in our housing it 's about community and having context so we know that if we are going to promote affordable housing we can 't just do it in isolation that must be as part of a community I think that 's also another very strong factor here finally I think it 's also our job at times to get out of the way to make things happen not just to be proactive and promote things but actually to get out of the way and this is a good thing to do to get out of the way to actually allow this to go ahead in our YouTube full support for that recommendation all right i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye as opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much","(-43.5320214,

yes and seconded by pauline and and we 'll we 'll open that up for won 't questions for staff it 's really just for clarification and it is in the agreement but my understanding from the agreement in terms of that is it the Judi trust that they had transferred it from council for one dollar and then in the future that in fact it would come back to council for one dollar as well correct yeah just wanted to clarify that pletely and I mean just to pick up yannis pointers there sufficient in terms of the agreement that the engagement with manaphy Noir is taken care of yes the trust and teens time to take through the community consultation once we 've given to the detailed design stage that it 's that will include the local Runa so is it possible to make that explicit so that because in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the options raise that as as a potential issue that yeah that we 've got an eerie management plan as well that identifies too many coastal structures in the harbor as an issue so you know I 'd just like to have some formality around the fact that a the local Erie have have been talked worth and are supportive of this project and be that there will be ongoing engagement involvement with them in the design the beautiful issue if it was a new structure additional structure clearly everything yeah perhaps analyst could be in the lead conditions to the funding as part of that we get something from the Runanga and in writing it and support I mean I 'm not on the group that 's been talking with the Runa I don 't know if others who are involved in that guild it is a need to make reference to it what I what I do know is that i was on the council that received at ely management plan and the talk at the time was you know it 's one thing to say something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're a number of kind of things that needed to be done so i 'm really supportive of us and i think it 's great that apparently those conversations are already been had but no we 're in this reporters at reference which i think is there will be good to just get somewhat formality around it um yeah maybe i can comment i mean we 've heard already that there 's been a level of contact that I think we can be comfortable with between the jetty trust and the net effect Runanga and I 've got no doubt that that would continue there 's going to be a meeting in around about a month 's time in governor 's Bay which is an engagement meeting with the whole community and certainly I know it 's the intention of the trust to engage with with ruining and of course why wouldn 't they I 'm reasonably confident as somebody who 's been reasonably close to this process right the way through that those relationships in a good space and they will happen i mean the nature of the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to each other and and and relationships are respected anyway that 's someone close to the project are not really seeing a need to formalize that in our own resolution and i think the the suggestion that a condition of the the funding be subject to and i think its community consultation and support from the community in general rather than just the the treaty relationship with with net effect and the special relationship that we have there but I 've got no doubt that all of those relationships are a good space and that there 's a good communications and engagement and moving forward between the trust and the wider community including Runanga which would allow all of those concerns that that you 've got unis to be to be addressed I still have a different one of you as we 've seen the steamer council historic sort of informal agreements and support can change over time so my preference is to have something for more formally recorded and particularly I mean again like if they if this is contrary to the elem urgent plan or efforts here we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had that result maybe stuff when they enter into the contract can just take those comments on board is that a better way of doing it so that they can reflect on maybe what we just need because their sales are Eva on supporter for just great but I think it is important to have some reference in Washington so in noting that so three could have the words added to it noting the provisions of the airway management plane yes in support of to help you got 90 seconds um that reference there the Erie management plan would identify mano-a-mano fino up for the purposes of engaging on that so do do you need to actually spell out to approve a naughty figure and there r a puppy what well it 's interesting because the comment is that there 's no impact on my vanilla but that there is a tacky waar which is specifically related to wrap our key is that it there is an existing GT and it 's being replaced with another GT I 'm you know I I 'd really don 't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Erie management plan and my view sends the signal to the community and they 're nodding at the back of the room so I think that 's sufficient to take on board those concerns ok thank you right ok so is there any discussion any discussion I 've already probably in the wrong place in the debate said everything I needed to say Pauline endorse the project um and I my mind comes back to the each people group that are embarking on the same journey and I just want to congratulate all communities and people in the communities who get off the bums and actually take ownership and get energy so can get passionate about the things that they have and and also valuing them more and helping us out helping us all out so it 's a fantastic project and I really wish them all the success and we will be walking alongside them and I Tahoe our partners so they walk alongside them as well yeah I 'll just I was going to make a comment about their a wealth of professionals living and the governor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ video of the survey it was done by the local community at the International Federation of surveyors working week here in Christchurch large international conference held here and it was just such a great example of using the community assets to really you know people that the people who live in the community to actually contribute to the to the whole process and it was just a it was great so yeah well done and fantastic and yeah I really can 't say any more than that so i 'll put the motion all those sorry but we just meant to address kriston one first recommendation recommendation obviously the council has allocated 535 thousand dollars towards this project which won 't go very far and so we just need to be clear about what councils and tensions are worth it funding and the expectations of the community raising the remaining funds needed if there 's of the council intends to grant that funding to the community any conditions attached to their this that 's what we need some direction on so what was what what 's the recommendation that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and team requires a option to be in front of us to consider I just assumed sorry that clarifying the intent was was just in relation to confirming that they 'd amount us on budget for this proposal the mechanism we wouldn 't make it on a piece of paper like this yeah i mean i would suggest the recommendation around how that funding transfers when it transfers what the conditions for transfer of the funding would be and so on would be a a further consideration but that needs to be done in partnership with the trust because it 's what works for council and it 's what works for the trust in terms of what the project plan and the timeline and the obligations look like and that probably would then I imagine result I don 't know whether this aligns with the way that staff see this would result in a further report coming back around I mean the intention was always that it would be match funding so that we would we would signal a contribution that then allowed the community allowed the trust to to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do in order to match that in some ways we need to have a look at the trust project plan to see where that lens with them to see what we need to do in terms of how that funding is transferred how it went in the project it occurs and so on but it needs to be a conversation between both parties to know that whatever we 're proposing works for the project I think it will be wrong for us to make a decision today that either you know for example we transfer all of the funds immediately will that bring the desired outcomes for council or we transfer the funding at the end when the trust have raised all the remaining money that may not work for the Trust 's I think we need further information to be able to make that decision that further information would inevitably come out of a conversation with the trust I 'm certainly happy to be a part of that conversation to whatever extent is required to to leave that to a good outcome yeah I 'm a payment process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will know when they will need that money and so we were there to assist it we 've already agreed to the amount and but forming a trust allows them to go to elsewhere as well they 're not just rely on council that 's a whole principle of the whole thing 's and it gives in freedom and we 've nearly purely supporting them so the payment Tyler time one should be done with related with regards to their needs not our so to speak so actually would take out what we should take our item one that because I must understood that I thought it was a future focused recommendation so we put three put a new three at the bottom and say request staff to provide advice on the mechanism for allocating the 535 thousand dollars and the 2018-19 financial year towards the governor 's Bay GT renewal so that so that you 're providing advice back to us about the advice on the I 've just taken the words out of here so request staff to provide advice on the on the preferred mechanism on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renewal to be undertaken by the governor 's Bay restoration trust yeah and then that 's you you 're providing advice back to it 'll be the next council and that 's what I assumed that one meet that we weren 't going to absent advice make a decision about the best way to do this but we 're confirming our commitment to the 535 thousand dollars that 's in the budget for the 2819 financial year and obviously any change that would have to come through an annual plan recommendation cetera yep we 're cool excellent so now I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much thank you,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

purposefully put in place to protect residents and workers from the offensive odors the dust the pathogens buyer aerosols the non-linearity non adherence to these Klaus has turned our lives and lifestyles and health upside down we are stressed living under such conditions as you know stress is a major killer not to mention the viruses that are contained in the pathogens it is affecting relationship and some people have been financially affected by it all we 've had this problem now for 7.5 years we have been subject to lies and deceit and abuse from the Christchurch City Council staff and it appears that the City Council method of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are noisy enough like me then you are trespassed or sinful simply asking simple questions sometimes difficult infinite information has been purposefully withheld from our inquiries how odd a heavily redacted and they 're not even one but commercially sensitive as there is only one operator in this operation there 's no other competitive and I believe this has been done to protect the butts of those responsible for this fiasco we are ratepayers we do not deserve such treatment from the people who are paid to service and to service in the facilities to us nor should we be subject to the tardy response from the people elected to represent us no matter where we live in this city from which would we are from you have known about our problem for three years this council has now it nothing has been done we are all here sorry you 're all here to represent us especially in times of difficulty we are having great difficulties living under these conditions it is your duty to protect us from unfortunate circumstances which we are in and in which we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I might have had been appalling the OPP shift we want the OPP shifted to where the 206 technical report states out in the country or closed down and it 's time to give something back to the east fix our problems instead of

thank you so good morning and thank you madam mayor and councillors this is Louisa REITs and I 'm Nick Harwood we are the secretary and chair of the governor 's by jetty restoration trust and the gums way jetty is a was the topic on the on the agenda today thank you for the opportunity to present a deputation on behalf of the trust and thank you too Andrew Rutledge head of parks and his team particularly Kelly Henson who has prepared the recommendations report and would also like to personally thank the mayor and councillors for allocating five hundred and thirty-five thousand dollars towards the governor 's Bay jetty renewal and since the trust was lost before you about 18 months ago we 've worked closely with council staff looking at various relationship models between the council and trust for the restoration of the jetty and we are here today to support Kelly 's auction one which is that the council approve the sale of the governor 's page 82 the governor 's Bay jetty restoration trust with an agreement that the trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of restoration we 're strongly in favor of option one that is as it is the only option with a clear path for a timely restoration of the jetty option one is supported by Andrew Rutledge head of parks Mary Richardson the general manager customer community Jason rivet finance business partner the council 's legal services team with a great help from Emma Perry and the Littleton Mount Herbert community board the trust currently does not have the ability to raise funds until we have the mandate to restore the jetty the agreement appended to the report which you were here soon enables the trust to approach funders to mobilize funds from sources that are not otherwise available to the council and this is a key strength of option one the case for support documents are presented to you is a key document in our fundraising strategy thank you very much we 're here to answer any questions you may have I 'll just help answer the questions look I won 't thank you very much for coming at some you know 18 months ago I think we were all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangement with the community but you 've come back with this amazing alternative you know technically the sale of I guess one of our city 's assets but in a perfectly positive frame where the community itself takes responsibility with the funding that we 've put on budget anyway and then assail back technically to to to the city and I 'm just haven 't got any questions I just think it 's just great Andrew did you evah tea I don 't have any questions because I 've been very close to this project right the way through and I think it 's great that we 've we 've got this some project at this point today this is about partnership it 's about collaboration it 's about council working hand-in-hand with the community to deliver the outcomes that the community have clearly said that they and they want to see this is exciting this is actually the kind of stuff that we came here as counselors to do so what we 've got is the council in the community working together to deliver a result which is far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own so this is this is true partnership so delighted to have got this to this point today I 'd like to thank the members of the jetty trust for the amount of time that they 've given to this project and the the skill and the expertise that that trust continue to display I 've been to a number of their meetings on a tuesday evening at the governor 's Bay Hotel which is always a good opportunity to pop into the governor 's bay hotel as well as to get updated on what 's happening with the trust there 's some great work gone on there and I know we were very impressed when you came to the LTP in 2015 with the the scope and the caliber of the scope of the project and the calibre of the people involved and I think that continues to be the case i 'd also like to acknowledge the work that staff have put into this as well because this in many ways is is breaking new ground for council I 'm really hopeful that the governor 's Bay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way that we do this in communities in the future so we 're we 're breaking new ground here and this is excellent my message to colleagues is please support this today exactly Annie I just have one question and you know I really just want to preface that by saying I 'm really supportive of what you 've been doing I think it 's great and endorsed the other comments that were made the one concern that I have is around the community of using preferences where it makes reference to the tacky wire of T hoppin artfx and I just wondered if they 've been that this has been discussed with them what their viewers and with others of all so we 've met with um Henry couch recap and he said I representative and he came to one of our meetings and he said they 're in support of it and they 'll do anything they can to help us grow so I 'm going to continue to keep in touch with him and exam yeah is it possible to get it somewhere recorded because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the report as being an issue a possible issue I think it would be quite moist we 're going to move on to the paper in a minute yeah so and but you guys are okay I think that it 's yeah I mean this is a high trust environment and I don 't know that we need a resolution to just say that but let 's shall we move to the paper I think that 's probably the easiest thing to do","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

have a seconder Andrew Turner I put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know that 's carried declarations of interest I haven 't received any we were asking a question as to whether the CC hl1 but look I 'll just cheer the meeting anyway for as long as I can Ori she put me down as an early departure thank you I 've got a yeah that 's what we were asking yeah do the CC HL directors set to one side on the statements of intend I do don 't do don 't be wise to do we have any advice council discussion well yeah but I mean I don 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm I 'm leaving I have a war in France commemoration it 's a battle of some anniversary today so i 'll be attending vet so i 'll be an early departure the confirmation of previous minutes sitting in front of us it 's just the minutes of the meeting held on thursday the eight of 16 but and I judge me very included in the agenda they 'll be in the next agenda there just wasn 't time to include them that 's Justin consider that it was the standard wording that particular minutes from so all I did was do what was on the screen yes and it is a great because we 're not doing the minutes today because you haven 't read them because they 're not there and we 'll deal with them next week right there 's no public forum presentations and no deputations by appointment and no presentation of petitions so the resolution is to include supplementary reports I 'll move the supplementary reports be included in the paper cigna by andrew i 'll put that motion all those in favor say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ item of the agenda is the minutes of the Christchurch Civic Awards subcommittee meeting someone like to move that they be received yani Johanson seconded by Tim Scandrick I thought that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried statements of intent christchurch city holdings limited and i know that Eddie Jones has a initially that she wants to raise in relation to the little import companies statement of intent I don 't know whether just a cch I 'll come to the table for this one or it 's just it yeah I know that the the cruise ship terminal you know the cruise ship the commitment to operating a cruise ship terminal or having a cruise ship to in terminal is in the Littleton recovery plan but it 's not specifically stated in the statement of intent so it refers to the to the it refers to the cerebrum your glasses down it refers to the little term recovery plan and thus saw the things that 's going to be doing and leaves out the cruise terminal I mean there is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's going to happen but it 's subject to some business case analysis at the moment but I think it would be useful to signal it and the statement of and change because it 's in Littleton recovery plan there 's no there 's no kind of opting out of us it 's it 's India but we 're wondering if we could have it specifically stated on the statement went in very clearly admitted and one of them is the role in the growth of the regional regional economy and excuse me infrastructure for the next 30 years so I don 't have the page numbers in front of me I was reading it on my phone and screen shot at it so it 's not that clear um but those were the two areas particularly for example in the CDC SOI there is clear reference to eat eat in the development of the teeth which hasn 't happened yet but is happening and I feel that that is a parallel with the crews birth NZSL I 4lp see ya at this point I mean at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the 33rd June and as I said we 're going through a process with them the business case was going through so it 's did you actually wanting it done in this state limited are we going to put on the lid of expectations but I think it needs to be part of the sea so I as as the mayor has said there is no doubt there will be some sort of cruise booth or terminal or whatever at littleton and it needs to be signaled in there somewhere either as an aspirational thing or something that is still to be investigated further this does leave it an interesting position because these are final I saw why 's that have already been it 's very it 's very difficult to change them without actually basically well I 'm amazed it 's got to this point without this having been raised to my apologies for not raising us yeah it has been it 's been through strategy and finance I mean through council and twice actually so this is the final that 's come through but it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that it does and that is in the little turn recovery at the levels and port recovery plan if there is nothing we can do about it there is anything we can do about it however it is a glaring omission and anyone who looks at an SOI has been through council only day their chance to make okay well I 'm one person yeah yeah Andrew yeah maybe just to add certainly some commentary was made at strategy and Finance and on the draft around the relationship between the SI and the little support recovery plan commentary was made around the crews birth commitment to the Antarctic Program and relationships with the community and I know all of those were picked up in a response that came back to us when we were discussing the draft and obviously we 've got to this final SLI now I don 't know whether an appropriate thing to do might be to note these things yeah in response to the next letter of expectation that would result in the next draft SL I think that 's probably the best process to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today yeah I think it when we 're going through the probe and start that process again in a month 's time yeah that 's right yet so it first graphical fabric so so note that the new one note that the LPC statement of an sorry litter of expectations will give clear direction that the council 's expects a cruise terminal to be developed and that 's cruise ships the accommodator and the meantime because it allows for I mean that is going to be an hour statement of expectations as there well year the next one starts a process in a month but but I think we should note it because I think that we should do more than give a clear direction that we expect the cruise terminal be developed but that we expect them to accommodate cruise ships in the meantime and I 'd like to put I 'd like to put cruise ships and ice breakers as part of the as part of Antarctic programs Antarctic Program icebreakers as well oh sorry and didn 't tactic program ice breakers or vessels be accommodated as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice but no Antarctic Antarctic Program vessels capital a no no no no no no no no no give it all capital aid kept it away in ta see taxi si si si no Josephus is tactical attack SI t I ca yep and it untucked up program vessels also be accommodated is that we need to see you holidays yeah yeah yeah well they 've got other wolves yeah kelpies at the port yeah but that yes and cruise please birth wrapping crew easily be good of terminal and that 's be e r th and probably and I don 't whether when you take advice on this letter of expectation rather than statements of expectation because it 's the letter of expectation of going to the port isn 't it and so that note that the LPC litter of expectation note that the litter of expectation for LPC so yeah take out yeah and move that goes for LPC will give clear direction the council expects that accrues birth they developed in the cruise ships the accommodation meantime and that the entire tech program vessels also be accommodated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this discussion federal drug he said eyes and raising issues of concern was done in politics live on a little bit consent day went out having the ability to raise theirs in a public season relevant to so you 'd like me to rule myself out of order no no I don 't want advice on that like oh I 'm sorry yonni but I forgot that I I wasn 't too I kind of I got a message from early that she wanted to raise this particular issue I hadn 't taken on board the fact that these were the final they are the final and actually it was going to be raised in this point anyway the litter of expectation there is absolutely no reason why we can 't just notify that here but look we 're going to have a conversation about this it 's not going to it 's not going to come up before there is a new council so I 'm quite happy for the stew to sit as part of the resolution is your happy for us to move other little expectation no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know Ellie 's already made a decision that she 's not going to be joining us after the election and and I accepted that resolution as part of the the next leader of expectation so I made a mistake yani I do from time to time and this is one that I made I say he to overlooked that this was the final stage so I 'm just being I don 't know kind to a person who 's decided to go to the community board level and and provide here valuable service to her city from there right Andy did you have another oh no except to say that I think the intent of what we 're doing here is is commendable and I see no problem with the fact that we 've got that Downey not I support the content of what we 're doing and that 's the important thing we 've things that we need to get sorted and this is the process for doing it and we 'll come up with a bit of process next time ally on question because of course in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the requirement for LPC to accommodate their cargoes as per their contracts which I understand what I 'd be slightly concerned about is that we are essentially saying that the cruise ships and Antarctic Program vessels should be accommodated full stop if they are unable to be accommodated and I don 't want to add any sort of gray area here but they do have contracts with some companies for birthing and cargoes to be is there some way we can just be every every endemic endeavor be made yes something at just every and gonna be made to ensure reaches the accommodation meantime and it also be accommodated and on the same basis yeah yeah cool all right now do I have a mover and a seconder for these yeah Andrew seconded by item I 'll put that Jonnie nothing JC yes it 's good to be able to save a spoiled 717 I just wanted to express disappointment that they count so did for a living wage of these 717 as we went to responsive design issue passing our companies to consider the only way it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease this council around some of the Pyrates for contractors and cleaners there 's something there 's improvement or neck so I 'll disappointed that as we did the drop certain some teams we didn 't actually ask the company to conserve that I think it 's still a long way to go in terms of things up high relativity CEO increases that needs to be addressed so I 'll take advice from the mere that you don 't want us to raises issues today that we can put the new council and consider the things that we watched Apollo mothers of equitation enough that i 'll return is council i will sing of the art of the asking quite good method to looking at the living wage and interesting nations of favorability around things like she means it okay I 'll what the I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye there 's a place they know that 's carried thank you um the cult corporate finance reports them ref would you like to move that this be received and seconded by Jamie got that motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's cari strategy and Finance Committee minutes we 're receiving those minutes in ref Sikander Jamie put that motion all those in favor say aye or as opposed say no that 's carried vehicle one screen washes 12 months support is anyone got any questions on the report right very good someone like to move that we receive it Paul non-sterile signorelli James I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried multiple multicultural strategy update to me would you like to move that and I 'll let you speak to it as well would someone like to Second Earth Andrew please multicultural working party I 'm delighted there the feedback from the drop for multicultural strategy consultation is positive in the fourth support from the majority of the community in the individuals I myself attended three workshop inform University of Canterbury and the pipes which multicultural council I have a strong field in the majority of lat Indies so that is our thought very strategical document is very crucial for council take a lead to give people a sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assess the council 's information in the services my view lacheesa said four factors which means the Welcome a supportive my majority of the community individuals is due to this high-level strategic document is based on the partnership between the city council in the wider community especially the multicultural working party consists of our fellow councillors and the community leaders to establish this document and also this document is the council in response to the wider community requests for the last 25 25 years so I 'm also delighted manaphy no one has been a get involved to review and amended is a draft a strategic document to make this document as a living document and will be presented to the Tujunga committee meeting in November of this year initial stage I have a little bit disappointed because why I thought that these the term council we were a top at least the document however monofin a while to review and they have a proper amendment that 's very weary the crucial because based on all the vision we respect the Treaty of Waitangi let 's very crucial so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this final strategy document to be presented to the council approve as soon as possible this way if we can approve at the end up popular before Christmas led-based rather than the next year and for the further implementation of the action plan in the for the next five years finally I still would like to Teddy 's opportunity to express my sincere appreciation to all the working group members in the stops my fellow councillor angel Yanni a clean in the myself eternal members zo Pacheco Catherine II can 't matura Josiah Winky and another and all the council staff clear Esther patria Katie Georgie gay bra in the ahora so thank you thank you I 'm injury oh sorry info and clean thank you i just like to echo the comments that counselor chan has made not also like to in addition to recognizing the contribution that the the working group members including those external members have made it 's been an excellent process and councillor chan has made a an excellent job of chairing that working group and bringing this whole piece of work together but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking a bit of extra time to end up with a strategy which is is really excellent and fit for the future and fit for purpose i think out of taking the extra time to to get the further input from the tejano gapapa typical ruining a committee and the advice of kaho and gabriel our and cultural advisors will end up with something which is going to be so much better as a result rather than rushing this to get it completed in this council term and not them getting that extra input so when my belief is that the extra I 'm taken will result in some real added value to this strategy which will end up with a strategy which is really fit for purpose fit for the future and which will ya be an excellent reflection of the really good work that 's been done to get us at this point though and I also think the Jimmy and the committee for doing excellent work with the staff there 's one area I just wondered about and I 'm is one of the themes of racism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strong a commitment from council around that and I note that you 've been you 've worked with a number of schools I 'm just wondering given the incidents with schools and sporting clubs if in fact we might perhaps have more contact with say the sporting clubs and maybe a wider range of schools and I appreciate the work though that you 've all read um thank you that 's not-- oh thank you yep I 'm Glen to do this properly and I lie here japanese frustration just pick up one of those coming you know sort of some way you know what warts unless and I know is the proposal to launch the strategy coinciding popsicle or counselor about Tigers in what 's need a commemoration and also good citizenship cereals we 've been here in some way of less than C report plus you know the council meeting closest to that could be a way to this properly closed anyway exactly like January that can be able be more optional we 're certainly happy to take your lead on where you and when you 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a raft of activities around that time it 's quite a busy time of the year for race relations and other activities so we certainly happy to take your steer on how you 'd like us to to launch it Yanni entation and just wondered obviously by the time the strategies adopted the elections will be over but are we doing anything just in terms of awareness of the election with those ethnic communities all those diverse communities around civic engagement and participation at the moment yes counselor we are distributing information and we 've contacted groups individually some groups have talked to the members by themselves and we connected some communities with the marketing team to give them the opportunity to participate in some of the campaigns that were organized around election days no don 't think anybody picked it up the young people picked it up more if Paul sorry just very briefly I want a fact clear for the work she 's doing I know the work you did on our safer crisis strategy he got a multicultural strategy just the work you 've done in terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term has been found elsewhere acknowledge that actually clear thank you for also actually like to acknowledge the work of Easter and the in the in the entertain certainly been in the multicultural working party at certainly been a huge undertaking and it 's been a really unique and wonderful opportunity to work with so many devious people particularly having the community help co-create this whole thing or so think I realize there are other people who ever I think the leadership you 've shown to Paul we get as each year outstanding yeah all I 'd like to add to my congratulations to cancel the chain I mean he 's been passionate about this and you know I wouldn 't I wouldn 't see any reflection at all about taking the extra time just to get the amount of input so that it is right and that 's going to have your name stepped over so and that 's because you 've just devoted your attention to making it happen and you 've just never wavered and your commitment to ensuring that the city has a multicultural strategy so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've also proved that the model that brings external people to the table with councillors actually works works really well at net concept of co-creation as both empowering but also provides for a better strategy as a result for us so that works both ways so on that note and i will put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed to know that 's carried right into sexual improvement kashmir hoon hay wars these shall we shall we shall we do shall we establish the Health and Safety Committee of Council fears yeah okay so we 'll go to item 14 it was actually there was one point that I wanted to make about the health and safety that ad said meeting shall not be held fewer than four times a year but it sort of thing I 'd rather express it positively that meeting shall be held at least four times a year okay we 'll update then thank you thank you for that suggestion was there it did anyone else have any comment I 'm Andrew Phil I had a number of questions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because discussing the chief executives role in this committee we with the chief executive in the room obviously requires some sensitivity but I was interested in the recommendation the chief executive be part of the decision-making body of the committee the recommendation making body of the committee at the same time as I 'm sure we would be seeking advice and assurance from the chief executive that the organization is doing what we would want it to do from a health and safety viewpoints so the responsibilities item to seek assurance that the organization is effectively structured to manage health and safety I would imagine that advice would be coming from the chief executive who in this model is also sitting on the committee as a decision-making member and I know that that can present difficulties with having one person essentially on on both sides of the table if you like and I just wanted to get some commentary around that yep I mean that 's seriously we were sort of trying to get that I 'm consider that but that 's good feedback and we wouldn 't necessarily when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Risk Committee and on health and safety issues so chief executive satsang yes so a lot of use that I made earlier that may not be a universal point of view that the chief executive shouldn 't be a member of a audit risk the chief executive is a member and it seemed to me that since the since the you know the the framework what you know came from or the idea the concept came from audit and rusk it seemed to me to make sensitive the chief executive beer because we would have someone from human resources reporting presumably so um if you read under secretary meetings and also about the committee may have an attendance such members of management including the chief executive officer so I think that this have been like a principal advisor role in terms of the because of the importance of this committee to the organization into governance so maybe to put the question slightly differently than the intention in this report is that the chief executive would be a member of the committee as in a decision-making member of the committee but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in advising that committee as well I mean it 's a question rather than statement because I 'm just keen to understand the background to the the formation of the committee I 'm certainly not taking a view at this stage on whether I think the chief executive should be a part of the decision-making body or not it 's a question just to to tease out the thinking behind what appears to be the chief executive having potentially two roles in that forum one of the ways of thinking around this area of health and safety and this is sort of guided by some of the principles and the legislation is that really to ensure a safe and healthy culture we need to ensure that there 's this kind of collaboration consult in cooperation so that might be a way of you know modeling the committee 's that are around that so that 's another way of sort of thinking about it because I think it needs to be we want to work very much the sort of unique roles of the chief executive and there are unique roles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think what 's key is that it 's a collaborative consultative process to make sure that we 're having an organization that 's you know promoting a really safe and healthy culture it 's what allows this to work at the end of the day what we want is the most effective structure so the committee can do its job now I just had one other question around again the terms of reference to membership we 've got councillors and we 've got external advisors and is there any thought as to the numbers of councillors and the numbers of external advisors because later in the report the report reads as though there will be one external advisor but that may not be the case according to the terms of reference so again just some commentary around perhaps the expected number of councillors or external advisors or how we would arrive at those numbers I think that we would certainly want to have more than one external representative I think that 's where the strength as to actually have some expertise from other organizations that have been involved in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to keep the committee relatively you know so not too large as well so that it can sort of be effective because this or quite a lot of operational aspects to it so yeah we 'll take some guidance on that but i think it 's certainly more than one external maybe two to three yep though thank you for the report Emma and Sharon so I 've also got some concerns around I guess the role that the CA and it wouldn 't matter who the sea is let us speak it 's a more of a governance issue in that clearly at times if the e is part of the decision-making committee as against being an advisor at times and given that it everyone want the committee to work in a collaborative basis as you say but the be times when in fact there are governance and management issues arising give it especially for example that if some issues would happen in fact it will be the e who would be accountable to the committee so just wonder if you comment on there I mean I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really thinking about we 're and we 're still working with the new legislation sort of working through how that fits and we have looked at some other councils experiences some of them will put things through the audit and Risk Committee others have established an independent health and safety committees so I think it 's a good point and so that 's something for us to really consider whether advisor or a voting member thanks email just got someone food look I made a mistake I 've been look good like the audit and risk management committee so Colleen 's just an attendant she 's not right a member of the community work yeah excite so taken to take the CEO out of there yeah but leaving the expression that there 's um including the chin I 'm just about answer my other point to though is that sorry I think it 's really good to have this discussion I think it 's it 's urgent that we get this done I 'm still wondering though in fact to get this right if in fact this is something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know this is going to the new cameras yes but we 're providing feedback and advice when we can assign a scanner actual terms of reference think that this is going to the new council but i guess that i mean we could have done this at a at a workshop and but but we 've been invited to give feedback so i think feedback we should give and that 's been very helpful yeah um I 'm look I 'm health or safety committees aren 't new Domino the right thread and many many organizations you hope anyway so the normal practice is that the reporting officer are relevant of their standing and the organization is not a member of a committee of the committee because their answer will crossed out CEO okay so yeah so we 'll take Willimon dirt that this CEO is not a member of the committee for the new yeah you just need to vent take CEO out of membership that leavin item total force do people want to do people have a view whether the chair is appointed by the mayor or well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless over tuned lava council majority of the council no as it is this a proposal to have a different mechanism forces I we were taking guidance on what 's a normal mechanism so that was advice that we got I just think that it doesn 't require a reference and again it 's just the standard yeah this was a resolution oh yes okay so that the draft terms of reference if you look at if you look at the key points on page 245 that says that the armc requested that council consider the establishment of a health and safety committee of councils the chief executive was to provide draft terms of reference and the appointment process for under pendant members with a view of establishing the committee in September 2016 well that 's not going to happen so we weren 't able to get to the position where we would be establishing the committee prior to the election so this what we need to do is provide advice and just refer this to the uncommon council with the recommendation that they establish a health and safety committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other issues that people would like to provide feedback on alright so moved by Paul seconded by Pauline so so we 've got receive review and provide no we don 't need that that the council that the council note the draft terms of reference document and appointment process and recommend to the new council that they establish a health and safety committee of council and in line with the proposals yea mostly that we that be given priority in terms of urgency to should we as a matter of priority yep Jamie yeah do you mind if I speak to that bridge any great um well I think health and safety committees are incredibly important and one of my pet hates is when you have an organization when quizzed around their level of priority for health and safety or whether they have a Health and Safety Committee the biggest cop-out answer you can give is when they say I know that the whole board is the health and safety committee because um you know when people say there 's no right or wrong answers are sorry that 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say well the hot waters the audit and Risk Committee you need to have their focus on it so I 've been a member of a health and safety committee for a for a company that 's probably in a high-risk industry and a heavy engineering and heavy equipment and that sort of stuff and I think the most important aspect of the health and safety committee is it 's not around the leg and educators and all that sort of stuff and the monitoring use know that that 's part of it but it 's um it 's around embedding a culture and that 's always the challenge so when there was talk of whether or not the chief executive as a member of it I 'm one of the biggest stickers usual fine for a the importance of good governance and governance versus management where their foot so it 's most effective but I see this committee setting very much in line in mirroring audit and risk and I think having lean around that table in the capacity that she has been has been absolutely invaluable because to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the risks are and also what the opportunities are haven 't having that chief executive around that table and a part of that body has been very very beneficial whether that 's in the form of a non-voting member whatever but I think the Health and Safety Committee should mirror the audit and rest traumatic and that 's how I really are in envisage it so if it 's as a non-voting in that look that 's fine but I think it should probably followed similar terms of reference to audit and risk because I don 't leave very very similar anyway with ya with that being said I think there 's a seven the right direction we 've obviously got new legislation and I know this is not a corporate organization or a corporate entity with the same responsibilities for elected members but that doesn 't mean that we should take those responsibilities lightly because this needs to be off top priority and ensuring that we embed a culture of success in excellence with respect to health and safety is incredibly important so this is a good step forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in hand because it be moments ago well then I 'll be heading to vote for us here or did you want to society gorgeous careful sir you clarified that the CEO was an adviser to the audit and risk I 've taken here out of them no no no no but but just to clarify because it was sounded like that she was a member of the audit and rescue and I was just wanted to clarify no no she 's a she 's a she 's a 19 done so principal ball yeah I did come back and apologize because I made a mistake oh yeah what then if I 'm a minimum it also again know what is carlington I know that 's why I click eject what what 's carlene 's roll under the terms of reference and order and russ was my a thing nothing she 's teeny she is a hugely valuable member of the community committee but doesn 't actually have voting rights and are we going to mirror that with the Health and Safety Committee yes but she 's not but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is an attendance perfect yes so that 's that 's covered by point2 oh I yeah great second is we got Paul and who second do it all Pauline thank you i 'm i knew i had a mover in a second death yeah all right so should I put that motion I put that motion all those in favor say aye as opposed say no it 's carried and now we can go back to item 12 intersection improvement kashmir indeed it was Lee 's and I understand we have our team here I presume that there are some questions in relation to this matter yes Glee ok thank you this report I 've just got a couple of questions and we have had a workshop which is good my first is why is this going to cost 2.8 20 million these intersection improvements and it 's a reasonably complex intersection there 's land purchase involved in it as well the original 900 or k thousand that was in the LTP was really to was additional funding that would be a would have been on top of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consent was required to upgrade as in section when the his subdivision got to 260 something lots and the 900 car and they would only have to upgrade the intersection to cater for the traffic being developed from the development we always foresaw there would be need to be additional facilities in the in section to cater for cyclists etc so that 900 case in the LTP was basically just councils proportion was foreseen to maybe be needed when the developer was required to upgrade this thing in whenever the development got to 260 odd sections so it is for a major in section improvement like this that involves a lot of realignment a lot of curbing work land purchases etc this is the estimated cost based on the detailed design that 's now been undertaken that with the northern arterial coming on it could well have been that some of these improvements may not have proceeded to the same as we had at the time that the LTP was put together the Nord of arterial wasn 't certain and so traffic loadings or Martians road were expected to carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section between qe2 drivers surely now that the North material is certain and and about to start construction the completion of the northern arterial will take significant traffic loading off of Martians road so that calls into question the need to upgrade Martians road at the current time as was planned in the LTP to upgrade it between 2017 and 2019 so the northern arterial will take a lot of traffic off of Martians road so we perceived that we need to now to further modeling and come back to the 2018 LTP based on the traffic loading that all the traffic patterns that will eventuate once the northern arterioles finished and review the need for for those improvements in the next LTP thanks Chris thanks Ellie the downstream mitigations that we 've heard a lot about particularly around the Ennis Road area was regards to that stretch from anas town to Barwick or Berwick this isn 't that area that we 're talking about was regards to moving the money from as it not that project still in the LTP to do those downstream effects studies and the mitigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second part is of my question is if it becomes apparent that we do require the money for this down streaming that we 're moving or want to move today do you believe that money will be available or will it just be in the pot for negotiation and allocation as paranormal process so as part of the 2018 LTP once we 've been able to reassess the network impacts of the Northern arterial being completed that if it 's needed it will be put forward as a project for consideration under the 2018 LTP under consideration just like all the other projects that will okay thank you anyone else um rare from their Yanni in terms of shifting some of these other projects why do we actually need to do that and originally the the funds for the worst is intersection we 're out in 20 21 to 20 23 that was to align with the perceived rate of development obviously now with the adventure park being certain it 's underway that and that 's I guess ever done spiders the submission from the sprayed and his co community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undoubtedly be increased so I panic movements it 's only a major one I guess the point I 'm making is these are quite tiny projects in terms of the overall capital program which we know we 're only going to deliver 7080 whatever percent so there 's not going to be a funding issue in terms of the funds to do it so why we 'd if we know that we can actually complete these projects they 're not big projects which might be delayed or run over time so why don 't we just keep doing these have been so that the resolution from council was to identify Canada projects that could be used to fund advancing this edge section into the current financial year and they are our suggestion or two projects that could be used lized to do the rest of the projects that are still in the LTP are underway for this current financial year and there isn 't funding or projects within the current financial year that were viewed as candidates that could be used to fund the the two million dollars that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don 't think there is such a thing as there isn 't funding I don 't see why we wouldn 't just continue with those projects just out of the downstream from Kiwi cheese not really required because it would have been traded at the same time some is an arterial opening which is supposed to take the traffic off motioned anyway and then you haven 't talked about the Fitzgerald everyone but it 's a similar plea because there are some changing patterns with traffic and citrus so to have a look at the whole thing rather than just won the under section that is bezel adhikari for this so there 's some sense and actually delaying those project we 're not delaying them but actually revealing those projects and light of the other issues we 'll look at them in the alist review of the whole of the network and the changes that are happening on the network at this current point and tight well just a heavy national gear that 's not a frayed usual issue no no that 's why these two are a dupe on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you say in the report that 's unlikely we 'll get NZTA subsidy so the other projects would qualify for NZTA subsidies I presume I don 't know about casual Fitzgerald afore that 's an accessible City project that 's not funded by NZTA or whether that 's one that would be but can you just explain that in terms of the 2.8 how much of that is subsidy from the other projects versus unsubsidized funding so the the element of subsidy and the other pro in the other projects would obviously need to go through the the normal business case process that we were required to do to secure that funding when we put together the LTP that the funding that we receive from NZTA has taken at a global level we haven 't done the the formal subsidy application for those two other projects of this stage is envisaged that they would attract funding from nzta at that time because they qualify for in terms of safety and congestion benefits we don 't account within the LTP for fun NZTA funding on a project-by-project basis is taken at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we expected for a project that the qualifies for funding is normally around fifty percent that 's our standard funding rate for capital projects of a project that does qualify for the component parts of that project that are part of the the carriageway if you like between the curbs that gets fifty percent funded stuff that 's outside of that so footpaths etc aren 't so it 's not a nap salute it will depend on the element of the project that is actually falls within NZ DA 's funding eligibility so basically there 's another million dollars of subsidy at a global level that we 've accounted for that we now need to take off so it 's 3.8 million for this project ya know this is this is a total cost we 're going to put in an application to see whether it will get across the line all we 're flagging is that it may not get across the line they 're supposed to mean the 2.8 would come down to maybe two with 800,000 I 'm not sure exactly how much would be eligible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to NZTA we 're just signaling to you that we may not get that you know so but what I 'm trying to understand if we go ahead today and we don 't get the nzta funding it 's the cost that would sing would be higher than 2.8 it would actually be 3.8 because there 's a million dollars global subsidy for those two other projects that wished to now those other projects if they went ahead after we 've done the relooking at the network would still be eligible for those when we move them so we 've just shifted that there well we 're saying is this may be a hundred percent funded by council or it may get a agency da subsidy we cannot guarantee that of time until we make an application fee so the total cost is 2.8 those other projects will get subsidy if they go ahead in the occurrence warm and negative in if you look at the resolutions under for this is removed from the LTP program so I presume that audit New Zealand would have a real issue with us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an NZT a subsidy surely if we take a project out of our program we also should reduce the expected subsidy multiple normal right yeah well Tim yeah so if we take it out of the long-term plan which these resolutions do then surely that subsidy should reduce like how would order ever say that you can claim a subsidy for projects that you 've removed and we won 't be claiming a subsidy I 'm sorry on the subsidy would go into as Chris said at a global level not adequate level so at a global level if we remove these projects from our long-term plan that subsidy should reduce right because it was unlikely would get the subsidy for the new if we have a project to 2.8 go in there at the moment we 've got to point out we 're doing it so that basically we are hoping that we will we 'll make an application for subsidy and so we 're hoping that we will get it we may we may not and that 's what really we 're signaling however so the worst-case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this project this case soon no not at this point in time so is you not right oh sorry by term second a buffer so the other question I have was just in regards to the removal of these projects so the question before was you know we 've got a lot of carry forward so by removing these projects which the community haven 't had any consultation on like casual Fitzgerald why would you why would you just why would you not just put them out further rather than remove them from the program I think Chris is said that he 's going to bring them back into the two 2018 once we 've got a holistic picture of the network for both those projects so in actual fact we question is asking before it might be moved into the 2018-19 year rather than be removed from the program that 's what he 's asking we don 't have to talk finance but I um don 't imagine we could shifted it wouldn 't be a problem of shifting some projects forward in some projects back help me here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no free lunch if we want to bring funds under this year without taking funds out that it will impose an and post and the extent to which we might also be putting at risk and contributions from developers and losing nzta nzta contribution also reinforces that risk so there 's no free lunch yeah but i think i think the way we were making the way in which it 's been put forward this consequence for the decision i think that the point that we were making was that what was that that would assume that every single item on the capital program was delivered this year which i am i 'm hopeful that it does but it hasn 't been before so yeah which i think it was worse point we the next time we do the the capital program will be in as part of the annual plan we actually upgrade it updated on the end the project so an extra fact we will can bring that back up to you we don 't do the capital program interim so we can actually look at putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what 's giving me a bit of trouble because it says to remove the project from a long-term plan i was happy to to swap the substitution and actually put it back into the year 2023 or 20 22 i think i 've known is literally said that way we actually enable the subsidy to be calculated and whatever audit happens because we would expect can we change the wording of it so that so that the that that we 're swapping them so basically that we rescheduled them for the 20 21 22 and 20 to 23 years as as provided for the Kashmir whom hey was the intersection improvements but require that they be reconsidered in the 2018 year yeah that is effectively what we were proposing but yes yeah but it but but the but what yani tseng is he don 't he doesn 't want to vote for a resolution that says be removed from the LTP and I think we we meet Peters consumed by putting it as a direct swap for an item that 's already on the budget so it 's to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm use the same we brief phased and to the 20 21 22 and 20 to 20 23 years so use the wedding from five no no no no to anything you just copied those and then and and and leave the woods 3-phase done to the 20 21 years for reconsider leave it at set for reconsideration at 2018 Rivera and evade all funds that are loaded up yep all right yep you good good outcome alright so we put a move on a stick it up I 've David faizan item three well are we going to reconsider that no because the point of item three really was and the understanding that i have is that the by the time we plan and get into detailed designed for item three there the northern arterioles likely to be on stream and the necessity for that work may be substantially reduced and in fact you know i would have probably gone kicking and screaming about taking budget off air side of town but i 'm convinced that the way we 're doing this is make sense because the impact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and face I would however just add the the one little comment that we 're here we are one point oh three million is being generously donated from the eastern suburbs to the other side of town and I trust that will be taken into consideration if there 's debate on legacy projects and things so you know we are a generous sub area and we 're quite happily in the circumstances that have been outlined line to us today to forego this project and the better interests of the city so well we 're caught to be steady canter and yeah okay our fell well I don 't think this is like a partisan type decision at all clearly the whole city is going to benefit from the adventure park and it has required some purchase of land and additional funding and end there 's no losses at all in terms of the runs project on on them and also that the safety aspects of Kesh one fits drilled at all so it 's a win when really in terms of making sure that not only this project is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good vehicle access and good cycleway access but but but they 're also it comes back to what I guess our safety concern that local residents and spade and haircut have asked for for a long time the intersections never work particularly well and this is a good opportunity to get it right so all together the the whole adventure park is going to be a huge asset to the city everybody is going to be an effort by what we decide today we got our time thank you dinger episode the traffic has changed since the earth copia developed in the south and southwest is huge we get a lot more traffic through this area than then we have it as many other areas do so there 's one intersection actually the pulsing will improve not only heck thorne road being your drive croco but the other areas that are immediately affected as well like we small and so I want to thank staff for the work you 've done on it and thank you it 's good good Yanni ya fiction I I actually think it 's good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it 's a shame that we might not qualify NZTA funding for doing that but given what 's being done in that local area I think this is a really sensible way forward the other the other reason that I actually like the idea that you 've identified casual Fitzgerald haven 't taken it off but I 've actually put it out to 20 21 20 22 there 's actually if you think about it that actually aligns with when hopefully some some planning or some thinking around the new stadium which will have a massive impact on traffic in that area so spending money on that project now ahead of knowing the future outcome of the stadium and the design and location and all the other things that are associated with it actually makes a lot of sense so you know I think this is a really sensible solution I don 't know when we 're going to start thinking about the stadium hopefully that 's not too far away and hopefully there 's a very detailed traffic assessment I would just say that for that area there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of streets going into the avenues which will end the northern arterial extension which will divert a huge amount of extra traffic around the 4 f 's that 's the whole plan for the accessible city plan and it would be really good to understand just how those safety concerns are going to be addressed in line with the major developments in that area so this gives us time to do that which is why it 's a sensible decision thank you thank you i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye or as a place I know that 's scary I 'm just before we move on to the next item how many how many counselors are going to the battle of the somme commemoration you 'd like turn Vicki would like to as well now is it a relatively than o 'clock so we don 't have to leave here for another 20 minutes yeah yep okay so it 's just over there too well it 's this power on to the rates for mushroom consideration for South our tier this was a request from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ask that this come to counsel with a report on the South our chair slightly different decision from the moment we made I means a different issue from the one we made last week but an equally challenging decision ref do you want to move the staff recommendation or do you have a different view no what would you like to move opportunity okay can we go to question two and see if we can turn that into a resolution is it possible just to ask a question of stuff anytime yes you can ask a question of staff momentum yeah I 'm thinking um I just wanted whether there 's a way in which we can actually see where there 's been massive changes of value like so is there a kind of systemic approach we could actually take to looking at where this has happened rather than just rely on individuals to make deputation upwards and downwards or just how much it 's probably Elvis I think that 's the one that 's been the concern expressed by people there their lens been you know research for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is unlikely to happen because of whatever reason and presumably that would also have to take an account with they had sold close to the time or not with evaluation as a point of fact so we can do it have to cross-reference it to land ownership and sale so I 'm just trying to understand whether we 're just going to get a whole bunch of ad hoc requests to give people right to remission because the lens been resigned it 's now with a lot more and the rates have gone up hugely or whether there 's a more strategic way it 's not the basis for the request so I think I think it would be wrong to make that assumption there are other ways of dealing with property values this is a this is a property revaluation that 's based on something that was due to happen that hasn 't happened so and and that 's very sore to the last decision we made it 's not exactly the same Paul just keep picking up on Peters point I would be interested to know if anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since their rating value has gone up on sold it and now they 're in there one here roast remission I know I don 't think there 's been any sales in the South outer area and just sorry to answer the original question yes every time we do a revaluation we do do a little heat map and chance of different areas to show how values have changed up and down and what the impact that our rates but them is quite right obviously the situation here is that the values in 2013 are considered to fairly reflect what the actual value was at the time and what has happened subsequent to that is that the signaled free zoning to enable that development and the realization of that sort of value has just not happened and there 's a question mark over whether it will happen or not depending on what happens to the car truck so this is the sort of thing that is fairly routine i guess around the town and the District Planning changes are signaled and changes do happen I think what 's happened in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the data plan change has happened far more quickly than is normally the case these issues and it just happened to straddle a 2013 revaluation as well these issues have been highlighted in a couple of areas where the changes have been quite significant so I mean the other question I had was related to where we 've seen a huge rezoning of density whether that 's now going to put the property values up can we just please deal with this report I 'm seriously we just talked about all wanting to go to this commemoration looking in terms of the fifty percent increase are you recently comfortable with that as threshold it 's a little arbitrary I 've got to say and does matter what threshold we choose there 's going to be boundary issues I mean that the table on page 243 shows when it 48 the seat yes so you know we could choose forty five percent but there 'll be someone at 44 and any bound any any decision I this is bound to have boundary issues so it becomes a matter of relatively arbitrary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough but it was in terms of the potential flow on effect which was one of the concerns of the earlier decision and obviously one here if it 's a 50-percent one the potential for flow on is reasonably limited yeah there was added estimates here in earlier on I think there were about thousand properties that experienced a 50-percent rates increase after the Reeve our last time around obviously only a relatively small number of those will be in a similar position to this the vast bulk of those thousand will have very likely or attained that increase in fact and people can always subject to the evaluation at the time of the valuation absolutely yeah and again that 's the same point there 's no question of these were wrong at the time the issue at hand the trouble was that I saw Dahlia was going to increase as the cat club was going to go earlier as well and say happenstance yeah I 'm happy to more yeah are you already here I thought no no no 10 refs already moved up and you can second up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that would provide a 25-percent rates from us and out ally you had your hand up that 's essentially what the precedent created could be is that right or is there a greater potential numbers-wise citywide personalized that 's a good question that 's just a bald number of the number of properties where rates increase by fifty percent at the last revamp citywide city was really quite okay than I think hi okay I will it 's been moved and seconded did you have a question I 'm following Vicki 's question I mean looking at the there is that forty-eight percent one which is an hour outlier and there 's below that I think it 's twenty-two percent so could we improve that property yeah cuz that 's just an outline there 's a 48 and 44 and 40 well I can only see in the table i 'm looking at it 's only got the forty-eight percent won the last two for 10 and 440 we promoter at 44 and 40 oh I 'm looking at the land vegetation okay yeah he 's looking at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah so are we talking about the land oh you know it 's providing a great 25% rates from motion for properties which experience at 52 I 'm looking around value change rather than the rates change all swear detention or 34 and most important both learn also be found so just us to clarify it showing highlighted they don 't the highlighting doesn 't make sense no no I 'll just get Steve to clarify which onesies yes sorry the highlights on the left hand side the properties that was I should have deleted that before I published it I 'm sorry that 's just to indicate to me that where there 's common ownership what really matters is the rates figure the land values are useful background because they tell you how things moved generally but rates are obviously calculated on total capital value not just land value so improvements my head of attack yeah so it 's yeah okay yep all right so um okay i 'll put that motion yeah ending and then Jimmy yeah but I mean I think this is important I don 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to be careful around rezonings where there isn 't price discovery so where we 've revalued on the basis of a potential rezoning I think so when it comes to new valuations I think we need to think about this that we need some kind of market price information to actually show that the value of those properties have gone up and I think it 's better to wait to see that rather than predict just because there 's been a rezoning that the price is now doubled so I think that I think that 's the important thing here and so it 's not going to affect a lot of properties it 's going to be quite specific around these types of reasons yeah just for clarification over when we do as you know when we do these revaluation as we must have a market value as a goose we 're having a debate now yeah i 'm talking about i 've actually price discovery in the market as opposed to valuation yeah i guess i think this is quite appropriate yani what do you want to babe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because comprehensive reports where we go especially option to what I will I would like to you know subtle support option to particular you specified in here option to advantage II you know acknowledged II significant change of circumstances since the 2013 do to affect us outside affected repair control that 's a factory know which means council reason a Bhatia to the living G with a constraint on south of Atia to develop at another power head until car club I ceased operating but you 'll also based on the page 242 the five point of 43.3 you also recognize you this resource concern is kind of high risk risk of cancer maybe when we are not to be up to obtain de because whether they have a strong opposition you know then eventually maybe council where can see the former change it to rezone peg to the ruler so this high risk oh so this has to be the Medicaid is the situation so that 's why the item want to support option one I preferred option to and also 22 properties only the four is over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasonable we specify those were not everything just part of it so let 's my to support option to cali i do think this raises a huge question with how we 're actually doing evaluations and revaluing something I mean rezoning land that can 't be developed is silly we should actually be not rezoning land until it can be developed in my view because if you take this area in particular we 've now got advice that there 's a high risk the resource consent won 't be obtained at all from the car club and we 've spent I don 't know how many hours and and how many millions trying to sort this tissue out so I think it 's unfortunate and you know I have to say I worry about other areas of the city that have now been got high density zoning and what 's going to happen in terms of their land value and their rates value and what compensation will they be able to apply for if we have a similar situation because we don 't have infrastructure in place or whatever it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that it does set a pretty high bar by requiring both the land value and the rights to be at a certain threshold so I will support it but it would be good to get something back at some stage around how the valuation and the language cleaning connects to each other in regards to this issue so that we don 't get a whole bunch of people coming back after the fact but rather at the time when the valuations come out there is a process by which they can understand impossibly challenge if they can 't develop as they thought they could thank you i 'll put the motions all those in favor say aye i post a note that 's carried up clean living stone the post right and the last one item 15 littleton design review panel friction of

you 'd like to and Vic he would like to as well now as it is really gonna clock so we don 't have to leave here for another 20 minutes yeah yeah okay so it 's just over too well it 's this power on to the rates from Russian consideration for South our tier this was a request from from a report from strategy and Finance they ask that we ask that this come to counsel with a report on the South our chair slightly different decision from the moment we made I means a different issue from the one we made last week but an equally challenging decision ref do you want to move the staff recommendation or do you have a different you know what would you like to move opportunity to make amigo to us turn into and see if we can turn that into a resolution is it possible just to ask a question of stuff in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff the meantime yeah I 'm thinking um I just wanted whether there 's a way in which we can actually see where there 's been massive changes of value like so is there a kind of systemic approach we could actually take to looking at where this has happened rather than just rely on individuals to make that you take upwards and downwards we 'll just how much it 's probably Edward I think that that 's the one that 's been the concern expressed by people that their lens been you know research or development and I 've got these huge increases when the development is unlikely to happen because of whatever reason and presumably that would also have to take an account with they had sold close to the time or not with evaluation as a point effect so we can do that have to cross reference to land ownership and sale and so I 'm just trying to understand whether we 're just going to get a whole bunch of ad hoc requests to give people rights or omission because the lens been resigned it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up hugely or whether there 's a more strategic way it 's not the basis for the request so I think I think it would be wrong to make that assumption there are other ways of dealing with property values this is a this is a property revaluation that 's based on something that was due to happen that hasn 't happened so and and that 's very sorry for the last decision we made it 's not exactly the same Paul just keep picking up on Peters point I would be interested to know if anyone in Syria has picked up the value since the rate since the rating value has gone up on sold it and they are there in there one near racer immersion I know I don 't think there 's been any sales in the South our tea area and just sorry to answer the original question yes every time we do revaluation we do do a little heat map and chance of different areas to show how values have changed up and down and what the impact that our rates but the mayor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2013 are considered to fairly reflect what the actual value was at the time and what has happened subsequent to that is that the signaled free zoning to enable that development and the

the changes have been quite significant so I mean the other question I had was to where we 've seen a huge rezoning of density whether that 's now going to put the property values up can we just please deal with this report I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to this commemoration okay in terms of the fifty percent increase are you reasonably comfortable with that as threshold it 's a little arbitrary I 've got to say and doesn 't matter what threshold we choose there 's going to be boundary issues I mean that the table on page 243 shows when it 48 the Cinque Terre yes so you know we could choose forty five percent that there 'll be someone at 44 and any bound to any any decision rights is bound to have boundary issues so it becomes a matter of relatively arbitrary judgment just decide how big a rates increase is big enough that it was in terms of the potential flow on effect which was one of the concerns of the earlier decision and obviously one here if it 's a 50-percent one the potential

increase as the cat club was going to go earlier as well and say happenstance yeah I 'm happy to more yeah are you already have I thought no no no 10 refs already moved up and you can second up and we can say probably so this is the word provide a 25-percent rates from us on out ally you had your hand up that 's essentially what the precedent created could be is that right or is there a greater potential numbers-wise citywide personalized that 's a good question that that 's just a bald number of the number of properties where rates increase by fifty percent at the last revamp citywide so do you want really quick hate them I think so okay I will it 's been moved and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's question I mean looking at the there is that 48 71 which is an hour outlier and there 's the below that I think it 's twenty-two percent so could we improve that property yeah cuz that 's just an outline there 's a 48 and 44 and 40 preserve well I can only see in the table i 'm looking at it 's only got the forty-eight percent won the last two for 10 and 440 we promoter at 44 and 40 i 'm looking at the land vegetation okay yeah he 's looking at the rock quarry sorry yes 44 oh sorry sorry full contract so are we talking about the land value so it 's providing a great 25% rates from ocean for properties which experience of 50 psi looking at the land value change rather than the rates change once the horse we return to your 34 and bottom part of both learn also be hungry or potential for so just us Steve to clarify it shall I that I liked it they don 't the highlighting doesn 't

Worsleys,SbSpcdz2Agw,20160914,1263.51,"Christchurch, New Zealand",3437,"and now we can go back to item 12 intersection improvement kashmir une fille was Lee 's and I understand we have our team here now presume that there are some questions in relation to this matter yes Glee okay thank you this report I 've just got a couple of questions and we have had a workshop which is good my first is why is this going to cost 2.8 20 million these intersection improvements and it 's a reasonably complex intersection there 's land purchase involved in it as well the original 900 ought k thousand that was in the LTP was really to was additional funding the would be would have been on top of the developer funding so the developer as a requirement of their consent was required to upgrade this in section when the his subdivision got to 260 something lot the 900 car and they would only have to upgrade the intersection to cater for the traffic being developed from the development we always fall saw there would be need to be additional facilities in the in section to cater for cyclists etc so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proportion that was foreseen to maybe be needed when the developer was required to upgrade this thing in whenever the development got to 260 odd sections so it is for a major in section improvement like this that involves a lot of realignment a lot of curbing work land purchases etc this is the estimated cost based on the detailed design that 's now been undertaken that with the northern arterial coming on they could well have been that some of these improvements may not have proceeded to the same as we had at the time that the LTP was put together the Nord of arterial wasn 't certain and so traffic loadings on Martians Road were expected to carry on increasing and it would have required improvements in that section between qe2 drivers surely now that the North material is certain and and about to start construction the completion of the northern arterial will take significant traffic loading off of Martians road so that calls into question the need to upgrade Martians wrote at the current time as was planned in the LTP to upgrade it between 2017 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic off of Martians road so we perceive that we need to now to further modeling and come back to the 2018 LTP based on the traffic loading that all the traffic patterns that will eventuate once the northern arterioles finished and review the need for for those improvements in the next LTP thanks Chris thanks Ellie the downstream mitigations that we 've heard a lot about particularly around the Ennis Road area was regards to that stretch from anas town to Barwick or Berwick this isn 't that areas that we 're talking about was regards to moving the money from as it note that project still in the LTP to do those downstream effects studies and the mitigation measures that come out of that study thank you the second part is of my question is if it becomes apparent that we do require the money for this down streaming that we 're moving will want to move today do you believe that money will be available or will it just be in the pot for negotiation and and allocation as per a normal process so as part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the network impacts of the Northern arterial being completed that if it 's needed it will be put forward as a project for consideration under the 2018 LTP under consideration just like all the other projects that will I can route thank you anyone else um ref emiliani in terms of shifting some of these other projects why do we actually need to do that and originally the funds for the worst is in section we 're out in 2021 to 20 23 that was to align with the perceived rate of development obviously now with the adventure park being certain it 's underway that and that 's I guess David inspires the submission from the sprayed and his coke community board as part of the annual plan and they will undoubtedly be increased so I pelling move comes one I guess the point I 'm making is these are quite tiny projects in terms of the overall capital program which we know we 're only going to deliver 7080 whatever percent so there 's not going to be a funding issue in terms of the funds to do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually complete these projects they 're not big projects which might be delayed or run over time so why don 't we just keep doing these have been so that the resolution from council was to identify Canada projects that could be used to fund advancing this intersection into the current financial year and they are our suggestion of two projects that could be used lies to do that the rest of the projects that are still in the LTP are underway for this current financial year and there isn 't funding or projects within the current financial year that were viewed as candidates that could be used to fund the 2 million dollars that is needed to to complete this project this year well I don 't think there is such a thing as there isn 't funding um I see why we wouldn 't just continue with those projects just outs of the downstream from qe2 is not really required because it would have been shredded at the same time as Northern arterial opening which is supposed to take the traffic off motioned anyway and then you haven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar plea because there are some changing patterns with traffic and citrus so to have a look at the whole thing rather than just won the under section if it bit what if I refer this so there 's some sense and actually delaying those project we 're not delaying them but no actually revealing those projects and light of the other issues we look at them in the illiterate view of the whole of the network and the changes that are happening on the network at this current point and tight well just a heavy haul gear that 's not a five usually she know that 's why those two are DuPont yeah yeah okay so the total is 2.8 million you say in the report that 's unlikely we 'll get NZTA subsidy so the other projects would qualify for NZTA subsidies I presume I don 't know that casual fitzgerald afore that 's an accessible City project that 's not funded by NZTA or whether that 's one that would be but can you just explain that in terms of the 2.8 how much of that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the element of subsidy and the other pro in the other projects would obviously need to go through the the normal business case process that we were required to do to secure that funding and when we put together the LTP that the funding that we receive from NZTA has taken at a global level we haven 't done the formal subsidy application for those two other projects of this stage is envisaged that they they would attract funding from nzta at that time because they qualify for in terms of safety and congestion benefits we don 't account within the LTP for fun nzta funding on a project-by-project basis is taken at a global level but what 's the percentage of funding that we expected for a project that the qualify for funding is normally around fifty percent that 's our standard funding rate for capital projects a project that does qualify for the component parts of that project that are part of the the carriageway if you like between the curbs that gets fifty percent funded stuff that 's outside of that so footpaths etc arms so it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ element of the project that is actually falls within NZ DA 's funding eligibility so basically there 's another million dollars of subsidy at a global level that we 've accounted for that we now need to take off so 3.8 million for this project I 'm sure no this is this is a total cost we 're going to put in an application to see whether it will get across the line all we 're flagging is that it may not get across the line they 're supposed to mean the 2.8 would come down to maybe two with 800,000 I 'm not sure exactly how much would be eligible so what we are going to make is an application to NZTA we 're just signaling to you that we may not get that you know so but what I 'm trying to understand if we go ahead today and we don 't get the NCAA funding it 's the cost that would seem would be higher than 2.8 it would actually be 3.8 because there 's a million dollars global subsidy for those two other projects that wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've done the re looking at the network would still be eligible for those when we move them so we 've just shifted that they 're all we 're saying is this may be a hundred percent funded by counsel or at make it a agency da subsidy we cannot guarantee that it until we make an application fee so the total cost is 2.8 those other project will get subsidy if they go ahead in their current form and they get the button if you look at the resolutions under four it says removed from the LTP program so i presume that audit new zeeland whatever relish it with us removing something from an LTP program and clutch and budgeting for an NZT a subsidy surely if we take a project out of our program we also should reduce the expected subsidy multiple right there long-term yeah so if we take it out of the long-term plan which these resolutions do then surely that subsidy should reduce like how would all it ever say that you can clean a subsidy for projects that you 've removed now we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm the subsidy would go into as crush said at a global level not at a competitive level so at a global level if we remove these projects from our long-term plan that subsidy should reduce right because someone would get the subsidy for the new hopefully if we have a project the 2.8 go in there at the moment we 've got to point out we 're doing it so that basically we are hoping that we will we 'll make an application for subsidy and so we 're hoping that we will get it we may or we may not and that 's what really we 're signaling however so the worst-case scenario is that we 'll have to find 2.8 million for this project this case soon no not at this point in time so is can you not okay oh sorry by term second a buffer so the other question I had was just in regards to the removal of these projects so the question before was you know we 've got a lot of carry forward so by removing these projects which the community haven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you why would you just why would you not just put them out further rather than remove them from the program I think person said that he 's going to bring them back into the two 2018 once we 've got a holistic picture of the network for both those projects so in actual fact we please asking this far might be moved into the 2018-19 year rather than be removed from the program that 's what he 's asking we don 't have to talk finance but I am don 't imagine we could shifted it wouldn 't be a problem of shifting some projects forward in some projects back help me here so is it unless the hallway speak on this is no free lunch if we want to bring funds into this year without taking funds out that it will impose an and post the extent to which we might also be putting at risk and contributions from developers and losing NZTA NZTA contribution also reinforces that risk so there 's no free lunch yeah but I think I think the way we were making the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequence for the decision I think that the point that we were making was that what was that that would assume that every single item on the capital program was delivered this year which i am i 'm hopeful that it is but it hasn 't been before so yeah which i think is point we the next time we do the the the capital program will be in as part of the annual plan we actually upgrade it update it done the end the project so an extra fact we will can bring that back up to you we don 't do the capital program interim so we can actually look at putting it into that so i think the resolution of the force what 's giving me a bit of trouble because it says to remove the project from a long-term plan i was happy to to swap the substitution and actually put it back into the year 2023 or even a 22 I think I think it 's literally said anyway we actually enable the subsidy to be calculated and whatever all it happens because we would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that the or that that we 're swapping them so basically that we rescheduled them for the 20 21 22 and 20 to 23 years as as provided for the Kashmir whom hey Wars the intersection improvements but require that they be reconsidered in the 2018 year yeah that is effectively what we were proposing but yes yeah but it but but the but what yani tseng is he don 't want he doesn 't want to vote for a resolution that says be removed from the LTP and I think we we meet Peters consumed by putting it as a direct swap for an item that 's already on the budget so it 's to be rescheduled yeah so to be rescheduled or no no I 'm use the same way brief phased and to the 20 21 22 and 20 to 20 23 years so you use the wording from five no no no no 20 21 you just copied those and then and and and leave the woods three phase them to the 22 a new one years for reconsider don 't leave it at set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wrote it up yep all right yep you good outcome all right so we 've gotta move on a stick it out I 've dated faizan five and three well are we going to reconsider that no because the point of item three really was and the understanding that i have is that the by the time we plan and get into detailed design for item three there the northern arterioles likely to be on stream and the necessity for that work may be substantially reduced and in fact you know i would have probably gone kicking and screaming about taking budget off air so out of town but i 'm convinced that the way we 're doing this is makes sense because the impact on traffic will reduce quite substantially once the northern arterioles and face I would however just add the the one little comment that we 're here we are one point oh three million is being generously donated from the eastern suburbs to the other side of town and I trust that will be taken into consideration of this debate on legacy projects and things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're quite happily in the circumstances that have been out lying lying to us today to forego this project and the bitter interests of the city so well we call to be City Council and yeah I 'm okay our fell well I don 't think this is like a partisan type decision at all clearly the whole city is going to benefit from the adventure park and it has required some purchase of land and additional funding and and there 's no losses at all in terms of the roms project on on them and also that the safety aspects of casual and fits drilled at all so it 's a win when really in terms of making sure that not only this project has delivered so that in fact there 's good exit good vehicle access and good cycleway access but but but also it comes back to what I guess our safety concern that local residents and Spain and hit could have asked for for a long time the intersections never work particularly well and this is a good opportunity to get it right so all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a huge asset to the city everybody is going to be an effort by what we decide today we got our time Thank You dinger pack aside the traffic has changed since the earthquake developed in the south and southwest is huge we get a lot more traffic through this area than then we hit as many other areas do so there 's one intersection actually the pulsing will improve not only heck thorne road being your drive creeper but the other areas that are immediately affected as well like we small and so I want to thank staff for the work you 've done on it and thank you it 's good good Yanni ya fiction I I actually think it 's good to be proactive and actually address issues before they arise and it 's a shame that we might not qualify the NZTA funding for doing that but given what 's been done in that local area I think this is a really sensible way forward the other the other reason that actually like the idea that you 've identified casual Fitzgerald haven 't taken it off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 22 there 's actually if you think about it that actually aligns with when hopefully some some planning or some thinking around the new stadium which will have a massive impact on traffic in that area so spending money on that project now ahead of knowing the future outcome of the stadium and the design and location and all the other things that are associated with it actually makes a lot of sense so you know I think this is a really sensible solution I don 't know when we 're going to start thinking about the stadium hopefully that 's not too far away and hopefully there 's a very detailed traffic assessment I would just say that for that area there are significant safety concerns with the closure of a number of streets going into the avenues which will end the northern arterial extension which will divert a huge amount of extra traffic around the 4 f 's that 's the whole plan for the accessible city plan and it would be really good to understand just how those safety concerns are going to be addressed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives us time to do that which is why it 's a sensible decision thank you thank you i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye or as a person no that 's scary","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"
NZ,NZ,Christchurch City Council,Christchurch City Council,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZETwErnCvvgbvBbnnHfyxA,15.09.16 - Item 14 - Establish a Health and Safety Committee of Council,NDgmuD7WDs0,20160914,970.3,"Christchurch, New Zealand",2599,um right intersection improvement Kashmir hoon hay Wars leaders shall we shall we shall we do shall we establish the Health and Safety Committee of counsel fierce yeah okay so we 'll go to item 14 it was actually there was one point that I wanted to make about health and safety that had said meeting shall not be held fewer than four times a year but it sort of thing I 'd rather express it positively that meeting shall be held at least four times a year I can 't we 'll update them thank you thank you for that suggestion was there it did anyone else have any yet comment and Andrew Phil I had a number of questions and I 'll apologize to Carlene before I ask this question because discussing the chief executives role in this committee we with the chief executive in the room obviously requires some sensitivity but I was interested in the recommendation the chief executive be part of the decision-making body of the committee the recommendation making body of the committee at the same time as I 'm sure we would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization is doing what we would want it to do from a health and safety viewpoints so the responsibilities item to seek assurance that the organization is effectively structured to manage health and safety I would imagine that advice would be coming from the chief executive who in this model is also sitting on the committee as a decision-making member and I know that that can present difficulties with having one person essentially on on both sides of the table if you like and I just wanted to get some commentary around that yeah i mean that 's seriously we were sort of trying to get that consider that but that would that 's good feedback and we wouldn 't necessarily and when we baste with previously reported up to the audition risk committee and on health and safety issues so the chief executive satsang yes so a lot of use that made earlier it may not be a universal point of view that the chief executive shouldn 't be a member of a audit risk the chief executive as a member and it seemed to me that since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came from or the idea the concept came from audit and risk seemed to me to make sensitive the chief executive beer because we would have someone from human resources reporting presumably so um if you read under secretary meetings it was about the committee may have an attendance such members of management including the chief executive officer so I think that this has been a lot of principal advisor role in terms of their because of the importance of this committee to the organization into governance so maybe to put the question slightly differently than the intention in this report is that the chief executive would be a member of the committee as in a decision-making member of the committee but also accepting that the chief executive would have a role in advising that committee as well I mean it 's a question rather than statement because I 'm just keen to understand the background to the the formation of the committee I 'm certainly not taking a view at this stage on whether I think the chief executive should be a part of the decision-making body or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind what appears to be the chief executive having potentially two roles in that forum one of the ways of thinking around this area of health and safety and this is sort of guided by some of the principles and the legislation is that really to ensure a safe and healthy culture we need to ensure that there 's this kind of collaboration consult in cooperation so that might be a way of you know modeling the committee 's that are around that so that 's another way of sort of thinking about it because I think it needs to be we want to work very much the sort of unique roles of the chief executive and there are unique roles of elected members in terms of their responsibilities so I think what 's key is that it 's a collaborative consultative process to make sure that we 're having an organization that 's you know promoting a really safe and healthy culture it 's what allows this to work at the end of the day what we want is the most effective structure so the committee can do its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the terms of reference the membership we 've got counselors and we 've got external advisors is there any thought as to the numbers of counselors and the numbers of external advisors because later in the report the report reads as though there will be one external advisor but that may not be the case according to the terms of reference so again just some commentary around perhaps the expected number of counselors or external advisors or how we would arrive at those numbers I think that we would certainly want to have more than one external representative I think that 's where the strength as to actually have some expertise from other organizations that have been involved in this so certainly would see more than one I think you want to keep the committee relatively you know so not too large as well so that it can sort of be effective because this sort of quite a lot of operational aspects to it so yeah we sort of take some guidance on that but I think it 's certainly more than one external baby two to three yep um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've also got some concerns around I guess the role that the CA and it wouldn 't matter who the sea is what respectively it 's a more of a governance issue in that clearly at times if the e is part of the decision-making committee as against being an advisor at times and given that it everyone want the committee to work in a collaborative basis as you say but the be times when in fact there are governance and management issues arising give it especially for example that if some issues would happen in fact it will be the e who would be accountable to the committee so just one of you comment on that I mean I think that 's a really good point and it 's really thinking about we 're and we 're still working with the new legislation sort of working through how that fits and we have looked at some other councils experiences some of them will put things through the audit and Risk Committee others have established an independent health and safety committees so I think it 's a good point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's as a advisor or a voting member thanks email just got someone free look I made a mistake I 've been look google the audit and risk management committee so carlene 's just an attendant she 's not right a member of the community well yeah so so Taylor to take the CEO out of there yeah but leaving the expression that there I am including the chin I 'm just about answer my other point to though is it sorry I think it 's really good to have this discussion I think it 's it 's urgent that we get this done I 'm still wondering though in fact to get this right if in fact this is something that we could ask the nuke should ask the new council no this is going to the new Canada 's yes so we 're providing feedback are more energized we do with the other side i 'll scan the actual terms of reference think that this is going to the new council but i guess that i mean we could have done this at a at a workshop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so i think feedback we should give them that 's been very helpful yeah um I 'm look I 'm health or safety committees aren 't new Domino the right thread and many many organizations you hope anyway so the normal practice is that the reporting officer are relevant of their standing and the organization is not a member of a committee of the committee because there are crossed out CEO okay so yeah so we 'll take woolum in dirt that this CEO is not a member of the committee for the new yeah you just make me vent take CEO out of membership but leave an item to the foursome do people want to do people have a view whether the chair is appointed by the mayor or well then they are appointed by the clear I 'm yeah yeah until a nice tuned driver council majority of the council yeah as it is this a proposal to have a different mechanism forces we were taking guidance on what 's a normal mechanism so that was advice that we got it doesn 't require yeah this was oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you look at if you look at the key points on page 245 it says that the armc requested that council consider the establishment of a health and safety committee of councils the chief executive was to provide draft terms of reference and the appointment process for under pendant members with a view of establishing the committee in September 2016 well that 's not going to happen so we weren 't able to get to the position where we would be establishing the committee prior to the election so this what we need to do is provide advice and just refer this to the uncommon council with the recommendation that they establish a Health and Safety Committee with some urgency yep yep yep so are there any other issues that people would like to provide feedback on alright so moved by Paul seconded by Pauline so so we 've got receive review and provide no we don 't need that that the council that the council note the draft terms of reference document and appointment process and recommend to the new council that they establish a health and safety committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we that be given priority in terms of urgency to should we as a matter of priority yep Jamie yeah do you mind if I speak to that very great um well I think health and safety committees are incredibly important and one of my pet hates is when you have an organization when quizzed around their level of priority for health and safety or whether they have a health and safety committee the biggest cop-out answer you can get is when they say I know that the whole board is the health and safety committee because you know when people say there 's no right or wrong answers are sorry that 's the wrong answer same as audit and risk you can 't say well the hot waters the audit and Risk Committee you need to have their focus on it so I 've been a member of a health and safety committee for a for a company that 's probably in a high-risk industry a heavy engineering and heavy equipment and that sort of stuff and I think the most important aspect of the health and safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all that sort of stuff and the monitoring you know that that 's part of it but it 's um it 's around embedding a culture and that 's always the challenge so when there was talk of whether or not the chief executive as a member of it I 'm one of the biggest stickers you 'll find for the importance of good governance and governance versus management with effort so it 's most effective but I see this committee setting very much in line in mirroring audit and risk and I think having car around that table and the capacity that she has been has been absolutely invaluable because to truly understand what the risks of that organization is what the risks are and also what the opportunities are having having that chief executive around that table and a part of that body has been very very beneficial whether that 's in the form of a non-voting member or whatever but I think the Health and Safety Committee should mirror the audit and Risk Committee and that 's how I really and visit it so if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think it should probably follow similar terms of reference to audit and rust because I don 't leave very very similar anyway with ya with that being said I think there 's a sieve in the right direction with obviously got new legislation and I know this is not a corporate organization or a corporate entity with the same responsibilities for elected members but that doesn 't mean that we should take those responsibilities lightly because this needs to be off top priority and ensuring that we embed a culture of success in excellence with respect to health and safety is incredibly important so there 's a good step forward and I 'm happy to I 'm happy to move it but it enhanced because Ben boulders hey guys well then I 'll be heading to vote for us hey what did you want to say cuz I disappear felissa you clarified that the CEO was an adviser to the audit and risk I 've taken here out of them no no no no but but just to clarify because it was sounded like that she was a member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrified no no she 's a she 's a she 's a 1910 so principled voice yeah I did come back and apologize because I made a mistake oh yeah what then if I 'm a minimum me also again know what is uh Carlene I know that 's why I couldn 't what what 's carlene 's roll under the terms of reference and audit and risk because my I think nothing she has teams she is a hugely valuable member of the community committee but doesn 't actually have voting rights and we 're going to mirror that with the Health and Safety Committee yes but she 's not but she 's not elicited as a member of the committee she is an attendance Luther yeah so that 's that 's covered by point2 yy-yeah gravy chicken is just put we got Paul and who second do it all Pauline thank you I knew I I knew I had a mover in a second death yeah all right so should I put that motion I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no it 's carried and now we can go,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Update,aGmbO8DMO64,20160914,553.54,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1365,north of multicultural strategy update to me would you like to move this and I 'll let you speak to it as well would someone like to Second Earth Andrew please multicultural working party I 'm delighted there the feedback from the drop for multicultural strategy consultation is positive in the fourth support from the majority of the community in the individuals I myself attended three workshop inform University of Canterbury and a partridge multicultural council I have a strong field in the majority of the attendees so that is our thought very strategical document is very crucial for council take a lead to give people a sense of belonging as well as give everyone equal opportunity to assess the council 's information in the services my view lacheesa said four factors which means the welcome a supportive my majority of the community individuals is due to this high-level strategic document is based on the partnership between the city council in the wider community especially the multicultural working party consists of our fellow councillors and the community leaders to establish this apartment and also this document is the council in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25 years so I 'm also delighted manaphy no one has been a get involved to review and amended is a draft a strategic document to make this document as a living document and will be presented to the Tujunga committee meeting in November of this year initial stage I have a lipid as a point because why I thought the lease term council we were adopted is the the document however mana feel no one to review and they have a proper amendment that 's very very the crucial because based on our vision we respect the Treaty of Waitangi let 's very crucial so I accepted this kind of the situation so I look forward to this final strategy document to be presented to the council proof as soon as possible this way if we can approve at the end up popular before Christmas let 's paste now that in the next year and for the further implementation of the action plan in for the next five years finally I still would like to Teddy 's opportunity to express my sincere appreciation to all the working group members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and myself eternal members zo Pacheco Catherine II can 't matura Josiah Winky and Anana and older council staff clear Esther patria Katie Georgie gay bra in the ahora so thank you thank you and Andrew oh sorry info in clean thank you and I just like to echo the comments that counselor chan has made not also like to in addition to recognizing the contribution that the the working group members including those external members have made it 's been an excellent process and councillor chan has made a an excellent job of chairing that working group and bringing this whole piece of work together but this this really where it 's got to is around taking a bit of extra time to end up with a strategy which is is really excellent and fit for the future and fit for purpose I think out of taking the extra time to to get the further input from the tejano capita per ruining a committee and the advice of car owner and Gabriel our and cultural advisors will end up with something which is going to be so much better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completed in this council term and not done getting that extra input so my belief is that the extra time taken will result in some real added value to this strategy which will end up with a strategy which is really fit for purpose fit for the future and which will ya be an excellent reflection of the really good work that 's been done to get us at this point it 's phil and i also think the drumming and the committee for doing excellent work with the staff there 's one area i just wondered about and I 'm the is one of the themes of racism and I note that the young people especially they wanted a strong a commitment from Council around that and I note that you 've been you 've worked with a number of schools I 'm just wondering given the incidents with schools and sporting clubs if in fact we might perhaps have more contact with say the sporting clubs and maybe a wider range of schools and I appreciate the work though that you 've all read um thank you that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your frustration just one of those why or anything you know sort of some way no points on this and I know is the proposal to launch the strategy coincides with the Louisville Slugger about Tigers in laxmi day commemoration also citizenship zeros we do some way of Leicester City report plus you know the council meeting closest do they fit in a way to is probably closed anyway exactly like genuine they can be able optional we 're certainly happy to take your lead on Wii U and when you 'd like it launched we were hoping that there may be a raft of activities around that time it 's quite a busy time of the year for race relations and other activities so we certainly happy to take your steer on how you 'd like us to to launch it Yannick entation and just wondered obviously by the time the strategies adopted the elections will be over but are we doing anything just in terms of awareness of the election with those ethnic communities all those diverse communities around civic engagement and participation at the moment yes counselor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some groups have talked to the members by themselves and we connected some communities with the marketing team to give them the opportunity to participate in some of the campaigns that were organized around election days no don 't think anybody picked it up the young people picked it up more if Paul sorry just very briefly i want to thank clear for the work she 's doing I know the work you did on our safer crisis strategy he got a multicultural strategy just the work you 've done and terms of getting a lot of this rule together this term has been foundational acknowledge that actually fear thank you for also actually like to acknowledge the work of easter and in the end that entertain certainly been in the multicultural working party at certainly been a huge undertaking and it 's been a really unique and wonderful opportunity to work with so many diverse people particularly having the community help co-create this whole thing or so think I realize there are other people who have a I think the leadership you 've shown Paul we get as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congratulations to cancel the gene I mean he 's been passionate about and you know I wouldn 't I wouldn 't see any reflection at all about taking the extra time just to get the amount of input so that it is right and it 's going to have your names to over it so and that 's because you 've just devoted your attention to making it happen and you 've just never wavered and your commitment to ensuring that the city has a multicultural strategy so I congratulate you and all the others I think that you 've also proved that the model that brings external people to the table with councillors actually works works really well at net concept of co-creation as both empowering but also provides for a better strategy as a result for us so it works both ways so on that note i will put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed no that 's scary,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Limited,GHCVGFv95k4,20160914,743.58,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1926,statements of intent christchurch city holdings limited and i know that Eddie Jones has a initially that she wants to raise in relation to the little import company 's statement of intent I don 't know whether just a cch I 'll come to the table for this one or it 's just it I know that the the cruise ship terminal you know the cruise ship the commitment to operating a cruise ship terminal or having a cruise ship terminal is in the Littleton recovery plan but it 's not specifically stated in a statement of intent so it refers to the to the refers to the immigrant glasses down it refers to the little term recovery plan and thus saw the things that 's going to be doing and leaves out the cruise terminal I mean there is going to be a cruise terminal and we all know that it 's going to happen but it 's subject to some business case analysis at the moment but I think it would be useful to signal it on the statement of and change because it 's in Littleton recovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of us it 's it 's India but we 're wondering if we could have it specifically stated on the statement went in very clearly admitted and one of them is the role in the growth of the regional regional economy and excuse me infrastructure for the next 30 years so I don 't have the page numbers in front of me I was reading it on my phone and screen shot at it so it 's not that clear and but those were the two areas particularly for example in the CDC SOI there is clear reference to team and the development of the teeth which hasn 't happened yet but is happening and I feel that that is a parallel with the crews birth and the SLI for LPC yeah at this point i mean at the time when we did this and it was approved by the end of 30 of the june as i said we 're going through a process with them the business case was going through so it 's are you actually wanting it done and the statement are we going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it needs to be part of the sea so I it as as the mayor has said there is no doubt there will be some sort of cruise booth or terminal or whatever at littleton and it needs to be signaled in there somewhere either as an aspirational thing or something that is still to be investigated further this does leave it an interesting position because these are final I so why 's that have already been told it 's very it 's very difficult to change them without actually basically well I 'm amazed it 's got to this point without this having been raised in my apologies for not raising us ya know it has been it 's been through strategy and finance I mean through council and twice actually so this is the final that 's come through but it is I mean maybe can we just take comfort from the fact that it is and that is in the little turn recovery at the Littleton port recovery plan if there is nothing we can do about it there is nothing we can do about it however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any so I has been through council only day their chance to make okay well I 'm one thistle yeah yeah Andrew yeah maybe just to add certainly some commentary was made at strategy and Finance and on the draft around the relationship between the SOI and littles important recovery plan commentary was made around the crews birth commitment to the Antarctic Program and relationships with the community and I know all of those were picked up in a response that came back to us when we were discussing the draft and obviously we 've got to this final SLI now I don 't know whether an appropriate thing to do my tree to note these things yeah in response to the next letter of expectation that would result in the next draft SL I think that 's probably the best process to pick that up given that we can 't make changes today yeah I think given we 're going through the pro gonna start that process again in a month 's time yeah that 's right yet so it first drop of every so so note that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ litter of expectations will give clear direction that the council 's expects a cruise terminal to be developed and sex cruise ships the accommodator and the meantime because it allows for I mean that is going to be an hour statement of expectations is that way well year the next one starts a process in a month but but I think we should note it because I think that we should do more than give a clear direction that we expect the cruise terminal be developed but that we expect them to accommodate cruise ships in the meantime and I 'd like to put I don 't put cruise ships and ice breakers as part of the as part of Antarctic programs Antarctic Program icebreakers as well oh sorry and they done tactic program ice breakers or vessels be accommodated as well oh sorry kreuzberg cruiseship birth cruise ship with antarctic ice but no Antarctic Antarctic Program vessels capital a no no no no no no no no no capital capital aid kept it away in TAC TAC si si si si no Josephus is type of

increase easily the grid of terminal and that 's be e r th and probably another whether we need to take advice on this letter of expectation rather than statements of expectation because it 's the letter of expectation and going to the port isn 't it and so that note that the LPC litter of expectation note that the letter of expectation for LPC so yeah take out yeah and move that go for LPC will give clear direction the council speaks that a cruise bet they developed in the cruise ships be accommodation meantime and that the entire tech program vessels also be accommodated Yanni very soon we wanted to write issues to be uncertainty or of the combination photography custard yes service calls between this discussion federal drug he survives and raising issues and conserving was done in politics live on a little bit consented day went out having the ability to raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like me to rule myself out of order no no I don 't want advice on that or like oh I 'm sorry yonni but I forgot that I I wasn 't too I kind of I got a message from Le that she wanted to raise this particular issue I hadn 't taken on board the fact that these were the final they are the final and actually it was going to be raised in this point anyway the litter of expectation there is absolutely no reason why we can 't just notify that here but look we 're going to have a conversation about this it 's not going to it 's not going to come up before there is a new council so I 'm quite happy for the stew to sit as part of the resolution is your happy for us to move other leaders high expectation no no why not because Ali raised us the forehand and you know Ellie 's already made a decision that she 's not going to be joining us after the election and and I accepted that resolution as part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mistake yani I do from time to time and this is one that I may die I had overlooked that this was the final stage so I 'm just being I don 't know kind to a person who 's decided to go to the community board level and and provide here valuable service to her city from there right and oh did you have another oh no except to say that I think the the intent of what we 're doing here is is commendable and I see no problem with the fact that we 've got that Downey not I support the content of what we 're doing and that 's the important thing we the things that we need to get sorted and this is just doing it and we 'll come up with a better process next time ally on question because of course in the SLI to there is a mention of return to shareholders and the requirement for LPC to accommodate their cargoes as per their contracts which I understand what I 'd be slightly concerned about is that we are essentially saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accommodated full stop if they are unable to be accommodated and I don 't want to add any sort of gray area here but they do have contracts with some companies for birthing and cargoes to be is there some way we can just be every every endemic endeavor be made yes something at just every and we 're gonna be made to ensure the beauty of the accommodation meantime and it also be accommodated and on the same basis yeah yeah cool all right now do I have a mover and a seconder for these yeah Andrew seconded by item I 'll put that Jonnie nothing JC it 's good to be able to save a spoiled 717 I just wanted to express disappointment that they can 't sew it up for living wisely power these seven designing issue asking our companies to consider anyway it 's really important and something that will improve the table reminding each patient 's brain disease this council around some of the Pyrates or with the contractors and cleaners there 's something that 's incredibly important so I 'll disappointed that as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask the company to cancer that I think there 's still a long way to go in terms of things like favorability CEO increases that need to be addressed so I 'll take advice from the mere that you don 't want us to raises issues today that we can call the new council and consider the things that we would like to put on others obviously patient enough that i 'll return is council i will sing of the idol be asking for a commitment to looking at the living way and addressing the issues and player on zivity around things it means ok of what the I 'll put that motion all those in

Land,u1Saew3KTpA,20160908,909.71,"Christchurch, New Zealand",2301,transfer of severe house lens item 38 this groundhog desert hey groundhog bed didn 't we just do it it 's only groundhog day for those that choose to see it that way all right look this is the this is the sister paper so little to the other sister paper and emphasis the transfer to properties listening charles street yep crystal yes yeah yeah that 's the only name you 've gotten brave today no i don 't know why i don 't behave today okay would you like to ask a question i 'm not going to go on what we talked about before but just one question so page for 78 item two point one point eight so you say that the policies of the strategic will the significance and engagement policies is the policy expressly states that a decision to dispose of only part of such a strategic asset may be made without those parts being considered to be strategic you just kind of expand on what that means it means that whole that the whole yes it has all the social housing portfolios at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there a certain native line around the policy doesn 't specify and that just for social housing or any strategic asset I think it applies to that success a comment it is made tools information all together it 's that I 'm looking at my colleague everything like a 51-percent is it can do your parts of the SS depending obviously on how big the factors do what that 's supposed to be obvious question what is there a delineation somewhere about what bit no I know 45 315 yeah but it was something I guess my question is at what point do you kind of they actually know that 's a strategical I think that 's a matter of judgment but I 'm certainly you need to make a call it thank you yep yeah ya think um what 's just wondering in terms of weather we 've had evaluation on this yes we have right and as and when was got done it was done in 2014 and then updated in 2016 right okay and and so the price is listed here the value listed here based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conditions of sale the gift that would require social housing to be built back on these sides the the trust to whom these assets to be transferred as a charitable trust its charitable objects social housing the trust can only use these it 's for social dancing so it can deliver social housing we can use these assets to deliver social housing in however it chooses right okay and there 's two other questions I 'm just under one you said it we 've got an obligation under the housing the board I 'm just trying to understand why we 've got an obligation when the government had obligations as well that it 's changed or not meeting around the 75 million so is obligation the right word I mean are we legally bound to do this by the housing accord or is it something that we can actually choose to do like the government has with its money that 's taking about we believe we 're obligated we 've signatories to the house in your court so why are we obligated to do that us but government 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 75 million on housing I can answer on behalf of government goes I can add a little bit happy you go okay so yeah so it 's like the culture we have to do what we say we 're going to do despite the fact that other things have changed to keep to your money sorry mr. the final question can I just ask given that um you know there 's candidates and the election who are standing on a platform around housing social housing why are we doing this today in the election period rather than waiting for the election we 've already consulted on it Jonnie for goodness sake that 's fine I 'm just no it 's not it 's not it 's not some stuff to answer we 've already been through the consultation I mean there is nothing that hasn 't been in the public arena this is being heard in public there is nothing that 's a problem here and it 's not for staff to answer somebody playing political games at this time of the year thank you anything else no right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phil is there any discussion yardley oh yeah yeah i will have stayed on this because i believe that we shouldn 't be making a significant decision like this in the election period it 's my view that given their they 're having candidates who have raised the issue of social housing on the campaign trail that this is a significant decision and i feel uncomfortable making this decision today it 's in my view in terms of the housing Accord I think that 's something that the new council needs to really have a good look at and understand the obligations that both sides had and what has or hasn 't been done but it has been a moving feast and I think it would be good to get some certainty around why things have been changed significantly from the government 's perspective rather than simply us continuing to go through it so but I think making the decision today in my view as an appropriate and I will be abstaining from this because I think it 's something that the new council when it comes in should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do I 'm calling Glenn and Phil you think you look like this is this has been a very long and detailed and challenging piece of work to me our housing portfolio has been and dire straits and for whatever reasons those are we had to find a way out of this this is this represents 50 million out about 350 million dollars worth of social housing air seats I think it 's a really good project to to enter into it 's a good collaborative agreement we 've got good partners on the trust and I we 've been told that the trust is safe is going to look after the asset and grow the portfolio that 's a great model and I 'm looking forward to it being successful and at the end of the day the winners are going to be tenants and good affordable housing are getting the uncommon ated rent subsidy from the government so let 's give it a go it 's no time now to delay it it 's so close to taking off I support it and clean and then fill and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a culmination of the tombs work so this has been a big piece of work over three years and this council in my view has achieved a lot over these last three years and this is another big tick because this is about our tenants at the end of it just out in three points all I 've noted the first over of Tim 's work this is the capitalization of the entity the trust is required as we know to to be solvent we 're holding up our end of the housing accord we 're signatories to that if one of the other of the other partner makes other decisions that 's not our responsibility we 're making good on that signature and that 's what matters my third point the report seeks to initiate capitalization process as per page 418 with this 50 million dollars at the end of it just like the stress it 's about the tenants I know we all know you might have a philosophical view on this which is different from mine the factors we 've been in social housing or around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sins let 's make it about them we 're nearly there so just really if you can agree on this today I thought I think it 's edible it would be a good tick for the calcium to end on I fell um look where he is right I 'm going to reiterate I with points that have you made in favor of us getting nothing done at this stage is simply not an option we owe it to our tenants we owe it to the staff who 've worked so hard on this for over 33 years and we ought to hold of Christ you truly to actually make a clear decision and just just do this so I the background to this of course is that and we wouldn 't be in this position if government were fear and gave us the the gay their tenants the income related rent subsidy but but they refuse that 's a scandal in my view that it does not mean we do nothing this council is doing what we can and and I 'm certainly strongly supporting the recommendations David I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centered around the fact that I it doesnt sit with the sort of recent decisions of asset transfer and here we are taking 50 million dollars worth of assets off our books and with hardly a whimper when we suggest selling red vessel city care it creates an uproar and the other the other issue that I have so much just on a problem with really it 's around the solvency of the organization and in that in the 50 million dollar transfer five million of it has really put aside to make this company solvent so it is whilst I see some of the pros and cons of the proposal my economic view of it gives me some reason to too seriously sort of question with a longer term this is going to be a viable operation so I 'm afraid I can 't really support it and haven 't done in the person either well just don 't say that I find it extraordinary that somebody can sit around the table and say that this is a and that should be put off the main decision we made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we assigned the tendencies I signed the tenancy agreement yesterday many of you were there and to have somebody playing politics and a lead up to an election simply making the point that others misrepresent what 's going on is a reason to hold off the decision is absolutely beyond my belief so this is not an s it sail this is the transfer of two properties it 's actually not the full 50 million but it 's the first match of of properties that will ultimately be a value of 50 million to be transferred from the council to the auto tahi Community Housing Trust these two properties are the first to be transferred and we 're transferring to a trust of which we are essentially apart but we are not a majority you know but there isn 't a shareholder obviously in a trust but we 're not a majority we 're under a majority because we have other partners sitting at the table or with the same intent the trust is guided by the trust deed it can only work with on social housing that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housing and we want to be a part of it central government 's made it crystal clear that they don 't believe that City Council 's are worthy of receiving access to the one stream of income which is assured around uncomely 8 and that 's the uncommon ated rental subsidy they pay it to themselves they pay it to any community housing provider but they won 't pay it to a council we have been committed since nineteen twenty one to social housing I cannot for the life of me understand why central government will not partner with us and as I said yesterday at the signing of the transfer to the community to auto tahi Community Housing Trust I said you now have the responsibility to reach out to central government we want you to partner with central government because they central government have said that they will trust the chip that they will work with the chip they 'll pay the IRAs to the chip so let 's see what we can do as a city but not think of it of having to be owned one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forming partnerships with communities this is another one of those partnerships it 's a different form it might be uncomfortable for one or two but that 's all it is it 's a level of discomfort with letting something go and trusting that a trust will deliver and I think this is going to be great for Christchurch so I 'm going oh no she 's it so the motion has been moved and seconded i will put the motion all those in favor say aye oh I suppose they know carriage thank you very very end one abstention from yonni,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

2016,-6LUjRaI6kg,20160908,598.05,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1696,the next icon most a performance report over the year season during twin Celestine ref you 'd like to move there and sit in 25 Tony chin are there any questions canny who who who 's answering on this one it really depends on the question I okay all right so you can all just wait wait just go for coffee wait with bated breath right yani far away it was a concern that we 're not meeting our performance level and it was comment made that that was due to the change in level of service in terms of the frequency of Road sleeping so I just wanted to check yeah what what basically if we 're putting back that level of service or whether that necessary for more resolution sorry ya fiction for greed standards so in which is sitting on page 4 45 yep we are talking with the contractors around that too its measured in the way of I think in a number of complaints isn 't it and we actually got in the 1516 4403 so we are looking at whether we are sweeping the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit of work going on with the contractor that in there so is that also including rudder collection because I mean it says that the frequency of sivan was changed in 15 16 and I 'm really just trying to understand if that was at activity management level of service change that we made is part of the annual plan or whether that 's something that staff have just done basically litter litter is sitting between two different areas there 's litter that 's on the street which is done under this contract and there 's whether that 's off the street has done under another contract and so we are ensure the levels of service of those are coordinated one of the problems that we have had and a good example would be the avon river precinct where we 've had changes in services because parts of the big area have been shut off and it 's put concentrated effort into other areas and a good example would be the little triangular part that 's by the bridge of remembrance where we suddenly had everyone having morning afternoon tea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times a day to empty the litter bins and we didn 't have any well we didn 't have any space to put any infrastructure and so what we 're trying to do is to see how we can match our services to demand we 've got another issue around a corona or is another one that 's causing us quite a lot of area of concern particularly around the bus we I 'm not sure whether we 've got enough infrastructure in there but those are things that we are looking at do we need to add more infrastructure do we need to actually get how do we change those frequencies and is there ways we can do things smarter rather than them then more expensive of that basically what I 'm just what I 'm trying to understand as like a levels of service wasn 't to reduce the frequency of sweeping it was to reduce the number of complaints but what we 've been told is that we reduce the number we reduce the frequency at 15-16 which is why we 've now got more complaints and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a correlation that 's the and I guess that 's the point that we need a little bit more reporting on the comment that because there 's a wide range of different factors going in so we 're analyzing that then trying to get how was those levels of service going in and we 're looking at the way in which potentially we may shift out as you may be aware a number of our major maintenance contracts are coming to the end of their run life and so we 're looking at maybe a better way to greet re-packaged those so we have like with like even though they get funded out of different buckets and it may well be the way that i read that is is that if you want to look to see it the csrs to see if there are a key hotspots oh and that 's your point is that some areas you get shut off from which means that people do things in other areas that they wouldn 't normally do and then that increases the level of season okay particularly in town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infrastructure reasonably quickly and we then have to reprioritize about how we do that and so I think some of those train the seagulls in ducks not to do certain activities on all that concrete so I don 't just looked at today and there 's a huge amount of letter because of the storm we 've just had you know we 've had a few because if anyone 's been in an area without the collective rubbish today we 've had more rubbish bins grown over than suits so to return to the frequency that we used to have what would the cost be I don 't know that anyway yet so unit says don 't know that it 's correlated with it 's the thing is might say that Jonnie but at the nasa and the community like in an escape more what they were told was we 've gone from collecting rubbish sorry sweet stripping sweeping street sweeping from every two weeks to every four weeks so we know that like there is a change of liberal servers that the community have been concerned about so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why the remedial action here is to then refocus sweeping frequencies we 're most urgently needed will mean that other areas then get even less of frequency and that 's what worries me i want us to actually keep to the frequency that that we had before we reduce the frequency and i think that 's what 's causing level of services around customer satisfaction it 's not around the frequency and so what we are saying in here as a mere saying is that we are trying to collate how do we deliver that service in relationship to customer satisfaction which is what it is you know a very good example you only need to go down well street and you see that now is about you know we 've moved the center of nights friday saturday nights to that area and we get more litter there than we used to get that used to happen in the middle of town so it 's those changing environments that we need to do it may be absolutely applicable we we may be sweeping streets don 't need to be swept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resource and put it to the point which is going to provide the maximum satisfaction of the 13 you could you get a specific report together on this issue and send it 30 is that is that possible because I mean it would be quite good to understand what the correlations are because I don 't believe that they are related to the frequency of the sweeping it 's the changing nature of the uses of different parts of the city that 's having more of an impact and then people were complaining you know so I mean it 's different areas of you know and I mean in lynnwood it might be because of this week that the sweeping but it won 't be the same across the city and I think having levels of service based on on outputs or rather than outcomes er I mean input so glad we go and not the way to go and that 's what we 're creating anyone 's guy in the integration recognized her and that 's the workers but but if you would you be happy to accept a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be good and like this clearly like for example when it comes to leave sweeping the seasonal variations to so how all of those sort of variables are built into it will be useful so can I think the resolution that we single thought on remedial okay we don 't need you to move a resolution will just to add another one I 'm sure counselor mange and gene will be more than happy to accept some weird in that asks for a report on under the roads and footpaths undertake channel sweep and rubbish and little collection to agreed standards that a report the a detailed report analyzing the the increase CS ours and identifying these hotspots be provided to the SE committee do you wanted them David how long do you need it like the first study committee of the new council we 'll try and talk about on have to go and talk to the stuff but they would be able to pull the frame work together by that time anyway yeah oh yeah okay and I think it would be useful to circulate that run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been an issue that 's been raised repeatedly through community rules yeah but I think that after it 's been to see it would be good yeah right do we need big that weird you John Porter can analyze something concrete customer service on end and the and the key hot spots yep there 's some yeah they are separate yes all you 've got over and there you that 's something okay all right i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye or there 's a place they know that 's care,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Changes,wGSnE5occZ4,20160908,662.34,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1589,seven rates issues more properties affected by district plan changes who 's is coming up to the table for that you 're you 're you 're here you 're moving there the recommendation I 'll second Dutch are there any questions Yanni I think it definitely sets the precedent in the sense that there are inevitably movements in property prices in between our three year league general revaluations so some people end up paying rates that are greater than you might expect compared with any current market value and vice versa for other people so there 's always winners and losers at the margin I guess the difference here is that because the particular circumstances of these guys in the northwest review area were very extreme it was very unusual the valuation more or less traveled just before the evaluations sorry the market value that the assess market value more let 's trebled because of the signaled planning change really just prized the 2013 revaluation and then not long after because the planning signals changed the value went right back down again the extent of those volatility and the fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revaluation are really very unusual so yes it does set a precedent in principle but the the scale of the change I think makes that precedent risk relatively low I had 100 enough early this week from someone in a similar area just slightly north of that asking same question hey look my property has experienced a similar sort of price volatility do i qualify for this permission and the my initial look at that suggested no it 's not worth taking that further because there 's only hasn 't subsequently changed in the way that these guys have so I 'm sure there 'll be a little bit of noise and churn of people asking the question but I don 't think there 's an enormous risk of a lot of unexpected costs here and we haven 't yet had anyone turn up saying that the evaluations gone up since the day and they 'd like to pay more jury question as committee the combination tool comes on the second bullet point that is response to a bhatia resident Association when the staff were ready report back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drafted and it 's ready to be considered at next Thursday 's councilman a Thursday okay thank you very good add clean Apple each social surroundings so if it sees the conversation so yeah just to meet us well say like this I think that 's always the first port of call that yeah the tax system is the tax system that 's just the way it goes I think though I mean that that particular wording didn 't come from the legislation at all but I think it does yeah the like I say the taxes tax and everyone 's got to pay tax in to the extent that this and overs and unders and it 's more or less fair on different people is just what it is and also the other part of that I guess is that property ownership is inherently a type of investment and that there are tax implications for that that might beneficial or not depending on what happens to you individually I guess so the the counterpoint to that though is that within the legislation is also this provision for race remissions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our long-term plan the fair and equitable remission is specifically designed to enable you to respond to situations that you consider to be extraordinary so the best recent example is probably the March 14 flooding around flocked and we 're quite quickly after the event there was a special permission given to those people to treat them in a way that was very similar to reds owners because they couldn 't live in their homes and in many instances couldn 't progress with their own recovery until we done our own bunting and other recovery work so the facilities there the the I guess the point in asked us a question is the legislation does allow for that sort of flexibility at the margin for extraordinary circumstances hell so Steve will though your staff recommendation still the same that they 're not be in remission in fact you 're all sorry acknowledging that these are quite extreme extraordinary circumstances in these cases or particularly in the northwest Steve 's actually opinion on that as an important in this case it 's it 's the council who makes the decision on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be balanced by those sorts considerations there 's all sorts of arguments you can go one way or the other you know you could say that well the signal was there the market value change was there people could choose to sell their property if they want to realize a profit you know you could get that there 's a continuum of views and you can get quite extreme or the other I think Peters rights it 's your guys call about how extraordinary the circumstances are and whether those the other considerations make it in your view worthy over a special remission the way in which I consider this become such an issue for everyone as we only do it one day every three years and we drug it in and it 's of course that 's going to change almost immediately thereafter so it 's right on the day but it 's only right again I 'm three years later when we do it again and so that 's the nature of the way in which we assess the Texas struck at that time and in situations such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been moved and seconded I 'll put that notion all those oh sorry yep yeah no the place they will our attacks which you must pay if i look at the comparative kind of example over the red zone there we tried to push for residents to have rates for emissions here and there were some granted in some circumstances and some parts of the course he as we 've heard but there is a line on page 419 which talks about but if they were inhabitable and what I 'd like to suggest is that 's actually a really subjective term it can be hard to measure habitability but there were many residents left by virtue of that unresolved insurance

the rights issues for the properties affected by the district plan changes which is the paper before us so you 're off topic okay either so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go into habitability and everything you can say that it 's not fair to give these people a rates remission okay when others didn 't but I don 't want you to spend time talking about then why others didn 't well for me its context that sits behind no the reso it 's not relevant debates have to be relevant to the decision okay that 's not relevant to the well I disagree but thats you know but I 'm I 'm the chairs yeah yeah okay so carry on yeah well I it 's some put it this way I can 't reconcile this recommendation of other circumstances which I do that 's it yep right yeah an appropriate way to deal with what is an extraordinary circumstance and the reason that obstacle does and make the comment that actually I don 't think two wrongs make a right so actually I I firmly believe that this is the right approach given the exceptional circumstances and given the dramatic changes that happened but in no way does this my support for this today take away from what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extraordinary circumstances that we 've debated in the past and actually lost like schools in the red zone for example or people in the red zone living without services but I think this is actually about doing the right thing fair and equitable to the people that are in this situation and I think it calls into question how we do evaluations more than anything around speculative investment of land to be resigned or was owned and I think that 's a much wider conversation but for today I actually think of this is and this is the right thing to do which has well support it and it shouldn 't be seen as being done at the expense of other decisions that we 've made not to do things that I believe would have been fairly equal to others right and he 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye aye those opposed say no oh no record that one yes yep that 's fine then Lovingston oppose this your show I can 't believe I did me apologise I do apologise gyani other foreign colonists,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Committee so I 'm happy to take any general questions questions Danny then Jimmy when we gave some role for dcl around master plans I 'm just kind of wondering where that 's kind of got to and yeah I guess mindful of areas like along with village master plan which you know may be an opportunity for dcl so just wanted yeah what 's going with the master plan yep so we 've got work and way at the moment we 're really we we are reviewing commercial opportunities those suburban master planes and we 're working with council start on that right do we have a time frame or a prioritization of which ones they 're not prioritized in any way other than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oval pendant on long-term pain okay and just the other one was on 2.1 for on page 35 you 've basically done a review of council contracts for street cleaning and maintenance and it says the deep cleaners underway this was something that came up at our community board the other day because we thought actually that 's quite a good idea given the number of complaints we 're getting around maintenance issues and we were mindful not to request dcl to do more work given you know maybe the capacity issues but actually undertaking getting a similar process undertaken just to deal with I guess that perception that things weren 't happening around maintenance so so we 've not physically undertaking the maintenance but as part of the work we 're doing with respect to regeneration and work with the community with the A 's very closely with council staff and contractors and sort of combined fashion to look at improving some of the issues that have been raised and not all those issues a new bright and fully resolved gear and we 're still working on those but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council affair 50 talk is there a sort of the process outline that you 've been to that you can make available to our community board or what kind of key lessons learned well yeah I think there are some learnings we would be happy to yeah damn Jimmy and then for football yeah yep it 's completed in its draft format and going through internal checks at the moment reading for submission jus the next council meeting all the ward one after yes no November yeah we 're gonna we 're planning to bit of that date yes well I mean September the 22nd as the last yes and that 's the one we 've glycans arm we work into that agenda good amazed good man Oh Paul it was just more around suburban master plans just carry on from yannis points raised when you 've got an area will we do not own any land 280 help activate what other ways do you see us been able to have an intervention too if she 'd bring about some change in an area do you have any sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been doing so I guess we 've had some interesting conversations and with some of the business community within some suburban shopping centers and one a particular which sets outside a suburban master plan area and it 's looking to sort of just understand map wilson what 's there at the moment and how that how the various offerings complem the tendencies complement each other I mean there 's an interesting sort of thing going on with with with some of the banks and and how they look to rationalize their offerings and those can be quite a significant cornerstone cannon to some of those local communities so we are in discussion with some of those types of organizations to understand what their long-term thinking is and some of that 's based on the confidence of all of other development opportunities in those areas to whether they withdraw to consolidate their own businesses so what we found is it 's a lot about the conversations were having within those business communities within those centers and we 've started in you know in two key areas to date but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanks Rob just to let you know receiving some strong feedback in the quick one section 2.1 point for over the basics the rubbish bins so you know where that line is between personal and council responsibility i 'm not sure but I we continue to see pictures of overflowing rubbish bins I 'm not saying it 's our fault but we present being presented with that I 've tried to push on CL proof bends it through the board for the whale pool so we have something already but it 's more so just to let you know that I think it 's the things like the bins in the toilets if we can get that white with our staff that would go a long way too yeah and I think we 're having to be it 's actually when you start understanding the detail of some of the issues because of one case you know a particular group have put in place their own system right with with an arrangement that doesn 't hi or as easy for the contractors to clear yep so so so to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah we need to understand sort of the detail of the issue so yeah I 've seen the pictures that have been put up by a particular writer community group show get flame rubbish bins and there are some issues that there that we can easily probably fix with you with contractors but not all of them is straightforward yeah okay yeah thanks okay bit and then tell me just just when we we get to deciding about some of the levels of service rubbish tins and things like that last time around there were sort of installations that others thought we 're quite appropriate for the area but still allowed seagulls and other things to get in and get it materially up I wonder next time around camp can we when we 're looking at the rubbish tins and cleaning bits and pieces around the area have a heads up first before we commit to any particular design sure yeah yep and Tim I don 't think you just under the quick ones to point one point for the Pokemon down the should have I think its outstanding it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra hooks to try and get bums on seats or feed it or not ' through the door nothing for a sixty dollar investment and I know they 're there for a different reason but hit 500,000 that is absolutely outstanding so um yeah that 's if you can only if your fleece even just a hundred of them that that 's good well done thank you thank you okay good okay great would

Changes,ldNuqHuZwg4,20160907,777.41,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1975,speed limit changes oh now the speed limit join hands with me do we have some legal advice on this one would you like to come to the table as well just while we 're waiting I think there 's a difference of view or two what can and can 't be done so I 'd like to sort of surface that but what we did a point that I 'd really like to make is that the staff recommendations weed out for consultation but the feedback that came from those staff recommendations before it came to the report came to our board and the consultations showed that there was quite a willingness of people who lived in some of these streets and like for example hallsville Junction Road that did want the speed limit brought down to what air community board is recommended so and we weren 't aware at the time and at the of the cross boundary issues with Salman district council and the Christchurch City Council so rightly or wrongly we weren 't that aware of that matter that air community board meeting when we when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that again so what we 're sure we 're off we weren 't aware that Rafe 's road and and and marshes road were boundary roads between the Christchurch City Council and Selwyn District Council and there 's a memo that came out on the sea the the seventh of sep tember from from ryan and pointing out that these has been no prior agreement to vary and some of these speed limits with the Selwyn District Council so we weren 't aware of that when we didn 't make the recommendations but we didn 't listen to the community and the holes will residents sociation and in the alberti a resident Association area have been very very very very vocal for many years but we don 't very often it 's a three year cycle when we get to actually review speed limits isn 't it Ron historically they 've been reviewed on it to turn to you excite there so that 's where it and we have been gradually bringing these speed limits down but with the rapid expansion of and development in in the halls malaria and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where we wanted to focus so run and we felt that some of the speed limits that were being proposed because they did actually meet the criteria of the day as far as what you can and can 't do that we 've been subsequently you know made well aware of is that we still felt for safety reasons and in common sense from a community Boynton board point of view and listening to the community that we felt obliged to actually make those recommendations so it hasn 't them we weren 't just saying just I 'll just let 's do it you know there was a quite a lot of things logic from the submissions and the community feedback that we 've got for that what 's more fundamental than that we have in front of us on page 289 3299 yes their staff recommendations on all of these streets so the recognition from the start relates to all of those streets yes the board recommendation after listening to what the community wanted and has been constant advocacy of the Wrexham were convinced to lower speeds in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes to everything tight limits all we 've done is change for numbers yes and those staff recommendation is this so if we go back to the staff recommendations we are actually making a call on those streets viewers so it 's not like we 've suddenly added new recommendation we 're simply lowering the speed limit on four of them now I understand from this memo that came out which wasn 't said at the community board but which came out yesterday late that two of these our boundary roads with so one district and we have to get their permission you can 't we just ask their permission wouldn 't that do the trick so if I go back a step to the staff recommendations part of part of the issue here is that to make the changes that we may in some cases we made proposed quite a small change to a long street and to do that legally we had to revoke everything that 's on the street and put things back in a slightly different way and so if you take marshes road which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred meters of the road at one end but we had to revoke everything which is a five kilometer long road and the issue the crux of the issue is that the change there 's brought about through the record and Wigram amendment changes the five kilo meter long section we know that was consulted on was a small hundred meter section at one end and if you looked at the maps that went out to consultation they show no changes proposed so if anything so so going the crux of issue of being the consultation the consultation that we did in essence highlighted that there wasn 't a proposed to some of these roads and that 's that 's a lot of the reason why there is an issue with the consultation that 's occurred for the record and Wigram changes can I just ask on that one run wasn 't the area that extra area currently a 50k zone anyway and has been so for some months you might be referring to holes were junction right so okay so just to explain their horrible Junction Road resolution Matt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per hour there 's a section that the speed limit is currently 80 kilometers are now there 's been some new development that 's occurred on that and as a result staff of held that at 60 kilometres per hour under TMP and the staff recommendation is to essentially adopt that temporary 60 such that all portable Junction Road has a consistent 60 kilometres per hour speed limit the record and Wigram recommendation is to change the whole of horse Hall Junction Road including the fitness currently 80 aims the bit that 's currently 60 to change the whole of that 250 kilometres of area we have only dome consultation on the smallest section that 's 80 h currently if i go back to council of those original question about and the issue with the boundary roads of i notified sellin district council of the effect that the Czarist there 's a community board recommendation to change the speed limit and their advice is consistent with our advice which would be that for a speed limit on a boundary road to be legally effective it requires a matching resolution from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have our resolution from them for the original consultation no because the reason for that is the changes that fall under the staff recommended don 't change the sections that are boundary roads I was only occurred as a result of the extinctions through the Riccarton Wigram amendment that 's brought on to play the changes Jason Terry boundary right so essentially you it would put it puts the speed limit in a very unenforceable situation with us basically to speed limits on these roads and it doesn 't make sense not to have the conversation before the speed limit has changed they have how do we fix us so do we go back out for another consultation and engage sir one in that process absolutely that 's that 's my recommendation yeah it incidentally there 's a there 's an opportunity here this has been brought to my attention after this consultation that there 's another change on sparks road sort by a member of the wicked and Wigram community board if we did some extra consultation it would actually introduce an opportunity to bring that into play as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just in relation to the recommendations i got at the bottom of the recommendation it start going to take additional consultation on the speed limit on those full road and then sparks road have you got a condom and around that one because of the election we think that we could we think we could beat we could think we could do that consultation and be back to the first board meeting after the election in November yeah okay oh that that 's a good resolve so what is the what is the what is the wording of a resolution that would achieve that that council adopt the staff recommendation for this setting a bit staff undertake additional consultation on the speed limit but we 're accepting the speed limits in the reptile mcgraw ward a week cancel atop the staff recommendation for seating and speed limits an erection warm in the winter or whatever and then we let staff and and to take additional consultation the speed limit have a whole school junction road as opposed to as well and she waits road masters road and went on when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its facts people and a people up and report back to the wicked on Wigram community board it 'll be the Rickett and what gruel no Rick ignored before but does that mean that we 're adopting the changes that were decided by the community that they wanted to be lower no it means that we 're adopting this innovations which don 't go as far as what the community yeah so that in the interim what so we 're going to change the speed limit potentially twice keep down young and bronze recommendation unknown on the bottom of his memo um they did yesterday have that the council adopt the staff recommendation and and not the Rickett Wiggum community boards amended recommends ease and that staff undertake additional consultation and the speed limit of all four Junction Road kaif 's Road marshes road and win cox road west of noises and with the addition of spikes has just been has just been mentioned to be thrown in there so that 's I think that 's the direction but it means it says in report back to the community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be saying additional consultation on a further reduced speed limit on these because it work witness we 're asking you to do a specific task which is the further consultation on the on a further reduce speed limit for these and his plan throne would be much appreciated a community board by the end of november 2016 yes yes yeah because there are a whole pile of other ones as well as a dictionary of a meeting but a formal meeting bubble a node in them yeah but that 's the swearing on okay before just before the end of december what does in this one before the end of december 2016 very good thank you thank you and thanks to your help with that because it was going to be a tricky one so really appreciate that thanks good alright so that

handled the process of consultation but it so we 're really really pleased to well to say that we 've nailed the whole the halls will domain for for the current funding and what we 're recommending is that we also proceed with when am night stream and hopefully it can be constructed with the development contributions because that was the staffs after second round the consultation it was the staffs the night stream one with the Stars preferred option but after the the well-attended extraordinary meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power center and we came up with the recommendation so we 're very very pleased with that sounded like it was a very good community engage hunt it was indeed a lot of people involved absolutely and I think at the end of the day even though there was people that were totally opposed to it being there and I think once the deputations were with felt from the wider community that they some that first level of frustration i think is is waned hopefully yeah and the effect at the that the pros and the gates will be part of be involved in the in the design of the facility as well is a very very very good idea and we 're just welcoming that too well I 'd say that it said uh this this challenging areas level sorry for so it 's more for beginners in it so maybe maybe you 'll be doing the fish no I 'm going to do enemy nothing fears bit yeah yeah I 'm definitely not doing the zip line at the crash it should be it your back lu laa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pink oh my can I just ask you about like with now the night stream one being suggested is coming from the development contribution to the funding hell reliable how reliant can we be that the be sufficient development contributions to actually note support there or are you also going to be look at looking at some other funding program for example through the LTP yeah the Christian so do that so they don 't think of the funding that 's good on yep so you 'd like to move it all right and seconded by Jimmy chin very good you can have a discussion about it oh did you have a question and Jimmy moro vendor fee based only the difference is the location of hospital country manner as evil unto ages of people pay particular concern whether any kind of social behavior was essential anywhere after now matter the stable start working together closely is the majority on the hospital community as well as also at remain as you good during the other stage of design in the stage and also because the stub recommend is the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a potential nice reprieve over a current it actually tasted the needs in the house where the domain spatial they have a figure of the whole street domain when they have r280 written a summation hungry in a 64 nopee for their fifty-eight percent so is the morning half fifty-eight percent EG but nice Trina is 71 there 's the second one you know twenty five percent 50 so especially holes were areas one of the most of your faster cause population area so these are too kind of the scape Hartford or face-illy agents me the current in the future need so this wider in a counselor at the table I 've like to support this one but in the community Paula me Gino I thought whether the locations time for what so I change mm I fully support this one get them there Yanni I think it 's fantastic that the skate parks are going into these local communities there 's been huge growth in these areas and I know that for a long time the local community have requested more youth facilities and I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just go past Washington way and have a look at how many people use it of actually all ages so these are really positive things that communities actually really appreciate they 're good for families they 're good for children and I think you know hopefully the concerns have been mitigated so I think it 's great that instead of getting one there 's two and I think taking out of development contributions is a fantastic way given the developments happen in this area to actually contribute back to the gap in these facilities so I 'm really really supportive of this and I think it will be really popular with the people that use it thank you Yanni and from quoted your enthusiasm for these projects going back quite a number of years in fact i can remember you actually being the driving force behind the Washington way so I think I 've certainly taken some inspiration from your enthusiasm about these projects the capsule are going and I just I hadn 't quite finished I just the other point I wanted to make was that I think this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and looked at a number of sites for selection where it 's the difference in summer is that the community would buy see top is only one site and that was I think at the heart of some of those issues so i think it 's it 's really important when we go through these processes to have an open mind about with a bit sites are p.m. clean I 'm gonna let you finish the mic and the other was just weather we 've had a conversation over using dcs to actually build community other community gathering points like halls and new subdivisions we had that this came up the other day over new subdivision in the city with a developer 's i actually required to build or contribute towards community halls so i 'll just leave that there for your consideration and peps for those who come back in the next term oops that 's a piece of work we can look at as well I hope you take note of our community board submission when it comes to you on developing contributions policy and okay I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this whole skate park selection apart from the amount of hours that the staff have spent on it and her have consistent they 've been because they 've got another process yet to go through in terms of their halls for domain and was the submissions from the kids and they were totally wonderful and it was so lovely to hear kids of all ages talking about what they wanted in their community and how important these things were to their community and at the moment they have to go to Preble t 'en and they have the reliant on the appearance to take them there and how they just wanted to be able to go and and the issue of how they maintained the the skate park at themselves and looked after it and of the whole era of respect that they have for various people within the skate park and how that sort of police 's itself and so they were amazing submissions to listen to it was a lovely evening even though the heating wasn 't on and they happen and it was fantastic to see so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear that so that process was just lovely so i will put that motion all those in favor say aye aye those opposed say no it 's Carrie thank you

NZ,NZ,Christchurch City Council,Christchurch City Council,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZETwErnCvvgbvBbnnHfyxA,08.09.16 - Item 18 - Berm Trees in Subdevisions,sqx07ve9I5I,20160907,481.629,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1352,then trees and subdivisions just around the corner from where I look yes yes so I 'm so what we come across I suppose is that there 's different policies for different people so developers have one sort of policy and then council have another policy and what seems to be happening is that developers plants and trees that look really great when they 're little and help them sell their properties but then that when the trees grow big they become a very expensive problem for council damaging driveways berms curbs fences that kind of thing so we 've come up with a recommendation as opposed that that there 's an integration between those different things so that we can avoid these problems and save the council a whole lot of remediation our Pauline I 'm very surprised that we don 't have the integration at the moment so my wishes how all of these trees and question I tells it stopped abilities be nuns or about or less than 10 years I think yeah so that about 10 years old that can someone help us out on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haha i would have thought this is the really integral part good here it seems and it is a truncated report we could branch out until you press dawn of these tons of us do team mates committee here you can take a leaf out of the book are you able to help no forgive me but you were going out on a limb me we live the alien it is very young subdivision yeah i 'd be surprised if it 's over 10 years last time I see you 've got out of the ability to alter the infrastructure design standards in a way so we can take that recommendation and put it to the team that 's working within the date of birth weight cutting up engaging that submission on the thing so we can integrate that too and we I think the delegation said any major changes need to come back to you but will report periodically so you can pick up that recommendation given the arbiters just make sure that we do a line if we don 't write but but I think that what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a subdivision goes on there has to be this you know consideration of the type of trees we will pick them so that they are aligned yeah because it also picks up the operation of those trees and maintenance so you know we are evenly involved in history season yeah are all these it 'd be good yeah i mean i love i love literally in the next subdivision which is much older then the one we 're talking about because i did ask when when I saw Westhaven which part it was and I have to say that the that haven 't living in a subdivision that 's been designed by a by a Oh buddy called landscape architect as opposed to an engineered subdivision as chalk and cheese there are little pocket parks everywhere it 's it 's very leafy you know lots of trees lots of grass lots of you know and it 's just it is such a big difference to live on earth and something that 's been you know really thought about for what it 's going to be like developed in the long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they look good you 've got to actually plant trees that are going to work with the infrastructure that 's around them because they get clean and then fell thank you we had deputations from two different streets in the subdivision there 's also boot Dale Street person on wheel teams tipped out over you know brighter so that these are non earthquake-damaged streets it 's costing the city a lot of monies when if you check the tree policy you finally appears to be a disconnect between what it says over ensuring trees are the appropriate size to the burma cetera and what we uncovered was the RMA process and the idea is so that 's you know we think this is more than just about the subdivision of hazzard city wide implications its rate payer money which we need to yeah ensures bit of spit so yep yep no they need a report on their door no no we 've got we 've got a memorandum and I 'm just going to suggest by way of process that and future when these reports are circulated that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful to have them tap Done together rather than remember there actually is we 've got a memo on that on the thirty-first of august and felt or thinks injury for bringing this to you and your bull to bring this to our attention and i just want to check with dave that when when we actually look at that the standards will it will they hold biodiversity strategy be part of it because it seems to in this game at all which this don 't ok but what i need to do is just I 'm just about to see an email off to the staff member now and just say look we need to get that integrated so we 've got the alignment of them so yeah I 'm sorry I don 't know what 's in there at the moment in detail and I don 't know how much has been considered but their document the IDS has been put together by a collective group of staff so it 's not actually one group or the other but we 've now got a good way to manage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ document rather than a than a aesthetic document so i 'm not sure that they 'd pull it and integrate all their other policies as appropriate things done yeah did you want to say something else oh it was just a just a guess or just another point is posed it that did come to like when i was driving around these the subdivision having a look is that the booms are very very narrow that barely 50 centimetres wide and you put a great big tree in them so maybe there 's something via tater to look at that if there are minimum width you know they have to be a meter meter of grass to be worth putting a tree and because otherwise you just you guarantee problems and if you 've got a plant a big tree in a tiny little strip of grass and it 's mmm they looks only two they look weird yeah it might be with them doing a sort of again a workshop on in terms of some of these subdivision designer shoes yeah yani but it hasn 't come back three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it i 'll have to look i thought it got approved but I thought the giving committee may have had delegated authority beer but I 've check it may come back through as part i think it 's kind of the council yeah and i think it would be really important that if we need to make changes around this or some weird it would be good to just tie that on if possible I mean there 's also think there 's a lot of other things in there that I can see maybe a workshop or something would be good because it was very technical hmm delegation so that it can be done on a continuing basis yeah all right so with someone like to move the motion david glenn of put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Minutes,KL_Ew9OD7QU,20160907,437.419,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1231,can we draw your attention to the manuka cottage manuka cottage turned up to meeting at which the board recommended the design and build of the new- cottage on Cornelius O 'Connor reserve the new cottage turned up with them about 15 of its some supporters members and activists in within it was actually a joyful meeting at which we came to the decision on the future of manuka cottage after six years or nearly six years and it was wonderful that there they now have a view of the future permanent home in sight and the other thing I wanted to talk about just briefly was traffic engineering and still giving us some concern on our board and we look forward to the employment of the replacement traffic engineers that might help us to get some long outstanding work going we have been feeling a bit fraught about some traffic engineering issues in our ward for almost a year now and it would be good if we made some progress yeah all right I agree with counselors Kendra that 's nothing to do with the quality of staff they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to address some major issues brought up by the residents in our ward no yep no oh there 's a few things I was going to mention as well one later you 're considering about the repair strategy thought South library and just to say that we had the staff come along a seminar workshop whatever it was and that was really good i don 't even know the difference um but um night and i agree with the recommended option um piece maybe october so we didn 't discuss it as a board but i thought it seemed the most sensible as they explained it and there was a couple of other things we had Christine glance from across South community gardens come and talk to us she wanted to actually give probably an hour long presentation but we hid just try and squeeze her in 15 minutes that go extended I don 't know how long and she has a wealth of knowledge this woman and she showed us data like a PhD it was incredible of the tons of vegetables and all the things they make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of stuff she also told us about how people use their garden to all this space to leave their rubbish behind and also things like tires because people find those things really expensive to get rid of and they take their stuff and take responsibility for it so it might be something to sort of but and I consider how we can assist in some way that kind of thing but also she was talking about having a more longer term vision across the city for sort of community gardens she achieved like to have her knowledge sort of used in a in a beat away I guess and and she knows a lot of she 's gotten sort of 25 to 30 years of experience and she was talking about having sort of sustainable go over the different parts of the city and actually having a plan so I 'm we would recommend that she come and talk two counts some stage and extreme properly to tell you everything that she knows not everything well the top of what she does yeah and the other thing I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just worried resolved to put through the remainder of our funding for the last financial year for the Hong hey lights for the for the basketball court Lakers is the kids that play basketball you see them all the time when you drive past I 'm a this road so and we were very very pleased to be able to put around sixteen thousand dollars roughly towards it on projects um yeah and we were delighted that you got delegations to pull your community center and we do hope that that 's its president for the rest of us and in terms of getting delegations to cover and work for our own projects it 's associated with things we don 't know turning up here sometimes really worthwhile yeah place it felt weird to hear that Carolyn and the Melly just touched on important point about how the different community gardens in the city should really be coordinated or assess council being across them so principally note that we have that workshop which has been offered pristine progress that the council backing off a little bit from sustainable Christ to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give yourself we have it at workshop I 'm hope I hope that we can can in fact because I don 't think there is any backing off I think there 's a there 's a lot of different outreaches it 's really about in being altogether so and I think when we have that workshop will realized how much else is happening yeah I what ought to get us going to make a quick comment about for example that Monica coach which Carol and refer to I just think many ways maneuver to cottage and then Strickland 's regards me they 're like exemplar projects and like I applaud the board for being so so they 've persevered so well to get this up and running and I think it 's an excellent investment from the capital endowment fund there 's no question wait so thank you for for your work yeah Pauline are you so just on community garden lady the sheer member robz the Christchurch yes yes shoe in Judaism for a long time usually cheapest and three times on the 036 bit separate occasions she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn up here but

Albans when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with board members to do that together it was really good outcome so we 'll be doing that with the community okay and my last question is around regeneration I mean is there some potential to look at this site because it 's such a large site for a regeneration plan yeah and I think everything needs to be considered and but what is best for for the area I 'm so obviously with a large site we just don 't want to put a building on there and that 's that 's it 's we need to have a look at what can be done and it will be considered during the process okay so we add a resolution that asks for for ditch that that the shirley pop annoyed community board what what the air and then bold and that the community board is fine because there 's two that the community board talk was starved around the potential for regeneration planning and this area yeah i think that bit is that good enough waiting for what we 're talking about you because that would have to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outline regeneration plan but we can and it may well be that a regeneration plan will just cut through a lot of red tape but include the community and a really exciting decision-making process so that could be a good one tunity can take the opportunity to add just talking about the Sun Albans community center process where we had the community rips maybe half a dozen of those in three community board members on there and it 's a reasonable time commitment from the community they came to to our meetings we had about six or seven there was a lot of meetings during that process and and I just want to thank all those people who came out and gave up their time and in the meetings were actually quite fun in the console staff were fantastic in their support and facilitated by Phil driver who was who just managed the whole song beautifully and it just and we just became more more excited as the process mean too long because we 've got traction and that 's only taken what five months once we got the wheels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get there but once it go go yes I just want to thank the staff and also that all the community members that gave up their time in in your time do Mike rewards you and and just recommend that process and we 'll put that up and hopefully replicate that and surely because you 've got to take the people whiskey and then they actually value what they end up with some they user so it becomes successful yep history of poverty gives an authority to do anything in everything and I 'm not quite sure and I just wonder whether it should be and I wasn 't sure what the delegations given to the community on the stain of almonds but if we just pressed it by as per the st. Albans community center because in theory with that you could make contracts you spend all the money we don 't want haven 't met them again they 've done so that we as staff are able to come work out what the parameters around that allegation is because it just says miss Syria priority and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i try to find out before the meeting that i just didn 't have the right people are just one basically the same ova Jack seem to work or are we happy with that and then I compared those up the despotic start yeah you put a break that 's after authority as per the scent Albans community center yeah Johnny um just one of stuff could just explain what the current delegations are around management of the facilities like who currently has that well it 's just a moment the guy should have east lyme unity borders so is that likely to be complete before any substantial work happens on the chilly community center and if not would it not FF side then would it not be better to just do that as part of that what do you have a model with actually went through that with the st. Albans transitional center we put it out for tinder in a community group one that tinder and they 've been successfully running there for about a year I 've just over a year yeah so look I 'm really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be part of the community board relationship with its local community there 's no need for the City Council as a whole to be making these decisions anymore great great model so just the question when the delegations are we resolve I mean that 's fine if we if we take this approach so I just flagged our board may like to start will import some reports to on other facilities follow shoes at night we do know how can I just take the timing around no I wasn 't briefing so this was covered in the briefing and we 're coming back with a complete framework around us and we hope to do council to mess up and start kickoff out and watched immediately but so by the end of the year should be in place very good so I think that that Pauline would like to move this motion and I think Glenn would like to second us again is very very helpful of you bleed so i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried it 's lovely thank you,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

home last night I was in town looking after myself making sure well quite a temper meeting this morning early and that the roads didn 't call me cause any issues to me but I told I actually was worried about you when I saw the we 're the last night I made an early decision yesterday and i cry why you well a lot of these things in here about communities in action and that 's what about resilience is all about and what our community I hopefully and is about with our reserve management committees in there are the remnants from the reserve management committees there there are some minutes from a little river I we 're a community trust coming to meet with us so it is about communities in action and things that we can do and if you explain things and to talk about things with the community they can often make the right decisions at the end so eminence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over all deal with a minutes first Andrew would like to move them and Tim would like to see in them I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and then we 've got cups a issue yes mmm Oh got just put them up on the screen understand you better presentation well know which is a couple of pictures and to show you what you cottage looks like just at the moment it 's just coming up there now and it is a council do I need to push us it is a council-owned building it was and it 's just gradually deteriorating fight majorly and with the community boards decision earlier in the year to ask for a report actually bought the community to a focus and what the community out of the woodwork really because for many many years we 've talked about come on we need to find a champion to move this little cottage along and get something happening with it is in a flood zone but it 's known as Jeannie 's cottage more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff recommendation has been a number of it was a poor process around the significance and engagement but now hopefully we 'll back on the right track and so the late there is a number of staff recommendations amended staff recommendations and the board 's recommendations on the last page of which we were were looking for sport off so we got a picture there two arrows on the keyboard so yes this is just some pictures of the little cottage that some there 's just three of them there so it 's in quite poor disrepair at the moment need considerable amount of work on it may need lifting but excitingly the the community because they 're so enthusiastic and out about it have already had a project and had a clean up around it and made a world of difference it 's in opposite the recreation ground this alright yep say and so I 'd like to move the community board recommendation yep thinking goodbye Atem and if I can speak to that briefly yep so is the pictures that Pamela shown us this morning and doing nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a site right in the center of a corral right by the recreation ground but there that could have multiple uses it was in some ways unfortunate but in other way it 's fortunate that this landed on the community board table in the way that it did the fortunate thing about it is that it 's allowed for a conversation or a number of conversations to happen within the community about what future use might look like and certainly there are a number of community groups are talking about this this cottage been used as community space there 's talk of social enterprise opportunities other uses that would be good for both social and economic development in in a corrado to happen on this some on this central site so the community board recommendation essentially is requesting staff to to work through an expression of interest process but including working actively with those community groups a number of whom laid deputations to the community board meeting where this was discussed so that we get the opportunity to find out what all of the possibilities and opportunities are with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enterprise type you so certainly appreciate the support of counselors for this today so that that next piece of work can continue clearly there 's an urgency here because we 've got a piece of counseling property right in the center of a corolla that needs a future use and that needs some attention so certainly good to hear from pam that the community of already engaged in a working bee and some other activities to get the site tidied up so appreciate your support on this one today right um Yanni so I would just I don 't know you wanted to ask questions so we just started the debate so you should have put your hand out to ask questions if you sorry Annie I I should have known um but I didn 't that 's why I just wanted to clarify with out how it was on their significance and engagement policy because I don 't see it listed on there so it 's a really simple question there is a last report I think that you might have received no list of strategic a seat yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came back with a living yet it was just an oversight so all right well I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye aye those opposed no that 's carried thank you very much thank you we 'll move forward and hopefully we 'll have a bright shining cottage with a community involved in the next steps in thank you,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Hazard Assessment,mxOQE9pAWUk,20160829,3843.4,"Christchurch, New Zealand",10192,so we 're going to move directly now to item 14 and as I said to start to counsel before I 'm going to have to leave shortly but I 'll now the recommendation that we have from staffers there we received the report and request that staff provide a report back within one month to a council meeting detailing the programme of work that will be undertaken and response to the recommendations and the independent expert panels report and there is a notation there that the staff report a muttered a paragraph under the details for the council resolution which was relevant obviously to the presentation we 've had that limb notations following receipt of the peer review report be reviewed acknowledging the findings of the report would you like to Brendan speak to the proposal to come back with a report and peps give us an idea of the programme of work that would be undertaken I 'm not expecting you to advantage of thinking in their area but just to explain the process sure and in just a sovereign from ghd as well who 's lead this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process and also i 'm probably most importantly the learnings from that process that and we would look to and continue to apply to my time there positive engagement that 's occurred over their last couple of months and hopefully and Judith from our legal team as well and so in short the staff recommendation is based on receiving the final peer review on Thursday Friday last week and what we particularly mindful of in the lesser net and the peer review in fact includes is not to rush these decisions and we do need to move as quickly as we possibly can on this what we 've proposed and is to take the recommendations from the expert panel and the exterior panel are very clear and that the recommendations different from the findings in a gainer different from the suggestions for the 10 year review and in a explicitly state that the recommendations are the parts that they 're expecting that the council actions and we 've been working for some time on the basis of the draft reports and now having received the final report would like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to outline the programme of work that would give a fit to all of the recommendations from an expert panel peer review and likely and that would then be in a situation and by the end of the year or early in the new year of having completed what 's described by the fu panel is phase one and which would be the scientific report so we appreciate the position that run at the moment not quite at the position of having completed their robust scientific analysis to the level that we expect in all areas and end I think he runs an agreement that I 'm completing that piece of work and is the most critical part before we can move on two phases two and three including the recommendations from the Xperia P nor on the conversations with the community and in the need to have the conversations about adaptive responses and we think within a month as a reasonable time frame obviously the report back will also include and the issues that were noted in the team December resolution about the limitations but you also want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've had an alternative proposal around the limb notations in terms of that the proposal that just was was made that we form a partnership with the CCR you to ensure that they are fully engaged in the process which ultimately will lead to the development of new chapter coastal hazards chapter for our district plan once the replacement district planners in place can can you comment on that sure I think it 's just the expert panel and makes reference to kind of withdrawing planning eps and just to be clear and the tonkin the taylor report and as a effectively what will become the stage one scientific report and is a long way from planning applications and inclusion inclusion and there the district plane so and the order and council and removed the coastal hazards from the district plane and but we do still have an obligation and through the standard resource management it and processes and to restart that process as soon as practical i think the word again the OIC is but that would miss them after the replacement district cleaners and play it wouldn 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and also you need to start with stage one get the science right and then hit the the conversations and with the community and fate and stages two and three before you get to that level so that 's a submission I was asking was about the proposal to have a more partnership approach with the community rather than because we were under a pressure cooker in terms of time so it was a relief when the government agreed well last it to to withdraw oh absolutely so marsal em jumpin is Robert and that and just very briefly that kind of learning here is and you want to do this and with people and you want to make sure that the community has engaged all of us because and i think is tim said it 's been a very difficult time in everyone 's learning through so i certainly appreciate the understanding from the community and from CC are you in terms of the lessons that have been learned and have been mistakes and learnings and that have been made through this we don 't want to rush the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistakes or we were repeat mistakes of the past so our commitment and as to maintain and the engagement that we 've got and maybe on that point I 'll just asked Morris to talk about just briefly about the lessons that UNC are supplying or the next period thanks thanks for even more than happy to look I do have a number of slides Chris if you wanted to talk that through it just sort of talks through that the the the process undertaken and some of those some of my views i guess around the the lessons have been learned and what you might want to do and sort of consider go next well I 'm gonna have to go which is a shame look ugly and I think the the sorry minute man I 'd much rather be called Lee in a big thank you um I look I fully endorse that that there 's a process that 's been established and what I think it 'd be a crying shame is that if that process wasn 't built on yeah and it was continued momentum gained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there 's ongoing communication and that we don 't wait until until there 's a start of the the universe district plan review and when you start that process I think that 's the lesson that 's been learnt within kapiti they did wait and it was a big vacuum and void in between and that created problems and I guess I said you know orientation just the one other point that I wanted to make before I left if you could scroll up to the thing now I know that David 's got a different resolution than this which is different from this but I just I kind of wanted to put on the table I mean people can move it or thickened it or whatever I won 't be here but what I 've taken is the noting the recommendation of the peer review panel to that should say to remove the hazard Maps until the legal requirements New Zealand coastal policy statement to complete because the current meaning may be legally unsound which the quote from the report direct the chief executive to urgently review the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and report back to the next council meeting now that 's not a month that 's two weeks and the advantage of doing edge is that it you know I mean you can you can come to a council and say you know do this even though you legally can 't but actually if we legally can 't do something as a council then I don 't think we would actually be acting lawfully I mean we wouldn 't be acting in accordance with their obligations under the local government act but this directs the chief executive to do their urgent review and to report it back to the next council meeting I don 't think it has to wait until the programme of work reporters prepared because there are very clear considerations and they 're quite separate from the work that 's going to be ongoing but I 've just put that up there and I 'm going to leave the key to to chair the meeting I 'm sorry but I have a prior do you need to seek them no I can 't move no no okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I pulled up as if official move in a second right okay do you want to run through your slides all right look very more than happy to know that if there 's going to help that 's useful okay thank you and then we 'll take questions if it 's okay okay look I try and run through this as quickly as i can I just want to cover the broadly the process my observations of what 's good well and what to consider and some of my thoughts as well on what you might want to try to consider doing next so that 's just a reminder where we started and and the key here is that in terms of reference was developed with the community to look at the science as well as the rig a tree and legal framework that was undertaken and you know I think that was that was just an important conclusion that came out of that engagement process with with the community and look my role and thank you for acknowledging me this morning but i have to point out that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the community and with council and councils in fact even we 've had a discussion with with government and MFE just on monday and i think that 's been really good a process of of bringing different parties together to work through work with the community developed terms of reference appointed peer review panel and support the panel to deliver its final peer review this is now complete and and I think that 's a key message that we have not had the opportunity to put more broadly ups the community yet so just since the last time that I was here talking with you as as elected members we had gone through the peer review panel has been appointed there was a draft or a peer review poor time taken and it finally review and it 's been heard by council here today what I wanted to do was give you a flavor of what 's happened in between and I think I think this is you know my view is this is important because it 's setting the groundwork and framework for how you can continue this going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know developed a broader understanding of the science and the rika tree drivers so so when starting that that dialogue discussion with the community reference group and I you know even look back six months and in some of those meetings we had with the community and also I guess with with councils and Environment Canterbury and councils here there 's a there 's a broader understanding and particularly understanding about the rib which drivers ansel process that 's occurred that 's led to the situation that 's here I think the council 's in the community have started to come together and I say the word started and I was fortunate enough to to be involved an a meeting where the community reference group that I 've been working with and the council and Environment Canterbury and councillors a number of you here we 're at and I thought that was very encouraging to see and I saw a lot of consensus and a lot of sort of a lot of willingness to engage through that process and I think that 's fantastic and I 'd like to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been consensus building even around the findings of the panel now believe me it 's quite an unusual process to ask a group of experts to provide an expert opinion and then have the ability to review that and provide comment back to them that is a unique situation and and one that I think actually really helped through this process because what I saw was in undertaking that that looking at that draft and feeding that back was some consensus building and consensus-building around what the panel had to say and their opportunity to sort of feedback into that willingness khobor I 've already sort of talk to and and also you know helping to shape that and it 's at that national direction it was really only one discussions had with government around it but I 'm starting to see that sort of willingness so this is great that the situation is happening here in Christchurch is actually being looked at and being considered amongst other communities across the country and also national government but fundamentally is recognition this is only one step forward towards a better understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communities and the actions that council communities and residents might want to take and i would suggest want to take collectively i put this up because the current reminder for me of what it was like six months ago because i stood up in a number of meetings with a number of people that were here and there was outrage there was frustration and there was a lot of no unity really in terms of kind of general direction forward and it looked a lot like that to me in terms of different members all in the room now I wouldn 't like to suggest that what 's happened now is that there is absolute unity going forward but i hope that most people would agree that that at least most parties are of pointing all to it together in a sort of similar direction what I don 't believe is that perhaps all parties are as far ahead as what they 'd like to be right now but I think this is a good building block to start from a concern I have is that is that really it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this process and there is a much wider community out there that need to be involved or aware or understand and be given the opportunity to to collaborate through what happens next we 've heard from one of those groups here obviously this morning so my key messages don 't stop please build on the process and collaborate to build mutual trust and broader consensus on the direction forward is probably my main parting message and some things just to consider in doing so is you 've got a community reference group so we 've had three members of CC are you as part of that community reference group and it 's been others from diamond harbour in a Curragh and in other parts of of the community as well be part of that group now it 's representative of the it 's been impacted through this report but it 's not necessarily represented all Christchurch it 's experienced informed community committed group and I thank them for that time and effort they put in and all someone to thank the time and effort that the expert panel had put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five experts having to come together in this way to produce what they 've been what they 've done and enter I for one you know a grateful and receive a report so keep in mind what a thing thing I would like you to also kind of keep in mind is there is a risk though that this Leonard group of who have worked with in the last six months have grown have a much more aware of the rig ettore frame with their needs to be sort of worked within as well as the kind of science and other issues around it I guess my issue did you know something is a potential risk is and keep in mind is there a growing gap between that group of learning people and the rest of the community and something that perhaps needs to be considered finally this is all about natural hazards and you know the hazards and risks that need you know that that need to be understood and that they need to be understood and owned by the community without this it 's always going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groups all for councils to make to make decisions so I would you know again I encourage you this is a broad discussion around multiple heads it 's not just something here to do with sea level rise the final two slides I 've got as one is just a reminder of we sat down as a community reference group and work through what was out of scope as part of this terms of reference I just want to remind some broad healings of what was kind of out of scope and that 's you know those are the actions to address the risk there 's still a desire out there and a lot of respondents that came in and saying look we want some action around this risk and there 's still let feeling out there there 's there was a lot of discussion around the economics and and having some robust information around that and also around limbs although that 's of see what some is on the agenda here to talk about I guess my view on limbs is is that no matter regardless of the limb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still there and it needs to be you know it needs to be continually understood communicated discussed and and if required you know taken action so you know that 's still there so whatever the outcome is in terms of the limb that you know that kind of discussion is to continue why wasn 't engaged was was part of overwhelming response that came right at the beginning this process the desire firkin initial consistency but also the recognition that actually flood impacts and new information since earthquakes that need to be fed into this and we 're well aware that there 's other kind of processes going on so this is my final one please here with me so you know my foot towards on gun on what happens next so don 't please go into the vacuum continue to engage work with the community I would suggest you 've got a community reference group there to work with that you could work with to agree a response to the final report and I think there 's the opportunity to do that and in the weeks to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that on the continued development of science and on the on how a wide you know how we engage with the wider community I think this group could probably help think about how you could engage that wider community just keep moving thanks for you that was clean so yeah Paul did you have your hand up yes I 'm sorry Paul Glen Pauline and then gotta get used to these new Mike 's thinking Morrison thingy to your group for all the hard worker I just like to pick up on something you 've just said and it 's becoming quite apparent that where a lot of us would see that the hazard a risk and the limb going together i 'm hearing with what you 've just said the hazard and risk remain but it 's what have you picked up it 's over the conversation over the limbs so it 's what I 'm hearing is with the limbs it 's worth these are dynamic here over its what the council is doing to the community so that their hazard a risk there 's still present but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's the dynamic at play isn 't it yeah look I accept the findings of the of the panel I mean that 's that 's their findings and I in AutoCAD except those and those the recommendations that have come forward and you know whatever the the other legal and other ramifications of their I think do need to be understood and and you know I think if there 's a time frame around that that can be worked through reported back that 's great but you know and i think the you know it 's clear to me from the report is that they are not saying as part of their report that there isn 't you know there is an a that there has it still you know the heads it still there and there is still a risk associated with community that doesn 't need to be understood and discussed and engaged engaged upon and that 's you know that 's the other significant finding ice it 's not a new question i mean this arose at least between the earthquakes i mean i remember these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ward at least now what 's going to go on out ilm so these questions were being asked you know way back then it 's always been this what 's the council going to do next so yeah well no no it 's not a question no not two guys well it mines lot longer similar lines me Morris when you talked about consensus what are we agreed on what does the community group and and the report agree on a nutshell so so root the role of the community in this instance in terms of the community reference group was to was to come together and put a terms of reference to expert panel so that was the you know and that and that step was it was undertaken and it 's you know the the expert panel has responded to that brief and that 's what the reports come back so that 's the process to date and that 's and then and that is the processor I guess I thought you were talking about those consensus between the community forum in the end of findings in here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion well there 's been discussion around the draft that came out from the findings of the of the peer review and in the at that time the council and the community and Environment Canterbury came together just to discuss those those broad findings and give some some feedback back what we fed back as part of that was the consensus view that will discuss at their meeting hmm in the main disagreements thing we didn 't discuss disagreements the whole point of that process was to look at it get consensus feedback to see give back to the panel okay and just quickly my second question as looking at page 10 number 27 here talks about beach profile data and accordingly we suggest that a Pegasus bicoastal monitoring analysis report including careful analysis of beach volume and disease is produced before the first assessment of the coastal hazards assessment now who would do that assessment with it is that he can just be clear sort of my understanding of the first reassessment is the what 's been talked about as the ten-year reassessment and so what we were proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the expert panel said it we must immediately in Irish I would assume that that suggestion in paragraph 27 is probably replicated in one of the suggestions that the expert panel have made for the reassessment so and we would absolutely get to those things in due course nice but we haven 't in the last three days and to do our teaching to and those issues right okay and is that what he can do that work or do we do that work um we haven 't turned our attention to those issues is you okay because I guess that 's what I 'm going to this going to have to be a collaborative process between all the well the expert p.m. does and quite quickly say that the nest be far stronger links in certainly from the community perspective the distinction between wat ek does and what the council 's do and needs to be stronger and so we would expect to do the majority of the work in conjunction with again yeah and also it does say to keep in touch with the central government updates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's comments in relation to this issue being like that a really good beginning has been worked through on a consensus basis with this community who are directly affected but also just how in fact you 'd suggest that we as a council engage with the wider communities who are also in christchurch who are also affected have we or is that something which would be considered in the report which will come to us so i 'm really talking about future engagement processes yes so thank you again this is my observation opinion so it my viewers you 've got a group of people who are actively engaged in this who all along have also been providing advice on how to communicate with the white with the wider community impacted and I think you have the opportunity to develop that in collaboration with some you know with with a group how it goes how you go about doing that there are you know there are examples models around from other cities have worked through these kinds of issues but I think I think you 've got you know you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's come from a different starting point and I think you 've got the opportunity to work collectively to work those kinds of things out the extra is my second question is in relation to the legal work which may be required because clearly we as a council need to work within that legal framework which the me referred to so jewel I guess on asking you is that is that also information which we would get in the report and I would assume clearly that will relate to the lemons a meta to I 'm useful I 'm can really expect to the limbs meet or not any other legal obligations in terms of the area our RMA planning requirements but ok legal part we need um II so we do still have to compile her obligations and legume er to put information on limbs about hazards that we know about so how we do that in light of this new repair report is is what we still need to work out the stuff does don 't need we thank you and my last question please to know Brennan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just take it that the further work which will be done and I 'm assuming that the report actually will summarize what needs to be done and it will be around the recommendations that the panel have particularly made and there in relation to the coast to erosion hazard zones and some modeling and that other work which they 're very specific will air will the report also refer to that those areas of I guess risk and erosion which which we 've been asked to do let will there be a summary and the report we 're going to receive a rounding without wanting to plant what we 're proposing to it and come back in the very near future and general positioners we 've asked a panel of experts to provide us the expert opinion on what should be done and I 've come back clearly and seed and you 've got more work to do in so I 'll be very surprised if we didn 't and is quickly in robustly as possible do all of the things that they 've recommended that we do right they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 'll take end and we want to make sure that these monitoring and ms morris is going to make sure that these continued engagement through that and the next pieces of work good thank you solve the chief executive having the ability to amend the lung so mind is sitting is that that currently exists so why would we need it reported back to Council could we not just actually ask the chief executive to amend alum as soon as practical based on seeking that legal advice yes you could it 's a better fact what the the tenth of December resolution see which is down the bottom the limitations following receipt or the peer review report be reviewed acknowledging the findings of the report yeah so I 'm asking why it needs to come back to Council rather than just the chief executive making those changes now or you know and what and what was a realistic time frame for her to make those changes based on this report um point number three I think as the that scene suggested resolution that the mere put up before she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't give a time frame but changing sorry I 'm just remembered of asking question that doesn 't change the time frame will give a time frame for amending the Lutton all it ceases to report back so all I 'm trying to understand is if we wanted the chief executive to get on and you know we 've got the peer review to amend the loans based on the findings of the peer review what 's a reasonable time frame what timeframe do you need to do that what we 've seen suggested and the staff recommendation is and that would report back within one month and whether or not the CH executive would have made a determination within that one month on what to change the emblem notations to and as a metaphor the executive so can I just well essentially I need to take into account a whole range of things so there 's advice there are recommendations and the report peer review there is advice as well which aren 't actually recommendations but suggestions there 's a statutory requirements and there 's the other information that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be interested in terms of what I might amend our the notations to be I would have thought so right so we had this debate um quite a few months ago when actually we got the chapter withdrawn from the district phone process and some of us were quite keen to as counselors make the decision to change the lumps at that point the advice we had back was actually it wasn 't appropriate so given that we 've heard from the community today that they are interested in us putting it right then I just think it would be really good to have an understanding of a really clear timeframe for that to happen as soon as possible rather than have a continuous kind of reporting back because it 's not what suggested it 's actually reporting back what my decision will be and it is a staff decision as a council decision to alter better than so what 's the point of view reporting back on a decision that you 've made that we can 't change well you might be interested that 's all but we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no I actually think it should come to the council i think thats info right in typical can we be clear in the number three then that the point of that is to decide on the wording that will go on the run sorry but that 's not your let 's not council decision in terms of the wording that 's my decision or staff decision okay okay so the second okay so um the second question is of staff what 's happening with our hazard strategy where are we at with that women it can we just focus on this this is big enough and hard enough as it is have you got any questions for the guys yeah well I mean basically if you look at what some of the recommendations are in terms of a way forward it 's really clear that ccc and he can move towards integrated management of coastal environment that some of the new zealand coastal policy stone policy for and i would have thought that the natural hazards strategy was actually a key part of that so we don 't have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know like to do you want to comment on that Brendan or shall I met Colleen well the timeframe Lazaro more than ever to report back within a month and on how those things were dressed ok and you 'll just annotate to do that we don 't need to amend this no was it well okay we don 't need to mean to wrap okay so another final question for me is just the New Zealand coastal policy statement what I 'm trying to understand is one of the criticisms as I understand it is that the work that talkin and Taylor did didn 't really expect one of your site said you know essential government direction was important but my understanding from reading this as central government already provided very clear direction around how we deal with coastal policy issues through that coastal policy statement but that that wasn 't incorporated into the work so do you have any understanding why that wasn 't picked up and you know is it that we need more direction from central government on this issue or is it just that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided well I think the cracks of asking an expert panel to a producer report and as an Morris aside and the three people sitting in front of you and coastal hazard experience and so I think that 's a question and if it 's a technical question that 's probably best directed at the expert panel and that it suffice to say that the expert panel have made the recommendations in a commitment and to you is that we want to get on in action those recommendations so one of the comments that was made in the presentation that I want to flip back was around central government erection on what I 'm trying to understand is there a need for more central government direction on this issue or is there is there actually clear enough it 's already around it so central government are undertaking a review of the center of the of the National guidance in relation to the semester at the moment and that 's um that process is just ongoing they 're expecting that process to to result in a an outcome before the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the moment so so those things are changing as they are based on lessons being learned from from various communities across the country but there was you know the event but there were national guidance and places and so the 2008 guidelines for from government and they was statues which has been commented my own by the by the expert panel so why do we muscle pull first of all thinking morosely work you 've done I went to the last meeting with the various partners and people involved and I think he did a great job when is she pulling those people to get it question I have us around the hazard mapping do you believe that they will be found what could be found legally Unseld may be safe Morris is eligible and kind of speculative and Christian and while it stays up there that could be legally ourselves now with the Xperia on page 58 of the report and states that so if that 's the case would we not remove those current mapping from the levels until it extra work is done we 're definitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflect the mapping and changing the comments so you 're going to do the two edges bit um see Oh not necessarily well there 's a potential these are actually young and so the issue a good way if we decide to legally could we actually remove those from the limbs now it 's a decision for staff based on the information that we have you 're asking a legal advice from from that and probably something you want to report on rather than just do on these and we are looking into we think the comments need to change what they change too and we need to look at all the information that we 've got now in the comments of that and so you have a need on that new date no we 're in the middle of luck Nikki okay is there any other questions Dave well clearly the biggest issue around this whole debate of the debate is going to ensure shortly is around limb notations and three up there and the proposal is a slightly watered down version of the recommendation that I put forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces and my question and it probably goes to you Judith really is the fact that it appears that I can 't put up a motion that that we remove the notations from lumps because it 's a legal responsibility of the chief executive what if any redress does counsel have if the chief executive and staff take a different view point to the report was before us and and the overwhelming sort of community position on this matter that 's the thing is that we can 't we use it and I know it goes is there a question it that Judaism can answer because it 's quite a big question yeah moisture I 'm here we have statement you want to quite clearly see you 'll have the chance to make state notice is there it right okay okay so we 've got a third see into the questions let 's move on to the resolution is there a mover and seconder for what 's in front of us I 'm happy to move the resolution i have have a resolution around three but i think i understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debate about what 's in front of you your nice big to it is almost all speak so a speaking order nice to speak last and so you don 't want your moving right you want to reserve that for the end all I 'm only going to speak once on okay so clean phool jaan e dave is it at and Paul Paul before Dave ok ok ok Keane all right Thank You Vicky just by way of my views here I just wanted I 'm not going to take too long but just looking at the timeline of events and this is a general broad sweep over what we do know beginning with diversity the promulgation if you like if this information information in the first place over hazards lead to arguably disempowerment of residents most affected although this is about the whole city the pushback led to peer review which has been carried out there 's a question now at least one question of where this process leaves the status of the land of information memoranda I suggest the status is not I do support these recommendations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while the science is under question there 's a truck and trailer effect so if the science is under question what does that do to the status of the limbs we have to get the science writers has been acknowledged the communication with community is paramount and that respect through the local community border did put forward a principle which daikin in itself had talked about and that 's kind of peer reviewing the comms so the communities actually take it on board to pair of you have because it a lot of this is the process over how information is is disseminated finally why because there are questions over the science there are questions over the process talking with residents in sutton place and ellington you know one comment was every time you as in council every time you do this so whether it 's hail information flooding hazard risk whatever it kind of just pushes them down so its debts what 's become quite apparent and the information today that it 's not only just the information it 's the process the reasons were first disempowered by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I I do support this I have questions over the status of the limbs given that the science is under question and the chapter is removed how we could change I don 't know you 'd have to peps bring about changes to the LGA david to to change that with regard to staff but i support this today a new age your support as well ok so we next I also want to thank you very much for all the work that 's been done Morris and the staff and also the local communities and and i think that the work that 's been done is a really good model notwithstanding the mistakes that were made and i think that there 's no del that as is in the report that the the mapping should have been draft mapping as the first stage towards a district plan and that the hazard maps its acknowledge those hazard maps should really be withdrawn until the final mapping and that 's what this recommendation does but that we do that carefully and on the advice of our chief executive the point has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing there 's no question there and we need to we also need to get this right and clearly this has been a comp has been a complicated scientific not only exercise but in terms of really difficult for the community and will be difficult for the wider communities as we have that cut those conversations i think though too it 's important for us as counselors to be clear that this report is wider than just the whole limbs issue clearly that may be the front page part of it but there is information here which is incredibly important I think in terms of future decisions that our council will make and like there are clear recommendations and we 'll get an outline in the report as staff have told us that of work that will be completed before the results which would inform the next stage of our district plan those recommendations there in reference to more information to be worked on around the hole open coast of Pegasus bay and the dependency of of that those beaches on the state of the Wyoming river and the sediment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking for further information on there and I think it 's extremely important that we 're clear to that as essential as a council we work with again and the in fact that actually happens another recommendation report and also that he 'll in fact the different communities are considered and in how we all have to in effect have what 's called a depth of management so there 's an integrated approach for our whole coastal management and it 's important that that work and informs any council projects which we undertake probably particularly in the coastal area and and the coastal erosion hazard zone and the mapping to be reviewed as is going to be done for the next planning stage and I think it 's essential if we look at the stability that dooms for example that 's referred to clearly in the report that we take that long term coastline dune movement that that also be reassessed and as a council we get clear information on there because the report is clear there is some uncertainty around that the around that sediment budget and the report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact we get I guess clearer science because some some of the the report describes the current sediment and assumptions as being optimistic so there 's no doubt that as a council we also want to be reassured around there it also this reporter so refers to the combination of hazards not only what is on the coast but it refers to the fluval and the pluvial but also that they 're all of the coastal flood hazards as well so insured I think it 's really important that as a council besides a limb issue which we will get further information on and I think are dealing with effectively and so that we absolutely get the limb part right too there 's a need for us as a council to take all of the natural hazards into account around our future decision making and that sense this is now a very valuable report yeah I want to thank the community put in and also to the the panel I think it is appropriate that we get a more detailed report back and we 've got some pretty short time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach I think it 's important to recognize that we can actually are the chief executive can actually change the limbs at any time so you know I hope and it obviously with number three we 're given two weeks to report back on that so let 's hope that we can get some idea of what 's happening within that time frame as well um I think to me this highlights some fundamental flaws in terms of the district plan review process and it 's interesting to reflect on the work that 's been done with the community over this coastal hazards issue I guess relevant to the other hazards as has been mentioned but also some of the other major land use planning decisions where the community had largely been shut out from a collaborative process and that 's a real shame this is I think a model we heard a lot about models previously for some previous reports of then considered today but actually hopefully maybe this can be a model not just for addressing the coastal hazards but actually addressing land use planning across the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things that needs to be addressed as communities being resourced to participate in these sorts of technical scientific complex processes and hopefully when we get the report back there can be some reference to do that because I want to acknowledge the huge cost and expense that this process has placed on our community at a very stressful time dealing with all the other things going on in the city post-earthquake I think the other really important thing from my point of view through this peer review is that highlights very clearly a breakdown between what happens at a central government level and what happens at a local and regional level and so the New Zealand coastal policy statement objectives don 't seem to be incorporated in and hopefully we can get some understanding as to why that wasn 't put in place through the initial work and what other things we need to do to make sure that in future it is but also if you think about Christchurch you think about the extraordinary no money being spent on our infrastructure the extraordinary amount of science we 're putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lack of a holistic approach around that so I think it 's really urgent that we get a holistic approach around our infrastructure strategy based on a response to the natural hazards and risks that exist in our region and I think you know again that should be quite a comprehensive document because it is very hard to see in terms of things like the skirt repairs why some communities are getting a lot of money spent and others are questioning why when they are not getting the same level spin addressing some of the rusts around things like sea walls so it 'd be really good to tidy that together and to have a really clear strategy for the city as to how we deal what with what I think most people except the real challenges of sea level rise climate change and the natural hazards that exist so I 'm happy to support what 's being put here today I think if things can happen quicker like the limbs for example then there 's no reason why we should wait for two weeks if we can get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meantime I would welcome that but thank you to the work that 's been done from the community and from this panel and to the consultants that we 've water okay I endorse most of the comments of my colleagues are made here now but it 's indicative really of a process that we were forced to do through the district parent via truncated process that would normally take 15 to 20 years to complete so it 's not surprising that we made some mistakes along the way and I lead five my colleagues to meet with the associate minister to ask to get the coastal hazards policy removed from this process so we could have some take some time and work with their community thankfully yeah that was accepted and we 're here today to after an independent review and it 's good to see the council can step back and say look we 've got some things wrong and we 're actually willing to do something about it and I think that 's a really important step for any council that they are willing to take up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's do something about it let 's work of the community and find a way forward noting that that we have got issues around our coast what there will be and how they will roll that in the future that 's why we need adaptive management rather than set in stone policies that actually dictate what may not even eventuate so I 'm really happy to support this here I 'm looking forward to seeing the chief executives outcome and again a big thanks to all the people involved including the community who actually have taken a lot of time and we know how much time that actually that costs to a community and the stress of places on them at a time when we 've got other things and other issues in our life that we need to be yelling with being an exceedingly long journey fee and starting back in early 2015 when the tonkin and taylor report was presented to council i raised the number of concerns about the report then and was the only counselor to vote against the adoption of the report the report in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ district plan reviewed and by virtue of its adoption the council was obliged under the local government act 2002 to place information on limbs reflecting that the council was in receipt of coastal hazard erosion zones in coastal hazard inundation zones information for a significant number of Christchurch properties considerable angst was Felton in the coastal community of outlets action which then gave rise to the establishment of Christchurch coastal residents United a great deal of lobbying and finally government withdrawal of the coastal hazards chapter from the in favor of developing a national standard for addressing sea level rise an under pendant peer review process was adopted in 2015 and we have its findings here before us today I 'd like to take the opportunity to personally thank CCA you for their tenacity and well presented arguments that greatly assisted the process for the withdrawal of the coastal hazards chapter from the DPR and secondly the community reference group for their excellent work and establishing the questions and finally the questions for the peer review panel and their recommendations for that peer review panel composition the many hours of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now the findings of the peer review panel are in my opinion well thought out and very well presented and I commend the panel for their work I do feel vindicated for my stand on the matter the report has many recommendations for work that needs to be completed before we can have absolute confidence in coastal hazard erosion zones and coastal hazard inundation zones that may a result mavis arise as a result of such work there are a number of points out of the report that I 'd quickly like to highlight on panes 165 the panel found that the reports purpose went beyond the technical assessment of areas subject to coastal hazards and as required under policy 24 of the NZ CPS and they concluded that mapping should have been draft secondly on page 166 the report was based on one single IPC IPCC samari Oh RCP 8.5 which is commonly used in hazard assessments however the proposed adaptive stage of coastal hazards own mapping will benefit from considering a range of scenarios sediment supply feel touched on this before the open coast coastal hazard erosion zone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more robust analysis of sediment supply and distribution as recommended in Zed CPS 24 should have been referenced in the terms of reference for Tolkien and Taylor and was not quite important they won the panel recommends that the hazard maps generated from the results of the report should be withdrawn for now until the final mapping is concluded the panel made a number of suggestions under general heading the way forward and I 'm going to read them they recommended that the council initiate the concept of a depth of management to assist all stakeholders potentially affected by coastal hazard risk to resolve issues at large and ends at pc cps objective 5 and policies 25 to 27 secondly that the council require the withdrawal of the hazard maps and the report and put them to one side until final mapping is agreed amongst all shareholder stakeholders and the second and third stages of the depth of management thirdly that the counsel advised the limo thority that the withdrawal of information on limbs is necessary until the legal requirements of the NZ CPS are complete because the current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and II can move towards an integrated management of the coastal environment ends in cps policy for all so that council and preparing the coastal hazards chapter of the district review plan move towards a strategic planning as directed by the NZ cps policy 7 and finally that it be noted that ends in cps policies 4 and 7 mandatory directors endorsed by government the report further has a summary of recommendations which you can find on pages 2 to 3 2 225 there are 23 recommendations I don 't intend to go through them all suffice to say i 'm almost finished suffice to say that the peer review panel has identified 23 matters that need to be addressed listen itself signals that the original point report was deficient in a number of areas and ccr and myself were justified in challenging the accuracy of the report and summary it 's been a long and costly exercise and perhaps it 's a reminder that we should not always accept technical reports at face value but be prepared to challenge aspects when and where there is an element of concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not that computer said oh aitee seve and up with singularity you but she gave a decidedly absorbing presentation outlining such things as computer capacity doubling every couple of years but more importantly advancements and energy storage that were astounding and I believe that some of these energy storage things like battery and solar energy eventually are going to overtake the use of fossil fuels and IPCC 8.5 relies on extreme carbon and greenhouse levels and good year so looking at that sort of technology i think is likely to see some of the factors that generate potential sea level rise being substantially reduced negated eradicated I 'm pleased with the outcome satisfied that my concerns have been addressed and confident that given implementation of the panel 's recommendation that we will have a robust report on which to base further adaptive management approaches to sea level rise I 'm always mindful of the parliamentary commissioners approach the climate change that we have plenty of time to adjust the sea level rise and need to have a plan ahead and a realistic time frame responding to actual change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modelling may indicate could happen than 100 years time finally the the unresolved portion of this discussion is centered on the limbs limo information on property titles there is clear advice given from the panel the chair of of that panel as a retired environmental court judge the peer review panel recommends the removal until science is right and acknowledging the legal deficiencies I have some reservations around three the legal implications however there is a clear expectation from both peer review panel CCA you and the local community that this information should be removed until accurate science and then the greed position on coastal peasants is reached the time for procrastination is over and I 'll expect that the recommendations are carried forward dr. Latham and my final point dr. Latham and his friend said the fighter pilot would you know we need to avoid any legal challenge to to these things so I would urge that we support the recommendation giving some reservation to three and hopefully we have a positive outcome that satisfies both our community and ccr you thank you finalists okay it 's like a speed limit,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

'll hand over to the chief executive thank you so this is an end-of-year report in terms of bringing together the overall performance and financials which of the year for you to have Ridge noting that operating expenditure was below budget for a number of reasons higher corporate revenues combination of cost savings and timing of expenditure some of those areas are timing of expenditure we 've requested some carry forward for that but certainly a better than expected result a capital expenditure is expected was below budget and we 've been forecasting which over time still being a busy year there 's been some softening and things such as the volume are consenting particularly the residential area but still very busy around there what I would like to just reinforces that has been considerable work done that despite you know the changes that are a resident survey improved dramatically so 19 increase in overall satisfaction at the highest in the history of the doing those reviews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of particularly at customer focus in things such as trialing the citizen hub at Tihar pula so that it 's a one-stop shop for people who come in to use our services around there the thing I also just want to catch on as a transformational program across the organization are great for Christ 's Church which is really looking at improving not only our performance and terms of benefit the customers citizens our communities but efficiency gains in building capacity within the organization in those three areas around procurement middle and back-office and that customer focus of customer community and operating model is enabled by IT so the work in terms that there 's been some real success in terms of not only savings by providing a better service in terms of to our community still a long way to go but given that we 've built capacity and capability within the organization will now start to embed that and the organization as opposed to being a separate program that still means that we focus on efficiencies and improvement in customer focus but it 's about that happening within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program because of that compare capability building and we 're really focusing on the how we work together as part of that sort of beating that cultural change across the organization that 's why I 'd say we 're good any questions then Yanni and then Jimmy Thank You Carly no just wonder whether we headed an amount on cost savings over the contracts out of the procurement whisperers at the top I hear it 's around eight or nine I 'll 66 million for contracts are in terms of procurement over that first year and is a step increase required for the snakes view as well I mean the procurement also covers the whole range of other things so it includes things such as we weave pets unsourced services that we might have outsourced treatments previously so bringing an FTE rather than contacting them out which is obviously more expensive for us as well I 'm clean a ninja me oh sorry I said yeah oh did I not say to do anything on it being doing the on page 90 the performance report particularly regarding a capital expenditure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 60 the million dollars less than the parties so popular quite a few the infrastructure or the progress been behind the CG I just want to know except the 47.3 a point of four million dollars carry the forward to the last year the weather staff and any alternative a plan try to speed up the progress to kinda to arrive 4222 narrower knows that the kind of behind the schedule um progress on the like the capital capital one year because the you have 0 60 million dollars so um even though we 're really in the new year the trend is much more positive yes and there 's been a considerable amount of work are thinking that into end process will capital and those alternative delivery models that we 've talked to you about as well but essentially some of those things are for instance and the the Erie planning stages have been getting that well ahead of time so we 're now 18 months ahead of where we were last year and tens of some of those planning processes as an example okay thank you you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me I yes okay thank you yeah okami hummus no no no cameras okay okay um Yanni looking at the operating expenditure mmm I was just wondering what the rationale was behind her it 's to do worthley if quite damaged housing and the housing three I thought he said the the operating expenditure Tony and the you know that the maintenance that 's not done on unoccupied buildings inside walls but I just I just the bank I just don 't understand what we 're 15 million dollars under budget for housing from the year because not all the units are open and your damaged ones and a lot of that crazy can I refer council Johansson to the 60 page report on finances that we produced in strategy and finance law says don 't know counselor your Hansen wasn 't there and that I 'm hoping and assuming he 's had the chance to read it since the social housing aspect and the impact on the operational expenditure expenditure is sent out in paragraph 14 of that agenda and the entire report is coming back to Council next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the year-end i would expect have come up and strategy and finance all can come back up and let that next one yep bit sensible okay um and the other one was flood protection but i guess you want the same thing wait till we get that report and then put the questions in there so and then just the other question I had was around the complaints i 'm still getting a number of complaints from people about the emptying of rubbish buns or the lack of emptying of rubbish buns particularly long the river um there 's no kind of record of that in terms of the context into but one of the frustrations people are still raising is the number of times that they 've complained this is getting something actually done so do we have any monitoring of the time to resolve the complaints that are coming in and as anyone doing any work around the new contracts around the parks just see where the gaps are and to pick up those things being added to contracts if they 're being missed out I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's no decrease and expected activity around those and there is certainly monitoring in terms of delivery of service so that 's going on in terms of monitoring of resolution there are some challenges on that and the sense that sometimes they closed off once they referred to a contractor and so we need to close the loop in terms of understanding when the contract is actually delivered on one of those complaints as well so what let 's so what works being done around that plate well we 're looking at there again the Indian process of how we get that feedback for around complaints and when they 've been implemented pretty much some complaints are resolved pretty well you might be you said you 're getting lots of them you should feed that back to us because we 're not giving we 're not getting lots of the repeat ones we we do I generally end up seeing them in funny old happening so I mean I have rung the call center they have gone through there is a discrepancy and the people that have lodged complaints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the gap seems to be that when the contracts were changed over there 's areas that were left out of the contracts that haven 't been picked up into the contracts which i think is what 's generating the complaints so it 's not a changed well serve us it 's a it 's the change of contract leaving some gaps well I 'd be surprised that they were you need gets within the contracts but we can follow that up no I 'm talking rubbish bins along the river which are not part of city streets a part of parks but seem to be repeatedly getting full with Robert and not being cleaned on a regular basis and people keep complaining but they don 't seem to be getting cleaned people seem to have to comply might not be our rubbish bins so yeah that would be great hmm good good Phil thanks Colleen some really pleasing aspect support and like for example work to Magdala link being out completely in front of time in under budget things like there I just want to shoot if your weapon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I 'm just asking about the skirt have you could we have a sort of a protect projected time as to win there might be a new form of skirt for council well um what you 're talking about is how we continue to deliver capital programs in the future and it may or may not be a new form of scoot it 'll certainly be alternative ways of delivering services so we 'll be bringing that back to you in the next three months it 'll be a month way probably kappa g ok that 's enough good indication thank you thank you good Merry Christmas all right someone like to move that report be received Tim scandrett seconded film Clearwater emotional all those in favor say aye aye though the

new area for councils and we acknowledge that we are all unwinding away understanding the science and heron impacts on cancer policy and citizens we accept it has been at times contentious for all of us however we now have clarity with the release of the final report the coastal hazards policy and the release of the final report has certainly been a high-profile and attracted much interest in the media during the last several days with leading items in the Christ expressed and the editorial page also we are certain that all Christchurch and coastal residents will be very interested in the outcome of today 's meeting I 'd like to pass you over now to Darryl please thank you Tim and good morning everybody thanks for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be to cut to the chase I think it is quite clear where we are hitting the implications of the peer review show us that it is a robust document so we 'll try to move there as fast as possible if you go to page two you will note that there are some background briefing information setting the scene and that 's for counselors who perhaps may have forgotten part of the process that we 've been through I 'm not going to go through and talk about those bullet points apart from to say that we remain grateful to Prime Minister John Key for his intervention and sending down the Honorable doctor next month and the Honorable Nicki Wagner early on in the process to talk about the removal of the hazards policy but the current such movement moving forward to the current situation I think it is now time counselors to make a decision the findings of the peer review of the scientific expert experience has been released and I think it 's time to do the right thing the council requested that the scientific peer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that way Ford we now have the opportunity to Scott start again and to do this in a way that can be an exemplar there are good people and counsel and we acknowledge that there are also good people in the community and local experts as well and we have engaged with them and we have the chance to produce something great so councillors it 's time to make a decision no more procrastinating it 's time to do the right thing the independent peer review panel has come out with a clear and robust determination we asked what more is it that you actually require in order to make a decision I think this is a decision that councillors should lead I understand that there is some bureaucracy and legalese attached to the decision but I think counselors have it in their grasp to direct counsel as to what they would like and what they currently understand through the excellent reporting and the Christchurch press with the editorial about doing the right thing and also the coverage that the press has provided in a fair and balanced matter towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robust decision-making what do we want now Christchurch coastal residents United endorses the findings of the peer review panel of scientific experts that coastal flooding and erosion information should be removed from thousands of christ church property records we also endorse the panel 's recommendations on process and procedure in support of this we draw your attention and you should have it in front of you attachment a peer review of the Christchurch coastal hazards assessment report of the 18th of August the way forward and there are two bullet points there which we have included the first bullet point says the Christchurch City Council to require withdrawal of the hazard maps in the report and put to one side until final final mapping as agreed amongst all stakeholders and the second and third stages of adaptive management the final bullet point Christchurch City Council to advise the limo authority that the withdrawal is necessary until the legal requirements of the NZ CPS are complete because the current mapping the current mapping may be legally unsound furthermore Christchurch coastal residents United also endorses this statement contained and the Christchurch Press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information should be on Len reports once science is robust quote removing less than robust details from those residents lumps is the right thing to do the advice christchurch coastal residents united has received indicates that adding and leaving the coastal risk information on limbs on those properties identified through the fast tracking of the district plan has potential to expose the christchurch city council to legal liability we hope that all councils councillors as elected members have taken the time to read and understand the legal implications of the peer review because they are serious we now have the ops however christchurch coastal residents united would respectively request and we are confident that councillors would also agree that it is preferable for the christchurch city council to weaken partnership with christchurch coastal residents united and the affected residents rather than having to see a resolution through the courts there are many people that have suffered please don 't force a legal decision that is a plea please don 't force a legal decision counselors removing limb notifications as the right thing to do you will be aware that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing the right things well in the process of introducing coastal hazard mappings and hazard report and the legislation that has surrounded that the council attempted to do the right thing or do it council attempted to do things right unfortunately it didn 't quite transpire that that was the actual situation as a result and at the council 's directive we have gone through a process of having a peer review so my final point does that in the process of doing things right it is now up to councillors and council to actually do the right thing Thank You mirror counselors for taking the time to listen we 're happy to respond to any questions you may have 29 seconds to go so did anyone have a question no I think you 've presented your position succinctly so thank you very much for appearing in front of us and we are now going to replace you with the with

reduces the drawn council funds now whether in fact then the endowment fund is considered by everyone to be the appropriate source of money that needs to perhaps be considered on another occasion should these things come forward in greater numbers he would for the moment if we can support this under the community calendar app and given that we do think it meets the criteria and we think it will provide a good working example to improve what we do in the future in to support communities taking ownership and reduce dependency on council so that whereas we think it provides the widest City benefit so can I just ask like so for other groups the how do they access the capital endowment fund it 's not a relevant question for this sorry it 's not a relevant question for this paper I think you 've already heard me say Lester seeds we need it we have to consider this issue in the future and look at it is something that we 're going to have to consider but it 's something that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where a measure of weeks from the new council being elected let the new council determine what the criteria will be this is a great model to be restarting and thus and thus way and if I can provide counsel and counsel with some assurance we 're very keen to do this because we do hope there are other models some of us are going to come forward and therefore if it puts pressure on the capital and dumb and fun that 's a good thing we need to fix it because we think it 's a very good model for being together so just so I 'm clear so the model from here is get the girl come to talk to counsel put an application and to staff and get a report to count its color and a model council a car yes because I 've got other groups that we really came to yes apply for endowment funding but it 's not as relevant to this discussion channels but mainly sathyan please focus on the paper it 's just respectful to the community we 've come here to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we spend half the endowment a bar question for us may well be there but the question in front of us today is spending on this project well here I 'll let the two local councillors move and seek and do it so David and then glean but questions well the question is it really depends on the community that comes to us with these offers obviously this community has done a hell of a lot of work and so when we 're looking at models for the future a model for the future the key for me is how will we ensure that those communities when they come to us have no the work they 've got to do because you know yannis just mentioned about other communities and other groups but it 's kind of a sense of relevant because it 's the work that they 've done to combine that community how do we do that at least you 're sorry to know lucky for me yeah absolutely i welcome the question this process has been a learning process it 's been a learning process obviously for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us as well the question was asked earlier in terms of why is this a supplementary paper I take responsibility for that because there were issues that we were attempting to answer to address the questions with that we 'd heard from counselors and we anticipated might be there we may not have answered the mall we hope we have now sufficiently to enable Council to make the decision are fully informed as we go through we will continue to learn and enhance the process once I think this conversation and previous conversations with Counsell leaves us with the sort of information and questions that we need to go back to any submitting group and say look you need to address this it 's not just a community brick coming Ford it 's a robust case from their perspective but it 's also understanding responsibility the council has to to manage and use well the funds it has it disposal so we 've got to meet both of those things and in this experience has been valuable in that light ya ali at the endowment fund again so there will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes out and that 's until the next financial year so we 've got is that right right i believe so so we 've got the majority of the year to go it 's useful Rex you know I think it 's about 300 3000 available okay and at the risk of whipping up the mayor 's Roth I did want to ask do you have any concerns that there will be other groups over the next remainder of the financial year that potentially could miss out because of the huge reduction in the endowment fund looking at war the older three viously or the opposite I mean the year well it may well be that more do apply and I think that 's what least had just said he said the great thing would be if it did put pressure on the fun because it would mean the new model I understand that and it 's a discussion needs to be happy can I respond that discussion counselor respond to that question yeah there was nothing on the table at the moment to my knowledge so to say yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some have been referred to in this discussion who are likely to want to come forward and it is highly likely once the publicity is received and we 've heard about the likely publicity as a consequence of a decision which might be made today and that further groups will come forward so these are these are going to be current issues which are going to need to address I don 't hear we feel the debts a reason not to make a decision on this particular proposition simply because we have nothing else on the table right now because it doesn 't mean that we may be confronted with the option of putting more money into this budget during the course of the financial year and do we have the power to do that using a consultative procedure after a certain Michael and all I would probably have to refer to Diane brandy just to answer I think there are two questions and yeah one is may we have to that 's a decision council might be confronted with but we don 't know can we I don 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got this Idol pain cases yes oh yeah I mean what stuff it just remind them me is is that we we 've also also set aside a million dollars to partner with central government over well-being and resilience initiatives at a community level in this format this this is exactly the sort of thing that we 're talking about where communities take ownership and they get support from from the council it 's not the council controlling the process so there are other sources of funds that will be available when that funders establish if I can just say one thing in regards that I think we 're all very aware about the amount of work that has gone on to the preparation of this particular proposal and consequence submission it would be a surprise to us I think that if we received several of this depth and quality supported decision in in the remaining months of the year it 's likely that we will receive some but there 's a lot of work that has to go before anyone would could put the money in council would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a mitigating factor yeah yeah yeah Paul it was just an issue around a wraparound service if we give this money to this community group do we actually get one of our project managers this assists them like we did with Mount Pleasant albeit too late with Mount Pleasant we didn 't do that in the start and they become a little bit under stuck with some issues they came across a long way and if we 've done that early on we would have probably mitigated quite owe you a lot of cost to their community group so I 'm just wondering though we sure I 'll ask us gerotor to address that and detail my expectation whoever is head of the group will be that Gary 's team will work closely in in its role is capable in capacity building in the community and to to ensure that we 're working alongside and identifying any gaps and skills required and supporting them so it doesn 't stumble that would be unfortunate for people but I would have to say that this community is very very very good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've done if it was a condition then I 'm sure that they would agree to it but to be honest with you having spent a lot of time with the wife total confidence so they can deliver this but we won 't abandon them no no no God look at all sure I look at that little baby it 's really more of an assistance and AJ so that a community capacity building yep and actually how your project manager and he may well be the skills in there and we 're going to learn a lot we 're going to learn a lot of subs that you can transfer that that that experience that knowledge to other parts of the other communities in the city all right well I 'll open it Oh another question you want to debate it ball does the I 've got the mover Dave do you want to start it off sir I button but I think we 've heard from Lester that this is a bit of a learning process for counsel and it 's been an exceptionally good one we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards this concept of enabling our local communities to take ownership of local activities and facilities this particular group really has shown some outstanding contribution to their community and organizing the the leveling project which they won pretty hands down a huge amount of pro bono work has been put into the project and the spirit that exists in this community is quite outstanding right from the time of the earthquakes it 's been a community that 's refused to lie down and die it 's a community that some got itself boyish shaken itself while the boot laces and got up and just keep going and that 's evident not only in this project but in a lot of other activities that have happened in the area so I 'd like to particularly compliment Jane Leslie Jason and the rest of the team at the trust and in my mind they are extremely capable totally committed and exuded great confidence leading that community to what I believe is a project that 's going to have outstanding benefits not only for South brighton area but for that wider eastern eastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the team earth clean here to propose and second this motion and I trust that the restavek my colleagues will support this which i think is going to be absolutely fantastic for our side of town yeah clean Pauline thank you this is a low cost benefit ratio to restore what really is the heart of South New Brighton so what happened was after the quakes through Syria demolition the shops which came into view crossing the bridge known as the bridge that welcomes us home were summarily demolished leaving nothing by way of a community gathering points we 're not talking about just one building we 're talking about and I know this term is used a lot now it 's a bit cliched hub but this literally is the hub the heart of South New Brighton so I think in terms of rate payer dollars spend you could hardly get better than this we see other see if grants go to peps one project and one suburb and they all have their merits this really is about beginning the the road back for an entire suburb this money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most affected by the quakes we 've heard the work that 's been put into this this is literally hand up not a handout and you can see sequentially by granting this money today it will enable the project to proceed to that next stage the leaders involved are held in high regard in the community is david has said and there is considerable community support for them visa V the letters in the report here today over the discussion over meeting the criteria particularly over citywide benefit and I take the main point I think there 's another view as well to take on board in that when we get behind some parts of our city particularly in this post quake time that benefits the whole city so we we can 't have the city being lopsided it 's we need to ensure that we strengthen all parts as much as we can I urge you to please support this I think it does actually tick all the all the boxes in relation to the argument it 's using up half the fund that may be it but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a third of the fund or a tenth of the fund what it just happens to be half at this point so I don 't think that 's a particularly strong argument over yay or nay over this i would urge you to get behind it 325 dollars it 's not much money I need more coffee you can pay that yourself 25,000 it 's not met year I myself it 's not much in well it 's at least the most of our houses isn 't it but it 's it 's not much in terms of what you can leverage off there and achieve for the community thank you our Pauline Andrew Yanni you thank you though I just really want to reiterate what others have said and really congratulate this group on a great job a great presentation it 's too I 've seen now and in the skills and knowledge that they 're demonstrating and the willingness and the energy that they have for their community is actually that 's present all around christchurch and this is going to add to that desire for people to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have so much talent so much knowledge so many skills in our community and local people know their local areas and they know what they need and they know how to do it and what format shall be presented and they know how to make that succeed in other words they know that it will be used it will be valued and it will be successful and just what I want from what Paul said to that we don 't just say well here--here 's the money off you go no we will walk alongside every project that 's happening in the community because we don 't want to see our investment flop and we don 't want to see communities fail we want to see them succeed so we will help and there 's other ways that we can help without offering more money we can offer our skills our knowledge our wonderful staff we have there with the knowledge so there 's lots of ways we can assist them we will not walk away we want this to succeed as much as you do over there and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've done and how you done it and look forward to opening day thank you um Andrew thank you and the this council has spent a lot of time talking about different ways that we can partner with communities that we can genuinely partner with communities to deliver things that council may traditionally have done for itself that communities are perfectly capable of doing for themselves and here we are presented with today an opportunity to genuinely partner with a el resourced well organized community group that knows its community way better than we as a council ever would so that we can bring about this some this exciting project I 'd like to start off by commending the trust on the the completeness and robustness of the work that 's been done we 've heard from the trust on a number of occasions and the the presentations and the way that the detailed information has been presented has been nothing short of excellence and it 's that type of detail that makes a decision like the one we 've been asked to make today in my world a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we 're doing today is is assuming this goes through where we 're agreeing to a pivotal point in the process to bring this project about we 're providing certain see we 're providing the the confirmation that 's required to progress this but we 're also and I 'm pleased if we are setting a precedent that other community groups can look at these type of projects where this capacity to do so and we 're certainly setting a very good example of the way that communities can think of working with the council and the council should be thinking of working with communities so the level of activity that will run through this Center is clearly going to be great for the the local community and possibly wider than that local community as well what we 've got here is an opportunity for the council to to do with the community to do with the community rather than doing for the community or even worse doing to the community as is already I think Ben said it 's an opportunity for a hand up no hand out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent excellent investment by the community for the community looking after its needs in the long term so very pleased to be supporting this today and once again absolutely commend the trust on the work that 's been done to get this project to this point and urge all of the counselors around the table to strongly support this today Annie it was really good that we got the explanation around why this needed to come today and it would be quite good to have that at the stat the start of the report when we 're being asked to approve a supplementary because it 's absolutely relevant so I 'm glad that we got the reason and you know if I 'd known that before we voted on it I would have supported this report coming as a late supplementary I I don 't think there 's any discussion about the merits of this project or not to me that issue is how is it how was it funded interesting enough when the endowment fund was set up many years ago and the community were asked how did they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more support for project and local communities and it was pretty pretty overwhelming that people wanted projects and local communities are being funded through this endowment fund unfortunate reality was a lot of that money went into economic development and into civic projects rather than into local projects so i have always been and will continue to encourage us as a city to change the endowment fund criteria to enable local communities to access that fund I 've always held that view and I 've tried to promote that as best I can I think the sooner we get a contestable process around local communities being able to access the endowment fund the better position we will be in and I don 't know how many times we need to ask for that but you know that has been an outstanding requests for you know I think quite some time now and it would be good to get some conclusion to it the other the other thing I think that 's really important is over a year and a half ago I put forward through the long-term plan a request @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have and develop a community charter with community organizations and we still haven 't seen that put in place and I think when we talk about new ways of doing things that like like this project actually having some sort of framework in terms of a charter I think would be really powerful so hopefully this can be a bit of a pilot project around that and maybe that can inform the development of that because there are many other groups who wish to also operate in a unique and different way who don 't which counsel to actually own their facilities but require some capital assistance so I 'm just turning to that the project itself i think this as a fantastic project has certainly deserted to get funded i think it will do far more for our city than many of the other things that were funding through economic development through the endowment fund like Ed 's in Australia or you know tourism promotions actually if we have strong local communities that are fun places that are affordable places that are dynamic and diverse places I think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the country the rest of the world then some of the advertising campaigns we 've put in place so I strongly support the surgery and I 'll just conclude by saying um the other thing that would be really good as to understand where this million dollar fund is because we set up a fund and I totally agree that this would be something that actually that fund could consider if it was set up so yeah it would be really good to have some understanding win that money may be available for other groups that wish to apply given that it 's not available today so thank you Paul and then the key I don 't wanna repeat what it would have said so look the council has often been doing things all the planning over the years were picked up more and more of that responsibility and I remember in my previous role once talking to the streets manager for the central city he said to me yeah Paul the council would make you breakfast and bid as long as you 're willing to pay for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was actually gone a long way towards actually change in our model post the earthquake I was involved on the restart project the biggest issue we had given that project off the ground was funding we had to end up getting an interest-free loan which still put a lot of pressure on us to perform and as you have the ability to actually you know remain solvent so I 'm a really really strong supporter of social outcomes through social enterprise it 's the way to go about it the communities out there want to do things for themselves we don 't want to get in the way we want to help them actually achieve the things they want to achieve and I think that 'll actually help bring those communities gether strengthen the local communities which is actually really really important those local communities will let you strengthen themselves and intent and internets your strength in the city so as she and I welcome more community is stepping up and wanting to apply I think it 's a great thing and as you said earlier if we get more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves we should be there to support it and find ways how we can actually support a more just very briefly because it seems to me that this project I was actually really to fund it when they came along to the cheek committee and all we had to do basically was find a source that was appropriate they 've actually gone out they 've solved all the problems and they 've done a huge amount work the community endowment the capital endowment fund has now been changed so that much of it can go to innovation and community which is exactly what this is it seems to me that there 's a starting gate we provide the first layer of funding at the moment the gates shut and all we need to do is open the gate and they 're away and that sort of model is exactly what we 're trying to do so our job is to try to make things as easy as possible for the community these guys are doing it for themselves and that 's fantastic our job is just to help it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to participate except for the that last comment not from forgive that we did have a conversation with central government about the need to have community lead action because if the community leads action then in itself it improves well-being and builds resilience you know and I know that some people don 't like that phrase resilience but it 's actually part of what we want people to be able to build with themselves the council can 't come in and make a community resilient the council can 't come in and make a community you know you have a sense of well-being the community can do it itself but it needs support all communities need support that we 've been having a really interesting conversation and this is about the that the community well-being and resilience fund which we 're talking to central government about so it 's not yet resolved and so directing accusing questions to staff around around this fund it 's going to come back to Council but what central government and us are talking about is having the ability to resource communities to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and well-being this will have an effect on on mental health and well-being as well so and and I thought I always remember reading that wonderful report there sepideh Gluckman road and I think may 2011 so it was straight after the earthquakes and he basically said that communities have a degree of competence which is shaken by a disaster so the earthquakes shake people 's confidence restoring their sense of self-confidence the competence of their own community coming forward to do things but that 's what builds the or hastens recovery that 's what makes communities grow stronger and more resilient so I just think that this is peps this isn 't going to be funded from the capital endowment fund in the future this is exactly the sort of project that I think that if we can get this fund set up with central government that 's where they will be funded but isn 't just communities that are struggling and the post-disaster environment and I mean look at the people that are involved in this I mean that awesome professionals and community activists and people who 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you know that they will succeed but you take a brand new community take Wigram skies if they got the energy to form a community I mean a lot of the people from the east a lot of the people from the east moved there there 's a lot of integrations still to be done to actually build community spirit and it 's that community spirit and energy that sometimes needs a little bit of resourcing and actually a little bit of joy in people 's lives of their jolly good thing as well so in theory and I but I 'm pretty sure the fairies will go to the opening as well so i will put the motion all those in favor say aye as opposed say no that 's carriage thank you very much excellent well done I","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

brighton trust regarding item 26 the bridge southbridge and community hub projects and options for funding purchase ability welcome I apologize for thinking that you addressed as Furies today I know I thought that color photography like a totally under deuce now I should have known Jason what 's the chase it is a ferry that would be beautiful alright so thank you very much for the opportunity and come here again today speak on behalf of the bridge south bright interest and we will only be very brief because we have talked to you people recently and also to that and the Community Housing and Economic Development Committee at some length as well we do have a little bit of extra information for you today and around our funding and and I just like to say that is really nice we have a lot of support here with us but we also have a lot of people at home and South right and right and watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Theory interested in the outcome of today so thank you for your time I 'll just very quickly remind you of the project and basically what we 're wanting to do is to take the abandoned church in the center of South Brighton and turn it into a multi-use community facility and we want it to be community-owned which is why we 're here today to talk about buying the building and community manage the trust will take care of the governance and one employer manager and we will work closely with the tenants and other people in our community to manage it we want it to be financially sustainable and we 've done a lot of work around this if we 're able to open this building without debt you have a budget with you and we should be able to pretty much break even from day one and it 's a very conservative budget that is based on people who have already shown a very clear indication that they will come into the building that they will use the building activities that are already going on in South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be local business will have community facilities educational facilities office space meeting spaces of performance venue a wellness center so really multi-use for our community because there 's nowhere else to do all of these things in South brightened and there 's no in the foreseeable future there 's no opportunity to rebuild any of what we lost and that 's because of new regulations around and foundation levels end and other complexities around that this building is ready to go once we get the repairs done and the fit-out done because we don 't have to change foundation heights or anything like that and we 've had a lot of people come through we 've got a lot of formation of all of this and it 'll be really responsible to local needs and once it 's not a small group of people going to decide what happens there terra cotta herself Brighton and that already has been operating for some time that 's how they operate they respond very much to the interest in the energy that 's in the community which is why we 're able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus very much on well-being and resilience and the people in South Brighton have been through a pretty rough time in the last five years a lot of people have come through that and a really get back out there and really enjoy their community and that 's where our focus is going to be okay this really quickly tells you some of that and things that will be going on there but that 's just really a quick reminder of what it is that we doing and all of these are confirmed activities for the place but really what I want to tuck and just let you know about today is the funding we have a three-phase funding process and as you know we are here to talk about the first phase which is purchasing the building as is in really a lot of the work that we 've done and we 've done a lot of work on the next two phases is just waiting until we can own the building okay so that 's kind of we 've got em smart left have already given us up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month you 're going to do it anyway they have an agreement with the Baptist Church we have rod Watson from the baptist association with us they 've been incredibly supportive of us being able to buy the building and they have an agreement a contract with smart enough to be able to do that work so there 's a huge confidence and they are doing it because our community voted for that we won that competition over 2,200 votes so we 're a 1500 household community so smart lifted have shown us that belief and what we 're doing in terms of the seismic strengthening and requiere lapeer work do you want to wait to speak to her there are some costume in front of you with that and a large hunk of there is the smart left work we 're taking it as close as a reasonable practical to one hundred percent over the 66 and the smart left work actually future-proof sir in the case of the next event there will be another event that building can then be real evill so its future proofing it weird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we don 't need to do but again we want to future-proof this community is it and we have we have a number of offers of donations pro bono work very very discounted work that again is just sitting waiting for a star in the building before we can start signing contracts that 280 is down to about 71 I have some funding applications and this is part of the reason that we did need to come here and before the end of the month is because we have a number of funding applications that need to go out on the thirty-first of August they 're ready to go but again we need to know the outcome of today hmm to finish up those funding applications and then the fill building fit out I think last time we see to you that we 'd approach the writer foundation with an expression of interest to do their foot out we 've just heard last week from rata that we 've got through the initial processes so we 're down to the final stage or get funding application which means they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governance they will assist and our business being a really good look at what we 're doing it 's a big commitment and you know we believe really strongly bits and bits that have a successful outcome for us so that was very good news just quickly that figure again we 've given you some detail and fronting on those figures it was taking it to a full furnished top level cafe etc and then allowing us to rent fully there 's also a that money isn 't there the tenant comin on board may do the Fed out and we 've had offers of that as well so that 's sort of again leaving the community of no dear on the day of opening yeah and we 've had talks also with the Department of Internal Affairs so we have further funding options in front of us but at the moment this is what we 're looking at and really the sooner we can get this building the sooner our community can start working on the rest of it and we can get it up and go in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together we can make this happen exactly thank you you know you 've actually answered some questions that I thank some councillors head how we going for two hun really happens three and a half minutes so we 've got some time for questions Ali question looking at the budget what are the what Sunday brunch that 's a significant amount on there what is that at all okay so that 's and setting up a regular event on a Sunday where we have some live music playing so it 'll be sunday funk sunday souls and ideas that kind of thing I 'm part of all of this as a mentoring program through so we 'll have young people working with them musicians will also have young people and in the barista section of the cafe and the cooking section of the cafe that are working alongside the cafe owners the cafe people are really really enthused about that and so what we will do from there is because it will bring an increased income because of the nature of the food that will be served and then we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cafe people about this we we will bring in and come from that so that 's based on that happening every Sunday for about 40 42 weeks of the year and we already have the people lined up was like that yeah the things in this budget are the budget is we think really realistic in terms of expenses in terms of income this is very conservative versus stuff we 're already doing we know is going to happen and the tenants have already I 've got people booking out dates every every wednesday from seven till nine you know for Saturday 's a year for a concert we 've got people absolutely lined up to come in the local toy library of the local choral society to work it out of how South Brighton and already have money in the budget to pay for office space and we 're about to move out of the office space in the community center there and you know this is a conservative budget this is not as growing or developing any of this much beyond what we already know is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospitality design this is realistic and we consulted with one of the young owners of some of the best cafes in the city and conservators figures so again community expertise as associative gonna give switch switch legs like a license is that is that going to be an issue with here look a license yeah so mister ed that 's a good question and we don 't want a fully licensed premise this is about community activity first and foremost it 's about social gatherings for our people as well alcohol will bring us money we 're very aware of it so we 've how do we explore around that and the best thing and that we 've seen so far we can do is to take up the licenses where you get a certain number of events for a certain number of people per year special licensing year so not for each of it because it 's expensive but we 've ripped out our yeah that we can do it that way and then recouped that money back and quite easily and then make extra money for the project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour not at all no right not we are we as I said Ford strengthening to as close to one hundred percent so change a use becomes possible which that would be we 've also taken usage figures from the different usages so we 're going to know the traffic and that so we 've talked to planners and ready to put in a resource consent for a bar if we needed to we 've got the data again we just need to own offense yeah no I 'm we 've done jointly with you haven 't seen any other questions yes one question these are three stages for instance if consequent of funding today purchased the house then you might have a hand assess maker strengthening and the for building filled out am i right total time for hot model of making the engineers 2 o 'clocks afternoon yeah thank you a year that depends on the other funding straightens a year at the maximum the thing is we

NZ,NZ,Christchurch City Council,Christchurch City Council,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZETwErnCvvgbvBbnnHfyxA,25.08.16 - Items 16 - Social Housing Assets Lease to Otautahi Community Housing Trust,1rJ3e0k7Eaw,20160824,1619.549,"Christchurch, New Zealand",4252,no to conflict council lonsdale Vicki buck and myself as trustees will be taking any part in this discussion ah ah decision okay stand down very much as we move to page 265 of the agenda and we 're going to take principally most of it as weird and obviously we 've got the staff here to our sole pile of questions there was a minor amendment that we are suggesting to the to the recommendation and I 'm not sure delegate it 's up there community and really it reflects at the moment the we believe the trust or the chip will get its registration at later in October we are suggesting that due to have been a process really that 's beyond their control have done everything they can do to do it we believe it 's an automatic process that we enter into the lease we 've also added a date to the start of the lease we can sign it at any time but at this point in time you will have seen a copy in the agenda had a blank to be confirmed and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I might hand over to Carol and then to Robert to go through some of the least one of the things i would say is there 's been very good work between ourselves and the trust to get an agreement around the lease and i do appreciate the work that 's been done by both parties really to iron out any points of disagreement to get a good point i also reflect the work in the financial world that 's been done by our finance team as well not sure jason whether you want to come up here or not but yeah so just to endorse this has been a real team effort and you 'll see from the 123 almost works trying to have pages of resolutions thus the significance of this lease is that it ties together all of the Esper ations and resolutions of council over the last three years in terms of establishing this trust and in this lease we have negotiated really closely with the trust as they said during the deputation and we 've made sure that the spirit of the aspirations etc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security of tenure for our tenants and also that the assets are protected for council and so there 's many clauses and here that of course is the trusted were the subject of robust conversation and we believe that the trust that the lease represents a well-balanced document and assures the future sustainability of the portfolio and in fact the furniture in the para grand the option one in terms the financial implications there you 'll see that we did quite a lot of due diligence on the financial model and we updated that so just to assure the sustainability of the portfolio going forward the lease of course is a very substantial document you are given a copy but we also really appreciating the the size of the document have also provided on page 13 16 a short shorter summary of the main terms of the lease I don 't propose to go through those and detail over assuming they 've being read but we 're happy to take questions if required we have involved we have had external legal assistance with the negotiation which has been lengthy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just to ask any technical questions if you have any around very good um Yanni thank you thank you for the work that you 've done on this um just on page 317 protection of existing tenants it says that the rent for all existing tenants is to a certain line with Ministry of Social development 's income-related rent subsidy policy do we have a copy of that whole thing and what I 'd like what 's what 's in there so the Ministry of Social development 's our rental policy is in line with reach seating for the community housing social housing sector and it 's generally the lower quartile of the market in a particular geographical location which approximates eighty percent of the market rate in that so it 's a below at the market rent in various geographical locations across New Zealand so I was just trying to understand from that Clause whether that means that the rent could go up quite significantly if our rates were at fifty three percent of market at the moment and MSDS policies that are at eighty percent then what happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a cap of no more than five percent per annum so it 's not clear on team which I 'm has presidents the general requirements to comply with the policy but in any year means can 't go up by more than five percent so we 've tried to balance and protect tenants by having that absolute cap right so our tenants likely to see if and the work that we 've done around that develop on the msds policy a five percent five percent five percent until it gets up there on those those are those are matters that the trust will need to determine on an annual basis what we 've done in the lease is trying to give expression to an earlier Council resolution that we particularly build position of the tenants as far as possible was reasonable and so this is the mechanism that that we have negotiated you to deliver their protection that doesn 't mean the tenants will eat so the increases of those levels every year those legal decisions for the truck and then just um in regards to that policy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the level of rent but related to things like security of tenure or as I only just of how you set the actual ring isn 't this is a wetter asleep to the rent CJ okay thanks from the other question I wanted to ask was just in regards to 222 questions around the way in which the trust reports so is it possible to ask the trust to report to the community boards not you know not on a regular what um you know in terms of we had a policy where the housing unit would report to community boards every six months there 's nothing in here that I can see that requires reporting to community boards have we thought about some mechanism by which that could happen well if not we haven 't and it 's not in the lease I 'm sure that well it 's something we could certainly talk to the trust their success in our successor pretty much linked together so certainly I think they have got that intention but it 's not something we 've written in as must do but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the trust and talk to them about that 's right I think that would be good and the second one was it was briefly mentioned around the focus on tenants involvement participation but again I didn 't see anything in the lace that required that is it possible to ask the trust for what something that would enable the tenants you know a tenant 's Advisory Committee attendance participation model that is developed and that you know as as part of this agreement I would personally like to see that happen we 're certainly working with the trust to date I know that in their policies they are fully expecting to have you know tenant involvement in participation to 2 to the 4 and I think they were going to be too happy to give more specifics around that as they begin their operations so can we require something in the list that parcel in the service level agreements well it would be possible it hasn 't been discussed to date and so therefore it doesn 't appear in the lease that is something that we could discuss as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ element under the good industry practice around that coordination in using of your tenants you 've got to appreciate that it 's a fairly diverse group going across a number of areas we again quite happy to raise up with the trust is going to be ongoing liaison between ourselves and the trust anyway as we move forward so basic Kate has just put a note here that type of arrangement with tenants is a requirement of chip registration so it actually comes through through that formal process okay great and just the final question was just around the health and safety of both staff and tenants is there any requirements that we have around the ratio of staff pertinent or any requirements or unhealthy and safety that we 've gotten all this in terms of tenants and stuff so again thats related to the registration how the community housing providers I 'm had to determine the operation policies in line was best practice the the we have given information about our current ratios and other ratios and I understand that the staffing of the the trust has been arranged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the classic City Council so there 's a lower staff to tenant ratio and the health and safety plans etc of counsel at cetera have been shared with the trust in terms of ensuring safety of staff and tenants sorry just just so we 're clear the ratio is the other way around the other way around you yeah yeah yeah so you 're basically saying they 'll be more Star Command yes apologies for my yeah I 'm Ali I just I have asked and had thus answer but I want to do it here in a public forum to have it on record and for clarity the council 's transferring 50 million dollars worth of land and assets held by the social housing unit to the trust could you just explain why that is not shown in the lease and also the issue around if things did turn to custard and the return of those assets were was facilitated that there would be a five-million-dollar component of that that wouldn 't be returned and that 's not shown in the lease as a risk could you just explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it might be recorded the the lease of course is off the operable social housing units the lease doesn 't transfer any ownership of assets to the ship at all it simply leases them for a period of time and obliges the chip to use them for social housing purposes the 50 million is a separate transaction it 's a distinctly separate transaction and we staff are working on two reports to come to council hopefully on the eighth of September specifically the first the largest report is specifically dealing with the 50 million dollar transfer so that is that reports coming to council second reporters the first tranche of that so in a very short time council will have a staff report recommending how and when that transfer will work and how it will be structured but it is a separate and distinct transaction from those reports will explain the mechanism by which that is a great way to make a recommendation to Council to to to to to use a particular structure it will also cover security of course in here in just and on page 3 17 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and respect of any dwellings which the council is proposing to dispose of to an entity not wholly owned by the council so would that not be either party because that them could you explain it because it 's to the Trust 's discretion as I read it to agree or not to degree to agree I thought would have been the other way around but I may be wrong obviously I have been wrong several times before in my life don 't know it 's surprising I will Carolyn Todd Mel 's rights okay I think down yeah so that isn 't laws 21.4 of the lease and I think you 're right i think that is actually in here and the lease that should be the lease or discretion that 's I think consistent with the discussions we 've had with the with each other I can tell you to we just made your choice you think like a change very good all right um okay well we 'll open it up for what would someone like to move the resolution says I 'm end up there gleam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glean if you would like to start off see immediately in the life of and the history of the social housing portfolio for the council this is arguably the most significant move it will ensure the future financial sustainability of the portfolio the modeling carried out by Deloitte was considered conservatively based and it did indicate that this would work the it 's been a difficult position that we 've been put in by virtue of the fact that the income related rent subsidy is not awarded to the council so it is awarded to another public housing provider being housing New Zealand and it 's registered to other community housing providers but not us so this is why we 've had to make this move what I would suggest while our housing policy is still live that we perhaps look at the two-way subsidy approach to with that between us and the government and the fact that we offer subsidy by way of DC rebate with housing development I think that 's a strong argument put in the future over trying to pull back there 's an our favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with now and I would seek your support that we move to this I 'm pleased to hear the questions over the tenants at the end of it this is what it 's about and we have very good relationships between our housing staff and our tenants and I 'm mindful of the fact that we need to do whatever we can to ensure that that transition is as smooth as possible you see the high level least summary on page 316 and that really draws us to what this is about their that it is at least we retained the full ownership but we 're having to lease to this entity in order to receive the income related when subject it is just how it is it 's not perfect but we 've retained ownership and I think that 's what matters so I seek your support on this again if we look at the life of our whole social housing portfolio this is really the chance to reset the clock and to get it back into a sustainable position thank you thank you Nani well yeah I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note just around that request we 're just debating oh you can move in a movement partway through a debate did you when did you well yes you can so just to know I just want to noted the request for consideration of how the trust could report to community boards I don 't see what you 've already had an undertaking from stuff you don 't need to have a resolution well I personally want a record of it but anyway I 'll just move into back then um so this is basically that getting near the end of a quite a lengthy process there 's been a number of reports as you can see from the council report that have come back in front of council namely that when we consulted with our community we did actually make the decision which we 've since changed or revoked that we wouldn 't establish this entity unless the government actually allowed us to use their income related rents game for the existing tenants and obviously that was rejected so I fundamentally have disagreed with continuing down this path but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views have been expressed and today really is about just basically continuing and I don 't think there 's much use and voting against us today would put our tenants in a much worse position I do think though that the idea that we 're ineligible as a council is fundamentally flawed and the fact that we 're relying on a government subsidy to increase rent or top them up to market level there 's a very unsustainable approach because basically what it does is it encourages rinse to go up without addressing the fundamental underlying issue and at some stage the government will not be able to continue subsidizing people to put rents up higher and higher because they will run out of money themselves and I think we 've seen that with the reluctance to give our current tenants access to the scheme but having said that I think we need to look at the opportunities that this new model allows and I hope that things like tenant participation and involvement as Rhea 's really strengthened I hope that the health and well-being of our tenants as first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we 've heard that we 've had some assurance around things like ratio staff ratios but there 's also a lot of other things around holistic provision of services around I think some of our tenants and some of our complex as that hopefully can be explored previously we 've been told that one of the requirements of the agreement with government was that you couldn 't provide wraparound services but hopefully those things can be changed so um I will support this today because I think we do need to move forward for and give certainty to our tenants about how things are going to be managed and run but I still fundamentally believe that this is not a good sustainable approach long-term and at some stage we need to go back to central government and have a much wider conversation about the idea that instead of just topping up things to put rents up even further I actually have a holistic housing approach that doesn 't doesn 't become unsustainable in the long run so thank you to everyone that 's been involved in that I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note that the community boards will get some sort of reporting then hopefully that can just be taken on board and captured in some other way strongly supportive of the recommendations I just want it noted though that I believe that in terms of community board involvement that there 's no doubt that each community board would regard any area of social housing like and trick them the same as any other can sub community or smaller community within the community so I 'm strongly of the view that although community boards will be involved on that basis as they 're involved with an e community that in fact there be no like special requirements or obligations to the trust or to the tenants around any social housing complex that count so have responsibility for but it 's want to make that point because I think it 's important in terms of you of tenants rights and air obligations but i stroke my I strongly support the recommendations that are here Jimmy staff recommendation because I first read our reasons the first one you know the lost a kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have the experience of confidence for taking over these candles so is also gay becomes opportunity partnership with the wider community to provide these kind of a services let 's first the reason second is these trust eligible to apply for the income related rental subsidized if a council-owned popular we are not eligible so we can seek in the wider the source of a funded the stir when the particulars regular the finish of the implication here is look like no any additional of extra counselor the costa because why if in a beginning no based on the day profits or 12 million dollars but increased for the 19 million dollars per annum then for council steer you know are taking to account for the major maintenance on the end also the refurbish of the placement so I think I petite a concern elisa street the kind of the issues i agree these the recommendation thank you thank you I 've just thought I 'd close off the debate by first of all acknowledging staff that have been working in this area because I mean this is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new chip and we have confidence and the proposal that going forward but I think it 's appropriate that we acknowledge staff for their incredible work in this area and the and the people-to-people contact that really has been the that the life and blood of the housing service that we 've provided as a council it was back on the twenty-seventh of february2014 that we passed a resolution to go out for a special consultative procedure so this has been through a really good process at some we 've engaged the public and a conversation about the process that we 're going through but but I want to make two comments about about the encumber lated rental subsidy first of all it is bizarre that only a council that council is the only not-for-profit entity that cannot obtain the uncommon related rental subsidy there 's something fundamentally flawed with that thinking so central government pays it to itself through housing New Zealand central government will pay it to the chip for new tenants they won 't pay it for any of our existing tenants as they transfer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me it 's a floor and thinking it 's thinking that I mean central government 's made it perfectly clear that they want to opt out of public housing all together they 'd like to sell their public housing 22 really anyone that would take them over the preference obviously is in the social housing sector but they shouldn 't be so directive around a city that 's been engaged since 19 21 when we first received a special loan from the state advances office to build eight houses on council land and huxley streets in them you know and actually that 's an incredible record of provision and there 's something flawed about central government saying local government can 't make this decision for itself and there 's something wrong with discriminating against local government having that social housing provision but that being said that is the policy of the of the government and so we do need to create an environment where we do gain the best access to a state subsidy for because it benefits basically the ratepayers of Christchurch we 've kept this completely ring-fenced as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our social housing but the rest is ring-fence so it doesn 't cost the rate payer money to run our social housing but you know i think that i would i would actually agree with this anyway i think this is a good move I think it does enable us to focus on what we as a city can do and how we build that wraparound support service for people in our social housing units they will get better access to wrap around support because of the other agencies that sit with the church and that to me is beneficial and people have heard me say this before the Illinois community would be more than happy to take the state houses from central government and be a property owning community trust that provides for its community with its community by its community not just on behalf of through a state agency but through the community as its own community group so I 'm very supportive at the sci congratulate all of those that have put and so much hard work I 've welcomed the members of the community housing trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our counselors that cannot contribute to there 's a debate Vicki Andrew and Paul because I know that you have also given a lot to this whole process so on that basis can I put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no Kerry thank you very much,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Housing Trust to the to the it to the table thank you I think you dropped something there yep no I Tim 's going to follow up with them so you 'll come back with a recommendation won 't you tell ya no sorry I could say I win pink Underpants first probably not appropriate yeah apologies for not being as colorful as the previous and previous group so therefore my sweet dreams as well I can 't offer gifts either and like to thank the council for giving us the opportunity to think in advance of the council making a very important decision to lease property the social housing to the edge Atari Community Housing Trust on antares Skinner on independent trustee and chairman to my left I have Pam sharp also independent trustee and my deputy chair and to my right I have Katie anywho CEO I thought I might give a little bit of background on where the trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will talk a little bit about the importance of our values and our vision capable then cover some of the details to the work that we 've been doing specifically writing to the lease and then I follow up just with a question for the committee and respect of the recommendation that 's being put forward by council staff so we as independent chair trustees of which there are four of us were brought on the end of December with a very clear mandate to establish a trust to gain charitable charitable status to become a community community housing provider with the ultimate aim of taking on the social housing that the council owns and a lease agreement and continue the good work and potentially improve on the the good work that has been done for the residence of Christchurch we commenced our trust meetings the end of January and we met and have met weekly since then it has been a huge commitment not just to the four independent trustees but also the three councillor trustees have been councillor Turner counselor but councillor lonsdale and we 're a group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing for social housing in the city and and we have come a long way in six months and achieved a lot we along the way we have taken advice from experts in their field and part of the registration process to become a community housing provider we 've worked very very closely with the Community Housing Association the in fact they project manage style process and we are very close to getting that status as a community housing provider hand over to pan to talk a little bit of a division of values thank you it 's such excuse my voice I have picked up a bag from a priest score yeah yeah ok so i guess um we just want to acknowledge you know that the council went through a long and thoughtful and significant process to decide to come to the point that we 're in now and so when we came on board the decision had been made to as to you know that there would be an independent trust and we have a trust so we were all very excited about this and starting from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of transparency and openness right from the beginning we set ourselves our vision which has to be a major contributor to those people who need support with housing and Christchurch and we thought it was really important to set our values and that in our work streams everything we take back to our values and our values are meaningful partnerships honesty and integrity and ocean accountability respect and celebration so the key things I guess for us at this stage alex has talked about how we got to the stage is our responsibility to our tenants and that we want to have a totally smooth transition over from the council to the trust and also we think it 's really important to build on tenants tenants engagement and and work with the tenants you know as to how we can improve and you know have good relationships in that end the whole social housing field in the city so Kate 's going to talk a wee bit about beliefs thank you very much for the opportunity to present to you all today I 'm very fortunate to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can say that everyone that I 've come in contact with in the trust and through the recruitment process have been equally so enthused about the opportunity to provide tenancy management services to the citizens of Christchurch who actually are in need of social housing we 're thrilled at the thought that we are picking up the city housing portfolio I suppose the document in front of you today is the lease agreement between counsel and ourselves and we have worked very closely with council staff over the past four months I came on board in June it 's been a delight to actually meet people and have robust discussions around the table about the best way we can have a lease agreement that not only protects the social housing portfolio is a very important asset of the council but allows the trust to be independent and to be working to the very best of its ability to provide very very good tenancy management services so we we 've got to since I 've come on board is picking up on the work that the trust were doing the trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the community housing aot or or who have actually been our independent experts who have advised us on how to go about the processes of registration as a community housing provider we 've also spoken with the regulator regularly we have shown the regulator a draft of the lease we have received feedback from the regulator as to the important things in terms of achieving chip status we have submitted a very comprehensive document to the regulator that went to the regulator in July and we 're now waiting on the decision it is of course a formal process that has up to 60 days for their decision-making to occur but the regulator is aware that we are a very large chip and that it 's very important to us that we work with them closely through this period while they 're determining our status the other thing we 've done in between putting forward our our submission for chip status as a few other small things we now have a team of almost up to 20 s staff coming on in the next two to three weeks we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of experience coming to the trust as well as other people who are really interested in this opportunity to do something of social good people in Christchurch as well as that we have our systems ready to go we have a premises that we 're about to move into so really we 're just at this stage doing a background we 're working on induction for 20 staff making sure they 'll have the tools of the trade and they 'll understand how to use them and really looking forward to our go live date which at this stage is the third of October so just just in respect to that specific recommendation that the counselors that you 've got in front of yourselves and there is a request by staff that it 's that the lease is signed subject to chip registration and we believe as a trust that we have done everything we can to maximize in fact guarantee enough guarantees the right word but to get chip registration but there is a formal process we have to go through we 've had conversations with the red later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took on the feedback the first time we negotiated and dealt with council staff to update the lease because it 's really important that any documents any legal situations that we get into the regulator is comfortable that we meet their requirements as a as a as a housing provider for the regulatory purposes so as a trust we would welcome the opportunity for the least to be signed and we give you as best we can the confidence that we will get registration as a chip provider so we request that the lease assigned as soon as possible to enable us to move the next twenty percent them that we need that 's were 80% to the way there we 've got the systems without the people we got the processes in place and so we can go live on the third of October we 've given one minute for any questions but welcome to take any questions please may have occasion sir Huntley the new stock is therefore hanging over the council staff where the transfer to party i was entrusted then especially in the other kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most mostly or maybe more effective or efficient okay we welcome to any staff in the city housing unit to apply for positions there is at least half a dozen coming some have already started we are meeting weekly with council staff and working through a quite robust transition plan so we 're fully confident that the way we 're working now will allow the tenants on day one to experience a smooth transition it 's Nikki and that is exactly 0000 so thank you very much and we 'll move on so thank you very much for your presentation will invite staff to take your place at the end of the table because I 'm sure that there are some questions as we move to thee to the actual paper itself,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

that South you brighten it got dressed up for the occasion so sorry about that we have the christchurch fairy circle which would you like to come forward i 'm told that Vicki back might be behind the sir always the moat box box I know you do we love box pops no I would never say no hello I 'm Lily Pierce Lawson from the Christchurch fairy circle and we are community group whose joy whose goal is to bring joy to Christchurch we are here today to ask for a fairy festival but first I would like to tell you a bit about our group in achieving that what that we do things like visit the hospital every fortnight and make crafts with the children and leave theory gifts for children who can 't come and visit us we go to public events and give out Theory wishes and we organise free public events like fairy pet max one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough for us to have a fairy festival a day of magical fairy entertainment for the whole family we are not eligible for funding is we do not have a legal status but we are just a group of like-minded ladies who volunteer our time our goal was to have a one-day event with the games area a stage area with bands in magical marketplace which would have been free to be in but stallholders would have needed to submit photos of the decorators tools to show that they would truly look magical we wish to be able to have this event heaven but it 's too big for us we sell fund and we have worked out is just going to cost too much for us to do for the foreseeable future but there are a lot of advantages to hosting a large fury festival currently the largest on record is around a thousand people so would have a huge opportunity to break a guinness book record there is a huge international theory community a lot of people who were travel to New Zealand to come to a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free of charge and would be willing to help out at any stage of the planning and organizing theories are a very popular theme and many children love them and not just girls we have a lot of boys who attend our picnics and really enjoy themselves I think this would be a great thing for Christchurch fairies hold a special place in many people 's hearts and I think a fairy festival would provide a really magical day for a lot of people from Christchurch and before i finish i would just like to share some feedback and this is from Jill one of the ladies who and we saw at the hospital I just wanted to say thank you so much to you my daughter has cystic fibrosis and was at the hospital today a new wave to her when we 're getting into the left and it absolutely made her day she is still talking about it she gets very nervous going into hospital for procedures but now there is a chance you were there she is so excited to go back you 're amazing you honestly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we would really love to have a fury festival and christchurch this is great have you every Weaver coupled up with the the doctors you know the clown doctors no we actually we only occasionally visit the wards you have to because of what how sick people can be on the wards yeah you can only go to people who aren 't in isolation and you know it it gets there 's quite a lot of um yeah hidden workings inside the hospitals that and we do occasionally go and visit children who you know it 's yeah meaning yeah Tim um have you thought of you know buddying up rather than having to do it yourselves budding up with like a tibia speak the tibias picnic or whatever so you could have like two events side by side both complementing each other but also making it easier to deliver um we have in our purpose we were planning on fundraising it completely ourselves but um we were all volunteers and we run a lot of events we ran a picnic every two months and we do a lot and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ask I know that these events you know you plan things like high school sparks and things and even if it was something like New Year 's Eve in the park had a theory theme this year that would be that that would be a big mean a lot and I think a lot of people kids go to news even the park and things like that and that would yeah yeah so um well we 've actually been questioned by our festival Events Coordinator working group cheers so um what I 'm going to do is connect to the two of you and I think that perhaps if if you can make a presentation to the to the working group then they will help you find your way through a process but it 's just it sounds fantastic so yeah yeah and I just I love the fact that it 's bringing joy to people 's lives it 's what people need peace yeah well we um and we bought I bought along are we I hope is nothing brisa everyone but I 'll we guessed instead I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good yeah I Rob you actually kind of

Tim 's going to second it so we have a mover and seconder I mean what the the video is actually we saw it the other day the environment committee meeting it 's actually shows you all the detail about the actual filter that 's going on since your VoIP interest me you 're quite relevant and it explains a lot about how that literally route to them resting screams hey but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as an intro to the video that hit play oh sorry yes it just as an intro to the video this is a good day councils are quite well aware there 's a good deal of interest externally and internally about improve water quality and the vehicle council 's using to plan for that as our stormwater management plans three plans have been done and one another ones in impress progress and all of that all that planning indicates that we 're going to have to deal with on road contaminants and the the treatment device that is going to come up on the video in a few seconds is one of the best practice options for doing that so and that there is also the that 's also the options being recommended in the so just I 'll start this video that shows it 's a schematic videos showing how one of these things works it 's not working here either quite like works of her name is it hey we can do it a blank screen when you make this last weekend you don 't know just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a living stormwater regulations are increasingly calling for more robust treatment levels in addition to the removal of suspended solids many regulations now require best management practices to remove significant amounts of nutrients metals and other common pollutants found in stormwater runoff to help meet these regulations contact develop the stormwater management storm filter a stormwater treatment device comprised of one or more structures that house rechargeable media filled cartridges at track particulates and absorb pollutants such as dissolved metals hydrocarbons and nutrients during a rainfall event storm water enters the structure through the inlet pipe and is directed to an energy dissipator to minimize resuspension of previously captured pollutants during the treatment process storm water passes through the filtration media and begins filling the cartridges center tube when water reaches the top of the cartridge the float valve opens and filtered water is allowed to drain at the design flow rate a one way check valve then closes activating a siphon that draws polluted stormwater evenly through the filter media and into the center drainage tube filtered water than discharges out of the system through the under drain manifold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the hood air rushes through the scrubbing regulators releasing the water column and breaking the siphon the turbulent bubbling action agitates the surface of the filter media promoting trap sediment to drop to the vault floor this patented surface cleaning mechanism helps restore the permeability of the filter surface during drain down and between storm events the filter media in the storm filter cartridges can be customized to target site specific pollutants for example in applications targeting phosphorous contact developed phosphorus or the wrist is advertising pretty good there 's a good dinosaur fossil I 'm i I don 't I don 't have any more prepared to say I was I wasn 't expecting to feel questions I 'll talk if you like but so but this is a pilot so it gives us an opportunity to trailer and gives us an opportunity to think about the overarching cost of us for the next day people yes that 's correct I think we 're confident that we know that the technology will work but we 're very interested in in operational costs yeah and of course we 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end yeah yeah thank you I really applaud you if I 'm thinking of you know new technology to use it 's great I was just wondering in a wet weather event but a storm Levin what happens with the raw sewage so in terms of coming in the storm water system in terms of this device I I don 't think there are any overflows in the catchment that this device will pick up that they there are there are wet weather overflows that activate occasionally but they usually more directly into the room I might be wrong about that but I don 't think this way in the Boston area when we had the really bad flooding I 'm the mirror and I went through with gum boots and even though you could see the kind of officers that was on in the storm water you 've asked me a question that I just can 't answer specific so I 'm really supportive of this and I don 't want to hold it I 'm just worried if raw sewage gets into it what happens it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it if it 's solid it 'll get trapped in that chain if it 's very minut it 'll get filtered out so it 'll be a better outcome than otherwise so this is a much better outcome yeah yeah and it can cope with the King cope with Sir Richard the kind of event that you 're talking about yani would be a major event so you 're obviously getting anything overflow maybe a gully trap overflowed if you 're thinking of a property feeling we just get diluted for a start so this system would be able to handle probably the system 's the most pressure will be that first flush and that 's really where the major pollutants come from you storm water system and so this is really designed for got a nice clean filter at that point in time of cleaning out that first flash because that is always the biggest pollutant load from a stormwater system so then it drops to the ground and then periodically depending on how much builds up we didn 't have to eat d the salt that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around every system and cleaning every one of so hopefully we bring it to one surface and it 's a lot cheaper option with a bit of quality up huh Thanks yep all right i 'll put that motion although sake i also put me speak to it you 're sorry i think the thing is that um you know our council is committed to improving the quality of our waterways is reflected in our healthy environment outcomes which says water quality and quantity is protected this is going to help us to address there in addition as you see where we 're up for am renewing our resource consumed while getting a new one and the conditions are going to be quite stringent in challenging to meet unless we do something to clean up the water before it enters our waterways so if you combine that with the cultural expectations of our partner night our who and it leaves us with the extra obligation to clean up the water before enters the waterway so this belt bells Creek stormwater pilot will provide us with the data in the cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stall more around the city if it works Center for people produces the results that we want so that we can markedly improve the quality of our stormwater discharge into our waterways so personally I find this really exciting we know that people are really upset about the quality of our water and our waterways and it 's the wrist retrospective waterways as stormwater infrastructure that 's the challenge to to fix and I think this will actually give us some really good starting point and hopefully you see more of them so I really applaud the staff for the picking up on this and getting an option for us to go with and and I hope that the objects comes in as a manageable Eagles that we can I look at doing some more to thank you okay all right I 'll pop that motion all those in favor say aye as opposed they know that carry this,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Interchange,6BAYKXn7SsQ,20160811,628.92,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1746,done glenwood bus exchange that come through from equally fearing me yeah thank you very much so we 've had ongoing concerns from residents about the bus stop in the area and affect the meeting that we had we decided this happen to be about three days before comments in the paper to crying the stage of bus stops in the east so the timing was really good there what we 'd like is that the council explore options for building a cabin integrated bus exchange in lynnwood and we 've had some information about the potential for shifting it and clearly straight into the more space there we 'd like that to be one of the options looked it not just simply the same ones I 'm like who 's road they have been upgraded recently when the process being upgraded to larger edl shelters which have a higher amenity value and rubbish those kind of things to help limit the anti-social behaviour but actually this is the fourth busiest bus stop in Christchurch and it 's really not fit for purpose currently and so we 'd like council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else if Sony we would hit discussion we 're to take this either through the infrastructure transport Environment Committee you need to do some work on this and then through to the joint PT committee would be that if it stays on back be right back please Rodin doesn 't involve any master of changes that that 's completely appropriate but if it looks like there 's options that might and require other parties then it would need to go on career there afterwards well bearing in mind that we 're actually trying to get these interchanges inside the malls now and this could provide an opportunity to actually investigate the feasibility of doing that there 's a report on let him hear ya because that you were originally kind of referring it through to the public transport committee but because they don 't have the delegation that came in we have yeah we were very clear we weren 't sure where the delegation eh no it 's not so much with the delegation layers with a whether that makes some sense for the joined up committee to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going to be just dealt with an isolation I mean if it if it involves moving the bus routes that would probably need to go beyond the actual years ite committee and council yeah but we 're not quite sure if it does or not yet so would it actually go through the mall with us no we initiate our initial request was for information looking at the potential to shift up to within the mall space staff have come back with some really clear information saying that that 's really not easy and may not be the best outcome in the cranberry street section but that doesn 't mean that there aren 't other options that involve them all especially is council owned some land within the current expanded more I the old library xiety lien would this be something we might want to take to a workshop it was a joint committee perhaps would it be better i studiously think that a workshop with the community board and the AG committee and the first dance dance might be the way to go this is vaguely because um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures and I really like having pictures but it doesn 't really show me what the vision is you know what there is no vision we need options but the problem with going into the mall at this point in it and it seemed to pass them all is that the mall has limited opening hours yes you know the bus has come on it 's three row down Buckley 's road which is a very direct line and on that key corner heating through the east mmm and so it 's your debuting through the more ads time but it 's also a G doesn 't have very much oversight and the hours of the malls not open so it might be but what 's the passenger traffic light we 're cool busiest and when I move not open yet because people are heading back to Brighton and stuff through there so it 's quite yeah it 's still busy in the evenings no no evening yes but the malls open and the evening is open till six six and eight we don 't have information on the specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friday here to these you thursday and friday right yeah and I mean and oh the countdowns open countdowns open till team very much the warehouse is open till midnight Sarah neither the warehouse is to wait when I no no it 's not later than that ball anyway but the point is is that yeah what do you think about a workshop with lately yes he end the in the community board yeah yeah and stuff we need to look at some options okay so it needs to be Hiram so you can we encourage change that the that a workshop I don 't know comprising the IC committee and the Hagley ferry made community board be held to explore options for and then just yes so to take out the council and leave the rest of it as it is no no oh no oh sorry did you eat okay right yes delete yep is that all right can you read that does it work I did you were trying to place it oh sorry we 're trying to fix that they just decided that they were like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're on fire maybe the bulb anyway that I workshop comprising the AG committee and the Hagley fearing me community board be held to explore options for building our cupboard integrated bus interchange in lund would be a very good outcome but it will is there anything further to the workshop though do we when is the outcome of that 's only having a workshop or does that workshop then decide no no it would report back so the question is the question is who it would report back to and I don 't want to predetermine that because as you say it may be that there 's a change in bus route required and if that 's the case then it does need to come back to the you 're definitely appropriate with a report it well I just don 't want it to stop at the workshop that 's not going to stop a fictional I mean that would um do you really need to say in a resolution that it has to report babe in order to get it to report there it was an expectation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't we say with a report back to the will report back to council and then we can we can direct where it goes to from there there go all right so who would like to move it what I fault Yanni and seconded by for the other daddies I yeah just to say um you know I think I was probably too optimistic through our district plan that we would get integrated transport in terms of large-scale developments in our city look if you look overseas what you can see is a number of moles actually have integrated public passenger transport terminals and I think the mayor made reference to possibly the opportunity at the palms which I just think is is such a no-brainer it 's just you know these places by up local areas residential properties rizona they either increase their footprint and yet there 's always nothing that goes back in the way of public infrastructure despite all the problems that become with the huge increase of people using these sites so it is really unfortunate that this has been around for a very long time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report in 2008 actually suggesting that east gate was the number two priority or was in the top four of suburban interchanges and it was actually property on the other side of Buckley 's road that was available with the old gas station used to be which is certainly nothing developed into housing so you know the longer we lever the less opportunity we have interesting not the consent that 's been issued for the mall in terms of redevelopment actually made comment on the bus route and the design actually is such that it means the bus or it has to be rebooted a bus stop relocator to occupy the site of our lease library land so should the lease expire that renewal there are no alternative routes available on the plans to accommodate the bus he can were notified and they were supportive of that so you know we really need to take a holistic approach to land use planning around these big activity centers and I think having integrated public passenger transport facilities is that is definitely the way to go so let 's not delay this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the suburban interchanges which meant they fell behind but this is one of the top priorities and I think we can get a good solution if we engage with the mall as well and I think I don 't know whether in terms of that workshop or briefing it it seemed to me that actually engaged with the mall is critical to us in terms of their plans and our planes so I support this I think it really makes sense I think we do need to think about strategically how we can get these things in place rather than just relying on us to always come up with the worst case scenario based on other decisions around poor land use planning very good i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye Oh as opposed say no that 's Carrie and then we,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

up my turbo road so he could cross the road to catch the bus because they go both ways yeah I 've been picking up and and the postbox was on the other side of the road plus the pub plus the doctor so everything was on the other side of Travis road from where he lived he lived on the corner of Daytona or you die yeah hey that 's through the Daytona small set of them yes I know it 's further down so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been on the books for years I don 't know what goes on and off okay no it wasn 't on the books it 's either the was that has been talked about it was so I thought it was don 't be done on one side okay staff could come forward and answer the question as to why we can 't have a refuge visit down my toro road as well so why are you putting this one on can we put one on near the corner of daytona there was a petition that a very active member of parliament top though you had Pegasus community board what their constituent who lived on the corner of daytona and idaho road what happened oh not wear what happened with that particular one in terms of this items if so this item considered the current project this is also able to do at hospital yeah I 'd love to fear that down the road so what we discussed with the board when I went there a couple of weeks ago now was that we have organized a workshop with the HP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some look and some wider issues of the board raised in that the meeting two weeks ago and we can include those wider descriptions there certainly that crossing isn 't included in this current in the current project that 's planned but we can discuss that with the board and they 'll get the board 's view on there along with burl wood hospital and you can even though it 's further down the road even though it 's mohammadi cliff rise sorry you promised that will happen do we will discuss it until the needs which all I want is what I want yes I make a note guys that 's gonna be discussed later yeah David I want to I 'll find out the electrode officers probably still got the details my territory the researchers Leah needs to take it off even featured Vatican do it and no it wasn 't it was supported by the County Board yani how things come one of the positive things to register planners we asked for integrated traffic assessments as part of large-scale developments it has there been an integrated traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean I 'm kind of worried that we 're doing piecemeal kind of intersections without a holistic approach this early have been discussions with the hospital in terms of the traffic management or one of the outcomes of that was the bus route has now been changed to go through the hospital to better suit the people that want to go that the the hospital and wash all with us exactly started yet but it certainly plan to change the route to do that I can 't answer the question because I don 't know whether there 's been an overall traffic assessment for specifically the changes that are occurring at burwood hospital certainly in terms of the merry hell road improvements we have taken on board the comments from put it hazel its weight in terms of the crossing points to provide for the hospital needs in terms of access to buses along that 's meant to marry high road and then when we meet with the board in in September it 's intended to discuss the other issues and the board raised which is the other accesses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that project is in the plan for three years time encompassing within that in Section upgrade any other needs that might be needed in terms of the relocation of services to burwood hospital see I just kind of wonder whether we should actually be saying well the new hospitals going in fact it 's opening officially soon we actually should have a plan so that everything is kind of done it you know in a logical sequence rather than come back in three years time like it to me it doesn 't it doesn 't make much sense III thought when we went to deter there 's no bus stop going in the hospital there 's no interchange or waiting area but is that likely to change at the bus route goes through I have no that 's an issue for the hospital so I guess discuss in terms of the reroute in through the hospital and the facilities that need to be broader within the hospital grounds for the bus so still had a long discussion with the DHB about this and he 's not here so I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen all this money now doing this project and then we basically come back in a few years and do something else because the bus services have changed that sort of the intersection project is an upgrade project yeah well network efficiency and reduced and illini hey Stefan we we want we 're going to have the discussion with the board just to end the DHB any can

happy to taking right so we 've got some 360 minute so they 'll be moved and seconded well but up to me and helped out by angering on this occasion and so I 'll open it up do you need issues you 'd like to raise with us it 's not there 's not much that we 'd like to raise I 'm going to cut about the playground and a little bit about disability and my deputy team whose name I constantly forget Melanie and talked about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me that to sign a beige because it isn 't and the we had a discussion around the playground and back in park this is an attempt to rescue a situation that became an ideal and we the emphasis placed on it by our board was instead of having things that require parents to push kids who sit s ugly we should be having things that encourage kids to play and explore and develop on their own so the parents can hear civilized conversation sitting at conversational tables near to the near to the playground and this particularly applies to grandparents as well who take up so much of the caring and we also change some of the recommendations as to plantings we 'd like kids our kids our children to be able to lie on the grass lie on the dude and look up at trees that their own trees and indigenous to New Zealand I just want to create I don 't want to Priya be with Pegasus but they are talking about the Disability strategy and all the other related policies and I just want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be on the agendas when all applications or proposals are put forward for developments and that they be a box that as is marvy consultation and concerned and we were told that the new templates that were being introduced would not allow for this but I still think that there 's a real game in what comes before the board and the council for in terms of disability being acknowledged for every proposal formally and being seen on our agendas has as hadn 't been looked at and responded to right and I was just going to give an update them because we 've mentioned about the sprain heathkit youth community board and just their members exchanged at both near I 'm elected co-chairs which I was at the meeting which was really cold in a treasurer no sorry a secretary so I 'm what we would like to see and I believe that um Taylor brace from youth voices maybe been to some of the community boards to actually um ask or want to work with other boards to make sure that there are youth community boards throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you know form a memorandum of understanding with our board but I think that they have a lot of good things to say so I 'd like it on to sort of keep open minded about building that within the city because I 've got a lot of energy and a lot more intelligence and a lot of us actually so yeah yeah and then there they really do I 'm better than the other commenters wanted to say was about the Apollo Heath get revenue twix celebrated its one-year anniversary recently as well so helene on their boards been doing a lot of good work on there and just keep that in mind is where i work on both get in John keeping our waterways pain just in terms of that the X the accessibility thing it goes up to fear accessibility and durability you know because it 's right here you 're absolutely right like for instance I find it difficult night i 'm not very disabled but i find it difficult to get up and down those stairs without a handrail yeah but not fit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got three more counselors coming so you know and the dignity is probably going to be up here with the mirror and we 're probably gonna it 's probably going to have because it then frees up a space there because the deputy mayor 's got to cancel sees so too so we 're going we will be changed so it is possibly an opportunity to think about whether we should have more of people able to observe from here but there are health and safety issues that you 've got to take into account as well but they 're not generally in here so in fact the building isn 't very safe for that regard doesn 't every proposal that comes before us we have to remember to ask the disability questions yes Leanne we have to say to ourselves have they done disability accessibility have they looked at the ball is all the issues that 's associated with it and we have to remember that that should be automatic yeah but in terms of that in terms of the building itself I 've spoken to a cup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around and they say that this is the most accessible building that ever worked on their entire yeah so a lot of the work has gone into making sure that it facilitates people you know accessibility for people who work here rather than people who potentially visit here so it 's a bit of work that needs to be done in that regard and but if you look at all of the the counters downstairs they 're all at a level I know I can you know excess so this building 's one of the big ones so there 's one of the better ones but there is still more that can be done I went to the palms the other day and they have they have done an entire reassessment of the entire building and they 've taken out they 've taken out barriers that we 're obviously barren where they weren 't various that I couldn 't see them but but when when you go in there now it 's just opened it up for everyone and that 's why i like the word accessibility because it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people have disability at different times of their life in terms of getting around if you 're pushing a pram it 's the same as being in a whisper you know like so so some of the challenges that people would face in a wheelchair are exactly the faith is challenges that someone might feel after they 've broken their league after us can I just say one more thing to blow you witless only end because I 've been I used the word disability accessibility because the City Council pinch the word the accessible City when the river is a government well the government did someone pinched it so when you try and discuss the accessible City it means that document you know rather than talking about people with really yeah yeah yeah but anyway but I will have a talk to the chief executive about about the framework of our decision-making papers because I agree with you we should be checking for accessibility we do do that as a council here our for our building so whether that 's something that we should be looking at when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we raised it with this playground Princeton yeah yeah and the other thing is is that resilience and regeneration of two other ones but we don 't want any of them to be tech boxes we want them to be real yeah yeah yes um yeah yeah I 'm sorry up your honor your name justice gave me yannis been being on about this longer than I have and it 's you know we any reports we have took boxes but they 're not tick box it 's is actually work done on legal alternative in our a financial etc to put an accessibility is just one of those things that we do automatically as a council the totally logic to me and so I don 't know why we don 't integrate to move it for but I mean as I said yeah he 's been being a lot longer than I do so I mean we 've asked for a regular report on that disap disability and accessibility to go to the chin committee which it 's under its terms of reference as I understand it and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happening but also tim and i have been meeting with the disability Advisory Council and feeding and some of the same concerns that you have so I think it 's really a case of being able to elevate it possibly formula I don 't think we should need to do that it should be in here right but maybe we need a formal resolution that we would help I don 't know the chief executive mark I think think and it 's about the visibility of the things that are happening so some of it will go to cheered some of its just and hearings in the work that happened such as in the consenting process and so forth so Kate 's what we you need is some more visibility about the processes that are in place all right i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye as opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much thank you,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Panel,aVhC9REgWVA,20160810,558.09,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1496,and I know just do a wee bit of the story so far this is something that the community board well let 's start getting letters in as a community that has a very high level of interest and designer appearance matters and that was demonstrated through the master plan and and also controversy surrounding the stand away builder which you may remember a contribution surrounding the London Street upgrade which was a council project and it 's a community that really repeatedly asks for partnership with council and decision making and so the board had responded to this after the earthquakes in particular with the proposal for a designer and advisory committee along the same model as the upper 0 1 which is existent and being quite successful however we were not able to get that one off the ground and so we 've in collaboration with the staff we 've come up with a kind of a hybrid model which is halfway between a community-based advisory panel and a professional advisory panel with a bit of benefits of both and I think that it might work really well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's not very high costs involved because we 're going to invite expressions of interest on the basis that the experts involved will provide the advice pro bono participate pro bono and I 'm optimistic that there will be enough qualified design professionals who make up a pool to participate I mean just really any questions or was that supported by staff they approach yes we work with the chairperson to develop this advice that you see in one ever told we think a trial it would be the best way of approaching this it gives an opportunity to consider how this can work and also learn from a prior to the LTP in terms of the effectiveness and the cost and also there 's been some limitations with the are corolla model has been recognized and that 's something we can also learn from and think about that as we look at the ugly role model would how long 's the trial for 18 18 18 months right yani oh yeah thank you and thank you for the work you 've done on earth how are you measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say is for successful I think is their numbers of the success of the one in town yeah we actually we 've done a valuation of the urban design panel a year ago so we have some criteria that we could apply to looking at this model as well which I think would be a good way of looking at that consistently also it 's also talking to developers and actually finding out how they found the recommendations of the panel and then seeing what changes might have actually occurred as a result of that advice that is provided so did they then make changes or they applied for the resource consent also I think talking to the panel members themselves we should actually go to find how they play on the process were they able to reach consensus give them the mix of skills that they 're going to have on the panel most sorts of factors and we 'll be keeping out any approach to the ground to find out whether the time work out whether the community is reasonably happy with the proposal it was supported strongly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design decisions and could someone to get their horse out of the chamber please now that 's a that 's a big fine actually I think he gets an extra fine on top of the normal fine force anyone that has a animal sound yeah I emphasize which is very risky and the chamber because you 'd say that the nays heaven anyway never I 'm le and the egg yummy I just had a question around what this would mean for other parts of Christchurch as well because I know that there are some areas that feel that their heritage and special menace ii is being lost and do you think that and i haven 't got a problem with that but why wouldn 't for example said no more parts of riccarton not want a similar input accra and lawton are different from those areas in town because they have the special character area overlay in the district clean so that is the reason why it works well in this context personally I 'm if this works well it 's I can see that there 's potential for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well and another communities are interested in rulers wise what would a panel like this actually be able to do to say avoid if that 's what was wanted the building of for example the stand away house well one of the difficulties that the community has identified is that the district plan rules and the design guidelines are constraining the kind of creativity that some property owners want to do and you could have a situation where a proposal comes to the Littleton design review panel which is not entirely consistent with the district plan rules and the guidelines but if it is sufficient if it meets the basic criteria in it is still a well-designed building in the support from the panel could make it possible for something that is a wee bit out of the ordinary to progress through to to concede the Littleton panel would overrule what is currently no no panel has any decision no no parity that only an advisory capacity but I mean overall in an advisory capacity so their advice would carry more weight than what carries weight but it 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well one question regarding to our little tender design review panelists the three of them particular for a professional or architecture where the lost of three is the part of the poor of 23 professional in the city wider urban design panelist the advantage that we that we 're looking for is that people on the panel live or work and lootin and are really familiar with the way the community works and and the history of the place and and and can can put that kind of local knowledge into the decision-making process at the moment if you have panelists from the look from the city urban urban design panel you may not you may not have anybody who 's got the local knowledge so so they satheesh inori 's another way but is qualified it 's also quality yes yes is proposed is to run an expression of interest so any professionals that have the areas of expertise that a call for could apply and be considered for that so that will bring forward people that have their littleton knowledge and experience okay thank you I 'm assuming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move this and somebody would like to second it Yanni and any discussion I 'll put that motion oh I 'd like to speak to it briefly if I can I 'm hugely supportive of this and it 's a piece of work has been underway for some time noting the the level of staff support and also noting the amount of work that paula has put into this personally and the support of the community board as this has gone through the various stages as well so this is another opportunity for local people to be involved in local decision-making about the area that they they live in and work in I 've got no doubt that there 's significant capability within the littleton community to be able to produce the level of expertise that 's required for this to work certainly you know talking about top of the mind issues like the the stand away building the the new Littleton primary school urban design is very much top of the mind of a number of people in littleton and has been quite a big issue for littleton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damage in the littleton town centre and the opportunities for renewal and regeneration that present themselves we need to get that right and the more local expertise and interest that can be brought to bear on getting that right the better and and this proposal certainly allows for that so once again another locally driven issue with good local outcomes that aren 't supporting and I others to do the same I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye quite as opposed they know that 's carried I assume you 'd like to,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

slightly revised one of these Paula no I 've only got what you 've got in your agenda as a so there 's the memo that came from staff which has got a revised set of recommendations not i 'll just signal i 'd like to make some all amendment to that revised set of recommendations so maybe if we could get the new staff recommendation up on the board much it would you like to do that um okay just what were you doing that can I so as a point of clarification um we had a petition that should have been received reverse sleeper okay and you 're quite right we should have received the petition and there 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it we could come back to it after this all and now let 's just let 's just ban will do it immediately after this yep yeah just let them know yeah so I 've only just seen the staff comments via right and I 'm not sure that they are consistent with what the board is recommending oh thank you the board is really keen that the site be gifted and I 'm wondering whether it would be possible to at a resolution which supports in principle the gifting pending a report from staff don 't be good to hear from me so really what you want is that that counsel and principal supports the gifting of the site to the Historical Museum society and that staff are asked to work with them to explore the opportunity yes and and investigate issues and report back to Castle is that what you 're going to that 's exactly what I was going for us so so just in terms of changes guys it should say that counts all so what are you looking at Vicki you 're looking at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you looking at i don 't know new set already on the board up there yeah what we need put up on the board is this new set of recommendations from the anywhere in the from the memorandum the first is what it is now yeah yeah she canceled it so and then if we change that to recognize the council 's in principle support for the gifting of the land at 33 london street yes to that other littles and historic museum society a bit as end it to ask staff to work with the Littleton yep and can we capture in that the the recommendation to above which talks about proceeding as soon as possible just to women it can we just get one with the lunch on the start to explore the opportunity to for it to secure ownership of the council 's property at 33 as soon as practicable yep yeah that cover your point but ok with you Paula yes yeah cool okay and then we 're okay with the rest investigators using options yet report back to council by the community board for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay by the canal ok moved I 'll just get a mover and seconder for so I 'm happy to move yep were we not going to look at if for some reason in the future that ah lame history something happens yes this is sort of Andrews elsewhere yes yes we were going to look at that and I 'm happy for that to be added in we could add that into number three including give the words I 'm so including consideration of how the land could revert to counsel if no longer required for this purpose in the future yep hoping that it doesn 't happen but just it 's just a yeah we would probably expect it to be part of the report anyway but it 's worth specifying here in as much as has been raised so including options on how the land could transfer back to council in the future if no longer required by the museum yep for this purpose yeah or maybe just if no longer required by the museum yeah that 's fine okay Allie I have a question yeah go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value maps of the land other interests potentially in the land why is that because that 's going to come in the staff report that you 're asking for here in item 3 but we are essentially supporting the gifting of the land so without any of the information in the rents of class hmm yes there yep right so so wide why do you need the land to be gifted as opposed to peppercorn rent because it puts the museum society in a better position for fundraising what does that mean does that mean you want to mortgage the land otherwise I don 't see that it makes any difference does we found it with the each week awkward they couldn 't raise money for the tool air in the land that doesn 't give security fund if we give up whatever and I a lease or something for peppercorn rent well it 's not enough I just don 't understand why would needing to gifted and this is a special enough for if I don 't know if we 're allowed to give more than right in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right it 's not so this is bob this was moved by Andrew and seconded by how 's the big endeavor you felt right okay we 've got a properly person here no dan dan did you want to speak dan might be able yeah I think other to help I 'm just leasing pieces is it so what 's the difference between gifting if you 're not going to other is saying in regards security of tenure the 33 year term relates to and if you 're leasing a portion of the land anything over 33 years requires a subdivision and the RMA but if you 're leasing the entire parcel of land in the the 33 year term doesn 't apply I 'm in relation to secure it in you you know you are correct you could look at look at a lease and people come basis for a long term and with various renewals if required that is an option and with this particular property here and you talk about value the value two years ago was about two hundred thousand dollars that 's not overly substantial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably do sit in the background we haven 't yet explored that will be explored in a report probably staff have been working with the local stories in society for a number of months and we are progressing this anyway and report would have come to the community board and subsequent Council anyway just as a matter of course is there any other interest in the land we 're not sure we haven 't got there so you can ask okay right okay can we now debaters or no more questions thanks Dan right Andrew I 'm I 'm hugely supportive of this this is a perfect example of a community organization working with the council to bring about a really good community outcome you 've heard through the deputation this morning the amount of work which has been done the amount of skill and expertise which has gone into this project to date the fact that the museum society is essentially reinvented itself and really taken this on as a challenge at a time when you might have expected a volunteer organization would have run a mile from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first of all like to commend the work done by the museum society in preserving and cataloguing the collection and also progressing this project at this point what we 've got here is an opportunity for a community owned building on a key council-owned site in the center of littleton in the commercial center of little term an amazing opportunity both for the museum to have a key site in a good location with good footfall far better in fact than the site that it 's and it had previously down on Norwich key and secondly a great opportunity for the further regeneration of the main street in little turn with a key facility a key community owned facility right there in the center of town what 's become in fact the the civic end of town as a result of other work that councils down alvian square the recently reopened recreation center of a little tin library which is under a full refurbishment in fact almost rebuild in part at the moment is absolutely the right place for the museum to be so given the opportunity to to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeed I would like to think that that 's what we as a council would support and what we absolutely would want to do and here we 've got something that can be held up as an example of how a community group can be working with counsel to deliver a fantastic outcome not only for that organization the Littleton museum but also for the Littleton community and in fact the wider Christchurch community because when you you look at the value and the significance of the collection that this building will house if we look at it in terms of the the maritime artifacts the Antarctica artifacts other unique things that have got a real history with little term it 's entirely appropriate that they should continue to be housed in a key site in littleton and have a home there where they can be interpreted in the correct way just to conclude I attended the meeting of the Littleton museum society where the decision was made by the the wider group to pursue this site the level of excitement and interest in this project not only within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other than commendable and I think we as a council I 've got a responsibility to do what we can to see this project proceeds so I 'm hugely supportive of this and noting that the detail will come back in the report and we 've left this wide enough for that to happen I absolutely urge my colleagues to support this wholeheartedly today thank you thank you fell then Paul look I 'm sickening this and what I say with full admiration for the work that poorer and the community board have done alongside the museum society and i know we we know that museum societies got a long history pre-earthquake I 've been there and there 's a lot of artifacts and and things that we want will we 'll want to visit when when this building is all done so i 'm thoroughly supportive of us I think it 's been a really good working partnership we have to keep in mind that littleton really was a landing point of our forebears and that a lot of this early historical information in fact will be available once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all put in place so you know it 's I think it 's a no-brainer but also it 's a very important development in terms of the recovery and regeneration versity and I again I chip Lord the work that were and the museum society are done thank you what it 's going really breathe a lot kam I 'm very supportive of this I think this shows that this museum to side he has actually kept and restored and filed all this historical information for our benefit in the future of who we were where we came from and I think it 's really important and i 'm also a big fan of that if we can actually just transfer the land to enable the museum society to actually fund raise the rest of the money to build this project to me that 's a hand up not a handout approach and that 's a approach to this council is taken over this last term and I 've some really supportive okay yeah I totally agree with everything that everyone said and I agree with Andrew you know we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projects to go ahead in communities however we also have a responsibility as a council to be in for receipt of information before making decisions and I don 't have that information and I 've only heard this morning some of the information that we should have known before including the value of the land what will come back to counsel you there sir okay I kept don 't into it Thank You Vicky and so you know unless we have the information to make the decision we 've also just found out this morning to that because it 's the whole parcel of land in fact a long-term peppercorn rental as an option not the 33 year limit these things need to be considered we don 't know who else could be interested in the land I totally support what the museum does and I would like to see the museum and a home soon but this has to be done properly and fairly and I don 't think we have the information I certainly don 't to support this resolution swimming okay right yeah no I support this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposed to the leasing that 's what we tend to do but you know I 'm not that fast it 's not a hugely expensive site but you know I think that the museum is important the feedback I had from the cruise companies in Sydney last week was they 're very interested in what 's going on in Littleton as well as the city and to have a you know a decent museum expressing kind of the maritime history of little to me quite important as a kind of a tourist attraction so I think it 's a great job they 've done so I 'm happy to support that Bob would just like a little bit more information around there the land in terms of leasing or gifting okay can I put the resolution can I have a right of replies and move you just very quickly I just want to address me well minute yani has a chemistry yeah okay so just some sweet quickly I 'm really supportive of to a sure thing that 's that 's fine i I 'm increasingly concerned that this council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I do worry that it does leave that 's quite exposed particularly with the new local governor which the purpose is really to make sure that we 're delivering cost effective services and high quality infrastructure to our communities or something similar so it 's just like we have to actually be really clear that we go through a test in terms of options in information and agreeing to things in principle when we don 't have the substantial report does worry me so you know I don 't yeah I mean I I don 't object to this i think the the proposal the idea makes a lot of scenes but i do wonder why we need one when we 've requested to it does seem a bit premature and we 've we 've been asked for one so that 's the writ that 's the recommendation but yes you have the right of reply Andrew thank you and I just wanted to comment on a couple of the issues that have been raised I mean what we 're doing here is asking for a full report by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have all of the full information that 's required to make that decision including detail around value a clue including a process around identifying other interests and what the necessities are there around the gifting versus leading reverses releasing a full report that picks up all the issues that have been raised today in terms of the synergy issue that ref raises with the other opportunities that Littleton presents at the moment I 'm very cognizant of the way that the museum society of work collaboratively with it collaboratively with a number of parties on the waterfront and in the town center and I don 't doubt that they would be happy to have a conversation with the cruise industry with the port with whoever was appropriate clearly little turn as a whole we need to be a success and we need to work and the more collaborative approach we can have between port and town which really is the whole history of Littleton anyway is gone a bit a bit for the benefit of the whole thing so for those who are thinking of voting against this because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the further information that we need to make a good confident final decision I would urge support for this so that we can get to that point as soon as possible okay thank you i 'm going to put it that those in favor please say aye aye those opposed no you vote recorded early so Ellie 's vote recorded against ok let 's past,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Zealand",4840,25 which is item of the Hagley pyramid community board and we 'll invite Sarah and Alex how about we just do this item of yours guys and yeah yeah yeah um Alex was going to talk to this one okay um I just want to thank everybody for the deputations this morning outlining issues associated with the consumption and the location and proliferation of fast food outlets not only in lynnwood but throughout the city and as a board we fully support the points that had been made here today and the concerns we had a recommendation to put to council but felt it was overly broad and we understand it is hard to define low socio-economic areas and the term fast food but as tim has said there is research that has been done overseas that we would request stuff to look into for more information just one point I 'd like to reiterate as the fact that it is five times more likely for fast food joints to be cut around schools and with that being said staff have helped us put together a more targeted recommendation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back as soon as practicable on options available to and tow it and central government to limit the location and impacts or prevent the establishment of fast food outlets in close proximity to schools or other sensitive areas in local communities thank you and that 's obviously got the support of the entire community board hot okay well whether there 's are four of us here today I think it sounds rated just just a point of clarification to the process I believe it um the board cart makeover vice recommendation list as a former board meeting but certainly the council can yes yeah when we move uh so call an argument so the recommendation from that community thing remains as it was but what you 're suggesting as a possible way forward is that the council adopts this recommendation it 's just looking for that yep as there are any questions of Sarah or Alex oh just that I 'm assuming that in terms of what your your suggestion that that in fact arap which basically is around that issue of a school in schools that you 'd also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unhealthy food in a wider foot wider basis as well you 're selecting would you want to add that to the recommendation I think there should be a way of believing the other issues well in the recommendation is given that this can 't come as a community board recommendation without the community board meeting and this is going to have to be a council council recommendation anyway so if you want to prepare a minor change to it will come very well in conjunction with the yep the Colleen and umbrellas I was actually going to just question the wording the year in the last line in close proximity to schools or other sensitive areas so sensitive as is not really qualified and I wondered if we could use the word out of the Health Act and say or any other areas where they would cause nuisance okay now because mutants has got quite a few definitions are here and it might cover what so cameras work out what the resolution is going to be assuming that people are generally happy with what Pauline city 's resources yep I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at things potentially like health centers yes and thanks as well and I don 't you don 't that we can support at least I guess so Pauline your suggestion would be that at the end of it it says in close proximity to schools or any other areas where they wouldn 't cause nuisance what a reference to the health net so that is who the hell 're you need a reference to self yeah so there is caprica console send interesting nuisance so I 'm just waiting for jared or just because um so and the reference in the health egg do you have it this is in reference to the New Zealand legislation healthcare 1956 it 's part two okay and just like if you put in the brackets brackets at the end of nuisance and local communities brackets referenced defiers to find in the healthy 1956 1956 cut to part two number 23 thank you 1923 yep sure okay yeah right okay you 've just been overruled Pauline so what would you prefer because um sensitive doesn 't mean anything to me mr. brain operation so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be able to a staff questions yeah but when we come up with recommendations and a product that this is revised but no problem I mean I 'd like to connect your staffs response to the deputation so we made this morning in terms of what possible ways for them okay is it Helen who 's who 's answering you need the questions haha Vivian okay tell us what the question is yani and we 'll deal with questions first other South question so if I just say the way sister cover obesity and smell okay two things that okay you guys want to come to the food is there anything else that you guys want to say not relation to this one okay thanks guys what all do is bring some stuff and we 'll just deal with questions first if that 's okay and then we 'll clarify the resolution okay so the first question is the wording you 're suggesting Vivian that that it stays as the wording that the community board people head I think if you and tag it to nuisance and the healthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just said a nuisance and not refer to the healthy that 's potentially okay be right so if we just take out as defined in the Health Act the ped in the brackets we good with that you good with that Vivian yeah okay cool any other questions of us guys oh yeah you go first inning games I mean yeah thank you um so the lintel because the people that made it touches I haven 't seen the memo that came around to us which has got some you know it sensitive information so I just um in terms of what you 've heard today I know we 've kind of had some advice at the board but if we wanted to do something about this problem if we agree that it 's a problem what what are the ways in which you think we could address this well I think one of the things in terms of stepping back from the specific request and the exploration of regulatory options we could also look at the champion approach so that the City Council champions for healthy food across its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also looking at this at the moment so we could do a combined piece of work with the district health board and have a healthy food policy across the city and that that would come through in Council facilities at council sponsored events in similar sort of things do you think there 's a need for us to get another report to come back with some kind of key decisions to be made around this issue like going through a district plan change going through the help no that is um point of order and I would like an answer question from the start I just I just like for me like there 's a number of things that we could do just a plain change a national policy statement by government on obesity including regulation of fast food outlets and Health Act by law or local government act by law but I guess what I 'm trying to understand is this resolution specific another and is it anything that you know we should be it 's the Suffolk around doing in the short term to get the US dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those things and the in terms of investigating and putting together an approach under the district plan or under the bile or making powers we would come back to Council on that with an indication of costs because that 's not a trivial exercise okay so when can we get that okay well just women it can do you want what it be sensible to add the champion is a lot it okay so if somebody want somebody maybe you Vivian works up the wording for and looks also at the champion approach and it 's all surrender developing a healthy food policy to that was a reference it 's just trying to understand what we can do now some heavy threat to be added but I want to know like could we write to the government now for example asking for a national policy statement on Abby city including regulation yeah I think what they 're saying is that they 're going to come back with all of the options and head and come back with all of the options you can choose which once you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for getting that week back to us week um what are you thinking ham in terms of a time for this report to come back it just says as soon as practicable so I think we need to go back and work out continually lashings would you like us to come back to the community committee or would you like us to come back to council it a bit good yep through the community committee yeah yeah I certainly happy to pick this our council so well we 're just to cancel anyway we just have to look at the time table so she within election with the elections coming up just yet September for our next meeting right but what 's the agenda cutoff date personally like okay not wait another two it says as soon as practicable and we get out and andrew is sufficiently interested in this that he will if necessary hold a special counsel special cheese meeting yep or otherwise if there 's a timeline that doesn 't work because of the elections and therefore it 's beneficial for this to come back to Council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we can have that conversation once we know what the timeline looks like yeah um I 've just just thinking it through would you like to broaden the in that number one if you want to talk about the the healthy food and the champion approach on your end non-regulatory options and your top line yes is my question with it being broad enough for that so as it is on that top line yeah topline it secure the memo no no no no just go back to the top line in front of options regular trillion enric okay oh you could just about copy of the text of the memo we 've received on us to vivian just on that front first line where it says on options regulatory and non-regulatory said okay with you yeah and then add the bullet point about taking the the champion healtheast of the approach in central government to one limit and to prevent and then three looking at adopting a champion approach yeah healthy human healthy City Alyssa tgp it 's a number seven in our memo we 've received we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're all good Liam did you have any more food it was just over that whether that would provide for a more proactive approach with it Oh Kate laughs so I 've got Ellie Phil ref at the risk of causing more talk about this than we need fast food is still a concern for me as far as qualification goes I mean are we talking about huge global corporates are we talking about somewhere that is quick to serve something and high fashion high sugar I mean I think that 's incredibly and though do you want to just put unhealthy fast food outlets and I appreciate that that does not define it particularly either but some fast food is well is it about the speed of the food or about the food itself as it fast or is it unhealthy food I think I think it 's part of the work we would scope but identifying they actually acai prevent the establishment of i would say unhealthy food outlets to cover it I don 't know whether fast okay well as food is the assembly room we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is fast food so I think if we just work as fast that 's good you 're going to get that okay so I don 't think we 're going to see in this council meeting defining fast food but just if we put unhealthy in front of it yep well it 's about it the messaging is unbiased as unhealthy we know it doesn 't actually define the line the same toilet and get a bag of apples but in terms of messaging everyone knows what they mean okay well and then rest could I just ask staff Christians around the winnings us to make it positive and like for example including and the concept of developing a Christchurch developing a healthy food policy that we include those depth tombs and and also from a wider perspective across the city not only learn what given them the issues they are incredibly sad and serious sessions but there are more implicit since the rider city to so that it in the report you give us that you will give us information about the number of intensity of fast food and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what to does what I wanted if in fact though we should be clear about the development of a healthy healthy food policy for SME that 's all and in ask me so I 'm assuming it 's look at their deception you 're the champignons cavity okay okay Rick yeah i mean my question really was around the definition of healthy food because i 'd like to explain it it 's the work that 's going to have to be undertaken best a bit well if gonna have to do some kind of scoping and look at what 's happening overseas we 're going to have to do a little bit you know we 're going to do some research we 're going to have to identify what what 's grouped in other places come back to you with what has appeared to work you know in other situations and come back to you with a menu of options because this is very different to say liquor stores which spacey liquors liquor yeah i could see how you could come up with a planning proposal where you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that kind of stuff would probably solve the issue but I think you know you 're delving into something that 's quite unsolved learn in terms of defining what held from who but the Ministry of Health does have some guidelines and they 're working with the district health boards on healthy food guidelines and there around the usuals of minimizing fed salt and sugar so it 's this that 's another very basically basic stuff okay thank you if there 's no more questions there is one more at the community what we asked if we could have a copy and consent that the KFC got because my understanding is we can actually control drive-throughs through odor and traffic has anyone done that because obviously the risk is that you know within the next two months all this comes back more fast food outlets open in that area I 'm not sure which is consumed to you after their consent that then the consent that was granted for the KFC to operate opposite to the school it and what the odor assessment in traffic assessment was on that right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it being notified as well can 't can we is that all the questions guys okay can I open it up thank you very much indeed and can open up for debate and you 've now got the resolution in front of you okay clean oh thank you um I 've got a confession but here I want to use it to make a point I 've lost some weight recently by cutting back on portion size and eating healthy food yesterday I had a fall off the wagon moment here 's the fall off the wagon moment I 'm just going to be honest with here it 's been half an hour on a treadmill and on my runkeeper ever I 've bent off over 400 calories my family then brought home mcdonalds for lunch the chicken and cheese burger amounted to 392 so that soon overtook the treadmill the large fries with 398 calories the large coke was 223 so I didn 't go to the gym again I never caught up for the rest of the day this is the sort of stuff we 're dealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a former New Zealand basketballer we do these things when we give the kids medals at these events he talked about the obesity problem in South Auckland and the fact that fast food is a lot cheaper and more accessible for a lot of families based on the fact that fresh fruit and veggies is far more expensive in New Zealand so I think if the government isn 't going to do anything such as taking GST off fresh Fred of veggies we need to be proactive so we 've got a lot of reactive stuff up there I 'd actually like to see the council further promote the resilience network work that met Morris and others are undertaking but also resource through funding the fruit and veggie cops which continue to grow in our city so the way I look at this is in the regulatory side of it there may be some limits but we have to keep chipping away at that but we also need to move into the projective space and do something about this obesity is a huge problem in the eastern parts of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to start promoting the good healthy stuff people who eat this stuff it 's a long way back those calories here to spend hours running to Iran really hard on that treadmill to get to 400 and half an hour so this is what people are up against and I 'm hearing some hums and hoes but actually it 's a really serious problem it effects brain functioning at schools I have a brother who 's a principle as well he will tell me about that and support it so I think we might think it 's too hard but it 's not too hard we just have to keep getting at it and keep doing all that we can ok any other speakers for then Andrew than Yanni oh that 's pretty quick it 's not just a crisis probably as a new zealand problem and i was pretty cool to find out with the third worst in the entire world for obesity so I 'm just really glad to see that if we accept this today that this council takes a lead on it and we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think that 's the important part to take the first step to resolving the issue and doing something about it hey it 's Paul entry yeah I totally support us taking a leadership role on this I think it 's essential that we do what we 're able to do when we be bold in this space I fully support the points that were made in the deputations and I actually thank the people that made the deputations for coming along and making those points so clearly it 's been really good to hear everything set out so so clearly for us this morning and what we 've got here is a harmful combination of unhealthy food really compelling advertising and also cynical positioning of these type of outlets in lower socioeconomic areas on main roads closed schools and so on the report requested in this Lucien certainly allows us to progress the discussion and it allows some informed debate that takes into account overseas examples that allows us to debate more fully the definition of fast food and where we really see the problem lie and so on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon as possible I 'm very supportive of this and urge my colleagues to support its annoying and just before I ask the next speaker and I should have gotten somebody to move it and see can do I do with move pulsing did yani right thank you Yanni who our next speakers go thank you I 'm thinking I too want to acknowledge the work that the people have done in the local community to bring this to our attention both from the children the schools in the local MP these are people that are standing up for their community and I think there should be commended for this championing what is a really serious problem not just in their community in Christchurch and across the rest of New Zealand and also the world I think one of the really important things is that this council has a proud tradition of leading New Zealand back in the 1970s just four years before Vicky buck became the youngest counselor at age 19 by my married at City Council adopted new zealand 's first building insulation by law that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is progressive that actually can champion solutions for the rest of New Zealand and we should be proud that that is our tradition but we should also continue to do that as we 've been asked to today so this is difficult and that point has been I think well made by everyone but actually it 's also very simple it 's whether or not we wish to stand up for our community for our children for the help of our city by taking a more regulatory approach to these sorts of activities no one 's saying then fast food from our city well what I hear the request saying is actually react to put in place some regulation that actually makes logic and make sense and that is about getting better healthier outcomes for I personally think we could do more today but I appreciate you want to have a fuller report come back but I don 't think we need to wait a long time before dealing with it ironically you 'll remember when we did a deep district plan review when we started that process I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and organs road and I asked us to do something about regulating fast food outlets and that wasn 't met with much support and now we 've got a district plan review that means that we almost have no control over our district plan because we have to go through the minister 's but actually we should think about controlling odor control and signage controlling traffic impacts it 's our right as a community to set the land use in our city and I think we should continue down that path and the final point I want to make is that a quote from Fast Food Nation I don 't know how many people have seen it it says today 's fast with industry is the culmination of larger social and economic trends the low price of a fast-food hamburger does not reflect the real cost and it should the profits of that fast food chains have been made possible by the losses imposed on the rest of our society the annual cost of obesity alone is now twice as large as the fast food industry 's total revenues so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can 't wait we need to act and we need to act now before other fast-food outlets open in areas close to our schools and in communities that have no say and where they can go but actually know that the damage that is occurring is seen firsthand by the medical professionals and and the families associated with those costs so this would actually save government money so I urge government also get on board and support what we 're doing today thank you thanks Jenny ah David did you want to speak thank you look I had a little bit of difficulty with the resolutions here earlier on but I 'd you generally support the thrust of where we 're going and I 'm pleased to see that we 're looking at regulatory and non-regulatory options for me I think in many respects it 's as a personal choice whether you frequent these places or not and as a type 2 diabetic for over 10 years I 've struggled with blood sugars and and health issues and with relation to diabetes and it was probably only about three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was faced with the prospect of becoming type 1 and a needle that I 've changed my lifestyle well quite dramatically and like Glen I 've lost a bit of weight maybe I 'm only said a quarter of an hour and I treadmill and 50 calories but it 's all good having that haven 't had a coke for probably eight months and I avoid carbohydrates like the devil at the moment but yeah so I think we 're not going to eradicate and I don 't think that 's the intention of eradicate in fast food L threats l outlets but I do quite like the option of championing better options at at these institutions I go to a number of fast food joints where I can get a healthy salad and I don 't have to have all that all the junk side of it so I will support this this remet today I am concerned how far we go down the regulatory path in the city and what implications that will have in terms of cost and bylaws and district plan changes and that 's something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that we need to be as a city championing better and healthier options and there is a problem we need to address okay thank you Pauline just very quickly look we know the difficulties and actually trying to turn around something that 's already here but I think one of the best things that 's come out of this is our decision which I hope we 're all going to support to to champion the healthy City approach to the extent that we will vote on our choice of food with our wallets and I think that 's where we want to go so we 're not forcing people into anything but by actually learning about healthy food reaping the benefit of eating healthy food and pulling away from that addiction of these fast foods that we will end up voting with our wallets okay thank you it looks like it 's going to go through almost unanimously I 'm thinking I just want to reflect on the what Jared and exit as well that starting on this road we had but I think we 're all aware that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you realize of course that the lollies have now gone okay I 'm going to put the vote and it was moved and seconded I 'll put it those in favor please say aye aye those opposed carried unanimously right,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

how would you like to we 'll all go come together okay so welcome everyone Gerald you just organized them I 'm Jerry from number day of primary school Ruth Tyson her local MP was going to be alone today folks representing the lumen community in relation to the spirit of fast-food outlets increasing spirit fast food outlets in the area particularly in close proximity to schools early childhood CDs and family traces gathered up a cushion of recent time and so Tracy is going to speak first appreciate your time thank you just so counselors we 're normally a petition would be allowed five minutes so I 've allowed these guys at least 15 and if they go over yeah welcome everyone Tracy do you want to stop no start they see that it 's not a problem my name is Tracy Charnock I 'm a concerned mother from Lynnwood Ionesco and after I noticed the cows a been built showed across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this okay you can see the advertisement straight from the classrooms in the playground and one source orphaned or you can smell is the smell of chaos see I 'm inside the school gates but I had no idea this grass they had been reallocated for the school and what 's out there I put my concerns out there to social media to say if anyone asset Phelps the same way as me with a huge response on the side to speak to the principal or to find that schools don 't actually have a say of what gets built on the proximity of the skull so as a mother to me this is quite concerning communities and schools are all about promoting healthy eating yeah unhealthy cares they can filter straight across the road from my son school with no consent to me this is very contradicting so I decided to go to the media about this and start my petition as a mother I encourage Hathi aided in my homes schools promote healthy eating in schools and communities are working together for healthier community yeah I feel this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a school no restrictions no limitations and no consent Lynwood yeah there 's a low socio-economic area with toast schools in the area and a cluster of fast food established you Roma still be more I don 't know if you can see and hear the school is down here all this colored dots all the fast food outlets clustered around the scope who 's wondered at Montgomery and behind all those clusters is the supermarket having a low socio-economic area with low income I understand the struggles of eating healthy quest feeding my family within a budget five-minute as easier sometimes giving in to the convenience these fast food chain set forth a majority of Lavina in these areas do struggle with lack of education budgeting cooking skills transport and lack of time with added stresses of trying to provide for your family to keep them healthy there 's not a lot of exposure to healthy food options and it 's more expensive to nurture your child then just fill them up we 're sent to beef quite a loosely better when it comes to the health of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today including Christchurch about fast food outlets clustered around schools has found that fast food outlets are 3 times more likely to build within a low decile area but what 's more concerning is that they 're five and a half times more likely to build within the close proximity of a school they don 't build an inny section by coincidence the I 'm marketing motives for where they built and a number of how many are getting built is fastly increasing another study in New Zealand conducted in Christchurch about the clustering of fast-food outlets around skills shows that over a 40-year study in 1966 to 2006 the median number of fast-food outlets over this time has increased from 1 to 4 and yet going back to my concerns earlier about the lack of healthy food options supermarkets have decreased from 5 to 1 this is all with an 800 meter radius of a skull or compared from Lodi so areas having highest significance compared to the higher to sell areas these results speak volumes when it comes to their targets and their marketing I also just want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health risks living in low social economic areas and more than others compared areas the amount of fast-food restaurants within a close proximity of skills this is significant worldwide excluding cultural fetches of course there 's a relationship between all three and this is a concern as New Zealand has one of the highest rates of obesity since my stylist petition these fast-food outlets and since my stylist position these fast-food outlets been built in close proximity else talking to people in the community and putting it out there through the media this has created a fast response and a new discussion of thought I 've received a large support and favor of this concerns that I 've addressed today I 've a total of 779 supporters 134 online and 645 on paper I have it all printed out sticking to employment all the comments or the online comments and in favor of with meaty and significant health issues user interface and we are on the rise due to environmental exposures we need to come together to make positive solutions within the environment we are exposed to by making a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an 800 meter radius of a school especially on low decile areas can eliminate health risks and children 's by not being faced with the daily fast food advertising scene within a school we all been taught about healthy eating in schools for choices convenience and temptation of the addictive foods by an out of sight within the school radius goes schools and families and communities the power that to endorse healthy aid in without being contradicted or undermined by this unhealthy let 's out of sight out of mind for these cats and most of all I guess people are say my recommendations to the council is to use the Health Act section 64 bylaw supporters AirWatch as improvement and promoting or protecting public health and preventing abating nuisances part two to make bylaws under for the purpose of the set in any other authorizing making fire laws for the protection of our house where their local government at social cause beer which is protecting and promoting and maintaining Public Health and Safety and there 's been a lot of impressive results over the globe and Dublin for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ran schools that 's just recently in 2016 also California I don 't know a year ban on youth fast food restaurants and the Community Health Council has published a report that cites that and half data showing obesity and diabetes rates had dropped between the time of 2007 and 2011 follow-up a year later a community health assessment in 2012 followed up a community health improvement plans they put in a healthy food zones so this would allow existing restaurants to continue operation but then fast food license and licenses in those areas close to schools there 's a strong relation and correlation between issues raised to do with a children 's low social economic areas cluster of fast food chains built and close to schools worldwide similar issues faced resolved and banning future stores and in the area building too close to schools promoting healthy food zones and making bylaws and zonings these countries are below us and below us as we have one of the highest rates of obesity and health risks after the area children are willing to to make restrictions to protect the half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our district plan to restrict the fast-food from building near schools especially in low areas and promote a more positive healthier approach like the no of like the healthy food zones or the no-fly zones and like my couple like I would like to stand to save a lot of reduction and how thrusts and our children like in other areas of the world that face similar issues get resolved and positive outcomes I just thought to say thank you so much for taking the time to listen to me and behalf of all my supporters as well that are about this and now you opportunity to make a change for the health of our children Thank You Tracy and I 'm thinking me some other people were going to speak as well yep the girls introduce themselves I 'm Kayla Muskaan 's I 'm Harriet home doing some research I found that New Zealanders third most obese country and that nearly one of three adults will suffer from obesity obesity increase increases chances of type 2 diabetes coronary heart disease stroke which is an increasing problem in New Zealand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as sleep apnea these are only the physic problems the mental problems are things ranging from discerning to pair relationships to depression this needs to change sorry the placing of the food chains is just evil they know that little it is a poor area and they placed it there on purpose because that 's where they can make the most money due to certain circumstances I think that the problem could easily be solved by putting a healthy restaurant that appeals to adolescence and maybe having a gym or someplace that promotes exercise for teens and yeah also teaching adults about reading the back of the packet and the nutrition table because they need to know that just as much as kids thank you for listening thank you very much well I think there are definitely too many fast food outlets at escape sex to be precise one of the worst is KFC there 's open right across the road from Lynwood primary which makes it almost irresistible for many students from the limit to primary and then with college on their walk home from school now don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's definitely something that needs to be eaten in moderation because too much of it can lead to a variety of health problems they 're very common in New Zealand such as diabetes and above and obesity so what 's one of the things that we could do to draw people away from it I was thinking and I think that something needs to be opened that would just reduce the amount and I pinpointed the ideas of why the students go to both King and I asked some of my friends and they said I got it for the free Wi-Fi and I got a good food so if we got a place that had free Wi-Fi that would attract some of the students but then it had healthier food options so I 'm not meaning just an apple because obviously they 'd still go to Burger King but maybe if it had fruit but also some kind of thing that looked like a delicious brownie then actually I think that needs to be done just something to change the amount of students that go there because 90% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week thank you thank you for coming I 'll just quickly add thank you for the opportunity to present our documents and the principal little acknowledge started this this year so I know some of you it 's not where we are representing Lynwood but of course not just a limb word problem so there 's two things going on my we want a strong limb word for a strong East for a strong Christchurch but but the wider side I was previously principal at Hornby high school and that was the one with the cows jr. and the liquor license so if this is a wider problem then what we are facing here I would encourage you if you haven 't been to the we would add old ones Road intersection where Lynwood at the school is at go here and see that Bank of multinational globalization and I do get that everyone needs to make it back and we 're a democracy and we need to be business friendly and at the same time the social responsibility that ought to come with it Kayla used the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it certainly made me think about it thank you very much I 'm Jane Hetherington I 'm the medical director of Lynwood Medical Center and we 've been part of the community for 35 years and we see the direct effect of fast food on our patients in Lynwood we 've got a higher proportion of obese and overweight children than the rest of Christchurch we have obese children who have high blood pressure high cholesterol and sleep apnea we see the poor diet affects their learning in their mood we see parents with diabetes and arthritis and liver damage and then we see their grandparents with heart disease renal failure amputations kidney failure and the early deaths 20 years earlier from these diseases we give as much support and education as we can but we need your help to regulate to address the environment healthy choices should be the easy choice for our community regulation of fast-food is supported by a large body of scientific evidence by Pegasus by the DHB by the New Zealand Medical Association and the World Health Organization the World Health uses New Zealand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working and countries who regulate for instance who choose to keep fast-food a distance from school have seen a decrease in obesity it 's a difficult problem but if we work together if you choose to do some regulation you can really make a difference to our community and our city and thank you for listening thank you very much thank you my name is dr. Richard Griffiths I instigated Lynwood Medical Center 's involvement in the current crisis as I call it regard in the burgeoning number of fast-food outlets because I see them as compromising and eroding our mission in providing effective medical care to this community and I would say that 90% probably more the presenting complaints we see are more or less the consequence of poor lifestyle choices by individuals trapped in the poverty cycle this often directly translates into unhappy unfortunate choices for their children day in and day out I am confronted by patients with cardiovascular disease diabetes and arthritis and overriding all is the elephant in the room obesity day in and day out I 'm confronted by adult obesity and have even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see families with very little insight making poor nutrition choices fast food is seen as a daily outing often after-school daily on my drive into work I 'm confronted by not one or two but several and more planned examples of the worst so-called fast-food outlets within a quarter of a kilometer of our Center I am affronted indeed furious at the ease with such an abomination for example KFC is able to be sighted across the road from the local school a cynical ploy please do not advance the increasingly specious argument of personal choice children apart from these eloquent ones here for example are easily led influenced and persuaded by unsubtle on street advertising I am personally appalled by the lacks ongoing attitude of government to the overriding problem of this country child abuse poor nutrition is part and parcel it is not something to invest in I 'm inviting you to show backbone commitment and respect for this community and stand up to these companies by reining in the ease by which they establish themselves without consultation please do not put this in the too hard basket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it comes from coming here and we 're at the currently and Woolston opposite the Ralston primary we will be part of the rebuild with Lynwood and moving down there I 've been charged to look after the well-being and the health of these teen parents we 've got about twenty four on site at the moment some of them are pregnant some of them have children and they 're very concerned not only for themselves because they can 't help themselves sometimes and they are in the same area as these children we we want to become water only and we can achieve it where we are but when we move down to Linwood it 's going to be very difficult for us because the opportunities just down the road are going to be very tempting but the mothers are concerned they want to be healthy they are trying really hard and we 're encouraging them that they have babies that they want in the future to be health healthy and what we 're leading to is it 's going to be worse for them so I just want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somehow thank you very much for your time just close by reading a brief statement that Ruth and would have shared with us if she 'd been here in just a couple of points themselves so from roots I look down and read thanks to the opportunity to present to you today the stipulation is speaking on behalf of families in Lynwood and other low-income areas who are fed up with being targeted by fast-food outlets you want the council to stop the proliferation of these outlets particularly in their close proximity to schools some facts that drivers please New Zealand has the food margin today at all 32 D rate in the OECD and rates are rising the consequence is huge health of the case citing financial costs these Dylan pairs of childhood obesity plans World Health Organization says childhood obesity is an urgent public health concern University of Canterbury research confirms the rapidly increasing fast-food outlets in close proximity schools and particularly in low-income areas the study showed that fast-food outlets are four and a half times more likely to be built near schools and highest and lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an 800 meters of schools decreased by 5 to 1 fast-food outlets in contrast increased by 1 for the Public Health something must be the egg contains provision which gives powers and duties to local government to make bowls for protection of public utilities this is a clearly identified problem it 's an opportunity to explore opportunities to solve this problem and I use you all to take the opportunity we 're not asking for existing athletes to be close they 've opened under the existing rules and have the right to be there what we are asking is that you develop new rules as a solution to this problem just briefly including yourself clearly there 's an agreed challenge and we 've got common goals and usually around healthy outcomes healthy lifestyles everyone 's on board but there to be a brave person to stand up and say I don 't agree with it and we want to start those pathways of healthy lifestyles with children and schools so schools give it their best shot but we don 't have a collective response to it and we don 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ response to it schools go the extra mile I could list some of the things we do around for in schools and so on but you can you can find out everything into and schools are charged with meeting the obligations under the health curriculum schools are also a great place for society to park its conscience we like to leave things to education handed over schools can 't do it on your own can 't do it with one hand tied behind our back because the rest of society the market is before I 'm making other decisions which have developed some extent but they need to be regulated just as we regulate other things in society we do it when it suits us and there 's benefits around property rights or traffic rights or were you confession where you can take your speedboat at a lake or something so why don 't we do it with us it is difficult yes that 's absolutely difficult to do and I know you guys and we 'll have some challenges around it and I know to involve acetal government as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having to find a kidney for an adult in that future is difficult having a child in front of us as a teacher who 's brain development and physical development is interrupted because of poor nutrition is difficult so we 're all on the difficult boat list just peddle the blasted thing and get ourselves some way that 's a bitter outcome for kids I 'm sorry about the ring thank you thank you all very much indeed that was incredibly impressive I 've given that I 've gone so far over time are there any questions yeah I might as well just do away with the time now Ellie I totally support what you 're saying I agree with you entirely with children of my own turn and thank you for what you 've said it was incredibly eloquent especially to you two young girls there my question is where do you draw the line I 'm just thinking about how you control advertising for those or for drinks those V drinks and caffeine full of you know filled drinks as well pies sausage rolls fish and chips how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unhealthy eating and food do you say only big signs from multi Nationals or you know the global caught about that and it could I give you an example yesterday as to what and then we 've recently shifted from these site that we were on the I guess what 's going on our site yet another burger bar that 's a burger bar next to KFC and this burger bar is going to be facing the school I don 't disagree with what you 're saying what I 'm asking is where do you draw the line my response to that would be that it requires really good heads in the room who understand local government or civil government law district plans by law was anything thank you just a question Maci yeah thanks it probably comes as no surprise that the cynical placement of these mixtures of cynical placement is making machines and liquor outlets to a lower socio-economic communities we have data over there so just thinking you know parent to parent when it comes to fresh fruit and veggies do you find you know is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's probably cheaper quicker to go for fast food as opposed to yeah is that a be careful here over generalizations but is that an observation you could make about your area that it seems to be easier for people to well on the main roads there especially the main intersection every corner is like large advertisements for the fast-food there is a count down there which the only building say maybe Subway 's I 'm not too sure what the first subway is that would sow healthy food in a store that 's in the background yeah no no it 's all good that 's it okay thank you just an outstanding marketing very successful models internationally that our leading these guys to the it 's gonna reflect back to what Decker saying around there you know it 's problems a little bit wider than then just Linwood surprises just you better a few with a third worst obesity rate in the world associate New Zealand problem as their question Paul well the question is is it decent what you 're actually asking us to do is to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't seen advertising for sausage rollers there there are very very powerful advertising forces in our faces and they are the ones who are doing the most of damage so I we do need to think this thing through keeping we don 't want to overthink it at the start that we don 't actually start somewhere so for goodness sake as jira to see if we 're all on a difficult both together and there are some things which are slowing us and okay thank you very much you might ask I 'm thinking oh sorry Jenny yeah sorry I think we 're all on the same page with us and I think all of us are really impressed with will with you all today so thank you Tracy you might be best placed to try and help me troubleshoot this one but in a bid to wanting to help what are those countries or cities that have been successful miss how they define fast food how do you define fast food and how do you define not fast food you know there 's McDonald 's ahead Stella volitans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and listen to some extinct as healthy oh it 's a healthy Oh Cheers so we could change this term to unhealthy fast food outlets is it and has it done on a calorie counter way how does it have the success stories do that where do they put that line because we we all want to help but we just want to know how we can iron out those definitions because that 's the tricky part my personal definition is more these and big corporations out there like Burger King McDonald 's KFC those that 's what our class fast food is but also yes you do have like the smaller businesses like fish and chips that are also unhealthy you gotta wait two minutes for him to pop that in or you can just go through a drive-thru you know and like sometimes you don 't get your burger in a minute you get it free I think sometimes they put out there for the marketing so but have we been one if we don 't have McDonald 's with their you know fruit bags and all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish and chip places and 1.00 pie shops and those burger joints that you were talking about because I don 't like that there 's the small businesses in a small way shop where is these other larger corporation corporations a larger buildings large advertising you know and large car parks may have car parks it 's a good really need challenge by the time having the two lines of Klein around if it rules and we don 't know how to get a life but that doesn 't stop us every night I think we all agree it 's difficult it knows the challenges but we 're on the same page okay think thanks Jamie and very last question the last last question from Tim oh I guess yeah if you look very simply I really like what you 're saying that don 't overthink it because the issue is fast food and what Jamie was saying before about you know what is what doesn 't their libraries feel I 'm sure now of definitions and and all the information etc well I think it 'd be really good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us as a council if we just put a pin in each school and do a line so half a carry-out or whatever it was and just for a big circle around each one just said look and can 't hit fast food here a relevant of its definition as it is is what I mean the issue is fast food its proximity to school so everything we 've it 's been 90 years debating the quality of each house doing it Casey da-da-da-da-da and let 's leave it to the experts there are examples overseas it works why don 't we just look at doing something simple is that to start the ball rolling I suppose it was a Christian well it was almost equally spread to principals in the room okay thank you very very much indeed what we 'll do guys is take actually if it 's okay with those are some people what we 'll do is take the first food one first and then your one next it said okay Peter Therese yeah thank you very much Andy okay you guys can go and sit on the lakes and there begins,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Society,pzkb3dQMR0U,20160810,718.69,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1866,"I to raise Aniyah both reason Elton to raise as director of the Air Force Museum of New Zealand at Wigram and I have recently retired as a director of ruffled Landscape Architects our purpose in being here today is to outline how the Littleton museum has feared since the earthquakes and express our interest in obtaining from the council a siphon Littleton 's Main Street for the purpose of building a new museum nakato thank you for the opportunity to speak to you this morning about the Dalton museum journey we had to give you the last six years our journey so far in about six minutes they are conscious of the time and I need to stress that Peter and I are just a representative all the very large and vigorous committee who have you know invested hundreds and hundreds of hours over the last few years in looking at where the future goes I should also note that there are references to the reestablishment of the little Museum throughout the little too master plan document but rather than wait for someone else to take the lead we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're just getting on with it so if I went background the museum was established in 1969 and from 1980 the society rare in the Luton museum in the council-owned former Merchant Navy Center on larch key and broad and varied social history and maritime solution is valid for being unique comprehensive irrelevant and the entire collection has international significance and that all came to an abrupt end when the building was badly damaged in September 2010 earthquake and irreparably damaged in memory 2011 however thanks to the amazing efforts of the luncheon volunteer fire service and this photo was taken in March 2011 so it 's very soon after the earthquakes and the collection was risky from the building and was taken into safe storage at the Air Force Museum where eventually became part of the wider cultural connections recovery center as soon as the collection was safe society understood that planning for a new museum needed to be carefully considered although it have been through a very difficult period the society decided it needed to take the opportunity to look to the few sure and create a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visitors that came to Littleton to underpin this thinking a strategic plan was produced and there are three key to extremes in this plan they 're probably not so easy to see on the screen there the first one was to check catalog clean and preserve the collection it was a key priority the collection had been relatively poorly catalogued previously but I can now say the collection has been checked cleaned stored and boxed and is still in safe storage at the Air Force Museum and until it 's able to be moved into its own your building so far there are around six thousand two hundred items catalogued and available online this is a program called a high and we 've been up to do this thanks to some insurance funds and also from grants and the work of many many volunteers the final batch of about 2,000 objects records will be uploaded to this website in the next few weeks so anyone wants to see what 's in the collection it 's all available in a way that never was previously so there has been some good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step for us was with the building destroyed and collections storage it was important that the museum retained a presence in Littleton so it could continue to engage with the community and a building once it 's gone and the museum once it 's closed can very quickly disappear all together and we were adamant we didn 't want that happen so number one job was to establish a website something we never had before and whole new brand identity was created around harvest stories and that 's the brand will have seen on the title page we wanted it to reflect the wider lyttelton harbour not just littleton port and township it is the whole community we 've done many initiatives including pop-up exhibitions outdoor timeline panel so one of the ones you see there is on the fine line at grub cottage and we 've done digital slide shows the most recent is in the window of Information Center we 've done calendars and all manner of other events to ensure the museum is not forgotten and effect hopefully better remembered there 's also been a great deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business association the port company community groups debajyoti sit around a trial pair key community groups and of course with the community board have been enormously supportive the final work stream was to look at the feasibility of constructing a new building we already understood that the formal council own building was covered by global rather than specific insurance so when it was unlikely to be rebuilt and decided instead that we should try and raise the phones ourselves and we have a human fundraising program that we are quietly confident will generate sufficient capital to build that building we also want to make sure that the new museum contributes to the Lyttelton economy as a visitor attraction and supports and encourages business to help with planning this work her consultant was engaged in arrangement instigations run to taken such as market analysis site analysis and ultimately we 're just finishing off a final feasibility study so as well as considering the original museum site that is site number eight on that aerial photograph we considered more than ten sites we quickly decided that we would like a museum with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up focusing on site number one which is a port company site on dampier bay and science numbers 326 along London Street we had several discussions with the port company but ultimately decided against Tampa Bay because the land was unlikely to be available for some time that was away from the main commercial area and the museum could not risk being an orphan a further development did not occur there and also we were concerned that a museum on the water 's edge could create issues for conservation and preservation and may be subject to risk from flooding to assist our decision-making cost consultants Rawlinson 's provided us with ruffled of costs to develop museums on each of the five sites that we most favored and after we rank the sites for physical market and financial criteria in discuss their requirements with site owners the only sailor is available in which best meets our needs is the council-owned former service center site that 's number three the site is located next to the Littleton lobby which is in the right of the photograph and it is diagonally across an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rawlinson 's estimated that a cost in the order of 3.4 million dollars to build a new museum on that site a Vulcan location study prepared by for us by one of many architects confirmed that the site would work for museum in terms of getting the floor area we require and also to accommodate what the council planus of advisors would be an act of frontage on the on the London Street footpath area in this photograph looking along Easterling London Street the site is just beyond the tree which is on the northeastern corner of the library site a museum on the vacant site would nicely fill a gap within a prime part of a little tense commercial zone and allow the town 's museum to have a high profile we envisage drawing on the best of international museum practice to create a small but highly engaging visitor experience back by professional standards in collection care and storage I won 't run on the detail of our final slide but it sets out an indicative timeline that we have prepared should the Lutheran historical museum society be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a museum on it we appreciate the opportunity to make this presentation to you today in the society will welcome very much your favorable consideration on the matter of making a site available for new museum thank you thank you very much indeed very impressive presentation are there any questions yeah could you just go back to the various sites that slide sure I was just interested in the one the site number two what was the story with that one this that site too attracted us because it was as you came out of littleton and out of the tunnel and drove down norwich key it was a fairly high pro for corner site and we did approach the owners of that and basically we were told pretty quickly that it just was unavailable I they had other ideas for it and is that the same with Nylund turn 9 and 10 no number 9 was the former Canterbury hotel that site the owners would have been keen for us to have a museum there but they were interested in owning the building and leasing space to us at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homework found out that paying a commercial rate would would would not be a goer for the museum at all plus it 's on a reasonably busy intersection perhaps difficulty with access did you say number 10 yeah number 10 that was the former post and telegraph building site that is now owned by the port company we 've discussed that with them and they want to keep that for port operations but they weren 't able to specific about what that might be okay and last question Yanni well thanks I 'm just wondering how you 're on how much money you have versus how much money you need to fund raise the moment we 've got about six hundred thousand dollars in the bank we were very successful in getting quite out of pro bono work from Bullington ceremony to date and we 've already had a lot of conversations with mr. of culture and heritage for example around their new regional heritage fund we expect there to be something in the order of two million dollars here and so reasonably confident that we 've got enough money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have got experience in doing that so it 's something i 'll lead for their 13 okay thank you very much indeed what we 'll do is take the other deputation and then we 'll take your item that 's on the agenda quite early in their agendas so you don 't have to wait around ok thank you very much thank you very good date","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

NZ,NZ,Christchurch City Council,Christchurch City Council,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZETwErnCvvgbvBbnnHfyxA,28.7.2016 - Item  12 - Partial Review of the Freedom Camping Bylaw,DIwwbuMsbK4,20160727,1468.52,"Christchurch, New Zealand",3825,with the freedom camping battle no we 're good who did this some super slide the Andrew yes he was the chair of the panel and David over on the all right so do we have any questions yep thought I just have one and I do I support the recommendations an option one but what I guess one of the concerns and almost like a risk of the reward as I may be on that page is we though we are closing we 're not going to be allowing these places to be available for 50 candles and there is reference in the report that implies and effectively the problem may well just move on and move somewhere else and so I guess my question is are we are we able to look at how we actually work while we do the full review are we able to actually make sure that we do some planning for the future so that we we have some I guess can be proactive to to look at how we manage this in the future too I guess the answer to that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ review dealing specifically with the non self contained camping at this stage but the full review look give us a chance to look at not only all of the Bible but really to look at what other other methods other techniques other avenues you can use to address this issue because of course when you review by law you also have to look at whether it 's most appropriate and what other means you can use to achieve the same or better effect because there 's also the Canterbury regional visitors strategy which specifically mentions freedom camping and looking at freedom camping across the whole of the region and looking at the infrastructure requirements for that so that work is also ongoing not not just through there our by law program though I thought that I 'd got that information that because i was going to share it with everyone but unfortunately i 've only got the reamer as it was put to the LG and zeg confer so I 'll just read from their press statement New Zealand 's South Island councils are called for changes to legislation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated with freedom camping and seek a working group of central and local government and the tourism industry to shape this as an urgent priority what the reamer actually said and I was a little bit involved in getting this in front of the in front of the conference with the support of the mover and the seconder of the motion that was already there which was moved by tasman and seconded by southland is that we need a new zealand wide approach to this from the visitor experience and the from the visitor experience point of view in from the protection of the environment so actually both need to be balanced against each other because you can 't tell a taurus coming unto new zealand we 've got one set of rules in this counts or another set of rules and that council one set of rules in the south part i never said in the North Island one set of rules for dockland and another set of rules for council land and by the way you can 't tell the difference between them so what watch the remit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together and to see consistently consistency across the country between dockland and council denser all public land that the rules are known from the get-go and then the tasman resolution makes good sense because it has a mechanism for ensuring that infringement are actually able to be enforced so I think that was a very sensible approach at local government New Zealand level and that was endorsed by ninety seven percent of the votes cast so there was widespread support for consistency across New Zealand and I think having individual bylaw was not the way to go so yeah David thank you I agree entirely and the joined up approach it 's definitely the better way to go in the short term however we are stuck with a viable approach to it and my question really to staffers i support the the thrust of where we 're going now what what is going to be the impact on our enforcement team in terms of their a their ability to enforce the bylaw and are we we resourced enough to to look after this and do it do we need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having non self-contained camping in quite a wide and large area to look after from an enforcement perspective the area that requires to be covered it is large and that means that practically speaking there is only unlimited amount of resources that we can actually apply to that in terms of monitoring what it does mean is that we will be able to apply a similar approach as we have done in previous years in that we will have an amount of proactive monitoring available and there will also be reactive monitoring to complaints that means that obviously from a complaint perspective we can target specific areas and we can make sure that we send stuff to those specific areas we also know as well through the work that we 've done with our Rangers and also our parking stuff that we can more readily now identify those areas that are causing issues and it means that we can target our resources they 're appropriately so if you want a all bells and whistles monitoring approach it would cost a considerable amount of money it 's not practical given the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly can and will work within the resources that we do have to ensure that we can try and provide is robust monitoring system as possible the reality of it is is that with splitting between self-contained and non self-contained vehicles that it actually makes the job of monitoring significantly easier in a way because you 're actually clearly able to identify those vehicles that are not clusters being self-contained and then take the appropriate action in earlier stage and just a second question then I note in the report that while not directly relevant to the criteria under the bile or the amendment may have some negative impact on economic and other benefits for tourism tourism tourists who prefer free camping options are likely to make fewer or shorter visits to crisis are we looking at any I know this is probably maybe that outside your scope that 's probably more for helen and other than Brendan are we looking at any publicity or other proactive measures to retain the tourists that the clamping the campervan tourist industry in coming to christ church but not as freedom campus what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss to the city for these people that there were a lot of huge numbers last last summer and actually now making christ church in Greater Christchurch a I 'm Zara will place to visit so how are we going to counter these getting that balance and so the predominant effect of this proposed bylaw would be for the non self contained am campus and not within the and the council has a boil all that obviously communication of their boy law is most effective through the mechanisms that freedom campus use which is by anoj the camper mate end and the camping calm indeed website so and if you 've looked at that website what it does is it synthesizes there by law and every other boy law of counselors across the country and to about five lines and it 's very straightforward easy to follow and so what we will be doing is making sure that boy those other methods that the alternatives including the campgrounds in the backpackers that these same people use in other locations with the identical by law so our own area queenstown lakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we need to make sure that we communicate that well in Christ you see ya green thank you I 'm on page just got it here hundred seventy three it talks about simplicity of or greater clarity around the messaging I was gonna ask Fiona to just in terms of will it make for greater clarity if we go for the preferred option over operation as well so we 're just slumming it right down to self contained so it 'll make it easier from your perspective yeah it definitely makes the messaging simpler it makes it much more streamlined and it 's very easy than for everyone to understand and it is very familiar to a lot of people who are really comforting yeah in promising appliances place perspective as well it makes your lives a lot easier it makes it much easier to differentiate between because we can clearly identify those vehicles that are self-contained from those circles that aren 't indeed mca requires the certification for so the certification process is a is a newly new zealand standard enzymes using a motor Caravan Association do administer the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certify vehicles but there are also a number of inspectors who work for other private outfits who are also certified vehicles on their behalf okay jaani so just so I 'm we 're putting us up for consultation we 're not making the final decision today yes a number of questions and comments have been made so this is like the final think so this is going out for public consultation yes and in the relief and the firm that goes out for consultation are we going to hesita front options no can ask or not um it 's actually when you it 's a part of the legal requirement you put out the your preferred option and then insult on the proposed assault on it yeah I 'm sold on the proposal and the proposal is the hot to the south so the question is that we ask people will only be whether they support the proposal not so if people have other ideas you know we heard some of those last time through dedicated facilities for freedom campers to go to war so forth that 's all kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this particular consultation which is just aimed at changing the provision for non self contained with a freedom camping and conceivably if when we do the full review of the bilu we might you know have a more variety that we 're in the proposal but this is a very narrow consultation so just in terms of since the temporary ban has been put implies how many complaints that we hear about freedom camping in the city in terms of for those sites in particular the levels of decreased dramatically to pretty much zero complaints about any of the client particular sites the road in five originally and in terms of freedom camping per se across the district we would probably average somewhere around about any tourism complaints per week but that can incorporate a number of different parameters certainly not the case of abundant vehicles they get reported versus being initially or perhaps people pitching tents in appropriate area and it can also be related other social unrest activity and how does that compare I 'm final question how does that compare to the number of complaints we got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quinta freedom can so we saw in terms of comparison last year not so you 've got different numbers in terms of the total in your people we identify them camping in the district that with the bile in place we actually saw a significant increase in the number of complaints but they were specifically related to the five sites issues that were generated at those sites in the preceding summer period we also have a reasonable a large number of complaints and they were directed again at specific sites and that would examples in the areas in new brighton are khadora so there were certainly hot spots you have been hot spots that have been ongoing over at least the two previous summers and two so complaints about freedom camping are an ongoing thing there is always a residual level of complaints about that activity but in terms of over the summer various religions in terms of the report back to us after the thing can you include a report and the report about complaints so that we 've got a full understanding of it when we make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well which is the impact that our ball or originated the original bottle had on our existing camping sites as that 's one piece of information that I don 't think I 've seen which is what what did the freedom camping sites do to legitimate camping sites camping grounds South New Brighton spins fool what 's the park down linwood ave that one called I don 't know yeah the holiday park down on my learn whatever I mean I just that I 've got an anecdotal response from South New Brighton I mean the tenants no longer there but they said that it was a thirty percent reduction and their normal usage and their usage hadn 't gone down since the earthquakes until we bought on the freedom camping bottle so I want to know all of their actual information not anecdotal advice you know from operators I want to know the facts about the umbrella will allude to the Pacific India and just might be more prudent given their time frames and of this proposal to go out in a net another by law and anticipation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run in then we can more fully and also come back to that if we can am completely and this and when we come back to Council with feedback from the proposal and between half a dozen camping grounds it 's a question of just asking them so but if he I would like the mask yeah Paul just just a quick question just oil from what yannis line of questioning was what was the most the biggest source of complaints where did they come from was it from the self-contained freedom camping vehicles or was it the non self contained freedom at least ninety percent from talking to staff was non self so you could actually reach me assume that actually the biggest problem we have through this whole thing is through the non self-contained units yes yes almost entirely it 's it 's quite hard actually to prior to the freedom camping by law the fact is that people could camp non self contained to us pretty well anywhere the it 's interesting that you know when we brought in the bylaw that the areas where if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat butt oh that 's where they go and then so have been adopted it 's the mechanism for advertising the bylaw actually became the problem it does just like I 'm here and set up King it is also valid up evidence sexy ass having a freedom camping white little hairs se reduced patronage to other motor Kemp 's or places where motor can vote of the existing back out so but I 'm hoping that the working pal you come up with a nationwide solution because I think individual bylaws is not a way to go and I think our experiences reinforce that we do not want to send a bad message to freedom campers we do not want to diminish their visitor experience but we don 't want to damage our environment and we want to make it good for everyone visitors but for our own people so it 's got to be a balanced approach and peace me I think it should be centrally based for the whole of the country so that there 's one set of rules that that kind of guide people in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see on anyway so who 's going to move the motion Paul second Davis is there any discussion because God 's I 'd speak to it for it to look very very quickly I think this is a good move that does reduce the the potential for non self-contained campus to migrate to to other areas which obviously was a huge problem last summer I am a little concerned about the monitoring side of it that we we do have a huge area but I 'm sure that this move will actually potentially make the monitoring somewhat easier than it was last summer and I just the other point that I raised earlier about the negative impact on our economy and I would like to see that the the campervan industry and those that do hard to get the right information and that we are not seen to be a city that is trying to d to freedom campus from coming to our city indeed we do want them here we want to protect our environment and we don 't want the sort of issues that we had last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here is a very good one in the short term until we have the ability to a either review our by law again or as the mayor has said the better approach longer term is for a nationwide approach to the camping freedom camping issue where people that come to our country then get the message that is unified across the nation and hopefully the issues that we have and a number of other territorial authorities of experience sideline to a large degree so I will support the motion yeah Yanni hello thank you um I think the important thing is we 're putting this out for consultation so um you know I think the interesting thing for once we get the feedback and look at what people say is the question whether we don 't have a ban on something I can just you know happen organically like it used to or whether we put a banner and effectively what 's the difference between the two so having a been citywide that we we simply cannot enforce because of the resources is that the right approach versus not having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of difference between the two um I think the problem was that when we identified sites without the infrastructure then suddenly we created a place where people could easily target to go camping and obviously that has led to a number of issues I just want to thank the stuff I went out and had a look at once walked park and you know I know some of the maintenance and and the ongoing legacy of having intensive freedom camping did some damage but I know first certainly from what I 've seen that that 's been tidied up so thank you for for getting onto that um the only other point I wish to make is that I think we should I totally endorse the comment that we should talk to the local campgrounds as well because it would be interesting to see what capacity they have and I do wonder whether or not we should be thinking about a sort of regional campground strategy as well so other areas with freedom campers are going that don 't have facilities what are their facilities that was some improvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that maybe it 's better to do that as part of the overall by law review and maybe that working party central level may address some of that but I do think I know one of the concerns previously has been the reduction or camping grounds in our city including the peninsula you know I think it would be a real shame not to have somewhere where people can go even if it as a private or a public camping ground but that they can can in a respectful way so thank you for the work you 're doing on what for to the results come in it yep and um look I think this is straightforward in terms of that this review at the stage but the start of also indicated definitely the problem is it going to go away clearly having a national working party will help resolve a lot of issues but but you know you 'll be a non go somehow or other and yannis referred to this we have to be proactive and looking at how we use our own current camping grounds and also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available for freedom campers and I put it on regretted commas because clearly freedom campus to should contribute the issue of the costs to this not not just ratepayers having said that I think we have to be careful given that we 've got a huge tourism wave as David East referred to that in fact freedom campers are likely to continue to be part of us and we 're to be careful not to demonize them and my experience at the eddington the eddington Park actually was because we didn 't have facilities for them and huge numbers came that 's where the problems really really began so what while this is just a partial review I think we need to think proactively there 's been on a reference to our current camping grounds as to how we hell we manage their because clearly we cannot afford just to have the problem shifted somewhere else but I am very pleased at international level we 're likely to get some consistency through that working party very good right and I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you very much for all of the work that you 've done so far and the work you 're about to do the next,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Policy,8QI4bTtfyqc,20160727,472.639,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1320,right so the next item is item team which is the business improvement district policy that since the cheer of stringent finance isn 't in the room seems a bit of a shame would you like to introduce it I 'll have identities look I think personally the this policy is a really really good policy and enable some of those smaller areas to actually be able to do sort of cool make and come together and do things together to enhance their business areas and its really really important and more so some of those small suburban areas where they are struggling wee bit to make sure they keep their people in our local the only concern I have about it is the one hundred thousand dollar threshold which I think can maybe prohibitive for some some small areas but overall I think this is a really good policy as I say it 's erm and I think but I think it 's more than just you know the ability to actually extract some income tuition able to do things it 's all about that facilitating the bringing together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important part lies it 's those businesses working together to try and achieve better results we put a flexible fisherman yeah yeah it doesn 't it doesn 't actually saved and explicit it does talk about all together okay why the steam yeah yes the council may consider a reduce minimum rate revenue requirement on a case-by-case basis yes situations where this might be inconsiderate and clue to a more smaller year and business areas we 've not get it to create one boat or a single business area we have a good proponent group or bit operating demonstrate they can successfully deliver a work program that will provide sufficient benefit Reuters Widow the area using a lower targeted right ribbon I think that 's an ideal outcome so that fits something that can be committee asked for and has been changed yeah it has anyone got any questions that to put a staff yeah yeah just just in terms of the next year 's once once this is done how how soon more people be able to cut it do it will start engaging with business associations pretty much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're working on some implementation standards and some criteria for funding so those won 't be conversations that we can avoid business associations okay I just there 's also a couple of references in the paper to the expected and time fireman we go point out in the paper and that the speed of a sage wisdom on the caliper and preparedness effectively of either the proponent order Business Association and it might be over period of one to two years and before you see some of those come through in also depend on the magnitude of the size of unique opponents and what their shoulders cancel it appeared to adopt and the implicit implication of those is that there 's probably opportunities for a lot smaller good components to come through it in was previously the case with that makes things faster whether it 's necessary and will be the test of whether a good as necessary versus those same proponents packing alternative approaches to be the same at counselor so I just want to breakup spector yeah but a ref you would like to move this motion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meetings yeah yeah yes so you 'll move it yes and Jamie bit that quickly document right thank you yanny speak to it oh I just wanted to ask one more quest oh sorry all right I thought everyone had done sorry um where did we get to with neighborhood groups being able to apply a 0 sturgis business yep we changed the terminology in the policy to and proponent group so it 's not strictly business associations and we would expect motion to be that doesn 't preclude others yep thank you oh good honey oh yeah um yeah I think this is this is a new new thing that we 're doing and that 's really good that we 're trying something new I think the key thing is that we do need to have an element of flexibility and also we just need to make sure that we do have really engagement around what this means particularly in terms of the areas that go through any sort of Bella um you know I guess one of the disappointments for me was the fact that we had so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to business associations that actually made submissions but I think when there 's things like master plan consultations going on it would be really good to maybe think about how we can connect those but I think fundamentally the key to this will be learning as it goes and refining it over time fig sure that we do get the outcomes that that we 're seeking are interesting enough it is wider than just businesses and there has been some work overseas and other cities that have these I think in the Los Angeles area which actually talked about a church actually doing you know leading the discussion around an improvement district and and and that was really successful other times where Council of just going on and said we want to do it it hasn 't been so successful so I think there 's you know hopefully enough flexibility and that 's policy now that we can actually work work through a variety of different ways in which communities may be able to exit and and establish these these areas and so let 's hope that it 's successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you I 'm Jamie yeah I just like to say with respect to birds this is nothing new about these at all you know there are and i 'm actually really pleased to say that we 're not reinventing the wheel because this is something that 's been implemented across the world and it 's been implemented very successfully what I particularly like about it is that it empowers local communities to really be in charge of their own destiny nothing 's going to be forced on someone nothing 's going to be imposed on a group or a business precinct that doesn 't want it it does require a supermajority to do this and it requires a very good voter turnout as well so this is going to be at all the local businesses can premiere talk they want it but just that other final point that was made earlier about widening this to not just businesses I think that 's great too because it most certainly doesn 't need to be restricted to businesses so it probably could be called SIDS in the sense that it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a very good initiative and I 'm very supportive of it and like I said it helps it helps local communities businesses and a lot of a lot of instances be in charge of their own own destiny and really empowers them and I think that 's the greatest thing that a council can do is to really enable the talented people that they have in their own backyard to be able to get on and do what they do best and this is a prime example of a policy that enables that right I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye as opposed they know that 's carried thank you thank you very much,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

urban development strategy update and the resilient greater Christchurch plans together and have a broad-ranging debate over the three of them because there is a connection between the three of them I think that the connection starts with something called the Christchurch story so I 'm going to propose that we play the Christchurch story as we begin but in order to get the three items on the agenda I 'd like to move the three recommendations and the deputy mayor would like to thicken up can we dim the lights yes the better sphere we dim the lights oh my you 're sweet talker just change everything this place just crave you and pulls you in and she doesn 't let me go and dim the lights sounds good and unless I don 't charge of filling the life i wait till I 'll do that when Otis I can

mountains right back to the setlist days there 's that spirit that get on with that can-do attitude and it 's still here today the pockets of the lovely old but excitement of the new you know a framework has changed a little bit that Earth has moved we have changed we 're blue it 's times like this you realize a city is more than just bricks and mortar it is actually people there 's something very special here we 're rebuilding the modern waste in the city now everyone wants to move forward you can 't do it in isolation is this new overlay that enhancing what Christ is all about but we have to not let go what was great at our cottage Everywhere 's ago the landscapers our garden grow a garden environment absolutely we 're growing community that 's what we 're all about growing our minds growing our careers by leading the world and seismic engineering research and Antarctic research we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universities the education system is excellent in Christchurch and I think we 're almost fought for choice across the city there 's definitely really buzzing startup community in Christchurch it 's open collaborative right in the heart of the city Martin has a global company that 's based in Christchurch we have everything we need here to make this fly it is the city of opportunity and there is a lot going on that 's everything that you 've got everything right at your doorstep everything is it easy to get to you because it 's easy to be part of that 's home it 's just a great place that 's got a great way of life for sporting cultural activities there 's so much variety and choice you also raised fist good night life and increasingly really friend said he was an amazing art gallery I 've never had such a sense of community anywhere else that I 've been very welcoming place very open I 'm from Malaysia Philippines you toid South Korea Oh China you know I get the real sense that my children just get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is you 're living in a city but it doesn 't feel like a city adventurers on your back doorstep with the mountains rivers you can go surfing skiing within two hours of each other it 's five minutes to play ground ten minutes to work spec five minutes to the beach and 20 minutes for the rest of the world you live the good life but also see the rich the world perfect the opportunity to be here to have a family here to have a business here to become part of something that is growing it 's something that shouldn 't be missed we finally did it our very first time and what a place to have a bus christchurch the best place in the world to be a key way almost Bridget I do thanks very much for the opportunity to do that and in a way the reason I wanted a play was to give some context for the debate on these three strategies because the the strains them are actually all interwoven and connected through the Christchurch stories and it 's about who christchurch 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Christchurch as a destination and its own right but also the international gateway not just to the Canterbury region but to the South Island of New Zealand and actually I 'm quite inspired by that piece because where it came from as it started with share an idea so they went back that the airport company obviously did this work as part of a bigger piece of work that they are doing over that whole strategic approach to what they call cure a south welcome to the south and if you think about where visitors want to connect when they think about coming to New Zealand for the first time the images that are in their mind are all from the South Island you know it is the other big images that attract people to New Zealand in the first place and we 're the international gateway to new zealand but it also talks about us being an international gateway to antarctica as well which actually gives us a really special place not just in in the in the national context but actually in the global context as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Antarctica so there 's a whole lot about the visitors strategy that aligns with the urban development strategy that aligns with the resilience plan and that 's why I wanted us to kind of debate them all together and when you think about the way the Christchurch story is presented and as I say it started with share an idea so they had access to the core feedback that gave when they were invited to share their ideas about what they thought the city could become after the earthquakes and I don 't know if people remember going along to the different parts of Sharon idea but I remember going into that arena and it was just buzzing with interest and activity and excitement about the idea about thinking about what a new city and the 21st century would look like and and all of those ideas the things that came through that are afflicted and what we 've just watched and then the company that did this interview 250 people across the board to try and get a a sense of weird things had shifted to and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't be a reference to the earthquake on the experience that we 'd been through and the really strong reaction was was that we had to acknowledge what we 'd been through and that we 'd come through the other end and that there was a direction of travel for us as a city and a place for us not just in our country but in the world and when you think about what 's happening internationally and even if you think about what 's happening in Auckland I was talking to a minister a while back who said that he was our best advocate in Auckland because when people complain to him about the congestion on the roads and complained about the price of housing he said moved to Christchurch and actually there will be people who will be thinking about moving to Christchurch because there will be an opportunity that they won 't get in other cities they get everything here we 're a small city with a big set of possibilities that sense of possibility that has been so good to highlight as well I like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes sense the opportunity to connect the international gateway status but actually we 're small enough that you don 't get lost in the crowd while we 're big enough to have all of the attributes of a bigger city so and the opportunity to find balance and I think people are looking for balance in this world they 're looking for a sense of security a sense of a decent lifestyle a good balance between work and and other aspects of their life a great place to bring up children and a great place to grow old you know it 's a it 's that 880 principle that that girl 's spoke about when he was here and I think that if you look at the urban development strategy that was actually that actually put Christchurch and why McCreery and so on in the region and the best possible position to face the disaster that we were confronted with because the land youth recovery plan would never have been able to be developed and the time frame that it was developed if we as three districts had not sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for our three areas together if we hadn 't done that work there is no way on earth that there would have been such an opportunity really to get the land use recovery plan in place and I think if I 'm going to be faidley reflective of the approach that was taken I probably would have used the urban development strategy as the recovery strategy and I would have adapted it for the purpose of recovery and then it would have had the easy transition to the next stage so what we have before us today is simply a refresh its really an update at essent the review of the urban development strategy which will have to happen next year but I have to say that I was a little disappointed that we couldn 't do it on the time frame that we had but then again the feedback that I got was that people were submission out they were consulted out and they didn 't want to have a consultation on the urban development strategy now and it is an opportunity for us or for the new council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ councils and with the end with the region and with the DHB n-no Tahu end the transport authority to actually take that forward into the 21st century document that it 's got to become but this time it will be on the back of the resilience plan and I debt to me that 's the one that I 'm passionate about the resilience plan actually sits greater Christchurch up to be forward-thinking to be future-focused to think about the things that make our infrastructure resilient at the same time as we think about things that makes our community resilient communities don 't become resilient of governments or councils do things for them communities become resilient when they work with local government and central government to make things happen for themselves and that to me is the huge opportunity that lies ahead for our city and I 'm so excited about what these three plans bring together for us but when we review the urban development strategy we will now be able to do it through the lens of the greater Christchurch resilience plan and that to me six out some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm really excited about three documents being here I personally think that we 've got to spend some time bringing them all together so that they all sit under the resilience framework but you know at the moment it 's it 's a an update of the utes tying and what the resilience plan and and the visitors strategy a supporting piece of work for the work that 's going on in the background where cct and CDC will be coming together in a new organizational framework that will bring in some of our events as well so future-focused organizational structure supported now by visitors strategy so i 'm happy to move that and I did want to kind of just make a we note on the end of allowing year technical amendments that 's been added in there so so that yep so that was all I was going to take Yanni next and then Glenn thank you um so we have a number of strategies before us today and there 's been a lot of work go go into this and it 's actually really interesting and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we pin development strategy and then we had a share an idea which is really um unfortunately I think in hindsight focused on the central city rather than the entire study or actually the entire region and more recently perhaps you could say in fact we should actually look at a South Island strategy because this is such a wonderful place to live and there are many ways in which we should be cooperating and being strategic across the wider South Island rather than just in our region inner city or in our community and I think the best example of that is that the idea that was sporting events for example that every city has to build a bigger stadium to get the next All Blacks test bigger than the stadium that was built in the city before so we 're getting into a competitive bidding war to get professional sports coming to our city on top of the expensive infrastructure that we 're spending but you could look at it in terms of infrastructure as well you could look at the port 's expansion for example by threatening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why don 't we work together cooperatively to promote what a fantastic places to live in in the New Zealand but also in the world and I think really we 're so fortunate despite all the terrible things that have happened that tragedy that has taken place this is still one of the best places in the world to live and I think we 're incredibly fortunate to be able to live here ah I think what 's really important is that these documents are actually dynamic documents as well the blueprint was done nearly five years ago so actually things change things evolve circumstances are different now than they were then there 's been greater certainty clarity around some of the financial models business cases may have changed depending on what population has moved to or come from so I think the really critical thing is that we get these strategies in place but we exceed but there are actually dynamic strategies and I totally endorse the idea of doing an overarching plan and I was really disappointed that the urban development strategy refresh didn 't actually do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sharon idea to and actually do it across the greater region because they 're out he was it wasn 't just Christchurch people that came to share an idea what most people from all around the region and many even international people that came and made submissions and came and gave some great ideas to us so you know I think a city of opportunity I think that 's a really positive thing that we also must be mindful of that this is a study that should be really proud to address the inequity that is existing both before the earthquake and post-earthquake and one of the key things we heard through the last six years was that the communities who can least afford it are often the ones that suffer most after a natural disaster so I think the idea that if this is a place that is great for everyone to live in that that is what will attract people to come here to stay here and your play here and so we can 't divorce us from the reality of fixing our broken streets making the footpaths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel like there 's investment there 's opportunity in those areas that were hardest and addressing some of the underlying issues which I know some of these strategies do run things like affordability of housing giving everyone an opportunity to own their own house for example or to be able to afford to live in a safe secure warm and healthy environment and so the two really critical things from my point of view going forward are they actually we do look at combining these strategies into an overall plan but we also reflect in terms of the budget because the interesting thing is if you go through this straight one of the gaps as the fact that the questions that we ask are not related to our budget so it 's very easy for someone to say bring forward the stadium because it 'll be great for events it 's a very different qysh it 's a very different answer if you ask the question what 's more important fixing your broken roads and renewing it to an environmentally modern standard or building a stadium and so there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it would be really good to have one clear process which all those different priorities can be weighed up put into an overall plan that removes the duplication or the different directions that different people may want to go so we get a common United vision for the city and for the region and then we can really focus on getting those things done and the final point is I just think they 're really does need to be huge public input and I think that 's one of the most important things about the resilience strategy there 's the focus on people participating and being involved in democratic decision-making and as Kent as a canterbury am as a person that lives in Christchurch I don 't think we should underscore the value of having local democracy in our cities and in our communities and inner regions and I think that 's one of the most important things from the resilient strategy is that this is a place where everyone is given the opportunity to be involved in decisions and to participate in the decision-making of their future that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm happy to support these strategies think II and lean the GU thank you and i light your joined up approach and the breaking down of any potential silos just from a cheap perspective we had a workshop on this after the last cheap meeting on the 7th of july so i 'm just putting forward one or two points from that and andrew 's absence one media commentators talked about the removing the reference to the stadium but here 's the thing in my view Canterbury is our stadium and I think we need to look beyond the boxes to the natural assets which really stadium can debris the rivers and the mountains are the parts of that stadium and that footage that you saw before that 's what we saw we saw our people out in our wider community the stadium that is Canterbury is for all people and we actually need I think in this post quake time for the sake of our communities recovery to encourage people to get out there where else can you run tyco and cycle from one side of the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an amount of bike competition or head to the hills over Tim and and Phil 's way just getting back on the bigger picture there one of the creative tensions we have in Christchurch at the moment as something I call and amplified hierarchy of needs which journey touched on on the one hand we 're dealing with roads houses and insurance matters on the other we try to reach for the stars it 's mezzos hierarchy of needs and in Christchurch I think it 's amplified it is a council we Traverse this hierarchy all the time and we learn about it when we do things like put statues and rivers and and that sort of thing you know we think we 're making the best decision at the time we find out actually we need to join up all these strategies we 're going to be living with these tensions constantly it 's it 's a challenging and a privileged place to be in but it 's our role as leaders as governance in the city to keep pushing forward and to keep progressing our roads our insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assert our place as Christchurch and Canterbury in the Southland in New Zealand we all know now that our safety globally is taking on a new meaning what does that mean for Christ 's Church now in terms of a safe city I support your approach today me and I encourage you all to get behind it seeing someone like Michael Gorman and the that video I think there 's tremendous that adds real depth because we can do it all the fancy stuff we like but actually if we don 't care for our homeless what kind of meaning and debt do we have to the recovery of the city so this is tough stuff but we need to hold all these tensions together and I think this is a good way to do it by holding all these strategies together nicely inkay felt well up clearly they 're three big documents the three strategies and discussing them together I guess what what stands up for me is that and we 've been involved with all the more along but it 's the resilient strategy I guess as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the future direction and how we get there and Glenn is referred to and what Michael Gorman said oh I think in the film club about that the city is more than its Breck 's and mortar it 's its people and clearly what underlines that the the strategy that the resilience strategy is is that fact it 's not the infrastructure isn 't only at all about the heart and the structure the steel and the concrete and all the stuff we do need and are working on it 's really that part of that it is with working with the people so that they are engaged in getting those other parts done that Jonnie refer to two but so in a way I think the good thing about the film is it really shows the milestones that in fact we have achieved and I think in many ways they 're quite brilliant and I think you only referred to that all the documents needing to be dynamic they do and I think though here 's the challenge for the council the next stage and especially around the UDS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sheeran idea is a great idea to do when it goes out but in fact what flows down then is how in fact we need to make all these projects work because that 's the challenge it is not just for us in the remaining time we 're here at the next council to Jimmy thank you a mere yeah I supported Isla Vista strategy they call this of West wasted strategy integrate like a mayor you mentioned earlier integrated resources together max map any fight any people of a church so integration of the tourism events economic development which also including Antarctica and all those business sectors and also the your particular mention this is kind of an international gateway not only to a South Island poverty to the other holder New Zealand because the white church a moment International Airport actually a lot of the directed fight to be here can transfer to Oakland to some other the city and also is Antarctica so there is a way where we do the opportunity to work how do we do was this opportunity that 's where we were two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategic document actually we can see this a safe setting after the vision the cause and the outcomes you know then we can gain in the wii game is spatially up to earthquaker actually the visitor drop drop a lot but right now they recover recover to the prior the earthquake how to whittle again in a market this year and follow our the preparing the detailed action cred that 's where we were with a crucial like we watch these the video earlier you know to share the culture we can see all those the people actually is a mid Asia of the people of hydros with four of the expiration for of the hopper for our city of chi Chi but when I reviewed a paragraph a 6.5 particular here mention this option is consistent with the counselor plant in the policies except the mayor you mentioned earlier align with the recd endure the hydroscooter plan and also the cultures the UDA strategy but also one of a key current existing the international are the relational policy you know these colors actually also align with this ternoon evista @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international education economic opportunity tourism as well as high radio investment etc so the without this the strategy or policy can align together to integrated together to complement it together let 's we need to you know to attack the soul away for the future implementation and also my understanding except the the future of the new entity cct and other see the CDC are currently the council Civic international the kind of relationship the department they are already also focus on the international education the Buddhist wrong the Sister Cities the culture the economic economical our collection how do we to also have a popular protonation net we need to the sink polit but regarding determine the law currently the council under the chair committee we did I have an international relations are working to also focus on these the kind of a stronger connection with our sister city social culture economic of the list are the connection by how do we to integrated either is also we need two more I think about it but units taking the based on am I mentioned earlier I suppose illustrated this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and effectively thank you let 's go Adam in Turkey thank you i totally agree with everyone pulling these together and it seems logical to put it under the resilience strategy so that 's all joined up but i really just want to talk with regards to the the visitor strategy i think that as we saw in that video what we have here in Christchurch and Canterbury and south island as we are unique Kiwis and we should be concentrating on be here for that visitor strategy I 'm the previous counsel some time ago brought ellerslie and you wonder why they did that when we have so much in christchurch that we can offer that is truly unique which no one else can I 'm Julie mentioned earlier on you know like if you 're in volume for bigger stadiums etc it 's about doing things better and what is truly unique so people want to come here they want to live and play here and I keep hearing the word stadium you know we we talk about a lot of things about disruptive technology look what electric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is moving so fast so piece of when it the discussion with regards to when we build or what we build etc as in the future but I just want to say that it amazes me that we still talk about a stadium if we ever built a stadium would be 20 years behind everyone else we 've got amazing opportunities and I want to look at a future that at some stage and when we deem it appropriate that it is a multi-purpose arena that would look it so I just wanted to say that the visitor strategy I totally endorse I think we 've got amazing future and as we move forward we talked about and we have talked about opportunities but I see as we move forward now those opportunities are becoming clearer and more yeah graspable so I 'm thank you are you going to speak as well because I don 't don 't to save up to the end okay yep Dave look I just like to elaborate a little on Tim 's comment and Glenn talked about Stadium Canterbury I 'm probably a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our and i 'll use the term Multi multi use event center out further look we we are dating I know I 'm just saying here we are we 're in enhancing the visitor experience we 're we 're talking about cruise ship opportunities hotel development increasing visit and of us and the experience of people when they come to Christchurch a the multi-use have been sent as an integral part of that and I certainly endorse everything that everybody sang on the city but I really would like to see us embracing that philosophy a little quicker than we are perhaps planning at this stage because it is an integral part of their visitor experience to Christchurch and we we need to get away from this notion that we 're building a stadium that is 444 rugby it 's not never will be and as Tim is quite rightly said a moment ago if we built something like that we 're going back 20 or 30 years we need to be looking into the future we need to be looking at something that 's quite unique M will enhance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Grosse fuge yes future council will make that decision full I 'm gonna be ready briefly pragmatic so personal I look at things through there any simple lens there 's three things I 've lent since the earthquake in doing the research project everything comes back to people people people without the people you 've got nothing and if you look at that video it showed people and it showed our natural environment it didn 't show the buildings and show what people do here and I think that 's a really key part of actually this environment we have here in Christchurch we have a great environment that you can do some really neat things in so we need to always bear that in mind that our natural environment is probably the most important alongside our people and if we get all those things right everything else will fall into place we are building back and there isn 't it there has been a thing towards a century city where you know we 'll put some emphasis on rebuilding our city we 've got to remember that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it back is a really important heart of our community so getting that right is also really really important because that 's what people come and that 's what reflects us as people that reflects us and what our culture is what we how we feel about each other and looking after our lowest common denominator making sure those people the most vulnerable in our city I loved us because that 's how we get judged we 've got homeless people lying around the streets people will see that and actually will judge us on that so we 're going to look after all aspects and if you raise the bar for those less fortunate you actually raised about for everyone so as keeping that balance right and as I said people people people free cookie and I totally agree with Paul actually it is people completely but i think if we look at what we 've got in christchurch we sit as the Gateway to the South Island as well which is such an asset such a place that you know could you indistinct a place that was better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love the fact that they 've used the word opportunity they almost got to anything is possible they 'll get there in the rerun and a part of their work they 've talked about the test bed for disruptive technology and how we attract more people who want to do incredible and amazing things but I think one of the things that we need to think about as well is that while we know the Christchurch story incredibly well I don 't think some of the rest of New Zealand knows it or hear it and and if we look at what 's happening in New Zealand just in the Auckland housing crisis and it is a prices and I don 't know what the word is beyond crisis but it 's actually beyond that because what we 're seeing is that Auckland has gone from the ninth most unaffordable city and at least affordable city in the world to the fifth within a year and it is now ten times your average income to get into a house and as the Reserve Bank increases what you have to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 400,000 for deposit to get into a house in Oakland I don 't know how anybody does it and I don 't think people know even an Auckland that there are so many opportunities here for them in Christchurch so while the situation in Auckland actually gets worse by the day because every day they build fewer houses then there are people who need them so for the next four years the price curve and Oakland goes on a hockey stick exponential growth curve which is terrifying and what 's terrifying for from my point of view is that as a new zealand I believe very strongly in the non hierarchical structure so while you make it huge respect and China and Japan as a mere you 'll get none here and i love that i know and love the fact that we don 't have a huge sort of pandering to authority that we are non hierarchical and that we have that sense of possibility and equality and and so so important that we ensure that everybody is included in our city so the sense of social inclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happening and is going to accelerate even faster because the situation just gets worse by the day is that that sense of possibility and equality in Auckland is disappearing so what we are seeing is a sense of major relative deprivation and what drives major social movements always is the sense of relative deprivation and that and Auckland is happening with alarming speed so what drove bricks it what 's driving Trump what got appalling handsome elected all of those really scary social movements is actually in embryonic form in Auckland right now and that 's scary and the government actually can 't solve it and the next four years and so the only way that it will be solved is by their huge numbers of people coming into orphaned realizing that there other cities as you an affected by the contagion of the Auckland house prices and so the press price of housing and Christchurch is going up four percent annually and rents are actually falling off slightly which is excellent and so I think one of the things that we know as New Zealanders is that governments don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think one of the messages we need to get out really clearly to all those people who want to go to Auckland or to those New Zealanders returning home is that there is this amazing city in the south island of new zealand that has these opportunities and this amazing potential and where they can actually afford to be part to not only own their own home but to be part of an incredible city that just has possibility original over it and I think perhaps we 're not telling I think the message is told incredibly well in four minutes probably way better than we can tell it in the strategy because it 's so visual but that 's where I think we need to also focus but now I think we need to take a story out to the rest of New Zealand and it 's a piece of work that the new council can can pick up on so i 'll put the first motion which is up on the screen and that 's for item number 7 i 'll put that motion all those in favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14 I 'll put it 's just ratifies so i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye as opposed say no that 's carried and item 15 I put that motion all those in favor say aye say no that 's carried thank you very much I said we really do need to recognize the massive amount of work and all these they appear in our agendas like this but that had several iterations millions of workshops thousands of hours and the patients then the magnitude of the job can all got really representatives of cct here in the room so acknowledge them as well the staff from strategy and transformation but also michael ealy fantastic job on here 's a text plan thank you very much all right thank you well June for morning tea and we 'll come back at eleven o 'clock","(-43.5320214,

Report,zcGybmYvzEE,20160727,679.99,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1631,"now we move on to the chief executives report thank you appreciate that this is a shorter report than normal it 's mainly because the financials and performance data wasn 't available when the report was written largely as a result of it it 's year end as opposed to end of the month but I can say that performance in financials were on target I just want to highlight one area out of here and that was the recall the opening of the ordinary why no need community center I met with the Lions Club International Foundation and the opening was enabled by the very generous donation or four hundred and fifty thousand dollars and we 'd been working quite closely with him around the resultant of the community center and they had a lot of positive things to say about the partnership relationship between the council in the Lions Club International Foundation but you also recall that they very quickly out of the earthquakes donated funds to the city to support the earthquake recovery so not only did they provide that generous contribution to the IRA noe one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for San Albans community center and that 's a relocatable building and given that the work is now a program progressing on the news and Albans community center they 're keen to look at the opportunity to donate that relocatable building to the city to be used in other areas where is a great need and for a similarly used in terms of earthquake recovery which is a fantastic gift for the community they 're also interested in talking about how we can build on the partnership with the city in an ongoing way and in particular aligning their local clubs were perhaps our local Ward 's so that and the ends of the work that they do it 's a line worth the priorities and the needs of local communities so I think it 's a fantastic arrangement and partnership that 's been developing and certainly when you want to acknowledge the very generous contribution they 've made in many ways to the city thank you questions yeah yeah I just said two questions I 'm thank you for the report but just am getting a little bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the changes to the electoral system this time so I just wondered I know that we had previously request that maybe I could go in the rights notice but do we have any sort of campaign in terms of just informing people of the new wards that there are n and then just making sure people understand you know but the significant changes they 're being made all right so unrelated to this report you 're just asking about the election crisis well no it 's about it 's not about election process it 's just about um the information through the customer service channels to people about you know the new the new system in line with i guess like the rights notices that got sent out okay um might ask Mary if she can comment on the range of work and information it 's been provided Helius treated by the American I just um confirmed that the commission also said that weird the highest number of highest number of watts our enrollments both routes by 3,000 okay um and just the second question was just around just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through into the election time and I 'm just wondering what the process is to kind of manage that in terms of decision-making you mean in terms of the consultations and following decision-making or generally yeah i mean just since there 's a number of things that are like scheduled to kind of come back right around the election time so you have things like the consultation time frame has been extended will have programs being changed to accommodate that so we 're it 's appropriate that 's been done as I understand council said that they want to continue to make decisions right up until the elections and so we 're timetabling that so you can see ahead of time what will be coming to cut two committees end to the council right okay so we will be making decisions right up until the election I understood that sort of that was a decision that you 'd made but it 's no it 's not it 's not a question of making a decision or just a requirement that that the council continues its business is a separation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but obviously significant decisions that ought to be held over to the new council will be done so so we won 't be making you know sort of major decisions and and the council the uncommon council will have referred to them the sort of decisions they ought to yeah yeah so there 's no decisions yeah so um I just actually wanted to comment on aspect of your report can I find particular plate particularly pleasing especially for local areas it 's a right on page 24 the facebook posts and hits on net and clearly like the briton superbike it was very popular and IC o---- tip over 10,000 people thought that was great old i had a good look at it but what really pleased me too is that the rot in the rising home community over eight and a half thousand people thought that was pretty great and even more people commented on the the in their interest and rising home being rebuilt and that that to me makes it really clear or a clear indication that local heritage really is uppermost in a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean just on your page 7 or page 26 of the agenda just under the health and safety I know that we now have cameras on our arm parking wardens which is absolute contesta offensive great initiative so the the abuse threats and assaults that 's dropped from 14 24 do you think that 's the direct result of those cameras being I think it 's an Ipsy fantastic thing to pull off as they they do get this nothing to this day and I think it 's a range of thing so I think certainly being able to record any events as helpful when people are made aware that that 's happening I think there 's also training for staff and how to dees kite things and make sure that they 're not in a position where you know there could be subjected to abuse routes or assaults it doesn 't mean it hasn 't stopped at all night certainly it 's um as a whole program of activity have you thought of with regards to you know abuse and threats are one thing but actual assault as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two or is it I 'm not just and we 'll certainly windy recorded their recorders specifically what they are and just helpful in terms of keeping them okay thank you oh just all that issue I spoke directly with one of the travel humans and the parking rules and he said that moment some of the spots the camera on it on the issue your aggressive nature changes significantly so it actually it has enacted quite to make quite a big degree out there and I think it 's a really good thing to see yeah it 's just a shame we have to do d why does it shine I know you you 're right I suppose a couple as well no they that 's your really reassuring titties that 's good include me a one question I want comments the questions without is a Lions Club International Foundation because fuel today contributor to the quietest community I remember week or two three years ago I also protect of their funding to the temporary the st. Albans committee center by this time the contributor aranui on Louie common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on behalf of City Council people quite churches represent a certificate of appreciation to them because they are the keepers and CEO they came to chi Chi from overseas in Iraq that 's right so let me meet with them recently so they 're coming from overseas and meet with me with him that 's when we talked about a number of these issues Amir has certainly written them specifically acknowledging the contribution and an air thanks okay second question is Riyaz comments regarding to the drop to multi-culture strategy because i 'm the currently the Jefferson City Council multi-culture strategy so this time I think so when we put the motto you know as elect men but we partake with the coordinate with the staff together i partake of the infant group parking station university of canterbury a position as well as the righteous multicultural council no organized opposition I think we coordinate where we could assert in a church in more people in the community leaders know tomorrow I think we can get a best outcome we are reflected to the destructor the strategy any budgeting approaching do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with someone like to move that will talk we received those stick in the pool let motion all those in favor say aye oh I say no that 's carried next","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Petitions,j2ZWSGfVNGg,20160727,601.01,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1434,right the next item is that we have a petition I don 't think this is one of our first petitions not our first but one of them Megan Blakely is coming to present a petition regarding the ban of single-use plastic bags in the new CBD again I think Megan you 've got a small presentation hello my name is Megan Blakey I present to council my petition regarding single-use plastic bags which states let 's lead the way in New Zealand and be the first one use plastic bag free city in the country a total of thirteen hundred and sixteen people join with me to ask mere delzell in the council to bend one use plastic bags in OT tahi christchurch starting with the new retail precinct in the CBD after starting my petition online two people contacted me offering to collect paper-based signatures I acknowledge the hard work and enthusiasm of Pauline Dave Bailey sitting behind me and girls hi Suze two girls high student Olivia region with recent media coverage of the petition on CTV and in the press there 's been a rise and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the issue doesn 't get sidelined later in the year by electioneering for me the ubiquitous plastic bag is an everyday symbol of poor use of our planet 's resources some of the values expressed by Christchurch residents after the quakes with it we want a people-centred livable and sustainable city we are looking to the council to help make that vision of a new Christchurch a reality my interest and plastic pollution intensified when I became an offshore sailor in 2005 and spent two years sailing the South Pacific you 'll see my husband and I mid Tessman and the photo above into in 2010 I was the volunteer Christchurch coordinator of the love your coast beach and River cleanup involving 800 students in adults across 16 locations that he would I have seen and collected plastic debris from the most isolated of Pacific beaches and right here in our own backyard the technology works whoops and it hasn 't it smelled of them are slightly on the right there the circ rail island beach on the left a cleanup at Marlborough Sounds macho acre estuary and remote port @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent mother of all clean ups which included scooping out layers of plastic bags submerged in the history mud there was just too much plastic to collect and we had to leave plenty of it behind at a micro level plastic is already in the food chain you are no doubt aware of the University of Canterbury study showing high levels of plastic micro particles and the history and many of our local beaches since starting my petition I 've learned that a similar one was presented to Auckland City Council and 2014 as a result of that process it appears central government as the only body with the legislative ability to an actor Ben although we had locally declared nuclear free zones and the 80s so why not locally declared plastic bag free zones I realize that some plastics can be put in the yellow burn system but from conversations I 've had with people i estimate a very large proportion of bags are used to line under rubbish buns and so continue to find their way to landfill also my understanding of the plastic bag recycling process is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventually end up and land fold it 's referred to as down cycling at the core of this approach is the idea that manufacturers and retailers can transfer the cost of waste management to consumers in this case ratepayers it 's time that manufacturers deal with the problems they create rather than externalizing the cost and transferring it to the consumer and rate payer and the environment as you may have seen on TV news recently Palmerston North mere grant smith says it takes a hundred and eighty thousand bags sorted from the waste system to earn his council fifty dollars he recommends we just need to take bags out of the system so I 'll pay you fifty dollars to do this even if the council 's bile or making ability is limited I believe there are still many opportunities open to you to help curb plastic bag use run a social marketing campaign to curb people 's habit of lining rubbish bins with plastic bags keep pressure on central government to levy and phase out one use plastic bags encourage developers and businesses and the new CBD and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to incentivize customers to bring their own reusable bags foster production of green technology and products by local businesses in a manufacturing sector if not already made council buildings and events on council land zero waste all of us here can role model good environmental stewardship through saying no to plastic bags and taking along our own shopping in supermarket bags in Portland 's elderly mum has made a bag for each of you so she will hand though yeah and so what this petition we ask that you please kick the plastic bag here but I wondered if anyone would be game after kids plastic oh yeah doesn 't make gorgeous thank you don 't kick it up me I thank you thank you very much a Megaton week we don 't have time for questions but but what I did because I actually saw your online petition quite a while ago so I our staff to prepare a report which I 'm going to get it circulated to counselors which means it 's tabled on the floor of the meeting and I 'll ask them to give you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawmaking powers are restricted in this area but your point is well made and I remember when I was master of commerce I was infuriated by the fact that there was a an inability of the supermarket 's to collectivize and agree to a price that would be charged for the plastic bags and that would change behavior overnight we know it would if they all did it and for my way of thinking you know the government really should what 's the phrase that they can under the Minister for the environment here 's the power under the waste management product stewardship yeah and the practice being single use plastic bags from sale or from the disposal for the info we don 't dispose hours to landfill if our citizens do the right thing which is put it in the yellow bone so we do recycle piece of eggs I think we 're the only territorial authority that does but that 's not as good as actually not putting them into the system in the first place so it looks very much the in recycling plastic bags is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air ya know I great not so you I 'm saying that but anyway look thank you very much for your presentation we need clear is that I wonder if the crossword I think I 'm one of us would like to take a speaker yes after Eddie committee we couldn 't meet with these people and actually work with them on this ya know look up is a sap circulated a report I 've got up here we ever done it yet okay I know and so it ain 't but we 've hit the presentation of the petitions and yes we will take it further but we are restricted in terms of by lawmaking power I complete yes yet but i think that i agree to figure we can have a informal discussion with you good if you get in contact with that remember soluti committee okay see you well we were busy by addition to the committee but that 's not only what we do so sorry we would normally when we receive a petition refer to the appropriate committee or all this it 's from so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infrastructure transport and Environment Committee thank you very much thank you here okay I guess yeah hey motion all those in favor say aye face they don 't that 's carried unanimously thank you,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

New Zealand",1601,generous public participation and we have a deputation by appointment and that 's grant and Jane would like to speak on behalf of be accessible regarding item 7a offices our strategy so if I could invite you to come for the semester hold on Joan yep come on sit down I understand you 've got a very short very short presentation just carries racial process going to say that for you good morning this is regarding the accessible accessibility strategy so we be accessible as a goal to be one hundred percent accessible Museum and Christchurch is in a enviable position of being able to do this from design rather than retrofit so we have sent a submission through so this is just really a very short presentation as part of their okay there you go so one for New Zealanders have access needs there are eight trillion global annual disposable income being spent around the world 2.2 billion global accessible to tourists this is a huge income for for Christchurch if we get our design right and what we 're asking for is to have in our strategy we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accessibility within there within design and development of the city good accessibility is is good business at the end of the day if you design for those who require extra accessibility you 're actually is designing for everybody it 's it 's really that simple good accessibility is good for business thank you did you make a submission on the visitor strategy yes there is a submission three be accessible time to find reference to it sir there were pages income lizards and give 15 to 25 or something on the PDF that was online but a big blue yellow sticker I 'm just trying to find reference to it in the actual document that you refer to amount of attachment the consultation feedback oh yeah it 's under the earthquake disability leadership burglars room yeah yeah yeah yeah I think there was an amendment to those strategy as a result of the assumption oh ok ok we only got confirmation of this couple days ago sir right but I think you 've raised a really good point so do people have questions that they 'd like to yeah all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 880 cities which is a good for an eight or a key role that 's right everyone this obviously pitch this absolutely into that if if you design for accessibility with accessibility in mind then automatically it 's easier for everybody and if it 's easier for everybody then it becomes more attractive for visitors to come to your city everyday work around the cost of retrofitting this just like we put a new build yep and a ritual fit the cost difference to it all depends on the building it all depends on the space so with with be accessible we have a an assessment system so rather than just um just same ol we need to I think the company meets New Zealand standards we want to exceed that minimum requirement for this media center so the goal is yes to meet that but to go beyond a bit further and so it 's a scalable system that you can you can then choose what level you want to be is that a bit like a green star right it 's a little start building this will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in city if we really exactly it is very much like a green star rating and it becomes a little book much more livable city so we recognize that everybody can 't retrofit the building everybody can 't meet the gold or plan and standard but you definitely going to meet the minimum bronze standards understand so you choose your level that you want to be the effect you you 're saying there are these other standards to attain you know since you say this is one standard everybody says well what 's the silver standard or what 's the goal center so you inform the public that there are better centers to meet me when you think about it that isn 't just for people who have disabilities for example I mean during the period of your lifetime you might break a leg or an arm or something out there that you might have a skiing accident you might by twenty fifty fifty percent of of the population will be over 65 so automatically I actually don 't want to think of that as a particular problem designed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City for everyone you 're more livable city for everybody for longer but also a parent pushing a pram is going to face the same challenges as somebody with a mobility scooter for example with a wheelchair or somebody breaking a leg skiing yeah extreme sports or the mountain bike path but there you go a few owners Sutton says you designed for the locals and tourists will come to it so yeah you 've got a design with both of mine absolutely and I think that 's what the intention of the visitor strategy is is that if that 's a great place to live it 'll be a great place to visit it 's a great place to visit it 'll be a great place to look that 's actually interchangeable and and the world recognizes Facebook and maintain all these media sites that say I had a great visit to Christchurch yeah maybe in a wheelchair maybe death may be bringing their newborn it 's a great place to visit yeah yeah thank you very much I think that 's a very timely reminder for all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visitor strategy but right across the board in terms of the rebuild of the city Oh Paul is your way you press apply to 72 maybe that the Yeti committee maybe get some of that thinking through overview I don 't know zero we do have our disability we help disabilities policy and working in terms of ensuring that you know infrastructure is accessible so our role is to cross cheek that when the reports come through make sure they have it up with all that raising the bar though so we 've got it I suggest that the Galleon I work with the disability Gail here and we 've been wanting debt as part of the reporting system so that asked our report that has gone through so they have done it whatever the report is about has been one of those things as run past able to let it over standard rather than actually well raising about at the moment some reports don 't even include it so young overwritten with garlic city to say well actually the reports do need to run passes and that would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missing any of the points well yeah this is doubly timely because I 'm speaking it to be accessible conference on saturday so okay I 'll probably see you there yeah a yeah I mean I think um the point through share an idea in the council central city plan we certainly put the a major element of that was to be willed renowned for exit accessibility and you know that hasn 't really carried through into the blueprint but I think you know it would be really good to put something in here and it 's kind of touched on in the strategic framework but i wonder if it needs to be a little bit more really really at the front of us so it 's really clear that that 's our expectation if if people know that 's the expectation those are the girls then developers designers yep the whole system then uses that or as Megan Reese a C 's accessibility or sees the world through an accessibility lens there was a meeting of public sector organizations a few weeks ago with a view to signing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check a bit about sitting wheel or arrogance is when we sit a bold target 40 homelessness so this isn 't it then we set a bold target and we do our best to attain the highest level we can obviously budgets constraint well with accessibility I think the only other point I like matt is a district come this is much more than just about disability accessibility is a lot wider than that and I think it 's got to be seen as a holistic view of the whole population we 're all going to have accessibility needs at one point to another whether it 's twisting your ankle or in the up in a wheelchair if we all have had to have that in our minds not for here and now it 's for the next 20 so there has been a whole enhancement of the visitor experience update and the document itself and it now says promote the development of visitor attractions visitor experiences but this is as part about an infrastructure that are accessible for you so the language of accessible for all is definitely there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

Harbour,6Rm40mavTto,20160714,417.08,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1159,t1 and governance group MOU Andrew did you get some changes to this so there are some amendments which of Awesome changes which have already been provided so they 're there don 't give yeah that 's fine and I 'll come back and make some comments on those at the appropriate time okay good question and it 's really around it 's been raised about the concern about sedimentation coming in from the port hills and into the harbor and I just want some assurance apply that in fact sufficient modeling has been done around sedimentation particularly relation to any change in sea and foot and see flows given that there 's a much bigger reclamation area going out now as in your view has there been sufficient modelling done so that in fact we can be assured that the increased reclamation area with the reclamation isn 't going to actually add to the sedimentation issues around the inner harbor okay with modelling I 'm not certain that that has been done in an integrated way but certainly the Lyttelton poor company as part of its recovery plan has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was to look at the implications of the port covery plan on waves and tidal current on the lyttelton harbour and the obviously the executive summary of that is stated that while wave impact in localized areas around the port will change and that were the expansion of the port that obviously tidal movement in the never navigation channel will increase the title strength will increase but that is likely to be offset by the when they actually do the dredging and deep in that area so it will return to where it was informer for most situation so the expectation in that I 've once the dredging was done it would would return you end that there wouldn 't require ongoing increased dredging in maintenance costs whether there 's ongoing requirement for dredging in the immediate future i 'm not sure but i know that the littles importer 's looking at having sensors out into the in the harbor right through to the entrance looking at wave and other hydro net dynamic matters that are going on to ensure that the dredging that Undertaker 's as i expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clive pretzel might be useful it when you 've got the results of their monitoring that perhaps to come to council yeah that will certainly be part of the overall project plan works research work that will be formulated and brought together around this whole management plan yeah thank you cool okay move Andrew I 've got an amendment to the wording actually if I can also point five because it needs to be strengthened a little bit and I 'm sure this is probably exactly the same note it wasn 't just anticipating that I 've got some wording here as well but some it is the sofa working passing we need to so that we 're using the same languages in the mou we need to refer to that as the around polk partners project team right so ask Rebecca Roper yep and rather than ask I would like to use something a little bit stronger I think require would be good there rather than ask asking is one thing but I think we 're saying this needs to happen and in developing the plan was the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project plan is to engage with them in developing the plan so to engage with the Harborside communities in developing the plan as early as possible so it 's not just this is what we 've done now we 're coming to tell you about its actual engagement in the development of the plan okay right okay that 's quicker a little project it 's projecting to engage with the required yep I think that 's cause it 's a requirement rather than a request again and it 's a little bit more specific about what request we don 't know problems if you actually look at the report which the project plan which is on the second to last page of their attachment to one of the milestones is to meet with the community and stakeholders and the dates in there in that table are going to be adjusted in the next week or so because that plan is resting on all the parties signing ups of this MOU okay so moved and ruin signature colors make it going yeah look just briefly to I think clearly as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to take andrew and helping lead this could also the cool looking to board in the staff like I think this is a good position for us to be n in the amendments today hopefully will help it progress okay what that way it 's more I 'll just make some comment upon that okay okay yeah so I 'm pleased to see again the the amendment and the additions to the original resolution there is Ben and they will continue to be a high level of interest in local communities in the health of the harbor for some time and communities certainly are already very interested in what 's going on here and I think it 's important that we involve the community board the zone committee and the local communities in the development of this project as much as we possibly can so there 's a good level of information there so this is a good level of community by into what 's happening community support for what 's happening but also so that the huge amount of local knowledge is able to be taken into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a piece of work which has been talked about in many different ways for a long time and it just so happens that here we are doing it because it 's an action dropping out of the recovery plan but in terms of the health of the harbor or in terms of sedimentation issues in terms of a stocktake of a huge amount of really good work which has already been done and in terms of outcomes for water quality recreation ma hang acai and a number of other outcomes this is very positive and this represents a significant step along the way to actually getting some of those good outcomes realized so happy to support it today oh ok I 'll put it we have got a second to Emily I was thinking it yeah those sequins okay i 'll put that those in favor please say aye aye those opposed okay thank you I 've got item,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

programme,tLEP3Eqjs-w,20160714,418.849,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1360,okay asking for tea have you thought somebody 's got to mean months there can I speak today there are some amendments that local staff to put up and I discussed it with James off in Jamie overall agrees with mother back Joe Joe do you want to tell us anything before we do this and I think it 's all so clear right okay she was really happy with this one minor change yeah I think it 's just an omission and i just changed three days to three working days three working days yes no problem yes PA I don 't quite understand the d-sub delegated what so a community board might have a committee of for that makes indecision no no I mean since the head or the team was away all right they could sub delegate it to somebody else knew when I was doing a chamber to it does the sorry yeah okay we got on this just something I just wondered if there was any condition that the trees had to be of a certain age or Z guys like if you remove team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to actually put things they don 't replace them with little seedlings yes I bridget road by the time it 's ten significant reserving the world so what 's in the policy Joe do you know no it 's not actually specify the size of the tree and we would differently select trees from the nursery that are larger there have been large trees removed but its case by case basis early because some trees were not fit for the site anyone know so this battle but I just want something in there that goes more like we 're welcome to a is that you know to chop down trees as a cost-saving but yeah so I actually think that if people are going to save money by cutting down trees there should be some so what would you actually want to put in it Jonnie so I just think that any term left on the delegation must be replaced to a similar value as what there before okay well yeah I guess that can I just say I 'd like to support it but achieving that enters the steam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some trees are incredibly valuable yeah tjr dollars so you know we took we need to I guess we need to be clear on on the side explicitly that that would take I 'm wanting to support it Jonnie but yeah I think we need to be I 'm really saying what she 's trying to tell you to reword it mm-hmm well you suggest a willing it 's not quite as okay all right is there any debate or work I just say a couple things beauty I 'm sure but can I just make sure that this has anybody got any changes that they want to make to us it might be good on e to put replacement briquettes is pure council is it our policy never we adopted that to replace them so do here so SP council I can 't see it means anything placed in that exact place um we gotta pull this kiss yeah we can yeah okay right okay so actual debate on it now well no other suggesting is it 's not a debate in the true since the word but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm i don 't think it 's news to anyone that council is always the art of compromise i probably lean more towards the second option here but we just discussed like obviously spoke with felonies accounts with disgust yeah the pressure points around it and i think would have clearly good compromise there so thanks to staff thanks to Phil and all the other colleagues that ultimately we probably want the same thing very briefly I just want to say that I don 't think it 's news to anyone either that trees and parking and tend to come up quite a lot at community board and when one of those has the potential to being removed from getting in front of that community board I can just see that as a recipe for disaster the last thing community boards want to do is hold up skirt program that is not the intention of versatile so we 're going to be pragmatic about it but it 's just in case there is going to be something that will really roll a community that you have got an opportunity for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don 't envisage that it 's going but I think it gives some comfort around it so I think it 's a good compromise and thanks to staff and colleagues for your support on this okay I 've got a Yanni Andrew and fell and I 've recognized for first I 'm sorry what have I started me know I just feel very simply say I 'm very pleased at the community boards in particular raise their concerns with us to make sure this works like clearly there are helping times when trees have been taken out and it has not been a good process and this will this will clarify that process so in fact for the exit are till the end of the year we it 'll be clear as to the community boards involvement in an effect sign off will be in to ski yeah okay jaani yeah I think for me my understanding of this policy is this will actually help us protect trees and minimize the loss of trees unnecessarily so I think that 's a really positive thing I think we 've seen far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from that but actually the cost of the city heads up after a while and the cost of the community so I think this is a really positive way forward that hopefully will enable more trees to be saved lest trees to be removed unnecessarily and put some plastic process by which the community boards can be informed which I think and give feedback the Java is really important so I 'm happy to support it okay enter thank you I 'm a lot more supportive of this in its current form than I was in the way that it was originally set out in the resolution in the report I think it needs to be borne in mind that trees have got a value other than a financial value in terms of an environmental value and an amenity value to residents and visitors and part of the character of our city so I certainly welcome the fact that the balance has been tipped a little bit more in favor of the community boards having an earlier heads up and an opportunity to to provide feedback this is one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deal with between the the need for the scope program to be able to progress without too much in the way of impediment but at the same time the opportunity for the community board to be involved and comment on behalf of the communities if I could just make one comment in regard to the wording I think it just needs to be tidied up slightly community board is to be given three working days notice prior to any removals to be carried as that just happened yeah yeah removal be carried out while I was looking the other way you changed exactly what I want to change so thank you for a mind reader City Marines okay right excellent so we 're all good okay so has somebody moved it a little bit not so much so and Jamie okay i 'll put that those in favor please say aye oh those post carried thank you as imperative,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

2016,S4C33yxDxtA,20160714,359.8,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1093,"39 I will have to vote on this yeah okay move Dave speaking to Johnny i 'll put that soon why are we getting us now rather than just to delay with the council 's meetings it ideally should have come through to your meeting and the last meeting in June and it didn 't I was waiting for some clarification back from the remuneration authority so they have actually seen the draft policy and provided some feedback as I 've referenced in the report so it 's purely being a a timing matter right and the other question I had was um you made a distinction between the chairs of council committees but there 's nothing that mentions cheers of working parties so I just want to give you consider that one place 347 does it seem to matter but yes i mean i 'm not i 'm not really came to have that exception for the chairs of the committee 's but if you were going to have it i saw one be fair to make sure that the working party church also access that sorry what can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mind to add that to it I see no no issue with that what do we need to have it there at all we are are you getting any just like I 'm paragraph 2 under counselors yeah it 's just a grants extra budget outside of the individual budgets that have already been saved for 4,000 cool committee chairs that adds additional two thousand dollars a year no no no so I just think we want to increase that to me whether we needed that or not if we did so you OMG it would follow that for example cheers of hearing panel 's would also receive that so that will benefit be okay if a solution why was heavy just to take it out because I thought for thousands pretty pretty yeah sorry I don 't is that a new provision that 's Bigfoot uh-huh no yeah we just take out to completely so everybody gets sent yeah I mean that 's my view everyone should get okay everybody so what 's the justification and argument for it being yummy I 'd like to hear that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into into distribution area funding and paragraph 1 why does it not fall into their tea I think we need some more information before we so no it 's quite simple so at the moment jarrell explain and this is actually just the policy that you adopted and last year and with amendments and from the determination from the remuneration authority with a couple of sections so I 've purely lift that in there because it 's what you had if the council chooses to take it out there 's no issue with why 's that via though Joel I mean it just because it was the other is necessarily a reason so why and the point that we made is what is it that that would mean that it would fall outside discretionary funding we need the specific answers to those questions I think before we decide to start pulling things out okay and just looking at it it 's I i have read it as assuming the chairs of council committees may have an additional responsibility over and above some of that other roles of counsel I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the four thousand dollars I guess to enable it to be if they 're going to specific conferences to be above that amount of the discretionary authority serious fishing like Nora no I don 't think we need it do it I 'm not pull it out because there may be other types of sources of funding of that should be required well we don 't know that and I 'm not doing it now we don 't need it Oh might need it do we want it or not want to say in its part it 's clearly for part of counselors training and if there 's additional conferences to which can be very informative the needs to be a clear funder stir who real late and who don 't well can I just be clear so there 's an allocation anyway does anybody do people want to in there how long does this last four joke and this is for and and 12 months ago a right nice another question because well I banette can we just get a clear view on this do people want on page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my question is about it so how often do you know the community board cheese exceeds the four thousand dollar counts a solution that 's what you know what else you how often do they exceed it and to the best of my knowledge it hasn 't happened but I will acknowledge that I 've been sitting in this seat for six months so so you don 't have that information yep well can I just get a sharp ends do you want it if

that those in favor please say aye all right those post item appreciate next box discretion in disguise fun tell us or no we just has it right is there anything you want to say before we pass it no I think everything is there everything 's quite clear yep yeah I did want to just talk on every flea um just before you drove out is there any questions of Cleo Nicola Yanni yeah I thought CSI closed down no we address this see this is operating and they were operating at a lower level until they found out the result of today 's standing misreported young and the second question is I mean in again you 'll probably oh it 's not relevant or out of order but in terms of us meeting with a key see around us because I just don 't understand I mean as any conversation being paired with EQC sorry most amazing well notice run the cs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made to eq c to fund a given that that 's generated a lot of the problems that people are having but we 've seen over the last 12 months and if so what 's the response been and if not can we meet with the board make a request I 've been up for clear to you know there 's this discussions happening at the moment about the future of cs and other related organizations at the end of the year and we 've had our meeting just recently with cs and res and the insurance councils members not end in b and all those players to look at what we what we do going forward so this particular application is to support and the estimators here to coincide with razors funding as well which which ceases at the end of years reinforcement so this deals with the council funding of it so i 'm not going to bring an eq c at this stage you can raise that at an informal warm terms of meeting with them no no right can I just ask one other question which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not mental health it 's the well-being is that funding I will be accessed by this service I 'm sorry I 'm an idiot a new model because you an answer but this deal 's worth the discretionary response family support for CS to keep it going yep okay so if that 's all the questions any debate LEC oh yeah cool I just wanted to say that I 'm money I would encourage everyone to support this I think everyone well I think it 's a shame that we can 't support them from more highly financially anyway but I take yannis point as well I do think that this is something that requires input for more than just the City Council the the the issue here is that CS was formed because no one was willing to fund an organization like this in the first place to that place and I suspect that that position hasn 't changed although it should because of this tale in now we 've got people who are incredibly stressed needing people to advocate for them and I still don 't understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ push back whenever the word advocacy is used people are exhausted people can be offered exactly what they wanted and we 're entitled to in the first place and still reject it because they are so tired and so confused and just so over it and they need an independent advocacy support in order to walk them through this i 'm working with a couple at the moment who were made priority in 2012 by eq see one of them has cerebral palsy they are still not back in their house there is one of dozens and dozens there are 60 cases currently on the book at sea and put success and then at a number of cases that red doesn 't deal with or can 't deal with because of the high needs and advocacy support of the client gets referred to raise so it is still very much needed and the point that claire made we we can be confident that there will be something moving forward and i think it will contain all of the elements of the organizations that are there at the moment that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would like to c M advocating for to use the word again as an organization that is made up of the a players the a team and those organizations to help support these last and claims through so I definitely supports to encourage you to do it le you want to move again you want a second d smile make two very quick point a thank you the first is that you could translate what is on the front page of the press today over the stress caused the school closures with insurance in terms of impact in the community perhaps we will never know that degree of kind of post-traumatic stress disorder other mental well-being issues in the community for sometimes second they all want something good to come out of this so if res is going to finish at the end of the year and see us shortly to I would like a template for future insurance following natural disaster as some kind of template put together preferably by CS actually because we we can 't have new zealanders going through this again it 's been an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operating you can 't put another news sitting through this so that would be my recommendation I don 't know whether it 's in the scope at this report to completely outside it that 's right but I we do need a piece of work on template going forward okay so you can we measured it she 'd committee okay um okay yeah new this is debate yeah yeah so um I mean I will support this organization I mean this was the one that I 've always been much more supportive of than than the rest because I thought this one would be able to read hopefully be a bit more private provide support around advocacy which I think was one of the real gaps and I think it would be really good to hear directly from them at some stage picking up on the point that Glynn 's mode which was also something i was going to raise as well as that you know we 've had the earthquakes but we 've got people that are affected by flooding we 've got people are affected by skirt repair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurance issues that people are trying to deal with and what we hopefully have learned is that we need these support systems in place and actually we can learn from what we 've been through and put forward a system going forward I think that would be incredibly beneficial I I do think we should as a council meet with the eqc board again and raised with them the concern and ask what they are doing to address the causes of why people are in this situation it seems to me if there 's not a legal responsibility there is absolutely a moral responsibility from the insurers and from eq c to ensure that people are being treated fairly and have access to good information and fair processes that they can understand and participate in and if it means fundings these sorts of services then I think we should put that on the table so I 'm very supportive of the work that these that this these two organizations do we haven 't really talked about very mad but I 'm so big less supportive of that one as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage to hear directly from the people at CS and then try and work our way forward so maybe for next year 's annual plan we can actually at a proper funding package that goes some stability around it going forward okay july product it 's all right just very quickly and follow on from there because as part of their the earthquake recovery is actually encouraging the people of Christchurch and all of us to get out there and enjoy what we do have in our city in one of those James 's fury meters Doric park and I many pleased to to see this come through today because you know with some 32,000 people going through you 're benefiting from it and all the volunteers they have 300 working there it 's a real gym and if you want to go down there and experience walking along streets with no cars and what it might be like in Christchurch in a few years with just bikes and walk and pedestrians it 's a really good refreshing view of the way things used to be so I 'm really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see us lose theory Mead we 've got to keep it going it 's wonderful work there and to see all the restoration they do on the trains and the buses and things it 's just wonderful so I many pleased to support this wasn 't ok I 'll put this doesn 't painfully say I I chose to carried thank you very much indeed you guys","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

favor say aye aye I supposed carried clear do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 31 thanks clear what schedule aces shiny but I drew it should i do a quick mediate easier yes arrive early it 's got a rather long history yes okay so back in 2014 we and staff undertook schedule review of the parks mizzou spinal unit which is includes obviously the standard consultation procedure special consultation procedure sorry in a hearings panel so that hearings panel report reported back to council in November 2014 council refuge that report back to the hearings panel over three issues scheduling issues across six the clause 9 to do with cars parking and parks and cross 13 the aircraft cause which was just a weird around ordinarily as you know well you may remember that recently council adopted in our pas policy which refers to connects to the aircraft clause in the parks and reserves by law in the sense that and the bile or it 's is one kilogram in the rpa is policy says 1.5 kilograms so hence the regulation and consents committee is recommending that we actually that you also consider approving a resolution around a mending that the Bible from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then of course we so we did go off and urine scandal looked at those three issues in reported back in March 2015 and the council at that point largely accepted the by the proposed bylaw in principle but it did ask for more targeted consultation around the scattering of ashes cause in particular they wanted us to talk to keys the previous sudden that is in some new key stakeholders such as the relevant Runanga the New Zealand funeral directors association in the kinder bring cremation society so in the report you 'll find that consultation results summarized in table 1 majano ikura Te 'o undertook consultation for us with the relevant Runanga in here report big is attachment fee to a large extent the consultation the Runanga in particular have moved a long way from their previous submission that they made to the original parks and reserves viable they had originally wanted a prohibition but moved towards being open to non regulatory approaches such as but me there but the preference was for that council Explorer designated sites in parks and that those be developed with with through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sites and also their preference really was that you know we actually skater gardens and cemeteries for example because it 's in really an existing place for such okay a business I 'm probably the New Zealand Funeral Directors Association dear the preference was for a non regulatory approach most of the community boards we talked to that was also a preference and the Canterbury cremation society did have a preference that their council provide some sort of alternatives not just say restrictor but actually provides an alternative people because it is a practice that many members of the community wish to undertake so in summary really divisional that the for the recommendations in the report that we do adopt their proposed parks and reserves by law now 2016 because the consultation was undertaken in this council tomb if we choose not to adopt it at this time we will have to go back either wait until I think its 2,023 before the next review is scheduled or go through the whole special consultation procedure again with the new council and the rationale or a non-regulatory approach through scattering of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice have enforcing it to do with the way in which the practice is undertaken say on an hour na sa in our parks or any of our public places the difficulty is that you might have people gathering for some time but that 's not an issue it 's the scaring of asia 's which will happen very quickly and it will be difficult to enforce thank you shall we just have any questions to start work and don 't just questions if there are any Andrew thank you and this is a question although require a little bit of explanation as to how it becomes one obvious quick as I can I have a concern that stanberry park remains in the report considered a suitable place for scattering ashes bearing in mind the comments in the MKT report on page 233 of our agenda so this is the commentary from our new cone the final response- karuna is that they remain opposed to the scattering of ashes at Stanbury Park it remains in the report so it interests me cause 6.5 on page 2 18 of the agenda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the position taken is noted but the fact that Onew karuna are opposed to the scattering of ashes at Stanbury park isn 't contained in that part of the report given that we know the local runner of proposed and given that we 've got the recommendation that management guidelines for any agreed cyta to be developed with the relevant ruining and we know that in this case the Runanga are not in agreement with that site I 'm interested in why stanberry Parker remains in there I 'd prefer to see it removed I guess my question is to what extent did the committee consider the conflict between leaving Stanbury park in there and the response from the local ruining a particularly in the context of the the agreement that we have further conversation with Runanga and why is it still there if that was considered my understanding is that the recommendation is simply that staff now go in identify some designated sites so those sites with the sites that we consulted on so we 've included them in the report but that in no way means that any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the designated sites we simply we put it into it interests me though that we would publicly we consider stanberry park to be a sight which could be considered suitable when we 're saying we respect the views of Runanga and the view of Runanga is this is not a suitable place and we don 't support it I think there 's a there 's a potential cultural insensitivity there and unless we 're giving very little weight to the views of Runanga I find it really difficult to see why would continue to be there now what we can take it out I 'm not a problem at all I mean it 's in there because they were some site it was included in the original consultation with ruining up because it had some sites and that meet the sort of those conditions that we 've am identified in 6.2 like it 's not a it 's not a sports park it 's not a community park it 's not a garden or heritage park there are some sites are that weren 't within 50 meters of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was included in the original consultation we can take it out I think I guess my giving the response from runner I think it would be reasonable to take it out so however we want to do that I 'll moving amendment if necessary okay other any is there any debate on this pretty about it i 'm assuming that was the only question because that 's the only hand I syrup is the narrow need abate yep yep Lynn oh thank you so notwithstanding that issue but I look at the recommendations staff clarifying around the parks I do support this I 've got to Maine woods I think it strikes a good balance between kind of choice and protocol and I wish to note that culture protocol exists not only for Modi but also for puck out as well I think that cart the underestimated I know that from experience in my previous role secondly Ann in terms of kind of oversight of it in practice that probably come down to the funeral directors on the day so I think there 's some you know we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be undertaken in a reasonably respectful manner you can never completely control it as you 've said clear all or police it that I know and it actually comes down to it that I think it will be undertaken in a respectful manner but I whole heartedly sir porn obviously taking communities with us through MKT for instance I don 't support unless a fair approach that you can scatter them where the heck you like I think that that really isn 't sensitive but this seems to strike a good balance between you know is more freedom to do that but also having identified play system okay Dave I 'm assuming you 're closing the great yep look as chair of that hearings panel this has been a particularly vexatious issue that 's gone backwards and forwards two or three times now and in in the last resolution we have our start to go back and investigate the matter further and they 've come forward with this report which I 'm very very comfortable with and for me it there are two key elements and this one we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scattering ashes and secondly we recognize the practicalities of enforcing a bylaw that would prohibit the scattering of ashes so I think we have come a long way from where we were earlier and that this resolution albeit addressing the Stanbury park and that there was a couple of other issues like that we 've got to a stage now where I think that we can and I would urge that we we do accept this resolution today because this this is going forward there could be several years before we were able to come back to it again and it would be good to get this matter resolved within this council Tim so I 'm like I 'm very happy to can I recommend making a recommendation thank you know just 2 g 's unassuming everybody 's okay with Andrews suggestion on story part and we just suggest in part 1 be that designated sites excluding stand retire yep very comfortable with that thank you said okay does it make sense to we want to take it it 's okay so it 's moved day and sleep and edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aye I like those post carriage thank you it 's been a long time coming thank you for

Review,eSMncFnaN_s,20160713,462.659,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1380,so proper question stems yep it was fun clarification so is this is your board seeking to mow the riverbed all the way down right no such thing as a site-specific so the background that we 've got is at the moment you see a lawn mower come along and mow the tops of the banks and they sort of have the wings that that sort of get better the way down the sides but then it the last sort of meter or so of their it doesn 't reach you can 't get right down to the water 's edge until you get this scraggly stuff and then every I don 't know when it gets to a meteor or so tall and just got to be on dad Rick they get a whole big team of guys on weed workers who spend days and days of week working it along but my question is are you wanting the river banks to be mowed all the way to the water no I think it 's more it since it 's an issue that I 've raised for a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said we we let a contract to to mow our riverside and variably a ride on mower is used which doesn 't get very closer to the edge of the mowing struck and they get further and further inland there 's a great clump of grass grows and the water 's edge down to sort of where the title mark comes if you like as left as well where our contract excuse me my question is are you wanting the riverbanks to be mowed all the way down to look into that video no choice I just see guys in terms of the resolution that 's here because it has some object and Roy to answer that question particularly but it also has some cost implications so my point there 's no no no get Andrea to answer who nobody appoint us that if this the answer to the question we have the West Milton 's own committee trying to stop the river banks being lowered because they not only em act as a filter for the element which contains contaminants but it also helps for the biodiversity so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurry on the SS we 're not talking about and I 'm sorry eh come on you 're talking about a contract that allows we waste hundreds of thousands of dollars I 'll imagine why we named water no no let 's dive is very yes need a point of order Andrea are you looking for these because there is ecological reasons why those are not Mon yes are you looking tomorrow so we 're not doing this from the point of the ecological reason we that this has come up is around a waste of money in a duplication of contractors so is there a way to while being sympathetic to the ecology and in doing the right job but having it that it 's not a waste of money and I see Jesus because there are quite major implications of just of what that bottom meter actually does even though it may not look tidy it actually does a good good lot of work so can I sit consider that that can I suggest that rather than just recommending that we consider this that we actually consider the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I said there is own committee action and process at the moment and progress to be looking exactly at this riverbank and contracting business so can we perhaps tie-in was what 's going on there rather than start the whole thing again right because Paul horses is investigating there thank you so can I suggest that that their council consider the implication that ecological implications and the costs and the work already being done but in this injection with the work already being done by the by the Christchurch west melton zone because all through that of Christ your twist model yeah and we will it come back to to a tee so can we then refer it to staff and come back to infrastructure committee said okay yep okay so we pick up the ecological things because I don 't think they are just sense it would be nice to have they are really really involved yeah the well-being of the waterways yeah and yeah our point was because of the we can say a waste of money okay energy progression Dave the risk of seeming pedantic I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole we are not talking about going down to the water 's edge we are not talking about mowing into ecological here is we are talking about the the edge of the Mon strip of our riverbanks no it actually no no I 'm double-edged respectfully finish and respectfully finish mmm yes we use two different sort of contracts here to mow our grass booms on our rivers edge and we don 't when we don 't do it properly because at the end we use right on those and they don 't get to the edge of the boom if you like on the riverbank and that last little bit goes wider and wider and wider and then we send a gang of guys with weed eaters down that take weeks to deal with the the last bit of the mowing out our river edge we 're not talking about mowing into the ecological area will get grass growing a metre high because these ride on mowers can 't get where they should be they should be using a boom mower that can just get over the edge and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole point of the exercise just poorly we are not thinking about mowing to the ecological she was actually actually their resolution does refer to that Dave which is why people were concerned about yet yeah can I suggest as a way forward and that we look at asking for a staff report to come to Infrastructure Committee on the ecological implications and costs in conjunction with their work already being done by the waste management committee on the relevant and then the rest of what 's here could I just suggest that perhaps come to the land range working group first might be good yep because we 're already doing a me for the we come to that infrastructure viable and drainage yeah yeah never come to eat yeah sure yeah knee yeah I strongly support this um I known areas and our board for example one side of the river gets mon and the other doesn 't and probably because it 's in two different contracts once called a reserve but the other side of the rowers like literally got grass go footpath but it doesn 't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side is maintained pristine condition all the time probably because they show you my contracts so it takes the same equipment tank will be more cost effective it actually makes a lot of sense the other example that we have an hour board is the rubbish burns down the East Bernard the runs that are on road reserve versus the ones that are Park refinishing it is a different issue and I go to stick rigidly to this one what 's this so the idea that we have one contractor or one contract that looks at a joint up approach i think is really sensible because i think there will be efficiencies and it will also be better immunity for our local communities of having a more holistic approach to how we do contracting so i think that 's what this is doing and I 'm very supportive are we all agreed then yeah so this is moved by Dave and secretive by yanni ok I 'll put their those in favor please say aye I post carriage thank you,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

out an invitation to you all to come and have a look at our tiny hats exhibition that we have going on a new brighton for the next week open daily from Team two or four at 60 right how big I think they 're some of the drawings are about that but but the real ones are going to be a couple of meters by a couple of meters so this is a council initiative it 's a bit like the giraffes that were done a couple of years ago to get people engaged with the space in so we had 90 people put designs in which is absolutely mind-blowing and we 've had I think almost a thousand people come through in the first week to have a look at them so highly recommend you come down and have a nosey know where is 60 60 new brighton wall 16 your breath yep so it 's right next to the westpac bank down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road thank you anything else so may have road improvement plan so I 'm hoping that this was going to be straightforward but it 's looking a wee bit like it may not be so full of hay fonts weight of Canterbury disabled persons assembly came and spoke with us around a number of concerns ahead for the area and we would have to say that we agreed with him around those issues that he pointed out they were very pragmatic and made a lot of sense we see down the bottom of the page secret here or note that as a result of the meeting the shortcomings of the Mary high road bus stop will be addressed but there was only one part of a bigger picture end I saw the update of plans i think a couple of days ago and those a bit disappointed to see that a lot of the other suggestions that were made haven 't been followed through now there 's a roundabout i don 't know if you know it 's right it right at burwood hospital there 's a roundabout and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dearie on one corner and then there 's a bakery in a bottle store and a couple of other shops and so to get from the hospital to either those things you need to be at across the road and at the moment the only road that 's going to have a walk wait you know one of those like there 's the island waste quest wheelchair some things to get through is the one that doesn 't go to either of the two shops and so the board quite strongly the staff that we really thought that that was important now this is a the hospital as a big Hospital I 'm sure you most of you went to the the opening yet a viewing and bent the opening and that kind of thing it 's not a small hospital and I think this intersection needs to be treated better the adjuster be a minimum response and that 's all it seems to be getting at the moment Ed 's it might be legally compliant don 't think it just so that you get some resolution of it I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is meeting with Philip but I 'm just wondering if it would be sensible if we asked him to come and meet with the community board and you speak directly to him about those issues well I thought we had that was the thing we had net worth whoever was the cable Chris Gregory 's in charge of that department yes is it him that you met were no it wasn 't so sorry awesome no chris is the boss I know part and I just suggest that we asked him to come along to your community board meeting you go through the issues with them because yeah we 're not going to resolve that footpath and bet whatever at the moment and would that work for you yep that would get there we go to okay yeah it see if it works begin he said partly does but I think through it needs to be elevated to the extent that I see it as a joint up kind of weekend health board counsel matter so it 's a substantial build and I think that our facilities for public transport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite yet built to save Northlands or what 's provided for there yes how well agree with you completely yeah I think it needs to get on the agenda at the hospital has got you know it 's got the spine over at the Bruins Barney and I realize we 've heard about it often yeah but what 's happened fill in terms of the bus stop and the access to that hospital well I 'll need to find out but what I kept the positive part is that the DHB have they participate in the new joint public principal committee so that 's a good start and there 's a fair way to go yet to actually have have the bus stop within the hospital grounds installed in a cleaner place which is closer to the Taleggio hospital building and that their conversations which we need to progress further the issues that i do have aren 't necessarily with the bus stop the inventors the other okay we 're looking at all join there that 's how you cross the road to get to the donut house what Harris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and talk with your community board yeah and then do you want further meeting so that you 've got e can and the hospital board there as well um yeah and is it worth absolute as well pull it together okay yeah so will then yeah at the moment it seems to it appears so no I 'm not speaking for staff but it appears from from my point of view that as being treated just as a suburban intersection it note we appreciate how important business it 's really important that it works for people who are in wheelchairs yeah especially that well I given the nature of what I know I 'm totally on you should be an exemplar I stop I mean I 'm only with your job yep I 'm timing with you yeah so um so if we look at two things why I 'm getting Chris to come meet with your community board so you deal with all those issues and then what we 'll try to do is get the DHB and again because we we obviously don 't tell them what to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah that 's it ok preciate it thank you can even Dave um there 's this intersection of Greater condition of the concern for the new hospital or is this just something that was quiet and have you don 't think that 's a condition if I can see what do I haven 't heard that that 's the case it was more just that okay I just know it was sort of a demon in the muck right of an intersection right be caught yeah yeah so might be worthwhile looking at the conditions of the consent if there are any because I know an Albert we 've had developments where they actually have to do certain road improvement yeah if they can i create so much earphone this appears to be coming all out of Council budget and the counter budget didn 't seem to have never be at the right significance for publication I had was like this I think this is the same intersection that was raised our annual plan process what 's work have you can you report back on man we had the workshop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was here sucks how it so yeah I haven 't seen the level of detail to know whether all of those issues that were raised it than anything they have been dealt with I 've only had a really quick glance 11 saw that there was hoping there was a lot of gifts that that fell it brought up um I think the bus stop one has been slightly has been improved there was ever one honey wouldn 't that guy that came here and wait to okay David look I just want to reinforce this motion of joined up approach he was dhb have spent mega millions on board hospital and transferred a lot of facilities from pmh over there and even to the extent of the bus services I 've been a bit irritated lately where I 've had people ringing me about when is the actual stop in the hospital going to be activated here that will pique want to refresh their their timetabling and then in the meantime we 've got some elderly people that have to Trek all the way down to get the orange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's different a definite need to coordinate not only buses pedestrian crossings but traffic management and the whole area because it 's w so the reports coming to our board for a decision very soon but I 'd like to see we can put I don 't know whether we can put that on hold and talk do it properly because otherwise we 're getting to undo potentially a hot guys can you put up the action points that we were just suggesting one was that we asked Chris Gregory to meet with the community board read this issue and the second was that we seek to have a cane and cdhb meet with you as well you look new solutions no these are just action points to follow on so so they would just be a note to the resolution a note okay clothes make a suggestion yep sure we run a impian process through the through the reverb for some developers and a while back I mentioned about so I start to finish approach as opposed to an end of the en approaching what a start the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Indian process looks at the building and what 's then the activity that building creates but the start the finish looks at more than just the building looks like outside the building at the public realm and around that area so you might have like the Burwood hospital they need to be a more holistic approach to actually have a that through that development what else is going to be needed as we do with the buildings in the central city are they getting built looking at the public realm on the outside is a lot of infrastructure is damaged or not sufficient for thanks it 's a very good suggestion but it since it 's not on the agenda I don 't accept that but it is a very good suggestion at mpi with the year or rigs and consents might want to look at so cannot connect to because to me it seems one of the issues is there 's no money so when we 've had this for the road in your where the money actually doesn 't cater the footpath so do we need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I don 't I don 't know what the money situation is it 's not covered in the report so I don 't remember every line of the budget all ok so I 'm going to put this and this is any changes and it moved Dave significant Lynn but that those in favor please say aye okay as opposed to carried and then I 'm on ice,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

appropriately we have elation at one o 'clock this afternoon older persons winter warmer and we 're hoping that they 'll be greased up as well and we 've got a french singer and I did cross off for breakfast I didn 't have cross on for breakfast but I might have had a bucket of wine we 're Ethel eyes open thank you Karen are you like to make your submissions in French oh well that 's not a story but I had five years of french tutor edge which resulted me getting seventeen percent in school see I thought the translation was about gardening it turned out to be about a laboratory now is going to introduce the party right so I 'm he says part a is about a community horde palaia so I 'm we 've currently now got um sort of a dlf was made in Heath get bored which apparently Carolyn see took eighty years and the making which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to counsel as basically that people don 't know what a community board is and I 've suggested this before I think it um it would be good to have a generic flyer that goes out of the rates where we get our you know cheap golf entertainment and all these other things that we get but nothing that 's actually informational and something that tells people we go who are the people that are supposed to be talking to if you have an issue and you know if you 've been on community board you know that people will say to you ah are you on council all know I 'm not among community board and then you go down explaining what it is people don 't know about the community board we need them to know about it they need to know who to go to in what we can help them work so that 's basically the purpose of this I 'm particularly wanting it to be mailed to people and who gets rates but it can go on to other places as well obviously yeah any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hinge quick question and would that they would specific so well put the explaining he legit fire and all the right bathroom I really need it said what I was thinking because I had suggested that before and apparently it 's quite tricky to send out the mail Ward specific because you 'd need to sort out all the mailing when you do the rights I don 't know how it work so my idea was to do it quite a generic one to make it an easy thing to be posting out with everyone but I mean it could be ward specific but I was thinking something simple that just says you know if you 're in this area it 's like the San you could even put where it is on to the rights notice which area and as part of the address maybe I don 't know it yeah so it could actually be even you know pushing community boards like make committee boards your first call that 's right people just started to know that we exist I didn 't know if we existed before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most people don 't you know people know about counselors counselors a busy community board members are busy toe but that we should be the people who people talk to you first so that we can then advocate on their behalf okay can I just suggest in order to progress it that we refer this to the community support and governance unit develop post-election mmhmm yeah that easy for you okay so that 's moved a full second attempt okay so sorry just a question do we have to do we request that they investigate this and attach costs and bring a report or do we just want to action it and if we do want to reaction if I want to put a time so today the next yeah fuses quarter next year order that 's what do you see doesn 't sound a big EP post-election yeah well just make sure it 's post-election so it 's not a look yet but I think we 'll just do it yes something doesn 't get lost in the system Vicki that 's all I mean I know it so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we don 't have to change the wording of the pate because the partes is investigate and we 're all happy that we just do it we 're happy if you just do it can we find like I just cheating the egg thing see either he 's okay something that was investigated and do it right okay okay okay cool put that goes right I carried that was going to be referred to community support and governance unit to investigate and do post-election right okay thank you so thats item 19 item 20 and more weird and we 've got a couple of issues to raise an item 20 21 and 22 because we go free board meetings to revealed it you may notice that we 've had seven months of an absence of traffic reports except for I think 12 reps and it 's nobody 's fault there 's been a bit of drama and tragedy in among staff members and the traffic engineering and we understand that but we have got an item 20 a delegation from the location area residents association and they were snippy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines and they have not had a response and we haven 't had a report to the board and we 're starting to feel that we 're just not reacting appropriately to the community nor acting properly with the community and we 've got some major traffic issues including words lease and the adventure pack coming on to kashmiri road which is going to be extremely dangerous come December the 16th when the park opens and we 're just not giving a response on traffic issues and we are not critical of staff we understand but we would appreciate it if we could start to get things underway and the other thing is we 're not receiving we find it really difficult to understand what 's happening to some of our buildings including heritage in our ward and we know the old stone house is being repaired we know the sign of the Kiwi is going to be repaired we notice signs of the tire haze being repaired we know the visitors center was opened we never got an invitation but these things do not come to our board in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheered report and that 's it and that 's very simple and we don 't we don 't get we don 't get the kinds of detail that would get enable us to respond to the community when they questioned us it would be I know it 's hard on staff and they 're working really hard but it would be great if we could get one pager every three months to say what 's happening in to the significant buildings in our ward and how is the progress I 'm looking at you do you keep report has been what we have summarized up at once a month and I know the community boards of taking their bets now if you want more than that it 's the major building to now board we 'd like little detail now and then and we 'd like to know about the openings and we 'd love to attend you said we can allow the pages of the chick report will appropriately to all because of anybody 's fault on them and I 'm sorry that 's what i thought was happening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dave they apparently gets it to the board advisor so we 'll just make sure that they go on your agenda beaky the other issue that your head was that you want to be invited to openings yeah not so we can Swan around but just so we can totally rigidity and engagement we will make sure that happens yeah okay right and Tre packer and trip okay he 's lightning wonderful yep okay right okay yeah that 's dealing with terrific yeah okay so 20 21 22 yep okay can 't move matt and mel wants to say site a sort of say well the thing i 'm just a very hairy one final time we hit the blessing Carlene came along which was really nice to have a link and with opening we had well over 100 people there we had quite lost staff there I 'm support we even had one of the staff JCP that community development advisor was given flowers by people from The Residents Association recognizing the effort that she 'd gone to so um yeah all the staff bazookas and Melanie got some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a really good community board member to lead there and clearly and focal up with full cooperation though from the hoone a community and what has been achieved as just as just fantastic as smelly as it described but it 's great where community board members actually lead by excellent doing and so this is a good example okay cool thank you so you 've moved from seconded item 20 21 22 put those those in favor please say aye or as opposed carriage thank you very much indeed thank you merci beaucoup,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

deputation on this matter and abroad meeting where we had a a representative from the inner city risk Neighborhood Association who was concerned that the potential for this easement was more than fun building that there could be roads in the future through hippie crap and was reassured by the thing it was limited and roads wouldn 't be able to be filled yeah so that was really good background okay so should we put that one move yeah nice even before that those in favor please say aye alright those opposed carried and then the least of the form United bowling coverings that 's right yeah yeah that the board was in favor of thus ended the duplication everybody 's all agreed on this it 's lugged and the deputation was on this one okay move Paul seconded Yanni but those in favor please say aye close Kerry unit aboard deputation in it so this is um this is this is a reference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very very quickly back to the days of my classics classes 27 years ago which were much the same as it presentation and yeah they were really good and I spent some time Ashley a.m. when i was at high school with a friend and reorganizing for us romans library all her books will ends ideas on school holidays yeah very filter to make contact again um but here is it is really important and there 's a real concern that there 's been a lack of strategic thought about heritage and christchurch especially post-quake and the ball really would like the plane urgently developed this is Engel cook somebody has something that they want to move on this yeah I mean I just going to suggest that um that we refer that recommendation around the strategy to the ched committee but also include reference to staff report heritage update including the situation for that all the yeah including thickens addressing the concern raised over in the field so how do exactly do you want to would it so that people win Kendra and so that we request a report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heritage strategy so I think in a sec moberly so in response to the digit ation yeah I think there are probably three things here if we can the first is englefield so a report on on where angle phaser let 's get catch of that one to request reported on one englefield yep too I 'd also like to see a report on what other buildings there might be that are in a similar situation to anger feel so heritage which is at risk okay even if that was just as simple as a list of buildings okay let 's just get the wording into it so one englefield sorry to any other properties that may be at risk other heritage properties that may be at risk across the city yep it may be at risk and three and update on the Heritage strategy yep and noting the comments on page 87 of our agenda around constraints around staff time but it would be good to know when that piece of work is able to be started and what the time frame for it is so it doesn 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need an expansion of the point that 's making the report today okay so as long as people understand that I think yeah bingo through a large Englefield large as it called is it right okay cool just on the update on the heritage JJ I think we get to also include an update on the buildings and cultural heritage recovery programs because there is actually an official recovery program that we haven 't had any reports okay so just so we capture it Jonnie and update on the Heritage strategy and buildings and cultural you did you I think it 's called early of nine buildings and heritage and the thing that we don 't know the name oh yeah on number two is here Beverly any other heritage properties across the city so that takes it wider than buildings you see properties it 's being recorded as buildings up well that most the map and things but I 'm thinking what do you think we ought to go this monuments yeah maybe we say heritage items around the building 's heritage no need to include Alice 's structures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved Yanni seconded Andrew but that those in favor please say aye Oh as opposed carried thank you that cover that one just on that one Vicki we 've set we 've said here buildings and cultural strategy what yani referred to as a recovery program sorry i can give you this sorry my bed and yeah that should be recovery program and yanni will give you the exact let 's build the heritage buildings and places recovery program for greater christchurch okay it 's apparently called the heritage buildings and recovery program is it heritage buildings and places heritage buildings and places covery program for greater christchurch places recovery prodigies recovery program for greater christchurch okay right we 've already carried that okay and with recovery before process the river cover thank you now we all know what it 's called okay and the board minutes put those pull Yanni and then so that 's item 12 and 13 put those those in favor please say aye those opposed carried chev anything else here no no thank you thank you very

that 's me yes agent one I don 't speak from what I think I speak from hard facts I will tell you at the end of it on things i think i would love to introduce you to the bellwether man of canterbury because here 's the man who was most responsible for bringing all the settlers out to canterbury and his never ever had any official recognition because you believe all the propaganda that came out in the earlier newspapers Fitzgerald was the murder of Canterbury because he had his own private agenda and I would not say that unless I could prove it I have been through all his own animus letters I 've looked at all the way his linguistics have put together I know he wrote the anonymous letters and I also know he wrote the replies now Britain was in his way William gaze Britain came here as head boy of the school where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely hosed until he said something else then Fitzgerald off because he went to university and learned his classics there but Britain could leave him for dead when it came to quoting classics he 's a bow in the man because when he read about it he owned a newspaper he and his brother in sherborn and he went to the and dead winter most miserable winter they had for years he went all the way from sherborne to London to buy the land at 10 days after the officers opened there must have run out of bated breath ten days after the officers opened he walked in and bought the first land so for there are a dozen reasons why he is the first man of Canterbury he stands off many things including market square he was the father of critters in Canterbury and I am so sick and tired of reading the newspapers every year when they review the cricket match and started off this little town and have godly scored this not a word about anybody else goggly scored that year after year I read it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not score the highest score my man did not only was that he was the oldest man on the field not only that he bowled out five people and not only that he bothers got another one but you don 't hear a word about that talk about convenient reporting I 'm telling you I deal in facts not what you think and not convenient reporting I offered that original painting at drawing chapel where is it yeah he 's a mediator that I read you join officer to the quick Academy cricket thing and you know the can make up their mind whether they want it or not so I have made it my mind I 'm not getting what I deserve it we can declare war overnight far the fair shot sink the first ship and I 'm talking about the Second World War and they can 't make up their mind will not in what a painting of your grandfather of cricket in Canterbury you make me laugh not to tell you what it does it wasn 't making me sick to start with here I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that off another you haven 't read it shame on you it 's about your own city and another manufacturer will burn certainly not aware of I can promise you that as 40 years of research in that I couldn 't write it because I had cataracts at the time and I asked my friend Jeffrey rice would he write up all my notes and you did here I 'm going to pass this around of school kids I ran the school and see if you like a talk on the social conditions of your own area even side girls used to the teacher brought them around the one girl with one pin wrote one letter to one man he gave her a prom that that house wouldn 't be bulldozed which the council had absolutely delegated it and though i was told us about to be late they 're going to bulldoze it nice and well you haven 't met me and i 'll fight you all the way for it it took me eight years to women so here you are they were going to sit down in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he not only started off market square he was also the chair of it the jockey club he was in left he was on the board of christ college when it first started when the Hemi park was all motor than they had a chairman social distinction and all that jazz nobody turned up to be chairman so the deputy chairman took over who was it william keys britain what did he do he gave the first trees to Hagi and he gave a sundial i went and asked where on earth is the sundial and the young guys did what we had the sundial in the shed that was all in bits and we just took it to the dump with three months ago thanks very much christchurch when you went to buy land if you did after all that time the first person you met was william DS Britain because when he bought his land they set up a library and a reference room and he was in charge of it he gave up his house by the way if anybody remembers seeing the very first film of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doorway the opening scene walks out the door way that 's the house that William gage Britain lived him just give me one other note he also said at the meeting I will fill the largest ship that leaves and he did he filled us to George see more he owned the horse walk worry the stone for witches in a provincial chambers or one of those things they 're getting dropped here but the worst thing of all is the piece of paper that i bought this morning where you 're going to repair what 's the name of the house was the newspaper categorizing rising home you can reap using him well bully for you lot built in eighteen fifty to lincoln wells no 1870 or something like that mine is built in 1862 and I can prove that because it 's in the flaming little sometimes just in case you doubt my word and no I wouldn 't for a moment but I 'm just I 'm just a wee bit tentatively insurance i 'm saying that i need to do i hear that well it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been to Englefield in England I 've been to the cricket ground he played on earth it 's really delightful there 's only one little tub and a cricket ground no shops there 's a church also he was a Brewers son I hope via records of the family let 's say oh they had to give up brewing the father had to give up brewing cuz it was seemly for the Methodists to be involved with a lot of bull dinesh he didn 't give it up he shifted to Plymouth where the boy went to school became the head boy and on the corner with us a garden thanks to me from here we 're going to build flats there and I wouldn 't allow it I said you 've got to build a garden sir george grey came until the first farm that was the first cottage he looked at and that was the first garden he looked at and a fully operational farm less than 18 months after they were here thanks to william geez britain just in case you forget his name ok we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end sometime soon well south near Brighton had to be gone by now so I think in fairness no no I went up at garden once no my defense is what what is it that you what you want us to make sure that you know you make sure that something of dignity remains to record the actions of this man to whom you shouldn 't be so grateful and I don 't want it left to chance and false promises I have lived here a long time and I 've had a gut full of false promises I can promise you and I don 't give him when they see it oh you 're too late mrs. Roman I said I bought it another for it I did you were going to build a gigantic motorway 30 feet of grass duty feeder road that way 30 feet of BD and grass and 30 feet of gas that way and road going that way and you were going to ball down all the borders houses including mine and the one next door on the south side to do it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and do it all I had a traffic officer had to come down from Wellington you saved half a minute in time for the roadway but I can 't get to race a thousand dollars in a day by opening your house at a dollar in it okay and I 'm just thinking Francis do you want to sort of just wrap this up with exactly what you 'd like us to have to do I want inglefield saved if you can save that rising home when it 's been boot done you can get your act together and save englefield aaj ok I 'm quite sure ok if the will was their money I think you made your point quite well and more money for here at or money for heritage rather sad ok so i 'll have the books back when you finish please do you wanna skip throughout this go back to when they 're available Jabbar weird that i have to pay jeff and i had to pay for those tried to play the head and published ok p.o box you should go and buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop ray ok they haven 't got them she 's been testicle okay thank you thank you big thanks thanks very much thank you thank you very much to date Francis 's and when I you speaking an issue feel strongly but no no no we got there yeah right the book is called Christian comedy illnesses quickly and colonists okay thank you so much oh thank you very much and it 's something coming to you can do on this and he was called small D and Italian it there isn 't a huge paper by the way believe will you read you might as well eat or what you think II okay Thank You Francis this comes up in the heck very make community year old reports today okay okay Connie from go cycles morning welcome you kind of know the rules now yeah I 'm still very nervous that 's right we 're not purify it all we were quite nervous before to other night surprise I 'm Connie kristensen I 'm the initiator of go cycle christchurch helping more adults to cycle for transport and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no money involved apart from the money I 'm putting into it which is not that much it won 't I don 't get so much money mostly my time and I have recruited about 20 volunteers so far we 're also keen cyclists and we 're not talking sports cycling here we 're talking every day hiking the thing is that in Christchurch has in the council and I think this is brilliant you set up a brilliant cycle safe scheme for kids to learn to cycle and and I think that 's fantastic but there is nothing to help adults who don 't have the confidence to cycle for whatever reason I know that there are major cycle ways coming out and that 's brilliant and we have new reduced speeds and stuff and it 's all really good and helping a lot but there 's still a lot of adults who have the perception of danger and they 're scared of cycling on the roads and that 's where I was involved in fox on bikes for a couple of years after the earthquakes and the god @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were really struggling to cycle on their own made to be part of it is that people sit in their cars and go written road is really scary I can 't cycle and that 's where we come in we help people one on one for example is here where if someone specifically wants to cycle from A to B and it can be from their home to work to school to the shops or if they just want to cycle around in a certain area and we will try and find someone who lives in that area so local knowledge is good when you 're trying to find cycle routes and as I say with a with a cycling infrastructure that 's going in it 's going to be easier and easier but there are still lots of nice back streets and parks that you can go through that people just don 't think about so that 's what we 're doing and we will cut come out and cycle it with that person to get them off to Goods confidence that we also do short rides for new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far and it 's sort of been the quiet season over autumn in winter and so we 're hoping that it 's it 's going to have a bigger take up over spring and summer this short rides are slow and it 's more experienced riders I welcome to come along as well but it 's all set out for the new cyclists and we will only take so many of new cyclists and so this is what we are offering those two things that the so I 've spend a lot of time going around hanging up posters that I printed at home speaking with people coming here presenting it trying to network a lot in and it 's become clear to me that it 's very easy to get hold of those people already cycle I can preach till the end of the time for people who already cycling they 're not really my target market the people we 're trying to get hold of are those who apparently the fifty percent of population who are interested for worried the they 're worried and not very confident for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look at what what we have to offer in links on the facebook page that are set up in a way they go they think oh I know a colleague or something and they go and do their own thing the rest will contact us and we 'll try and help them along and hopefully they will then move on either to join Fox on bikes a little start cycling to work the idea here is that this is a benefit it 's part of the solution I see for the transport problems part of the solution also maybe to green prescriptions people who have in cycles a long time we 've had people come out either on one-on-ones or inside too short rides the age group they vary from 22 over 70 people who are retired now are looking at doing militia militia riding but they don 't go on the hills of obvious reasons they want to cycle around in their neighborhoods and they can only be good for neighborhood so I think that we have more people cycling around in the neighborhoods as well as cycling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're looking at here it 's really just trying to be part of this a little bigger solution and what I 'm getting to hear don 't know how much time I have spent their entire minutes sorry is that where you guys can help us is trying to get in touch with those thousands of people who are potentially the interested people one of the things that I 've been thinking about that you could help us directly is in the rates are being sent out you send Flyers out and I 'm not suggesting that you send these ones out but you send fly us out about all manner of good stuff that is going on you could do your own with a psycho flyer it 's not only about to go cycle christchurch but there 's a lot of different ways in promoting your your own website for Queens transport for christchurch for example and the good stuff that is on the effort reminding people that there is is that that would be one one way that you could help us a lot because we have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other people we 're trying to help and we only just scratching the surface so though and you encourage employers as well oh can I say honey can I say thank you so much for talking with us in your presentation today because it 's actually a really important point in terms of how we coordinate it at rate the training and people learning to feel confident to to be honest cycleways which we 're building and there 's also another you mentioned number of programs on the agenda today is it referenced or bikes and schools program so it needs to be cured native together yeah we will do it the point is what it 's very good having all these kids who are itching to go out cycling but you 're not going to get them cycling because their parents will not allow them and that 's part of this perception of danger and the parents can 't see themselves cycling they won 't let their kids cycle depot the training program six bubbles can I just clarify fell at the when Gil Penalosa spoke he talked about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central city was something for a couple of hours on a Sunday morning to encourage cycling and it was something that we were quite keen that we explored I 'm just wondering if Connie 's information and that information could go to Eddie and we could go to infrastructure committee and we could ever talk about what 's possible to actually promote and divisive cycles in a very safe way so that people don 't have to compete with I 'm sure he has be good if you do that Connie does it comes to the infrastructure transparent committee have some even informal discussion and as Vicki as it used to be great if in fact not just way into the cycleways open but if we could have a big event by closing some streets and well after the killing Loesser event we were looking at the possibility of doing something monthly at non c 'è the first Sunday of each month yeah maybe closing some streets or so people just have a celebration on backs as it were and that 's the kind of thing I mean we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it 's a whole lot of other yes for those who are new to and we do try and link in with icicles for example some of you might have no know about them in the city east cycles who are also doing social work and giving away a second hand bikes to the community that we link in and do a short ride when they have workshops but it is really really difficult to get people to come out and and it needs reinforcing in a bigger way so how about we undertake that it the infrastructure committee we actually have a talk about how we can promote yeah cycling will put their own new gym very safe ways you okay and do that an informal way to thank you connie very much and a to put your amazing yeah thank you for all you think that you 're doing ok that concludes the vox pops a wee bit late ok one more sorry oh sorry so okay I 'm sorry you 're not from the baton Club are you a good time you 're not from Fatah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're not part of box pops but you are next because you 're proud of deputations by appointment your subject is on the agenda so no stay there stay there and come come on move do you sir sorry it does conclude the box pops yeah okay interestingly and Robin ward thank you yep welcome from the crash shoot patong club and this relates to item team on eating it come thank you it 's relating to the lease of the former United bowling club rooms and the greens and head apart thank you and the project pétanque club hopes to obtain a lease so we can move from our existing site to the new site so I start off by saying this is a momentous occasion and for crisis and we hope that today your agreement to ground lease will bring to an end 21 years of striving to obtain security of tenure and access to our own club rooms the project petanque club was formed in 1994 and prior to the earthquakes we were the largest petanque club and New Zealand with over 120 members and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competitive player numbers have increased but our social club numbers have decreased due to the lack of facilities so we have a change of membership dynamics we have three members currently in the New Zealand means open team and several of our players are ranked in the top six of the competitive plane categories including open open woman senior men and senior woman petanque New Zealand has recognized proven organizational abilities and a scheduled Christchurch to host the new zealand national doubles in november 2016 and the International Oceania 6 mason tournament in November 2017 we moved to our existing site beside Victoria lake in 1995 suggestion of the city council staff and you 're seeing my facilities with the North hackney Bowls but when they suddenly relinquished the lease we made our first least application we have been actively seeking a formal least since 1996 we have complete the submission to the Hagley Park management plan and have been advised that we are entitled to a lease in hagley park however negotiations stalled while a decision was made on their then existing pavilion and after the earthquake damage any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was demolished when we reached out of the our lease negotiations were advised the council 's preference was for our club to relocate to the proposed sports hub sends it on the area formerly leash to United bolts we believe that relocating our club to this existing spot sports area is the best interest for hagley park it allows for a full utilization of the for me like a bowl of greens and pavilion and releases the area beside Victoria late for the bend of the wider public we understand the council plan is to eventually remove all hedges and fencing from the site to open up the area between the current botanic gardens car park and the Victor and Victoria life and re-landscape the entire area the pavilion has already been demolished and a storage shed building removal is found this means there are two less buildings and Park and a lakeside recreation area can be developed the landscape plan which you have which has been prepared in 2002 shows the area that can be redeveloped for this purpose of course it 's put on Club is treasure the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have maintained this area to Botanic Garden standard at her own expense project response is working closely with high school old boys rugby club and United crow T to establish a charitable trust to administer the area formerly least the United Bowls as a sports and recreation hub and all will share the existing facilities a draft trust deed has been prepared and is being considered by the respective clubs when the deed has been registered a copy will be made available to the council we request that the council favorably consider their application to grant at least the proposed north haven t community Sport and Recreation trust for the area previously leashed to United Bowling Club subject to the formal registration of the trust thank you very much are there any questions this comes up in there ginger slightly later any questions so can I just ask you what was the club that I 'm safe going hidden for that very building so is the building the building to be available to other organizations were besides the tank time yes see the building is there already it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we would fear the system that 's why we went on the basis of a charitable trust trust would administer the building and the idea is that other sports such as some touch there 's a group of players that play kickball which is a bit like volleyball only to kick it and perhaps even the Kremlin bridge club were interested in perhaps using the facilities so we would have envisage it being available for a large number of sporting groups so in that they could use other than the terms of your lease yes the the the draft lease which has been prepared provides for that and it 's been was prepared by the city council stuff thank you can I just clarify it you 've seen what 's on the agenda today yes are you in support of what 's there do you support the recommendation that 's there yes right great thank you so much to date that 's right no from mental blank it was a hard question yeah thank you very much thank you okay thanks and guys it 's two-thirty and i 'm aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you like to go through to quarter to eleven and then have a coffee i 'm just a way that they 're britain loaf life is what you do yeah corey between 10 and 11 are your five minute break easily run over these okay and so we will now thank you for your deputations thank you everyone,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

okay you don 't need to read this when we hit an open date we asked our local community to come in and give us ideas about what they 'd like to see in the space there was a heap of ideas there 's a lot of energy there 's a lot of excitement and South right and we need a place to do this stuff okay and the reason it could be so multi users this is just a plan of the place there 's a cafe will have meeting rooms there and there 's there 's just so many different spaces in the building we can run things during the day and then we can have while the cafes open community activities going on we can have health and well-being things going on at the back of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen in the cafe at night for pop-up restaurants for performances for things that will bring money into the facility we 've been trialing some of us already okay this is what 's really important we have a three-phase funding process we 've been doing a lot of work on this and the reason we 're here today is this one phase one okay we want to buy this building as us for three hundred twenty-five thousand dollars we think it 's an incredible investment in our community and we think that City Council may well have the capacity to do that for us ok we have a seismic strengthening an earthquake repair phase which is going to bring the building up to one hundred percent of code hey I 've let 400,000 we 've really got 240 of there in terms of pro bono the smartness donations and with were that 's close to having a roof a new roof donated in and laid free of charge ok and doing the full building fit-out service of making it fit for purpose we have it its people interesting with router @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the different places we looking at for some of this funding you 've got that information with you ok intended that out to you because we 've done a huge amount of work and this is a short amount of time we need to be a bikini here okay I 'm talking really fast but I hefty yes finish our chess this is the last thing i do want to let you know we 've got leaders of support for this project from the local school from the local am safe code from local kindergarten preschool The Residents Association from this Community Board from elected members from the land from proto volumes from all sorts of community groups people love this idea okay and just a couple of quotes we 're doing a survey at the moment for community consultation and we seed two people in the survey we 're going to go to talk to the council we 're going to talk to funders do you have anything that we 'd like to think your bike has to say okay oh no don 't tell us what they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a really amazing precedent for everybody else you can see behind you but what I 'm going to suggest is I think probably there 's a lot of support around the table just by the body language of the people watching you so what I 'm going to seduce is that a Gary you 're obviously and involved with this group can you just bring a report to Andrews committee yep because obviously there 's some financial implications here that are not on budget and the CEO is not here either can we include the chem pool endowment fund a as an option yes yes of course of course you should yes okay yeah I think I think you 've done a superb presentation I 'm really sorry that I 've got to limit it because the energy is just contagious like I said 2200 this yeah no no even behind me completely got there and so what I 'm going to suggest is that Gary brings a report to Andrews committee you 're very welcome to come along to that committee as well is that okay when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's teaching us at the edge yeah no I move toward the fun in turn to get that information together I would rather this person the next check meetings the fourth of august i don 't know whether you could get it there that quickly if we could have even the beginnings of conversation about it that would be good because obviously there 's it looks as though the support for what 's been presented there are some questions we 've been presented with um we begin to look at how we can answer those so even if it was just a relatively short report that was able to come to the fourth of August meeting it would be good to start progressing some conversations well there 's something for you for the fourth of others fantastic Kendra man okay thank you so much guys yeah that 's the key yeah very impressive thank you um okay genet the informant no welcome hello Paul Oh Janet good morning everyone I 'm tenet being I 'm a bus user and with me is form acknowledge who is the chief executive of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back our inner city bus shuttle service a free bus service of electric shuttle buses that run at least every 10 minutes in both directions a service that has as its very hard the bus users that 's the bus drivers and the passengers together relationship my big dream is of two figure eight circuits covering the areas within the four avenues but I know that 's too large an area for now however poor MIT know is our best advocate and most practical manager to give you a good picture of what we can make happen soon remember that the red bus and the Christchurch City Council together ran the popular city but shuttle buses before the earthquakes Paul would you please give us your professional view last week Judaism I am so this is very much conceptual proposal feel like I 'm really too I think it 's appropriate time to start thinking about the current last mile connection between the bus interchange and the car central city as its recovered so so I haven 't got a presentation but what you have in front of you is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sort of just thinking about where the city isn 't named the target organ see it seems to me to be shifting workers between the central city around the central city visitors the tourists secondary retail a lower priority currently but that 'll that we think grow over time and it 's also better hospitality work as well potentially so I 've got a bit of a map of what a service might look like that could be implemented quite quickly it covers the areas like like the west end area victoria street margaret Mahy playground and new Regent Street connecting that through to the bus interchange so effective at last last miles friends for ever so it 's very conceptual and and in terms of what a bus service might look like a one bus service gives you about a 30 minute cycle with two bus service gives a 15 minute cycle and from a practical perspective I think it sort of kind of rotate though so you 've got and going in both directions in terms of magnitude people have reasonable worse but travel times in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommending something like a smaller accessible bus that like them at Mercedes buses that have just going into service now as a kind of starting position yeah clearly there 's quite a bit more work needs to be done on the route in the end the demand but if that conceptual drawing route were and put in place there are additional bus stops required to service those areas and that 's a commitment you could have it will be relatively simple to connect real-time information to the system as well as also so I think kind of from here it 's if council thinks the concepts worth pursuing it seems to me there 's now a joint public transfer working committee and that 's the appropriate place for it to land that so it 's better work around just put these muscles around this and then then put in their proposal for and have you 'd answer any question to my hair excellent are there any questions given that you 've got one minute 45 yeah um couple things with regards to the circuit if we had a tube us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so there 'll be different streets so there would be a join up like a figure eight abstract figure eight so if you wanted to go somewhere you could ditch these spot buses conceivably you could do that and it 's really a case of you know where whether this is the right mix that we have now and part of that is constrained by that one way street system to some extent and the second question is I presumably vital the main airport bus stop which is on i believe manchester story wherever it is in Central City I would be does it have to be a cinch for this to go past it so those guests in our city could get off and hop on a bus and get it 's good service to one of the hotels that 's right see is that the bus current base exchange being a central point so that would be a pickup and dropoff pulling on the way on whichever direction you traveling through so if you 're in that area you can then progress on from my okay so i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it coming say to the joint public transport committee which you said suggesting so I 'm assuming that part of the Russian are the things that the committee will need to look at and you can tell me what sort of things but would partly be at least though that this new route in the inner city would be aligned with the other routes that decided why you can clear your new Tucker 's into account so I think you were duplicating activity absolutely is yeah do thank you that 's really particularly filling in those spaces where there 's no current service particularly we 've seen for example this there 's no it 's a long walk in on a weekday it 's not going to be coming at people carrying goods I Stevens Tracy be digging okay you 've started so even there was some feedback that I received last week that there is a disconnect at the moment between you Regent Street Isaac theory all that kind of area where the ibises as well and the restart and victoria street as far as tourists not knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is just on the outside of it do you see that there could be some sort of synergy if you like with this providing a service where tourists could be shuttled those short distances or do you see that as a separate i had certainly intended to cover that I think the tourist minutes for a seasonal activity and it 's growing so that 's we got to become more over time it seems to me just thinking and looking at the city it 's the transport of people under work position that 's probably the critical thing could it be accommodated though you thought well it 's certainly intended here it 's going past new Regent Street right and it 's certainly not far from okay thank you know I 'll let you guy because it 's you or juice just to really a colleague it 's really like a normal tip for the central city connecting all the city will sieze really that 's what it is trying to do that yes in a reasonable way which is constraining it so you 've got a good site cycle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you for coming along but I 'm going to seduce do you want to scout at eddie before it goes anywhere near that II can group well since it 's an air in a city that 's very appropriate goes to Etienne done and what I 'm alluding to toe and Paul has confirmed that they 're clearly for it to be aligned to be another step after the infrastructure transport environment Lisa but I 'm happy for it to take that sort of process so how would you like to invite for a minute to the next as we can very welcome to come to hear again it 's meeting with those seek a deputation for hips yep yeah you could say to make a deputation as well or just come and have a chat hmm so you 've got what longer I think I think even talking further discussion infamy at the stage will be really helpful to you okay hey this is very conceptual and you know I don 't wait to think about it so if it 's not perfect I 'm enjoys that but no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using the little residual buses it will be so cool okay okay thank you very much indeed and I 've got inner but it 's actually dude and Justin for the green prescription welcome hi I 'm Jean wozny and I 'm a consumer of green prescription and I 'm hoping that you 're giving me might hit your help and this is justin he roots a green prescription okay I became very sick and my doctor put me and head to give up smoking after 50 years is that killed me then and anyway I put on a lot of weight I swap food for my cigarette and so my doctor put me into a green prescription and and it 's run by Sports Canterbury and anyway I learned a lot the council talk about obesity in what can we do put in the cycle lane you know we have footpaths you know improve them but not everybody can walk not everybody can cycle because of hips the knees the league 's you know people have been using these quakes and the lives have changed and so they need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because i saw one know and and so as I actually feel it 's no good talking about it I went to green prescription aim damn it was wonderful I 've lost 10kg and yeah it 's so good and it also has helped helps with depression anxiety you only get to go to this little course once so I 've become a volunteer so I can go all the time yeah so but the unfortunate part about this as bit and to do some of the things this cost in not everybody has retired and his gold card not everybody actually has a community services CAD okay so what can you do well I 'll tell you you 've got the facilities that we need you heads the swimming pools they are weightless people when I down there it doesn 't matter about the hips it doesn 't matter about how big they are I still weightless and we also i go and there 's a cost I go to deal where I can do my own Ecuador gang because council have these boards that you can do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want you to reduce that down to three dollars but I want it that I will help you out yeah it will be certain days certain times like say monday to thursday and nine to 11 and then 132 three in so those times um I want to see and absolutely and the Oh what is it like that three dot when I say this it 's like you can go then there 's one person in the pool right you 've got star zia what they doing maximizing their nothing so it 's good to have 20 in there than one is not you pier 60 bucks from there you get 580 from that lot all right does it make sense mr. finance yeah so I 'm hoping that this council is going to show that you can care about us and that you 're willing to do this and you 're willing to put people first and when you talk about what are we going to do about obesity you 've got the answer you can help everybody you 've got cycle lanes you got footpaths and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Army na and the conditions would be green prescription would do cards if you don 't have your cards lifted the time when Z to bed you pay full price you must have a green prescription card okay the it 's called no prescription card no discount and as the wat as an eight well we want it and we need it it 's as simple as there ok it seemed pretty fit well they were too scared to us no no just go ahead she 's not yes yeah yeah great I 'm thinking thank you for your reputation I know we 've actually asked for a report through the annual plan to get a report back on fees and charges so it 's really timely that you 've made that submission or deputation I just wanted to check in terms of the green prescription who can access that because you sit in to start with you only have a limited time so I 'll just interested if it was only for a limited time then someone has to get the card there or whether there 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access no no no that of course we have you can go and do all things we have body systems people and we 've just had a force and we 've just hit this course and woman we couldn 't even get out the door um now she 's into April joking and cheese all over the place you know and we have a buddy system from the ones on the course and they 're doing be returned and they 're all joining together so the prescription goes on but there 's only an eight week course and then we hope to match everyone out of what they 're doing bring them up hey you wanna go walking today when I go badminton tonight whatever so as long as people are actors they could have your social anyone can access it it 's basically where a free support service to help people work on unhealthy lifestyles that generally comes to the Jeep beaver yeah open to anyone thank you yeah hey you can catch oh yes yeah all right yeah yeah okay thank you that five minutes sup could I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is this report coming is that we ask or the report to include the impact of reducing fees for those people with a green prescription yeah said okay yeah that 's awesome thank you that 's five again for that report close that because you mentioned about when the arm when the numbers and the poles are down so it 's a win-win for everybody yes so could we get that from our staff with regards to what language did it okay yeah she have its fine frame color for that report oh it would be good because I don 't want to wait for even a bit okay we don 't hit the moment but will get but I put on way okay so and so I 'm just assuming with past it yeah okay okay thank you very much indeed last day drink mix meet you","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

of QE2 Park,JTQ0SnyYPdo,20160623,2782.48,"Christchurch, New Zealand",7736,mmm hi some number 41 hearing panel report to the council on the proposed and so fiction of qe2 cut and I supported to the proposed sale of proportion of duty to catch the ministry of education we might as well just deal with the two of them together for us so if I could invite staff to come to the table yeah and so on what 's the programs here that we just accept the hearings panel first and then deal with odd yeah yeah we well we we can do so the actual no because that 's that they 're both the very very emotional so they 're both the same so um I think we 'll just deal with them both Tony asleep yes simultaneously so questions and comments ranging over both of them now Jana you cheered this hearings panel do you want to give us a report yeah sure just um just been introduced the item a bit a bit like the previous one around jelly park there was a different view so it wasn 't a unanimous panel panel decision and so by majority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to go through i guess just some key key issues um one was the medical center which is a pretty straightforward issue there was a medical center that had a lease over some capsule land to provide car parking and it was pretty overwhelming from the cementum 450 with us to retain retain their for that purpose so that was pretty much had full agreement and it really wasn 't important I think to the ministry whether or not that land transfers over so that was a really simple 11 probably the more the more contentious issue was around the there were two real contentious issues I think one was around the process and aid of sea of information to for people to be able to make submissions and know what was being proposed and the second one was really around the trees which which and the general significance of a site the work comments made that you know this was really seen as the Hagley Park of the east and and that when council ridging acquired the land it was for recreation purposes and it was really important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so yeah those are really the main issues I think overwhelmingly people supported the idea of the school locating through this qe2 site and that 's certainly my my personal opinion has been that actually that 's that 's good to have the schools you know happy for them to locate on the site the issue for us as a hearings tunnels we could only make a decision on the area that we 'd gone up for public consultation in terms of selling off the land as reserve and we had no ability to look at any other location on the entire qe2 site that we mail or people who made submissions may have thought it was more appropriate so all we could do was decide on the site that we 've been up for consultation on we could shrink that and we could amend that to take less land for sale but we couldn 't extend it or move it into areas that we hadn 't indicated to the community that were up for some discussion and you know really with them that I guess one of the concerns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submissions and support of their written submissions was a real desire to see in oh and overall plan for the qe2 site so I just conclude with with three points really one was that personally I actually think that when you do a site visit as we did as a panel and you see the different aspects of the entire site including the mature trees the vegetation and it 's really hard to kind of understand how everything 's going to fit together so I personally had a lot of sympathy for the idea that we do do an overall development plan for the site so that people can see really clearly what 's proposed and I reflect on that from the jelly part report that we 've just had wasn 't it great to have that level of data on the jelly park plan where you could actually see clearly what 's being proposed what the changes were etc and I don 't feel personally that we had as much detail as we should have in terms of people understanding what was happening there and so the second thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the protected trees and encumbrance on the trees so it 's my view that the hearings panel came to the conclusion that it was better not not too with move that land for sale but actually to put an encumbrance on the trees in terms of getting a protection and we had quite a divide around the number of trees which i guess is one of the key issues that council will need to consider today and finally just a um make the final point that you know thank this one of the submitters was from a former councillor former deputy mayor who said um you know and I had a lot of sympathy for this comment um I personally support the two schools being established at qe2 but believe that many of the historical aspects of the park should be preserved the park is much loved by many people and holds a lot of history for the people of Christchurch we just need a bit of good planning and that really resonated with me so um that 's really the report you know I 'll put that forward in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the earrings panel but but you know more pro forma rather than in support and you know I 'd certainly welcome other councillors views on the issue around the overall plan the issue of the trees and I guess I guess the final issue which you know i think is really important is that if the money does come in from the sale of this land that then that goes back to implementing an overall plan for for what is a really significant area oh thank you and I guess the question that I 've got is that if we put an encumbrance on all of the trees listed there as an item 's a and B presumably that would mean that the Ministry of Education could walk away from the deal it 's great so which trees if we actually just highlighted the trees that were which we 're acceptable for an encumbrance to go on them what numbers would they be reported if I could just clarify their the trees that are numbered and to a the trees that surround a historical part of qe2 right at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about fun so they are all agreed and with the ministry are comfortable with those trees having an encumbrance on them on the man we we learned it not selling that parcel of land at the Ministry happy they quite liked to have that for the land in their footprint and a totally at agreements with an encumbrance on the trees listed him hey sorry I should have treated nicer than be a line of oak trees that were planted not long after qe2 was established they were planted by the north New Brighton residents association and I think you 'll find that tree is numbered 1 19 20 and 21 yep an all probability can stay regardless of what the ministry 's configuration with playing fields that can 't pull the pan out to be it 's the remaining trees from one month seven eight starts 13 to 18 and next 29 for 228 sapna hinder the trees and question question some of them are it 's a small and there 's some larger specimens in there so if you look at that map now there you can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rough footprint of the school 's buildings just on that lip so on the left and upper corner there you 'll see a group of trees that branch out into the middle of the the ground there and then there 's another cluster we get further away so they are the dreams that potentially are in an area that the ministry would like to designate as playing fields don 't think that scene is quite unquote deal-breakers sincerely no no deal breaker but not the ones in bigger I think I think we just need to get the process very clear yeah but overall thoughts are yeah what I wanted to know it was was because if we pass the recommendations as they stand then we won 't have a deal with the ministry so I 'm trying to understand what trees get us across the line and which ones don 't so just be very specific around that the ministry have expressed a preference around the remove of the trees to the north around that they haven 't said specifically it 's a deal-breaker the ministry do have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to right and I think union would that be so if we put an encumbrance on the trees they could remove it by way of compulsory acquisition I believe so but that would then slow the process down because they 'd have to go through a whole compulsory acquisition for the whole site correct right okay so have they expressed a view about trees 119 120 and 121 not specifically no so but they 're saying that that that they 're willing to work with us on as many trees as they possibly can the the ministry have the main reason the Ministry of expressed a preference to remove the trip to the north is essentially to enable the sports fields to go ahead in that area out any I guess constraints on their design for this school if the council wish to remove or keep sorry the trees 119 120 121 I think it is then it would be a matter of just how the school with InDesign they 're playing fields around net if the other trees were removed I think there 's a very strong desire from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 I think it is and then in the North theater definitely be removed that would have been enabled him to have at least one playing field and there are other options it could be considered all right so um yannis moved at pro forma do I have a seconder and David so are there any questions of staff yeah bread so the piece about the actually hold on a bit of make sure I 'm on the right are we talking about the sale here as well well we 're talking up yes oh ok yeah so is there a possibility for a regeneration plan for the whole site to wrap up the master plan and the the school construction at the same time so if I could speak to that so late last year the boob pics is community board through a resolution through the community board asked for staff to start working on an overall master plan or site study to occur it 's been very extremely difficult to the position at the moment whereby we have obviously a parcel land that the ministry wish to acquire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be as they have to go through a PPP process to design that piece we have obviously been working closely with a nursery around opportunities to work with them which is why the fertile area in the middle of the air is the shared community sort of hobby area that we 're trying to create but I appreciate that it 's been half the community to see that overall picture because of the information has been confidential to stage with the ministry and we haven 't been able to share that information look from staff perspective I think staff very open to the the need for an overall master plan for qe2 for the rest of the park in which fully support their cause you 've got three bitsy but the schools you 've got the keys and sports and rec and then you bought another piece of land left over why not do the whole thing in one plan look I 'm just saying forget him to start consultation all over again really would you because the regeneration plans come with a consultation process this has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Eastern sport and really the school 's relocation has been consulted and so here 's now the that the sale oh boy you have to do that with the master plan whatever that 's going to be no no manners master paintings you 'd still put through quite a complex theorem think University where expert on convicts doesn 't have to wait for the schools to be built no but I 'm so get here the mazda mpv are underway we 're getting particular figure 3 different richlands planning can either so just wondering could I just clarify the point that was made the advice that the hearings fennel head was that through the notice of requirement of the minister does that is a public process as I understand it that will we you know people will be a possibly able to make submissions around terms like design I mean we don 't want to go down there tree buddy the northern accent yep oh that 's a process that they have to go through as I understand it just thinking of your carving this on scenes of land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're all going to be dealt with separately yeah the problem is is that the process began a long time before the regenerate christchurch legislation went through and yes this would have been ideal for a regeneration thing at the get-go but to stop it now and put it back i think the community would just go nuts so it can can you take some of the consultation and kind of put it into no no no no no regenerate I know I think everyone 's everyone 's reasonably comfortable with where we 've got to that the community are just desperate to get this facility up and running they 're desperately happy about having the two schools located there it 's a 1 111111 I 'm not making myself clear hello can I just show you are the problem isn 't concussion if she was a regeneration planning process available two years ago then the answer would have been used just a point of process I 've just pray for my second to the motion I wanted to a mean there 's something should I have signal no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make an amendment yeah i 've already got too busy packing done oh I 've just to thee that we put an encumbrance on trees 119 120 and 121 like and sick it if you wish but sorry a little he was Leslie clear we give second to that oh no well it 's asking me whether he can move an amendment if he sickens us and I said no you can 't and he is now withdrawn his seconding of the motion and dreams so gleaners pro forma if you 'd like seconding the motion which means that he wants to keep the encumbrances on all the trees so we 'll take it from there so move and you want to move in a medium and which is to visited is restricted to a tree 119 120 and 122 do we have a seconder for that amendment seems logical now just go to the big picture of this it seems to me that we want to get on build the aquatic center we want the Ministry of Education to build the schools there there is the only area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are a deal breaker with the Ministry of Education or not we 've got some agreement on some trees and some disagreement on some trees wouldn 't it be sensible to agree to this today that have a different clause that talks about working what 's the Ministry of Education to retain as many trees as possible so that means you need to if you actually did a lute ly or do you delete be all together so I would second that if you want to move that as i 'm all moved in that we delete they all to you yeah but i want us to strengthen see ya so there instead of retention of as many of the balance of established trees on the site has a reasonably possible say with no education we work closely with the Ministry of Education to ensure that the trees numbered 11 9 through 12 right whatever it you know via the lustin be one 's own work with the Ministry to ensure that as many of these trees are able to be retained and then the retention of many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that you 've got a clear steer from us that these are the trees we want you to work with the ministry to save and I mean they could be asked to use the balance of the part that isn 't being transferred for them for a playing field I 'm and we could be reasonable about entering into sort of almost like you protect our trees and we 'll let you use some of our land and then in the neighboring area you know I mean let 's just work with them on a collaborative basis to see if we can get a good result but I don 't I don 't want to hold this up I think it 's really important for this area that this goes I 'm sorry to be picky but haven 't we got agreement on 119 120 and 121 well haven 't the ministry agreed today the ministry haven 't expressed a preference around that they 've expressed a preference that they the whole of those trees be remember okay sorry sir I soap okay yeah yeah injury we 're still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming back Simon to a point that you made a few moments ago because you know what we 're really talking about here is the degree of certainty or degree of protection that we want to see over the trees in that northern section you 'd identified that if Clause be worried facing to being with it so if clause b were retained in the same formats in in the committee recommendation that wouldn 't necessarily be a deal-breaker and then you made the comment that if the deal weren 't able to proceed for that reason then the ministry could go down a compulsory purchase track and that would involve compulsory purchase of the whole site so it would it would involve a compulsory purchase mechanism for the whole site is this land that we 're talking about all in one title no it 's not in one title at the stage so could the agreement I mean depending how the titles are broken up and I haven 't looked at the maps in enough detail to see we 've got over whether we 've got a map of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land that was subject to the encumbrance on the trees that was the subject of a compulsory purchase and the rest of it the rest of the titles could go ahead depending of how the titles sit over the the land that we 're talking about it sounds as though we 're making an assumption deal that the whole thing would be subject to compulsory purchase when in fact it may not that is correct they could look at the titles and determine whether the title is actually encompass those trees or not I don 't actually believe they do currently and there 's just the office of my head i think the the key thing for the ministry is to ensure that they are able to purchase the entire site and ensure that they 're able to build the two schools here ultimately fundamentally that 's what they wish to do if there are constraints on the site then they will need to then following obviously council 's decision look at how they either am into their design or until they look at other options they may wish to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delays potentially yes yep all right thank you questions yet yeah so what 's the time frame do you think for the notice of environment process I think off top my head I if I remember rightly it 's approximately a 3-2 almond process I think I think Leo Mia I believe it 's a three or four month process just for the notice requirement they thus the schools sorry the Minister of Education wish to go up for a request for proposal for a PPP to start the design process and within the next couple of weeks and then just it the other question for me is just in terms of the overall site do we don 't have a figure on how many trees but within the ministry site there 's a number of trees that were identified by the artist has been worthy of retention the orange ones so not the memorial ones do you know how many props me out I have an issue counted them up I guess the the key message we 've been given very clearly from the ministry as they end both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on site as possible and where there 's ability to relocate trees either within the area or opportunity within the rest of the park the ministry would be very much interested in doing it end planting planting of new trees that would we want to see that as well if that 's what the council quiet absolutely hmmmm don 't need to for their own shape of mercy so do you think that we want to add that to the resolution as well just to sort of say that moving of trees and planting of new trees to replace those that have that can 't be retained so I mean we just we don 't want to make it impossible for them but we want to make clear that the trees are actually an important part of the environment of their path yeah I think it 's fair to say that the ministry themselves knowledge that they need to retain that they want to retain as many trees as possible they won 't show for the students at the school so don 't think there 's any disagreement from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of as meaning of the balance the established trees on the side as is reasonably possible and then just add to that and planting planting of new trees in the case of any removal system yeah or just to replace into mud with new trees here right okay so um so we 'll deal with well we 'll deal with the debate over the two so the amendment is that we replace to be what the two B and C I don 't think anyone object to planting new trees going in the main resolution but they go home yes so so we 'll deal with all of them at once oh but the amendments been moved and seconded the motion has been moved and seconded so I 'll open it up for debate looking I think getting these schools on this site along toward the eastern recreation center is absolutely key to the development of the Syria I think it will be an amazing regeneration thing without that has the opera regeneration me and and I I what I want to do is get on and do it personally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and and I lived right alongside qe2 for a very long period of time so I totally understand how important the trees are there but the difficulty is we 're sitting here and the ministry is sitting here and the way in which we will sorted out is by talking with each other about which ones can be saved and which ones need to be replaced with 14 other ones and because right alongside where they want to put their sports fields are 8 public sports fields a whole lot of other public sports fields that create some possibilities for the ministry so there are penalties above and beyond what is shown on the plan and I think we can come to a good outcome and if we sit around the table and talk it through but a don 't think we 're going to do it by way of our resolution stopping the whole thing happening and making it really difficult everybody wants this to happen and we want it to happen fast so I think the solution that you 've arrived at is but yeah David now look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eastern suburbs and it 's something it 's something long in the sea for quite some time for me it 's probably the first tangible outcome in terms of bricks and mortar alongside the eastern sport and recreation facility for that side of the east and for me it 's also a significant decision for the eastern suburbs both from an educational point of view and for economic recovery and for me there 's also quite a poignant sort of a personal one little story here as well and that this year in fact a couple of weeks ago I celebrated with a number of old schoolmates the fact that we were 50 years ago we were fresh basically third formers at shirley was high in 1966 so here we are in 2016 taking the first steps to cement the establishment of sugars always high in Aden cycles at qe2 and I think for me that absolutely magnificent that it was 50 years ago that I started high school we 've heard today that there were just a few stumbling blocks and I 'm very pleased that the Medical Center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on on the medical center there was a distinct fear of that the Ministry of Education took control of that parcel of land that eventually they would dispense with the car park so that for me was an easy one to overcome and the ministry were very keen to to agree with us that that 's not a parcel blend that they were ticularly worried about the second thing that hasn 't been mentioned today so far as there is a fitness track that runs right around qe2 and we we had a number of submissions that argued that they would like to see that facility retained and fortunately the ministry again has agreed that they would retain that fitness track around their border odd of the lens and in fact that it would prove a useful attribute for them and their physical education process the third aspect of the submissions that attracted quite a lot of attention was the entrance the qe2 lqe to there 's a mound there a number of trees and within those trees there are memorabilia that commemorate the establishment of the park the facility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the area so we saw this well the community saw this as being a parcel of land and trees and memorabilia that they wish to see conserved we debated in the in the hearings process about whether we would actually retain that block of land ourselves that the ministry were quite keen to have that within their footprint and have agreed entirely that an encumbrance on the trees and the memorabilia and there is most appropriate the fourth aspect was the line of trees that we 've been debating and I 'm quite comfortable with the rimac sorry the rim the amendment I should say going forward and I hope that everyone will support that so in summary I just like to say you know the there are economic benefits for the eastern suburbs that and they are huge the flow on benefits to local businesses retail confidence and real estate in the area are quite significant in fact if you look now at places that are coming up for sale in and around qe2 for several months now they 've all been advertising in school zone for surely boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feature of real estate transactions in our area now from an educational point of view this side of town has been advocating for a number of years for a high school some may prefer to coed school we have other options in the area for coed but certainly having the school in the area as a great advancement for people and that live there to be able to send their kids to high school quite close by and the fact i 've been to a number of community functions recently where parents have been quite ecstatic about the fact that they can get their kids to school fairly quickly and one lady I was talking to any last night was saying great I 've got three kids I can drop them all off in the swimming pools behind them as well so everything was good from a community point of view and lastly I think the location of the schools in qe2 in conjunction with the sport and recreation facility that we are developing immediately behind it provides a unique key location of a number of activities in the eastern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we have yet to see the final plans but there is general agreement that they will build their gymnasiums they 're performing arts center hardcourts artificial turfs and things will be at the back of the school and close proximity to the council sport and recreation facility so in effect we are creating a community hub of a whole host of activities where the school have indicated schools have indicated that their facilities would be available to the community outside of school hours so it 's going to be a fantastic facility for the eastern suburbs we also have the Christchurch school of gymnastics looking very closely at their future of their building I believe at this stage they are very keen to relocate their facilities alongside the sport and recreation facility so we will have this unique community hub I urge everyone to support both the amendment and the substantive motion today and as I said it earlier this is a milestone in the and the reestablishment of the east following the earthquakes and I think it will be one of a stiffened a huge part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Green thank you I encourage anyone with you 're an elected member or someone watching on today if you are still peps holding back on this to to catch the vision of what this can be for not only the east of christ church but also the whole city as we 've already heard people are already making decisions over their children 's education simply on the promise of this investment and the east house failures have increased down that eastern seaboard we know publicly at least twice since these decisions were flagged insurance companies are still ensuring contrary to views in some quarters there is rising and I encourage you to support this over the process that we had with the hearings panel the ratio of those who wanted this who submitted was roughly two to one and of the one that wasn 't that keen it was primarily over the inclusion of the crevice road medical centre car park and there were people who were saying both yes or no who said well as long as you do you know this so I think we 've resolved that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the fitness track I think we 've resolved that and I 'm pleased to see a path here that i actually won 't cost us with this too in the big picture and i need to credit Simon really if you don 't mind me plagiarizing this this really is part of the spine of the city so having this for the whole city if you have this here you 've been running down to the link with the Metro sports in our print away we have the homes with the bike Parker and the you know the Canterbury sort of dental and is also a playground as well so if we just capture that the big picture I think that 's what we need to hold before so I have an interest in aegina as I 've said in the LTP of kind of rewriting the balance in the city and this will go a long way towards their it really will provide a lot of increased hope and confidence to the residence if we agree with this today just be tremendous again if you 're holding back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 'll be marvelous yeah Paul look I just want to endorse my colleagues from the Northeast we know the yeast has been hit hard and this is essentially so on the southeast but I do see this is actually a regeneration project it will bring a lot of economy back into your area and dumb be really heavy supported good always wins Andrew um what resonates for me is that we 've got both ward councillors in agreement of the way that we should proceed here is the price you know when when you look at the submissions when you look at what both ward councillors are saying and I 'm assuming that both ward councillors are saying unequivocally that we support the substantive motion and we also support the the amendment to allow this to proceed so that we 're not held back in any way you know there are some things where the local benefits is so great that I think we need to give extra way to what the ward councillors are saying and I think this is one of those occasions certainly what we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local benefits of this are going to be significant in an area which has been hard hit by the earthquakes and clearly there are a number of people waiting for this decision so that we can get some positivity into this neighborhood and yeah I 'm pleased to support that for that reason and with that guidance yep not Jimmy yeah thank you I remember the mayor you have a kind of the I don 't know it 's probable if we plndr a rice a year we plan the trees ten years but if we print the the person 's of people hundred years so that 's very important actually no we we create the condo on for tomorrow created the history of especially the education is a foundation is where we were the important you know so even the piece or lenders important we all say this aces council aces how able to faster in their kids lets you know this absolutely which fully the support and also I agree the amendment is the new tree in the sea replace to be endless sea because wider this kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on yours you install there 's actually I didn 't see any master plan now yell or drop the concept plan are we working together we can make the happen so I supported so I are just quickly doodling on top of it because it is Confucius for confusion givenchy no listen to your speech give me in confuse the reason that every occasion occasionally I give a good speech is because I quote somebody who is much more quotable than I quite Jimmy Tina 's for one year yes plant Ross oh if you at manas 14 you yes plant tree jae seok if your plan is for 100 years educate children oh yeah and now don 't you think that there actually is a perfect expression of what we 're discussing here today this is an investment in the east of Christchurch and to be able to hear the school 's the two schools so you 've got they are the single sex options for the east so we 've got two single sex schools and the East colocated with the fantastic Eastern Sport and Recreation Center it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything to hold it up including me I just want to go to a few points on and since we 're in that business of quoting i 'd like to read your we um story he was shorter sh and oldish and brownish and mossy and he spoke with a voice that was sharpest and bossy mr. he said with a saw dusty sneeze i am the lorax i speak for the trees I speak for the trees but the trees have no tongues and I 'm asking you sir at the top of my lungs he was very upset as he shuddered and puffed what 's that thing you 've made out of my truffle a tuft look more excited there 's no cause for alarm I chop just one tree I 'm doing no harm so when we think about quotes and stories and sayings and chef I 'd actually like you to think of the lorex because actually it 's quite a powerful I think story and that is when you look at the map that we went out with the consultation none of these chains were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trees that were going to be removed across the entire site but when you look at that plan I asked you to think about the huge amount of mature trees not just the memorial trees that will possibly be lost as part of this process and is that really the best outcome for the city in my view the loss of such a significant amount of trees to what was described at the time that it was required acquired as being a place that the reserve would emerge is a park second only to hagley park with amenities for a number of sports that that is actually imagine that happening in hagley park and imagine the art right up cry that people would have and the challenges that you would face so I actually think it 's really important that we get this right no one as I understand it apart from a very few people are against the school going on this site so that 's really not the substance of do the school 's go on this site or not but the job of the hearings panel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our Park be sold off and that consideration I think raises a number of questions about the environment around the trees and around the immunity of that area for that wider community so I think one of the really interesting things is that we also heard submissions around getting rid of things that are perfectly functional so we 've been an existing sports field cricket oval that could be used that you know has been done it extensive costs in the past that is going to be demolished and made way for a building when we 've got other land on the site that 's sitting there with nothing planned for it and that really sums up I think the unsustainable approach that we 're taking across the city as we regenerate that we think we 've got endless amounts of money to just get rid of things that are in the way and build new things which is incredibly expensive way I think of do things and the issue of the incumbent trees and so I won 't support the amendments that swing part is for the sake of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got several sports fields adjacent that we will own as a city we are talking about getting rid of memorial trees and taking off an encumbrance just for the sake of a single sports field or two sports fields when we 've got adequate sports fields right adjacent to it it just seems to me not a very sustainable use of our resources and undermines the value of the trees in terms of our environment I can know that trees in Christchurch are a major issue we 've seen that through the district plan the number of people that feel very passionate and strongly about the trees in the city in the final point I want to make is um or two final points one is that through the design process for those of you who have seen where schools of redeveloped littleton hillview Christian look at that urban design facing into the public areas and I ask you to think about what that reflects to a community I know was some of the school redevelopments in my ward that people feel a little bit underwhelmed with what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a really important point that as we go through this process I think would be great to have an you know one of the most sustainable environmentally friendly schools in the world as a real source of why you would go to a school or several schools on the site but there 's no guarantee through the process the public-private partnership process that you will get a good urban design and a good amenity so that 's an issue I think that people should be very weary off but final point I 'll make is that you know I have experience where the council pre to say that ignored doing community consultation in a way that people felt quite agreed about and that was the pressure wastewater system and because that issue got taken to court it didn 't actually speed up the process if we just went ahead and did it because it was the right thing to do it actually slowed it down because we were challenged found that we had to go back and in this particular case the risk I think is that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down even more than doing a comprehensive regeneration plan and I commend councillor men jie for making that point because actually when you think about it we still have to go through the consenting process of this project and wouldn 't it be better to do that through a regeneration planning process that looks at the whole site then a whole bunch of ad hoc concedes for individual elements of the site that have no relationship to each other so I think it 's a bit of a muffed of thing that that somehow we 're speeding up the process by making this decision today and particularly if we remove the encumbrance from from the trees so I think we run the risk of actually slowing this project down even further and that to me absolutely would be a real tragedy if this ended up being legally challenged when we 've still got a lot of planning and consenting to be done so i actually really endorsed the idea that actually a much better approach would be to do a regeneration plan that would enable community participation would enable more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole site and would have a very cool motor approach to getting a really good regeneration of this area that would benefit the local community and also that eastern part of the city and i just erase the point of friction because as i read the amendment we want to retain the trees oh no this debate I 'm sorry it is and the everyone 's made this point so I 'm going to start with the amendment so I 'm going to put the amendment all those in favor say aye all right those opposed say no no no can you count councillor you 're handsome and i 'll put the substantive motion all those in favor say aye or as opposed say no no that 's carried council you 're handsome sorry as,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

move the staff recommendations do I have a seconder for that clean yani yeah i 'm just going to step back from this because i 've used this service so oh don 't even take oh sorry that 's silly I mean it is okay right it may be Mississippi because they 've used to see this that means you can never have a vote on if you see or you can never have a boat on my destroying the right wing I think I email you ownership all right I setback last time from okay all right all right Roger said self self employees got it anyway right ray just a question and I don 't know the answer so I 'm asking it so how does this relate to the story about CS shutting down its the well I don 't think it does there is a separate paper that 's working its way through here 's a recommendation for CS but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this this is the fund that the previous counsel in its wisdom decided to take a million dollars of donated money lenders hands and pay it to the government for the earth pate memorial which is absolutely beyond my comprehension so I don 't know why they decided to do it but they did and they did it by majority and since eonni is sitting back from the table i will say that Jonnie johansson glen livingston and tim carter who voted against it and every single one of the other councilors voted for it so you know it was an overwhelming majority of the previous council decision I don 't think that they considered it carefully enough sweet and-and-and because this was down to its last 50,000 basically it was felt that my attempts which have been going on for more than 12 months to get the million dollars back into this account was not worthwhile to pursue and when the government came to the party with the idea that they would match bond so not giving us not having a million dollars available but having two million dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community lead I just thought that was the perfect outcome we got the opportunity to bring back to the table the money that was donated from all around the country and actually all around the world so I don 't resolve from that for one minute but i do question the sense of taking money out of donations and putting it into an earthquake memorial riff yeah I mean I fully support that I guess just in terms of the public this confusion that there 's these two different organizations that seem to be doing the same thing so I just become useful they 're not doing the same I know something useful Justin look good really understand that this is my personal point of view because I know my staff will know that I 've been pursuing the social as well which is I think it 's time for raise residential advisory service for CS and whatever format can be retained and also the work that 's been going on through southern response which is the the breakthrough if they could all be brought together and actually get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideal outcome might be a long tail here this is this needs to be supported here is a significant rail but that the issues are incredibly complex if there 's not some of them are and some of them aren 't but yes just to follow on from that there is something coming back to us unsere yes do you know if for easily fall into a lie yeah I thought if I may make just through to that was the first point foot in july second one was when we the previous council first pushed on insurance it ended up with res but the council had a mind to push along the lines of advocacy so raise never wanted to go down that path because they thought insurers would back off and they got buying from them anyway anyway we ended up with cs when CS went to use advocacy in its title it was advised not to in order to attract ya funding so in the end both organizations were never able to attract funding we 're never able to use the efficacy in there in the wording @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense that CS is probably head that egypt be more in that advocacy space then rest they 're being said thing well it has both organizations have achieved a lot and you know i think under way they 're even more necessary yeah they haven 't sorted out by now you 're gonna need some seriously we 're still in it but i still like the idea of bringing everyone to the table and finding a way for this collaborative again you know over you can do it much better if you 're actually working together but what what raises got sitting behind it as the support of the community law seniors and i have to say that i don 't think that the city would have been as advanced in terms of recovery as it is today without the Community Law Center and all of the lawyers that volunteered their time and actually committed behind the scenes and all the law students that really worked hard on behalf of the people who were initially stuck so you know I just I kind of uncomfortable with this payment being made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the next period of time but i do want us to play an active role in ensuring that what remains gets sorted Ellie can I just add to that as well that it 's not only just I 'm getting it sorted and pulling those key people you 're absolutely right though and community law has been key and what 's been able to be achieved at res despite EQC not coming to the table for the first couple of years which made it hugely problematic for people but CS is now getting approaches from very high-profile qualified in criminal lawyers from christchurch coming through me and others asking how they can also support and help so what we need to do is stop this fracture angle what 's happening yet so whereas i totally endorse what you 're saying I don 't know how much longer see us will be able to in fact the word is that they 've closed their doors now and I know the 14th of July isn 't far away but for an organization that was running on a pretty tight budget on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fumes at all it 's got 60 claims 60 cases that it is now having to pass over to res I would hate there to be any drop in the momentum and don 't like of those cases so timers ability I diseases yeah well with easier 8283 old not ever infect anyone as you said ref who 's still not sorted after five and a half years is going to be exhilarated changed yeah yeah both speak yep yes be yeah absolutely all right i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye jose no that 's carried now","(-43.5320214,

and Bylaw 2016,gbYML0a2jDc,20160623,1211.95,"Christchurch, New Zealand",3511,and all before the council proposed changes to the dog control policy and dial controls battles and who 's who 's who who cheered that one big you right you 'd like to move it just I 'll move it thank you and do I have a seconder for us Andrew Turner perhaps are there any questions oh no you I 'll give it a bit of tape summary okay so some of the key points we had 256 submissions to this new dog control policy send me two percent of them were from dog owners and we heard 12 people in the hearing submission I think the the sort of pertinent points for the dog policy is that we were trying to adopt a more responsible dog ownership across the city and we focus that sort of on the collection of dog droppings making owners aware that there 's a responsibility their dogs on leads particularly in the CBD and New Brighton a new definition of under effective control and short leash clarification number of clarifications around matters with rural dogs and summer beach prohibitions we moved to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of new beaches were particularly in the level harbour and and and some clarifications on banks peninsula we 're added to the list that 's probably a reasonably holistic summary of the major aspects of the the new dog control policy it 's it 's been pretty well widely received I think so far in the media and there 's a lot of discussion about it when it first came out and I believe we are merely probably adopting more of as I said at the beginning more of an attitude of educating dog owners in the city about their responsibilities for owning dogs and how how we can be a little bit more lenient perhaps in terms of having dogs in the city and and in response how we expect dog owners should cooperate and take notice of what with what 's been proposed so that in a nutshell I think it 's where we are just a number of quite pertinent points there and as I said it 's been fairly well received their than the general public choker just the one thing I would add is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was either McLeod and she 's moving on back to Dunedin I think yeah I just think we should just acknowledge here at this yeah at this might overhear contribution and could I say that over a number of dog hearings that we have we 're doing the dog policy here but we have a number of menacing dog hearings and isla has has been very obliging and making yourself available for a good number of those hearings and there 's been a very capable member of the hearings panels that with it well I think we should write to her and it 's linked here for the contribution nah I thought it was appropriate to raise contact now I 've got Jamie le Yanni it 's really for Dave this question you know if ever thank you very much i think it was a brilliant synopsis and I appreciate that Dave and thanks for you and the panel 's work on all around this very supportive for dogs and public places particularly in Central City we 've got to give the times there and actually embrace that it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much a step toward but very very supportive of it being under a feat of control now I understand that that 's leashed song willful dogs in the city but leash dogs in the city can you let me know basically two things what happens if they 're not under a fit of control what 's the process around that into are there places in the central city where they don 't have to be under effect of control because I thought I represent or so away from them but rather than mark two verbs answer those questions okay very much i guess so answer the second question hagley park is one of those areas which is large enough to enable people to take the dogs exercise but certainly this under control is an area that we are going to focus on them especially in terms of enforcement the path they have to be the paths they must be on a leash is yeah but sitting of the rest of the area I think the doll packs that the city is created we have steven 's really good dog it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as opposed to playing areas where we really quite frankly don 't need dogs in those areas and so to answer the second question is yes there were men de tree to have these dogs leashed and if they 're not what we 'll need to take some enforcement action on is what does someone do around there because my experience around that is you don 't know if a dog 's dangerous or not they don 't have a tattoo on there for weird but you can see if they 're on a leash or not yes it 's got Kristen and I guess the first thing to do is contact council we have we provide a 24-hour service we will get there to those areas as quickly as possible speak to those owners if they don 't want to comply then that we have to enforceable infringement finds the maximum penalties 300 it 's quite significant and should the two people who are going take the attitude of all it 's just gettin on a dog run off the leash because it 's not acceptable in the community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's important to reinforce that it 's running the council don 't bring anyone else renault counts oldest 24-7 we 've got coverage with the dog dog dog a droll yeah yep um yeah and I think was at Le ya jaan e le Vell yeah just had a question about the cvd um I think so I just wanted to check because it says here that you have retained dogs and the cvd need to be on a leash but then your definition of the cvd seems to be the for abs so can you just clarify what the area is that people have to add the dogs on the leash and why you 've done the 4s which includes a huge residential area as opposed to the CBD if that 's the connect mark might want to elaborate a bit on the sphere that essentially the old dog policy did allow for dogs within the central city but have had prescriptive areas that were prohibited Victoria Square new Regent Street Cathedral Square and parts of the high street mall I think from memory so prior to this dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a leash but we had a prescriptive regime of certain areas being unavailable what we are now we 've removed the areas that were restricted before and basically now saying the whole of the central city is dogs are allowed that they must be on a leash and all areas but so just it 's so unclear so prior to this proposed Bible coming in at the moment people within the residential area of the central city within the 4 f 's currently don 't have to have their dogs on a leash and we 're putting a restriction that they now do know they 've always got me happy what they always were supposed to whether in fact they did and I was up to but within the city limits CBD for any news that has always been council policy that dog should be on the least but as I 'm saying we had prescriptive areas that were where dogs were prohibited at all and we what we are now saying is that the entire cvd or four avenues is available for dogs but they must be on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just clarify that bull dogs must be on a leash on the road spective with our city but in those those prohibited areas will release those reduce those to having a month under control by leash so just council have got that absolutely right so effectively we should say across the entire city on the right near where you have if you 're on a footpath or the dog you need to be leached correct and we do say that it 's on the vinyl so why do a distinction and because we wanted to make a clarification about the central city in particular because we had hit those prohibited areas so we wanted to bring that to the attention as there is also some of the park areas within the central city and it was just easier to describe it founded by the four eva news if you have a dog and you 're walking on the footpath it must be on a leash if he 's in the crash at the transit area any part of the area including banks Man 2 incorrect let 's stop it running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of weird like we want people live in the central city but then we kind of signal them out for special treatment which we 've heard is an actually special treatment I mean I support you 're doing in terms of allowing dogs sorry asked and answered I 've got the answer was that the reason that it 's being highlighted is because we 're changing the rules to make it more available to people to take their dogs through the central city so we 're removing prohibited areas yeah to do that it makes sense to let the public know what we 're consulting on I don 't see that there 's it 's asked an answer and I think it 's getting to the point of debate also that we 're asked point about bait now no that wasn 't okay well this is the second fish i have was around the dog parks so I know previously do as a resolution to counsel look at dog like new dog parks particularly around the portholes in terms of the eastern side of the foot holes and also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will consider the idea of having additional dog parts to match the kind of increased restrictions was it part of the skypes I know she ain 't restrictions oceans dog pack status included in the bylaws sinners so were you asked to you know presumably we signed off on the draft to go out for consultation did we ask you to consider additional dog parks as part of that process my understanding was that we weren 't us to consider that but Tina Crocker who 's done all the policy work on this and unfortunately she 's quite sick today she can she 's not here so I can check that and get back to you but you weren 't asked to do it I don 't aspire away process no I don 't believe we worry that we want confirmed existing dog parks we weren 't asked to look at any further misery accounts a resolution to ask with animal a very settled way so we can have a look at future dog park status in the future but not now Ellie and then Phil thank you picture 317 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly related to this but it is reach and and the report we 're looking at the speed of cyclists on passed in hagley park where it says it was going to be referred to the police so the police have jurisdiction over our paths and Hagen part around speeds of cyclists that 's my first question and secondly if we can put signs up at dog parks which i think is the bit of a set on that page there what sign is up why can 't we put signs up around speeds of cycles on parts so the speeds of bits of a cycle is a vehicle in terms of the land transport it in rules so the police have jurisdiction to enforce the speeds of vehicles but we don 't need limits on bikes yeah I 'd have to check that again but there was if we wanted a specific speed limit and higley part we would have to sit there but I just need to go back and check the land transport rules about the speed of cycles but certainly we didn 't feel that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we did want to have a discussion with but anyways about their signage up saying morning cyclists or warning dogs or something like that as a sort of thing you 've done well there is but a theorist new site a new signage going and higley park i know but the new pathways only you knew my violent thinks I did I 'm a dick ok this was an issue that sort of got quite an earring and the hearings and in recent meetings the problem was also surfaced along well stand in front of the museum and cross college as well with with cyclists going up some considerable speed and so it 's an area perhaps whilst we haven 't we can 't and didn 't deal with it in the dog policy it is an area that pods possibly needs some means of address through council because he might be something coming to the environmental Commission specifically it 's not something that we could include in the yeah oh um with the list the list for example the port hills reserves physiol on page sorry and 384 I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it included somewhere else it wasn 't on the list for portals reserves on page 29 modulus well 384 I wonder if we could just check that I think it 's a really precise I don 't see them there either here if you don 't want a lot to come back and just let the dog food problem up there it 's obvious that there are dogs and there 's other animals like sheep in the area too yes thank you and that 's my main question actually and I 'll make a comment later so is that is my other question sorry is that the intent is the intention to include rocky quick as a place then we r dogface i presume it so an error that 's I I think it is because it 's an area the track is an area of great concern to us in terms of people walking at the size of dogs Woodstock around it 's like a highway but could we make a note of it for ya no longer and then my other question was really um around this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publicity for people so that in fact the really good work that 's been done as we clarified for air isn 't here so we 'll commence their already we have a communications team actively involved in drafting documents up so we can get it out to the community let them know this is now what 's the speed approved I guess this is an area our new control policy and these are the areas of concern that you might be interested in looking at and so the communications group are developing a plan now flat table thanks man thin oh thank you is there now do you think greater clarity and I 'm looking at the schedule page 385 in relation to dogs on beaches do you think it 's rated clarity now over boundaries with the various features might because I think there 's been some ambiguity over we must have a dog still not know once you get into the kind of new brighton section i think some people are under the impression we can let them run free it 's actually not the case to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it yes essentially that 's right however if you 're walking through one of these prohibited areas you may have your dog on the leash you may need to keep it under control then once you 're outside of that prohibited area which is 100 metres either side of the Surf Club for instance you can let your God I 'll go and have exercised it seemed ridiculous to expect someone to get to that line go around the outside problem of the road get back to the beach so it 's just as easy to enable a person to get through from one side of the beach the other through that through that area but with the dog on a leash under control I think I know the question yeah it 's still a bit of confusion out there and do you seeing a Mexican the signs I guess because they are fairly high in terms of high tide mark and are really something we probably need to address when we did assigned it 's a plan I think enforcement also needs to be there on a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't mean during monday to friday said days and some of these needs to get little herring as well ok so the beach prohibition areas they were designed to match up with the surf lifesaving rob up furious i don 'ti invest how they work yeah Pauline do you think 's can I just ask a question about the two license join two more dogs I 'm just not quite clear what it means um so does it mean that in the city bank splinter aside and the city of someone has a property smaller than one hectare they require a license or do they only require licenses an X bullet points are on page 318 if they have more than two dogs not quite clear hmm so the issue was in beach peninsula those properties that were I guess communities that were feel tight in terms of boundaries and then there were areas which are larger rural there 's a man of getting a balance between with your head of property larger than that or small Latin if you did have one small net and it was considered as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city and the township there was a need to have a license to keep till more dogs because they were all relatively the same terms of size when you went outside of those areas those rural areas the farming areas obviously wouldn 't need to have a license to keep two more dogs and the majority of farming communities have more than at least two or three dollars working on in the second bullet point altering the proposal so so when we went out for consultation we had a license for owning two or more dogs yeah but the feedback from the submissions and that hearing this panel considered that and decided they don 't be a license for more than two dogs so three you 've got two dogs you don 't have to have special provisionally but if you give you go to three we 're doing it wrong whereas before it was two or more so and to get that licensed I think people need the responsible dog status still generally yes however there are many dog owners without that because the properties aren 't quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secured to ensure the dark area so it 's about containment within the property not issue the full containment of the property right yep thank you that 's clear good oh okay just the responsible dog owner status so the removal of that what does that actually mean so the responsible dog owner status policy it was a separate policy we 've actually put those provisions into the dog control policy now so it 's just all in one place Josh Smith is a nice rack tonight good all right I 'll pop that motion all those in favor say aye all right I suppose they know that 's Carrie okay,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Management Plan,n-yPwz-G6RA,20160623,443.14,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1053,21 item 20 item 21 and I 'm hearing panel report to Council on proposed changes to the jelly car management plan this has been through a hearings pen or a piece um it 's have been moving a lot to speak oh okay that 's mine I don 't like to understand it yeah i don 't i don 't have we got a presentation on and we put this on the table yeah the Hearing Panel have you are on the Hearing Panel we yeah we 're getting okay whatever thought you 're moving at and do I have a seconder and breadth of it sir okay so do you want to just give a presentation or a brief presentation the the submissions basically centered around four points and one of them the first one probably arose because the original management plan for jelly park had what was called in at an indicative development plan which actually sort of gave rise to the perception that some things in that management plan we 're more or less in there and deemed to be something that would happen in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so in the new development sorry management plan we have removed any indicative management plan and just merely referred to activities that currently our existing on the plan there were three principal things that the here then we looked at two of them involved extensions to the car park and designated car parking area in the grounds you 'll see sort of in that almost top right hand corner of the red bounded area of the plan there 's a little blue area there that was signaled as being a possible extension to the car park it intruded into the parks and open spaces area of the the park and there was significant opposition to that from the local community there was a second area which skirted around not actually shown on that map at all but you can see the light blue area that shows where the sport and recreation facility is there is a driveway that connects around the back to the Apollo project centre and there was a small wedge of land there that it was deemed desirable to include in the car parking area and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under consideration was the Apollo project centre itself was not recognized in the management plan and under the sierra act technically at the end of april this year that building had no status and would have had to have been removed the OIC has been extended to for another five years so it 's been recommended that the Apollo project centre being recognized as a building in the management plan such that in 2021 we can then have the decision whether we want to keep it or remove it by not acknowledging it it has to go and we 're so clear yes let 's acknowledge it 's part of it the lectures on the on jelly park at the moment and when the OIC expires we can then have that conversation does counsel want to continue using or acknowledging this building or do in fact we want to terminate the usage of it then so they were the main points of the the hearings on on the jelly park management plan so effectively there are only really three points that we we are recommending today the first one was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right hand corner of the the met up there second one was to include the small wedge which is not actually shown there it sort of just underneath the blue shaded area of the recreation center and thirdly that we would reference in the management plan the the existence of the Apollo project center so that that 's essentially the recommendation that the hearings can will bring to you today okay sounds right yep right yeah I mean we discussed this at the community board and we had a community board member on the panel and we 're generally comfortable with that I 'm the obviously he usual issue around car parking trees it was the prime concern for the community but we did have some community members come in who done their own kind of research around car parking and they actually said that on the left-hand sides of the greers road there is actually always a lot of car parking but everyone goes to the other side so actually people prepared to just walk across there 's actually plenty of the car parking on the other side which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it so I think they were quite happy with that other piece being taken out yep enough we 're going to feel good yep look I 'm I think a lot of really good work has been done on this I guess I 'm around the management plan which is here it seems to me that it 's quite an important an important document in terms of how we manage here parks about a long period of time to go and I guess if if some staff had been available to give us a brief presentation like you 've had on the land drainage I just think we 'd be clearer about signing off the whole mention park and I acknowledge the really good work that 's been done and I 'm pleased that the board have been involved too so I don 't know whether we should consider delaying this and I don 't want to hold things up but till till we are across at me I don 't think something I think I mean Dave you know presented quite clearly and those were the issues and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in you know quite detailed level so everyone 's happy with it so the community boards supporting the Hearing Panel recommendation well that is a metropolitan facility isn 't yeah so i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye let 's say no that 's scary thank you work,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Options,HFbcdzsjxQ8,20160623,1274.34,"Christchurch, New Zealand",3582,now we 've got number one drain earthquake damage repair options thank you very much again we 've got a very short presentation if yep you want us to go get out through my bus so again this is another land range recovery program project but you 'll see at this stage is that the the emphasis the focus is on repair so peter is going to take us through where it is and what we 're proposing so yes another drain exciting drain this one I think is slightly more exciting what we 're looking to do to it where this terrain is number one drain which goes between the shirley catchment you can see on the screen there in through to waikiki or horseshoe lake that 's a concrete lined rain and it was one of the ones identified as the being most damage within the city so as Keith said this is very much about repair the strain and I guess the consequence of not doing anything will fail and couldn 't has potential for flooding upstream and the more costly repair you can 't quite see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can see what it 's yeah it needs serious work there 's a drain or two higher ups the western half does need replacement and those from the photos on that side seriously damaged the eastern half is less damaged in can be spot repaired at those sections which are particularly badly damaged and so in this way we sort of framed it in the report that in terms of western half that requires replacement in the east and half is some decisions to be made around how to approach that in terms of the crossings for repair of the and the drain is I guess three options we looked at repairing like like an accessory placing the concrete panels taken back to a concrete drain repairing with natural banks that 's a wider base channel but just sloping it up at three two one slopes still somewhat utilitarian or naturalizing it and that 's taking it back to a more natural stream channel to recreate I guess what was originally there in terms of the costs of those they range in between two thousand five hundred and fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meter now at this stage level up costing those are approximately the same so I guess we 're looking at three different options with a similar cost per unit costs three place those with the naturalization meeting I guess a lot of other benefits in terms of improving the ecological health Lakers in there minus e e we management plan is identified as one of those water features within studied like to see its fruits particularly sort of three options that we present to in the report is repairing the western half through naturalization and just focusing on that western half and then looking at the eastern half as either a spot repair or we 're doing some works to see whether and some modeling to see whether more capacity is needed so that could be done under l dfp scope or it can just go back into and I guess being prioritized with other naturalization projects throughout the study but what we 're proposing is a detailed design would be completed under the audio RP just in terms of there 's a design team there that makes sense to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to repair the recent half with concrete channel like-for-like and then the third option is to naturalize the entirely so they wish them half a foot with an LDR p scope but just getting approval to extend netskope for this particular case to naturalize entirely in terms of costs there 's a lot of costs associated we 're just getting set up and design and established on site and so it 's a ratio of about seventy five percent for the western half and twenty five percent of you to do the eastern half as one package if you 're to come better game be slightly different that 's around about the ballpark so yes the the preferred option there was that we put food under our current scope was the detailed design of the entire length under the ldiot project and the audio p scope is just a natural eyes the Western heart only and for the remainder seek what other options there are that 's the project in a nutshell and the potential alignment with the avon storm water management plan I like the idea of having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that 's not been included in that this was a identified relatively late on the piece I have talked about it with the people involved in the sand water management plan I 've looked at very high level sizing whether you could do something there and this yes you could do something on the land available and the golf course is quite happy with and we 've talked about that with the golf course it 's nary between fairways that 's not particularly used at the moment so they in principle they have to go through the club and don 't have any problem with Atlas stage and so the way I see that is that that could be prioritized with the avin SMP and see whether it matches their priorities for I guess the catchment itself as residential so maybe doesn 't it 's not high traffic roads or an industrial commercial catchment that was downstream receiving environment in this case is particularly sensitive that 's right so it 's just seemed to me but it takes a lot of boxes for me which is why I couldn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommendations but you 've explained it because it was late and maybe that 's something that perhaps I should have said even before is that you know we 're in the new environment now with the greater Christchurch regeneration 8 and we 've also as a council committed to cleaning up our waterways so and stormwater obviously as a significant powerful contributing factor this is a particularly vulnerable area and special area you know issues identified so it 's a very good paper and I just wonder whether we need to be thinking all the time holistically around not just land rayna 's but also cleaning up the rivers also regeneration opportunities at every step of the way because I mean there will be lamb drainage works for example that will require compulsory acquisition under the Public Works eat actually it might be a lot quicker and actually a lot more engaged with the public in terms of that regeneration of an area to go through a regeneration planning process or through a purchase process through through the egg so I guess that we 're going to be asking you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about all three at the same time so it 's a sort of that 360 degree view of of the total program and what we 're trying to achieve in terms of regeneration so and it did seem to me that was something that was missing from the recommendations but I don 't know whether a request to investigate that option further and progressive if it 's able to be progressed I mean I 'm not sure of the because it 's you know no it 's making a comment before about silo silo thinking and so one money group of money comes from the land drainage recovery program another that a money comes from the stormwater management program for their avin so I I don 't know i mean can certainly something that we could take direction to investigate further about feasibility and what it would do in terms of water quality because it would make a difference to do it now wouldn 't it at the same time as doing last absolutely yeah okay sample I suppose my flows off from what you the ID you talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars extra to naturalize the whole project seems logical the prospective of exterior managing River quality and I suppose that now outweighed with motley and suggesting with the one of you better be put into that precede rather naturalizing the whole this way I look at or we go what the money 's on the budget to naturalize the whole thing and just that 's why we wouldn 't do it is there 's a Christian of scope I think in terms of we work within a certain scope and then we put forward options for enhancement and we can we have escaped to I guess identify options for enhancement in terms of naturalizing the whole thing versus you 'd want to do it together with a some sort of water quality treatment feature because they basically would be so close to here in terms of scope and scale ready and work and make them work together so be something which is compatible with it if you could that would need glean the ideas over here if you hit your preferred choice I know you 're saying this is your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this is a preferred choice under lanterns recovery program scope and the option to naturalize the whole thing is something which I think would have would be have good benefits to do that at the same time and that 's what I proposing that we 'd at least designed the whole thing at once yeah a gleam and then sell thank you so I would support that joining up and I was thinking about that box ticking over region plans especially with regard to you know that proposal for eg something like a flat water facility which will know that would come into that area there 's a kind of certain element of the that the lorax thing you know who will speak for that area given its its cultural sensitivity so I think we do need to look at joining up with the region bucket of work yeah so I think if we were going to decide on that part today we should ask for some more information about the processes my concern is that if we if we indicate we want it joined up now by way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million dollars means but that 's five hundred thousand dollars that isn 't spent on another land Reina jut and I 'll be frank the messages that Tim and I get around the heathcote River are very clear so flooding the Len drainage part was the priority of the flood task force there 's every reason to have the cleaning up the water and if this could be considered as part of their that we do so but I think before we decided on doing that we should get some further information for clarification about those processes I think they 're saying that we get a detailed designed for the naturalization of the whole length that we come up to naturalize the western half only so that the detailed designs done for the whole lot and what I 'm asking is whether that should also include the avin stormwater management plan suggestion for a boost clutch first flush basin and that area not doing the real way yeah in the funding for the eastern half would not come from the ldr peanut from elsewhere it would have to come from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council to go down that tracks right not really yep so it is there a phrase that we could do to ask you to the potentially scope the inclusion of their tour or at least consult with the people and the I 'm in a bit you answered my question well because I couldn 't understand why it wasn 't included on the recommendation but it 's because it came up late so is there any chance of just sleep seeking advice from those involved in the Haven stormwater management plan as to whether this would be a priority for yes I know certainly discussed it with him a terms of alignment with their overall approach does alone perhaps it 's a just adding in concept design of a first bus or a water a storm water quality treatment facility within alongside the drain or something like that so can we add that to design details decline of the neckties I don 't know just add to their what is it contact concept design concept design for the this blush basin I wouldn 't call it first flash-based next one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality treatment facility ok Scoob needed concept design for storm water quality treatment which leads you more room to move yes is as identified on the paper yes yeah yep all right Yanni yeah just want to check that 's of work taking the door count waste water overflows and with her events and not to date no so is it I mean is there a process because the point you make about water quality demand max about water quality and obviously one of the most distressing things for the communities when it floods as the war serves that then goes through their houses and properties so is there a way that we 're thinking about actually how we stop that from happening as part of these drainage projects is proposed certainly and it 's the range of people that we have on our design reviews and concept designs issues and options include people who have an oversight of the is a waste water near away from an understanding so these are often raised is an issue if there 's a potential over flow upstream as to what effect that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not specifically aware of a overflow point or a stream of here but I can 't we can check their Phillip the low-lying lands on the other side of the horseshoe lake yes yeah so you 're wrong it can I just ask that the whole question about waste water overflows wonder if David answer my comment on it because I know a lot of like now he 's asked the question but has been gone yeah just I mean it just seems like stopping Ross erodes going into our waterways should be like a top priority and we should mr. Adam some white comment not necessarily 15 that 's looking at feed the storm the sewer in the sewer overflows in that particular location system is powered interacts with that so this group 's looking after the land drainage program and so it 'd be hard for them to update you on the progress that we 're making around all of that reviewer and what we 're doing around those can send it in normal consumes of wastewater discharge there 'll be some that we will never fix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriately putting stuff down and I think we did about that not not too long ago but there are some and unfortunately than those plop it has happened they do actually overflow it for love is patient so we are on another team looking at their specification so so my understanding it 's a systems design a weather event to over fly into the storm water right so at the moment we 've got a system that says if we get too much rain the kind of safety bell is to discharge to overflow into the drainage to stormwater drainage system so if I certainly will be I assume we controlled points should actually enable a controlled discharge rather than a young control discharge because you know where it 's going in it you know that the paramount thing is to protect public health so and all I 'm asking is how we doing that through this process well can I make a point of order this actually doesn 't refer this isn 't in relation to this report it 's a whole separate issue mmm and if you if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will be relevant reports available on there that 's quite separate from us it 's sorry it 's nice so do need to be aligned and they are being aligned as much as possible okay my view the flooding task force it came up in the feedback the land drainage program should be dealing with it that you 're saying it 's not i I 've personally just can 't understand why we wouldn 't take opportunity to take that holistic I think the words I 'd I can 't understand probably reflect the the situation work because it is a separate issue and I think that we do need to possibly have a workshop on the on the whole question of overflows and I mean we 're setting up a whole what 'd he call it a seminar with ekn with you know the University with all of the different parties in relation to water quality because this is a top priority for the council so I mean we can get a report on that specific issue but I think to have the staff who are here dealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of earthquake damage repair options I think that it 's not an order to be raising that in the context of discussion so I 'm very happy but we asked we hit a workshop on these things so that the issues that have been raised are aligned and we 're clear about the programs that are happening yeah so just in terms of 5.2 it talks about the priority site with regard to addressing water quality issues so you know I mean all right you can say it 's not relevant to today and we have a workshop in the future but if we 're committing funding to doing a repair and we don 't have an understanding of what impact it has on improving the water quality then we just raised a whole thing for a concept design for storm water quality treatment is proposed in the report we 've ever bet though but we are going through a process of getting to understand all of the components of our obligations as a city and the impact that we have on our rivers so in the horseshoe lake is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so um is that okay yes um can we just ask for like reword and get Inge to the proposal item D yep so so you were just saying cause our reader potentially just changed to include some water quality treatment design as proposing the record which gives us a bit more freedom as to whether it 's just a detail okay storms water quality to include some water closer quality treatment design design as proposing the report but yep okay so has it been moved and seconded a lost track yeah I 've come yeah it was moved by policy girly and weak and advice a film alright can 't link to this uses the look you know we talk about improving our water quality and reducing sewage overflows all this work will help to address these overflows because we 're increasing the capacity of our waterways of many parts and I just want to reiterate the hard work and the talent when this team here that what they come up with an hour working party we often have these projects come to us again and again they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and increased efficiencies and a better result the work that 's going into this is amazing we just received this recently about the Dudley work and this has got all the work packages exactly we they are on time on budget it 's just really impressive they 're really on the button all this work and the fact that this team actually identified this naturalization option for the eastern half as well as included it in the design but it 's not with an ad like happy to fund it as an indication of the way they are thinking about our water quality and the opportunities so I just want once if you want to thank the team for the incredible work that they 're doing they 're a really good bunch to work with in there on the button so thank you very much yeah we 're getting really good bang for buck sorry got it in there yes look I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye aye opposed they know that 's carried thank you ok,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

presentations yeah he 's only she loves walk on drains yes it 's pushing me yes HD drains we 're just talking about to help you neither three laughs light ones yeah I find them very training training I think these reports are quite draining you would say I withdrawn I flush out all the bedbugs but you under pressure i said i 'm happy to take the appearance and later nothing 's a certain vodka stavia for the drains drained of the will to live is it exhibition again right okay so i think so but the deliverer I think we 've got the presentation ready two to go socio drain is a large range recovery program project and one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the investigations for these these works is to look at repair options under meeting up remediation options together with any enhancement options the objective of laundry and recovery program is to return flood risk to Creek wake levels so Tom I think we 'll just text through somewhere just a few slides very quickly sure thank you very much we investigated those sort of three options inside the investigation for the lender a trip every program to e3 great nice translocated and to fix the area and takes flows from a 20 degree throw down out to the history by just upstream of the tree now we come up with a preferred option which is repairing the breezes Road rain and some limited remediation so that remediations extending the pipe network and widening at the drain to a small extent and we found with our works there full remediation this catchment was going to be very expensive and we look for other options which were more cost-effective we know in this catchment from our modeling work that there aren 't any houses of significant or high risk of frequent flooding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is much lower been the subject of previous reports looking at a flood map you can see the flood risk as in pockets in the catchment and that circled area indicates the downstream end of history drain and the Breathitt or drain and we 're targeting a little pocket of flooding there and bruises road to the very bottom of that picture and the reason we 're targeting that is because this location of the non Flores flooding and the more extreme events sort of 2% exceedance event so a disenchanted that event occurring in any given year and when inside their investigations we look at the pretty quake flood risk in the postcode address range now as you can see on the slide the number of floors or foundations at under full flooding or foundations at risk in this catchment has reasonably quieter 120 before the earthquake 134 after but there 's very few houses at risk of above floor fighting that we estimate from combining our flood hazard mirza results in the four-level survey results now we hit for pre quaking that for postcode but they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have actually been improved by the earthquakes during you want to come on so so so you want that have come on that is the target of that limit of remediation stepping back a step and the investigations we did look at a wide range of options before we counter and preferred 111 options originally and married that down to these four concepts that we progressed the image you can see it on that slide is the current condition of that drain motion it 's a about a meter wide before the earthquakes you can see the amount of damage that suffered in terms of that limited remediation option that drain is to be replaced shown and blew up there on the slide plus upper gone hot network the drains the replacement of drains me 170 odd meters there upsizing the parts similar length and then extending the network from the ground there either as a partner Nick the grounders the surface whale the options for rebuilding the drain will be considered further of the next design stage whether or not we can actualize what we considered rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there this is an 11 kv cable which good limit and other more naturalized options so how do we come to this preferred option where as I say at targets that two floors that have been exasperated with flood risk and it comes it 's relatively small cost compared to for remediation your catchment so there 's for remediation options we 're considerably more expensive because they included pump stations and up sighs and pipe network through the catching and you can see from the slide that though costs for those sort of options were quite high those other options did address the underfloor flooding to a greater degree or foundation fighting to a greater degree we did present these options to the community board after the report written on the 7th this month and they and we presented this presentation essentially in they had expressed some concern of our wonderful flooding and said that it was still a silicon soon in that community and of the residents but they felt that they could support the preferred option given the significant increases in cost with the other options they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other options maybe between the limit or affiliation the for remediation at some intermediate cost they could have might have preferred those but we haven 't actually seen any options and those sort of experience thank you very good commander yani thank you just just um just help me understand that that table that you 've got so before the earthquake 120 properties where risk of underfloor foundation it 's wrong clay with repair and limited remediation we 're basically 810 profit each other for 1.5 million dollars we 're making improvement for is that so yeah and it sort of water plus the we 're really targeting the two floors that are at risk of above floor flooding but noting that their repair cost is something we 're going to have to do anyway that drain has been significantly damaging isn 't functioning so we need to invest it sort of money just to reinstate then it with what it was so there 's that 's probably more akin to the incremental cost between the nuclear option be attributed to them so here we dropped on us at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk we did actually talk about that Mel something the community board raised a very similar question their response of that stage was that the remediation options provide a wider community benefit we get better drainage of the streets and the adjoining properties so rather than focusing on just this direct benefits to those three properties you get a wider community benefit with the drainage works being enacted that full cost benefit analysis we have an under makeup and then just um a recall from the community meetings over the flooding in this area one of the concerns was that skirt appears in made the situation worse because the water following the skirt repairs was draining into people 's properties has that being addressed through this work well we do have drawings of the skirt works it had been enacted they 've enacted some pipe repairs and install floodgates and didn 't store bund along the best of these properties to hold out the tide in terms of investigating that we have relied on the scoop design work to prove the efficacy of that or even reinvestigate them through so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific area but at that community meeting at the one only Methodist Church a number of people got up and see the flooding issues and this kind of errand le area were exacerbated post skirt repairs to the streets so I just you know it would be good to have some kind of assessment old if that 's been looked at because of you know obviously hopefully would make things better not not worth sure so those suit works in this particular catchment aren 't on the streets they 're sort of on the drain downstream the works are we proposing so I 'm not sure if that that 's even with another area that it might be separate area that was their concern but we can ship em coming and under skirts brief of you know just for repairs like the light repairs so they didn 't go beyond that in order to solve street flooding or other problems so it might be that the perception has been made worse but it might just be that that was an existing problem that just became more noticeable following the skirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasn 't within skirt brief to go beyond simple repair yet they made the littles apparently according to the claw of the levels book I think that we 've heard that this is a different catchment so is that right joining the unmentionable that the Skip works are downstream of what we 're proposing and not on the roads we could we can pick up a conversation that 's good just confirm that they and affected street flooding in this area but I 'd be surprised if they worked and I just think of it in terms of reporting back to people who came to that meeting and you 're just giving them some reassurance that we 've looked at there were peers and we 've looked at the solution a week we know what meeting you talk about the flooding meetings that were held in the different communities they 'd have to match 2014 yeah the flooding meeting that was held in the one only Methodist Church this message is true my 90 Methodist Church it 's miles away no that was the meeting for the flooding issues for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to then expect in 2014 after the floods yeah it was and it was skirt repairs that have been done before 2014 people got up and said yes that they had noticed an increase in flooding and there was something to do with the levels for the the way the designs had been done in terms of fixing the infrastructure they had put the flooding going into their properties rather than draining away properly but this is this is going back to before 2014 skirt repairs I presume you 're referring to the workshops that were held as part of the mural flood task force 's rolling meadows okay so we could we can find out what was some see if I can trick my own knowledge enjoys making sauce let 's go was it yeah maybe not yeah double-check this stuffing okay better be great gymboree bother thank you clean thank you I 've just a couple of quick questions just that that gap in terms of what appears to be to get between ER and the benefit cost ratio between options one and two is that money down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pump station and the rising may bit probably accounts for that and then alter okay you 're the vast majority of the differences of pump station rising lane works but in addition the five foot back to the inundation map here we 're targeting the downstream into the catchment with the preferred option rather than getting all the way up into the catchment so the later options have a have a wider benefit but it really is the benefit for under fulfilling I can rather than above all and it seems then I just had a quick question over six point 10 on page 171 over community input there 's been a lot of intensive long road works nearby and breezes rope the residents appeared of being quite patient but I 'm aware it 's really stretched so when it comes to community consultation taken on board d buzzing I level approaches at this point as you can see from the proposed works here we 're not planning on and acting any works on the road so I know but it 's still Lydia in a context you will certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community and here particularly in the area the properties beside that brown line was that 's where new network is proposed yeah and it will as likely to require the easements so when we bind from this Community you to get this work through but I hope that they 'll be favorable for the works because the people who are being impacted of those who are directly benefiting from that said you know it worse Romania I think if we can get that right they 've had to absorb a fair but lately with road weeks so I 've been near a warrant yes anyone else so that 's someone like to move the snap ring window o meter Kelly decision to go Wally Wally Wally oh sorry is it the other twin Gunther Yahoo seated I actually did get the right time I just feel sorry it is perfect it 's the infrastructure and we call in a bar that they need AG that it 's been moved and seconded calling and full and i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye I suppose they know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the presentation as well,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Plan,WaM5phxtm0A,20160622,784.64,"Christchurch, New Zealand",2142,okay apparently my microphone wasn 't on that 's an advantage okay item number 15 crush it should he counts all freight management action plan this is a receiving and adopting the information and the crush it city so freight management action plan of course is that you 'd like to move back sikander by a point lonsdale are there any questions for staff yes yes um just kind of trying to understand what have we got funding on budget for a number of these things yeah so this section planners obtained for staff to how we gonna work on managing Freight better so it 's all within existing staff budgets it 's not additional budgets like if I look at page 141 which is kind of that actions been summarized it is considered bridge loading three count data so do we I mean I was just surprised like the morehouse over bridge has got 30 and restrictions with EV even though it 's just been repaired there 's it I mean is there kind of a more holistic approach to what we 're doing in terms of the repairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really about getting a quick count data on the number of fruit freight vehicles that have move around the network we we don 't always have to be start around Freight we we we have data round of vehicles in general but not always easy to stub much between freight and other vehicles so it with part of this is hitting more data returns accepted with frazier 's moving around there and I go what 's the point of getting that data after we released a huge about the money repairing a bridge well this this is really about how we manage how fragrant on the network and the issues that freight has winner tissue when threats moving through residential areas and the noise that causes residents and the damage that causes at our roads we all those other appears we 've done like the Morehouse overbridge has taken account of the balloons over that Ridge so that that would be factored into the design to make sure you open the amount of volumes this is more about so we 're freshman tickler is moving and the noise that causal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not I could only other thing I wanted to ask or or possibly add is I don 't see how community boards are involved in this and given that they 're making local decisions and I know our boards being approached by kiwirail we 've had you know presentations around Garland 's rode around the tannery we 've also done master plans through main roads and in fury road where the port have made submissions so what 's the prices in terms of the action plan for the community board community boards that are affected to have sort of a view you know in terms of local decision-making and input sure yeah this doesn 't change any delegations with community boards this is really about getting data communicating with the freight industry and freight operators in terms of the needs of freight and and the issues they 're facing and also getting data on the issues that are facing relatives on the impact of freight any changes that need to be made to the road network or any additional investment that isn 't that is recommended out of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of delegations to community boards if it 's needed or cancelled so we 're not proposing any in a new M structure out of this at the stage it 's really about flipping data so that we can inform any time I 'm just go and brief the community boards though about the action plan sure so once we 've approved it then a few make contact I mean I can think of um your rom street dancer it would be in particular obviously the hagley theory meet and surely top no I 'm and out obvious ones but there 's probably probably all of the community awards and potentially just in terms of parent organizations and I thought it would be good to in Italy add to the community boards to that what concerns me is the community board to make emotional decisions or recommendations but by the time we get work for us to consider something of all the discussions happened with us not been having Empire in its kind of it just frustrates a process so we 're not doing a report and I 've just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know I don 't know it 's not the actual strategy that 's the issue the issue is the ongoing discussions that are held between the different interested parties we 're boards make decisions on certain things or recommendations that 's really involvement at the forwards at an early stage establish a good understanding of the issue surrounding local freight management within Council that doesn 't include community boards when I just suggested that there is a briefing to the community boards that are specifically affected and that may mean all of them it just seems to me that that 's an easy way forward i 'm jimmy le and Sylvain Thank You mayor at one question on page 134 135 regarding to equate approached Ephrata study your particular mention this one is not a pro SB 6 direction we got into issue and solution for freedom movement on the culture to the city local row they work but my concern is that because why the regarding to list kind of our infrastructure investment you know we can get a kind of based on outcome to improve economic growth that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it knows the kind of rate possible approaches local rule more or less you know I was taught by my constitute knows vibration and them is all the issue so quick which area we can reflect release way how to mitigate is effect sure so the greater crotchets Freight study was a joint study with his own transport agency he can was involved and the port and Selwyn why met destructs flew evolve and the airport as well now that get really concentrated on really the state highway network so such as prime street and you know those key routes yes where there 's lots of freight and that 's of the vintage boylan is the transport agency not by council yes this this action plan is about the council road so the roads are out stakeholders and it 's really those roads where you know the long distance freight that show them through the city should be on the state highways it should only be freight that is going to local businesses or deliveries and libraries that should be using our our roads and that 's how when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know we should be doing more to encourage Freight to be using the state highways so they don 't go through residential areas on this they need to yeah and that 's really what this is this is about how do we manage our roads that we control not the state highways yeah it makes sense in time and i 'll use a the classic example that i know from from my background before I came here as the trucks that would duck down Preston 's road to avoid the traffic jam on Martian road and that you know we would want that discouraged in any way shape or form because the damage to that road is something that that falls on the council obviously but also that disrupts the normal residential environment kitchen right Senora so and even when and even though we use brome street as an example it 's the it 's the coming off those streets in order to avoid traffic jams that that 's where the problem occurs and it 's probably the area where where I actually agree that wreck running us to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in the in the sense of the swiftness and the light touch that that would imply our ally and the important quite a question on page 133 we 're right at the beginning with the introduction and the second paragraph it talks about road freight provides a flexible and dependable benefit to freight operators etc etc is this only about road or is this also about round yeah so the this this is about how we manage question City Council 's roads was obviously we only control our roads we 've made it very clear to the agency 's engine transit agency and kiwirail who obviously on the rail network that we would like to see more Freight on on rail and that was put on our submission on the Cephalon freight plan so we 've made it very clear but we can 't control their own it rip that 's not our network so we this is really how do we respond to freight net does use our roads and and how do we discourage that or it would have thought where you 've got a freight management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the government so wish I I might be wrong because it 's you know but I couldn 't see rail mention once and here no because I 'm solo and I do understand what you just said you don 't need to notice it but what I 'm saying is surely there should be at least some reference to the fact that you know just putting more trucks on our roads as of the answer of managing those roads on our trucks isn 't the answer in fact rail as a part of it but I don 't see any mention it but it 's not it 's about our local I understand it but how our local roads work and how they manage was frayed covered by the greater Christchurch great study the lives that mention in here it is bright study as the as on page three yeah I mean I 'd 142 there 's a specific action right so that 's the question I was asking was this realm into here I couldn 't see it moocher just look at page 14 turning now window say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risotto babies on you I mean it is hard to read these small so it was not it is ok well I 'll take it that it 's there I can 't read that to be frank I 've got new glasses it protects strategic locations from Chris royal complicity double checking in sightings good deal the own anything we can do there is free land use planning to protect areas for for rail obviously we don 't invest and rail that 's that 's qrl so that 's part of the wider greater pleasures concessions by having looking right Pauline I think system known page 139 I see you mentioned we 've had our own internal monitoring and implementation group by 16s and then you mentioned that one of the key deliverables is to establish a freight partners group and was wondering who do your visitor to be on there and what 's the progress and getting us established what 's your time frame sure so the news and translators have just recently established since actual group them and we 've started the team net that 's been quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of freight operators to meet and discuss some issues that they 're having on the trend through christ church group so we don 't already been established on anything that 's been very positive and have you got any idea how the impact of the Western Bypass and reducing some of the frame coming into town with it yeah would it hit quite a feat it will hopeful that long-term the freight trailing from the north of the city through the air for 10 and and onto Ralston and beyond but once again freight that needs to go into the scene from City or into the suburbs we 'll have to use our network all right anyway but ok so we 've moved and seconded that and promotion all those in favor say aye all right those opposed

that you is it right give you got the message Paul gave a very good presentation to council is informally on on Monday and I thought that it would actually be quite helpful in the context of discussing the draft housing policy to actually have the presentation here and the public arena so that there was a general understanding of what we 're seeking to achieve and adopting the draft housing policy okay okay thank you miss me Jonah we could go up bullying does come with me no thank you Miss Mia it will be as per the other day I 'll attempt to run through it expeditiously will you the handouts that Joe is distributing does contain some slightly fuller text on it just for your general information there so without further ado is Joe distribute sense will proceed to run through it hopefully you 'll be able to see the text on the screen there so this idea wise counsel doing it I guess in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grounder policy framework for counsel to act in a more informed way and all the housing spaces across the housing continuance or think about social housing affordable housing and market housing to have a more fuller recognition of context and drivers which will be hardly surprising to most people but it allows us to act and our opinion no more informed way not only to in terms of actions what we do but if we 're advocating to the likes of central government on various legislative matters and so on so forth so recognizing housing and that context is much more of a health and a a community infrastructure matter rather than a strict market good so some of those drivers causes and symptoms I 've been talking about some pretty well-known falling rates of homeownership why is that important because homeownership captures a lot of wealth that most people have that is their wealth it is this stock that is their security so that 's why home and ownership is important as well as affordable rental accommodation as well demography all the adults even the minister of housing does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adults being both cash port and SF poor and the challenges that I 'm that poses clearly directly for us as well in terms of how we rate and maintain and deliver services and those sorts of things employment security school tune aging and mortgages are just referred to so it 's starting to notice increasing number of low-income older and older adults a super annuitants now starting to have to pay off a mortgage so getting that coming through little graph there hopefully you can see that bait that basically is a Troodon to show you the increasing numbers of households at the 40th income percentile and below so the lower forty percent of household incomes paying more than thirty percent of their income on housing costs so we have some slightly more sophisticated ways of measuring that that 's a measure that we had and the crush each housing a court so that should be reasonably familiar to you just another one there on a median household incomes as that sufficient to purchase a lower court or house price at the moment only just if we 're talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is would put you as that 's as good as it gets at the moment and there 's a lot of risk associated with how the worm white tune so I think it 's another signal another flag to be aware of just in terms of some of the wider context here that were doing crush each housing a quarter talked about the district plan as you know regenerate Christchurch taking effect UDS refresh and draft resilience plan we may need to look at refreshing reviewing a social housing strategy and of course there 's the national policy statement on urban development has just come out that the officers are currently preparing a submission for to grief you on very shortly I guess the key themes of our housing policy here is the framework that was talking about using a full housing it 's a new approach recognizing context and drivers and principles of housing adequacy is informed by a human rights type framework so recognizing those sorts of issues so that the whole of community has the capacity and capability to enter in a much more informed way we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I point out the schedule of actions is quite separate so if a council adopts the policy then we can make update and it means the schedule of actions to take to attach to it very easily without revisiting that the core content to the policy so so we would submit to you that that 's a that 's an effective way to go about delivering on the policy we want it to be a living policy a real policy that done something here 's the vision there that i believe the deputy mayor should be quite familiar with all people in christchurch have access to housing that secure safe affordable room and dry there 's the housing continuum diagram was talking about so you can see some of those spaces or segments within social housing affordable housing and market housing and just how we 've tried to delineate or underpin net with a housing adequacy framework and just talking about perhaps watch more assisted in that space in other words what what we and others might do to support people in various accommodation types and perhaps what 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been and quite fairly in many respects are on the market side of things so council for example delivering on its feet as conceding processes and all those sorts of things as district plan review but clearly there 's a lot more space lot more action a lot more public good initiatives that we would submit that council can do and the plaza framework will guide us in a much more effective manner so he goes some of those principles there of a human right security of tenure collaboration quality of life and quality of housing is that this that 's a little bit about on why if you like here goes some of the proposed goals so firstly a demand-driven housing needs analysis to inform our actions so we see this is quite pivotal as a evidential base that we can then build on so what are the real needs going forward around our changing demographics what do we think are going to be a household types our income types and those sorts of things to really start to tailor and incentivize and look forward to what kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remaining goals team to flow off that around knowledge around types of mixed housing an inclusive housing community building the range and types of responses that we can have the acute needs and you 'll see that on the staff recommendation attached to the report that so there 's one around there around homelessness that you 've had some opinion and discussion on before so I 've come to you with an immediate recommendation around that and retained affordable housing as well we see that as as quite important market relative affordable housing is okay but where 's our interest long-term and ensuring that we actually have some longer-term affordable housing so there may well be some quid pro quo arguments around that that we 'd liked you would like to get back to you on that around some of the actions in the schedule so for example if we 're doing rezoning an episode what 's the quid pro quo around that what might be the affordable housing requirements i would like to carry out some investigative work for you and come back to you upon adoption of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here 's the the house she jus let us talking to you about before the schedule of actions so it 's a little bit more detail on that too including evaluating residential housing developments that we 've done so far around our exemplars including investigating measures such as inclusionary zoning to support affordable housing minimizing barriers to deliver affordable housing as well the report does flank some potential new spending so I 've just flick back up to that that slide the other house stuff they 're pretty much most of that challenge against all be can 't be met with an existing budgets okay thus next slide here around potential new spending so that would be new spinning clearly would have to come back to you at annual plan long-term planned time around that so that 's things around giving a wider and full of consideration particularly to social enough and affordable housing when we 're doing things to assist certain types of housing delivery somehow operational policies so would like to be able to review those and assess how well they they can give a much fuller consideration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in those spaces that might come back to you in there we 've tried to flag an airport to you if we gave full effect to some of these measures here it could be anywhere between anything up to between basically zero and five hundred thousand dollars so depending on councils appetite how far it wants to go down this track these sorts of spendings would be discretionary and ultimately rare as well so it 's it 's not like we 'd be seeking to lock you in forever and a day to this but it 's just to be upfront as with you as much as possible about where some of us may lead to so as I say in summary I guess the the key messages is a policy framework for council recognizes wider context and drivers uses a housing continuum approach to address housing issues and sees housing as a wider health and Barrett good not just strictly a market good so opens up a much fuller consideration of the issues in options that we may wish to take and addressing everything cumin smear fun thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to council after a consultation period we would be seeking to do that in September before the universe current term and we can we add that to the recommendations request staff report back to council proposed final housing policy by the end of September with is that sufficient yes Bosnia would be seat would be seeking to report back to achieve earlier that month as well right okay yep yeah we 've got a time frame put down for stakeholder engagement to come to the housing task force and then 315 yeah that 's good I just I just wanted to get us into the habit you 've actually putting dates on the report back yeah yeah yeah I got it I was just wondering we 're working with the the government as well it seems crazy reinventing will recreating the wheel when they are already involved in a house in a the biggest landlord in the country and probably have a pretty good handle on you know what 's needed future proofing and so forth I mean it just seems I 'd hate her to be talking and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely we would absolutely be we already work with them of course on a number of on a number of matters today particularly are on the marketing and the social housing and we 've had some preliminary discussions with them on this work in certainly around the cord funding work that comes funding that 's come through the budget so absolutely we would we will be working to complement each other their economies of scale and design and purchases you know if we move into that area of affordable and so forth that we might be able to gain by working even more closely with I would certainly hope so they for example commissioned to a housing market assessment back in 2013 so we 'd be seeking to work with them to bring that up to date and up to speed okay I Pauline oh thank you your aging and mortgages you are you is your reason to there is a people actually either like mortgage free and then they refinance at an older age as are you finding that or you finding that people are actually taking longer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those things we would certainly expect from a structural point of view if you like delayed entry into purchasing home means it 's going to take longer to pay off I certainly take your possibly your implied point about people trying to access the equally with some small amount of review security mortgages of the like some initial what figures we 've got back from stats New Zealand start to show a small increase so we 're noting several hundred households and the super annuitants low-income households still have some more which is to pay off certainly talking to agencies around town the likes of the city mission the Methodist Mission and the Salvation Army day States that 's between five and ten percent of people coming through the doors would be homeowners so that starting to see that reflected and those accessing the services well and so is there also evidence of a declining number of home ownership and an increasing number of renters I got that ninty yesterday who says very parents through our three instances darling well thank you this is a really good rapport thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the vision statement you 've got the comment that the market alone is not enough I 'm just wondering if you might expand on there because sometimes it could be an assumption with a hesby that it will deliver and I 'm wondering too though that 's my first question my second question is really how much do you think that this policy is actually going to achieve what is an ambitious vision sure if I take your first point Phil make it alone not enough to deliver across the whole range of housing continuum tuna social and for Dublin and market honor I 'm pretty sure that 's not in dispute several commentators including Elijah Sharma will will be very forthright and saying that so the market certainly delivers very well a market level some terms of overall supply meeting overall demand for those who can participate that 's fine doesn 't necessarily address there are the housing needs if you like that relate to social or affordable yes its name ambitious vision but a lot of evidence in the sorts of space is that you shouldn 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge and address something rather than simply manage it so yes we would submit to you there are a number ways that counsel click connect in that public good space to assist in that area assist Paul so I 'm wondering in fact is is this policy really capable of achieving their vision in concert with others we cannot do it alone things be out breath hmm two questions please and just expand your Ali 's point in terms of housing New Zealand how will this also work with the community housing provider just a question clarification you 're talking about the new provider that fits been yes so we 've got kind of three players in terms so this has that all gonna use work together yes so we would we would submit to you that some of us work and our actions that were praising would be of assistance to both of those bodies yes and secondly can you just explain the housing bond guarantees and what how that works sure so that 's something that we would like to investigate a little bit further it 's something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set aside a portion of funding in the budget if you like to see ch Lee act as a guarantor for philanthropic funding so they for example of set aside 6 million and taking into the leverage factor that that allows up to 30 million of philanthropic investment so central at CC X 's and and right in that area so the only being that philanthropic investors recognize that and are happier with a lower rate return to the afore and vest then social and formal housing through the likes of community trust and depend and so on so we 'd like to assess our let 's move they say their underwriting the rent no no writing a a housing development room yeah yep yani yeah i 'm thinking i 'm finna look at you you 've done on that um I know this is going up for consultation if we approve it so changing the priorities and some of the things like inclusionary zoning is best done at the end of this process I would submit so that use we would like to report back to you following some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resignations around there are we able to get or do we hear any information on the lender with free dark what impact that 's had on affordable housing and then what impact its had on actually increasing homeownership or who owns er certainly early days are on that one but I can certainly a team to find out a bit more from colleagues if you 're thinking about what we 've done around the district plain reading for example and then the other question I had was in terms of the I think there 's some research that came out recently in Auckland around actually a lot of the properties that have been sold or actually investors anyway so the idea that we intensify and that we provide more land for housing isn 't actually hoping I 'm owner sure it 's helping people that already own homes owned more homes and make more money off it so is there any work that we 're doing locally around the kind of investment versus the actual home ownership sure this policy would be a way forward to approach structure some overreactions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affordable homes and home ownership rather than anything of a speculative nature okay and then just a final question was we 've currently got a social housing strategy it 's probably got a bit of a misnomer of a nine because it 's actually much more than social housing but what happens to that is that so they 're going to be updated as part of the process is it going to be amended is there another process underway to look at that yes certainly staff are considering and how we go forward with that and the light of the changing social housing landscape so I imagine that there will be a recommendation coming to you shortly about how we address update and refresh next week I guess I was wondering whether as part of us that would be useful to have a resolution so it actually picks up two weeks right my recommendation would be that we come back to you separately it 's a separate matter in my view and David you look I 'm just looking at one a recommendation up there and asking whether it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homelessness I don 't know that we would ever get to a situation where we would eliminate significantly reduce yes but not eliminated I don 't want to live in a city that doesn 't have a goal of eliminating home well you 'd never get me there was the Rope is about around people are out of your say we don 't so the first driver don 't work anyway but we 're not here to debate the outcomes we 're here to debate the adoption of the draft housing policy as part of the adoption they use well I can support one I are we in debate yet no I 'm going to move to debate so bad ask you I 'm going to sort of changing their wording but apparently not no and if you want to move that the word end to eliminate homeless must be removed i don 't think you will find a second is the water all i 'll move an amendment then that we replace that with significant orange juice drive a second up for that yep I 'll second it are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all as one one debate and Glenn would you like to move the motion I yes please I would like to me which would be a good idea to do that before we accepted an immune if I say we do I thought it was going to fail for want of the Second Earth but I was wrong so wait a minute I want a seconder for the resolution that the council was off the draft housing policy yeah so or would you like to know no felt okay so um and and then after which aid counselor is seconded by um hello Jones moved by way of amendment that the words n to eliminate our replaced worth substantially reduce and substantially reduce right reduce yeah cool right so we 'll deal with the the whole debate has one but i 'll invite gleam to start the debate right thank you very much i just wondered whether we could at that diagram of the spectrum up up d if you wouldn 't mind scrolling to it we 've been in a pragmatic space for a long time we 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock we 've taken initiatives over homelessness and i believe he brought the government to the table over there too with the calm care and vision West contracts but we we need a housing plan no one else has come forward for a housing plan for Christchurch and in my view it 's up to us to take the lead on this this really is the culmination of a lot of work the last three years since we we began with the Housing Committee we moved to the housing task force and we 've carried this work through including from Hannah Ross mcalpine actually be in tune and the mayor 's office assisted in the early days with this but Paul is the author of this report I think the spectrum sums up so much of what we can do as a council you know that obviously we that the second largest social housing provider in the country we 've taken initiatives on homelessness as well but we can also have a part to play across the spectrum so it is a big policy that actually grabs hold of housing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seeks to recognize that fundamental right that actually everyone does deserve a roof over the hits that fit that 's a human right then using human rights language if you talk to the HR see these days they talk about adequate housing so that that 's the language they use providing adequate housing we have a huge affordability problem in New Zealand those rates are declining interestingly the Christchurch Youth Council has emailed us all with results of their survey and what 's actually taken them by surprise is the number one a critical issue for them is affordable housing and they 've admitted it 's taken them by surprise as well according to their own survey so what we do for future generations when we 're faced with this here we dream slipping through our fingers do we really want to settle for our becoming a nation of renter 's I encourage you to support this policy over our homelessness just on a why settle for reducing it as much as we can why not go towards eliminating homelessness totally for firstly as a basic principle but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the big overseas cities some of the places in the States you might ask how will they ever eliminate homelessness there Christchurch is a city village it 's quite within our grasp to actually ensure that everyone has an option to have a roof over their heads and through the good work that Vicky and others have done on the team there are more options now to ensure that people actually do have the possibility so let 's not settle for getting as close as you can let 's go the whole way let 's set that target one more thing i might say is that a lot of the work can be met in existing budgets as Paul has said but even if in the next annual plan we move into the area of should we look at spinning up to five hundred thousand dollars that 's surprising the price of one house to give a thick to affordability potentially across the Christchurch market so I encourage you to look at what we also fund out of council budgets and to just open the possibility or be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and be a catalyst for affordable housing in the city I encourage you to please get behind this so to send it out consultation and then wrap this wrap this up in this this term of council the street is a summary of much of what we 've been doing and I think it would be a good piece of work for the council to to have this finished off thank thank you Paul yeah I think it really comes down to having a bold target things if you know without bold targets we we don 't get to we we really need to go I think there 's no one around this table that would deny the fact that would be good to see no homeless people in the city and I 've spoken to a number of the homeless people sitting on the street and interesting just to note how complex the issue actually is it 's not just one size fits all when it comes to homeless and a lot of us around mental health issues some of these ppl makes you want to be in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can lead the way in this area and often it you will find that it will come down to a multi-agency type approach where we can actually lead the charge and bring those other agencies interlined actually helped us achieve the goal so it 's really about starting the process NSSA having bowled targets and being raven and they 're taking the initiative for Danny oh yeah I 'm thank you yeah I think this is a good first step I think it 's really important that we do look at a housing the draft housing policy and we get it out for people to import into interesting enough you know it 's part of the earthquake recovery there was a housing recovery program but it was on the planet didn 't have statutory weight and I think it 's a really interesting it 'll be a very interesting case study to look back and see the idea of rezoning all this land without any inclusionary zoning without any sort of community benefit to see what actually that 's done for us in Christchurch um we have to look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should absolutely set a zero homelessness target and gold and those cancers that were here when we did the central city plan and share an idea that was one of the first things that we put on the board when we heard that after a mess of natural disaster the people that can least afford it they 're an inequitable front of stress and financial challenge because of their existing socioeconomic status so we knew after the earthquake at a very early stage that the impact on the people that at least afford it would be the greatest and I think we have a moral obligation to address that through things like a housing policy and it has taken a wee while but it 's much better late than never interestingly enough and I 've sent ground and made this point when the council decided to fund the refurbishment or the new builder for City mission that n seattle they actually say fifty three percent of the cost to the health and the social service sector by investing in a housing first apartments for what they called a wet Centre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could actually have a place to call home and head wrap around service support and my concern as a city we 're still spending a huge amount of money funding band-aid solutions without actually providing people with a home and with that wreck around support and those services so I hope through this process we can start to have a much more holistic view on on what 's being done the other thing that I just wanted to conclude on is that this should not be our role alone but certainly as a council I think it 's important that we facilitate but we shouldn 't lose sight of the fact of those basic rights that will put up around housing at the start we need to meet with the eqc board we need to meet with the insurers if you talk about having warm and healthy homes we have the greatest opportunity out of any city in New Zealand to have done that in the last five years and certainly in the next few years but time is running out but we need to make sure that we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we do get those warm and healthy homes and we we need to meet with those external partners urgently to make that a really bottom line I think for the earthquake recovery the other thing is that we also have a resolution to make with the cdhb and I think the sooner we do that the better because it 's really clear through my understanding of our social housing that again we 're picking up a huge shortfall and what effectively the government should be funding that that they 're not and we 're having to pick up the people with high psychosocial needs and everyone deserves the right to have housing and I agree that there needs to be housing for everyone but actually we need to actually have a much more coordinated strategy with central government and with the health system about who we r housing and why and what are the appropriate services that we can put around that to make sure that for all the different complicated issues we can address it so I think this is really good let 's get it up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let 's organize those other meetings that we 've asked for that haven 't yet happened so that we can get a common goal we are a signatory to the healthy crush its shadow with a number of those other groups and I think its inherent on us to act as a signatory on that charter around the housing which is a major contributor to people 's well-being and go Freddie yeah I just yeah I 'm sorry but adopt the draft housing policy which is actually in there surely we 're approving a draft policy for consultation we 're debating this now yes I know but I think there 's a problem with the wording of it yep it 's fine debate it Oh Sees an amendment we 're in debate we 're not other positions have gone beyond fun let it go let it go yep yep so just in relation to the oh sorry look Jimmy I call booth there 's no can I 'm sorry um no no no yeah Jimmy oh thank you get here sorry a federal council and as I supported to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the food clothing transport in housing this a fundamental needs everyone 's equal opportunity not to assess these are basic in the fundamental needs what I support is when you be reviewed the house in there are continuing we can see this actually is why the scope not only the marketing house is maxing out in space on the market you 're the mayor supply whether you you know can afford or not marketer to refactor however you know we need to consider not only the market the issue in considered community no social economic environment this kind of factors rather rather than just mocked in the issue so affordable and also social housing this kind of the scope but in here particular focus on if affordable in social housing council need to take into account you know to pay our responsibility why i support the lister kinda dropped the housing policy because it is all responsibility we established this policy we go to the consultation try to you know get a feedback from the community from the society how do we do integrated together all those the resources to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topless one my view you know we another pair always possibility so that 's where we the crucial and also this palace actually is provided a kind of the framework especially if we review the kind of divisional all people in partership assess the housing they secure safe affordable one in the tribe now to reach the people but poor people so the medium and also low-income people also are opportunity to assess this one so the that 's very important to based on this the kind of framework we can guide we can inform the council of activities and integrate all those the community private sector carrying the together so i think that 's important the otherwise we 're over where we will put into the in here now the kind of info objectives ido from this and the opportunity our sister home article we get the information from this siiii you know Eva Hamilton the City Council can make it happen why the quieter City Council we cannot make the paper but actually you know they are partnership with the community a moment based on their the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know is the homeless the person they did this quit the job is also the Hamilton the case you know to be the elderhood model so I ergy the mail my fellow council we supported is the policy we they are always possibility thank you okay um I like the continuum that 's here we are in fact doing almost all of these things now and in one form or another the emergency homeless is happening in christ church regularly there are at the moment about to deportees a week coming from australia that powers are dealing with and they come the last one last week came for his offense was driving while disqualified was picked up put on the island for 55 days and which is unbelievable punishment having served this time and then deported to christchurch these people need help and support they are arriving in the city with none and they need somewhere to live so so fortunately in christchurch there is a good range of social agencies as well because i was talking to taro me the other day who are trying to deal with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i think some of house new zealand houses with no city mission and without the array of social services that we have traditionally had here at so we get emergency housing issues all of the time social housing and thank God we have kept and if there are any lessons that we should learn from Auckland it 's never to let your housing get into the situation where they are currently facing because I simply don 't know what the answers are in Auckland but here the situation is we can deal with it we know the number of homeless and and it is completely doable with if people want a home it is absolutely beholding upon their community to ensure that there is a place that they can move so eliminating homelessness I think is incredibly basic but there is way more than that supported assisted rental we 've done already as a trial with the Methodist Mission we 've also created within them as welfare fund a fund such that if people can 't get into our social housing or has in New Zealand we can actually provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them into a private house and there are a range of initiatives particularly for people with children who should never even be contemplating sleeping in car or anything any city should be able to deal with that in terms of the development of additional housing obviously we 've done that in a in a joint way in terms of our last two exemplars from our own social housing unit and developing more social housing will be a two-way hybrid project between both the City Council which will do it and the new chip which gets 50 million dollars of land eventually transferred and so that it can also develop more social housing the developments we 've done have actually included social and affordable housing riccarton includes the Riccarton racecourse development includes thirty percent affordable our tier houses they are selling the cheapest houses that our tier 4 2 bedroom new house as 350k meadowlands includes affordable housing ownership housing so I think while we set bold targets it 's really really important that we important that we put the considered action around it as well so I like the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think I mean we have looked at trying to make all of the new development six star and in the district plan we tried to make that part of the requirements that was turned down it is really important liquids like Community Energy Action continue to be able to do the amazing work that they are doing but there is a huge shift happening in Christchurch encrusted and new zealand new zealand more pronounced in christchurch but it also very pronounced view and that is the ship from ownership to rental and the idea that people can never own their own home and the increasing percentages of young people particularly who will probably never own their own home is really disturbing and that 's the issue that we need to get into that is an issue that local government as I think never been in in New Zealand I think it 's a very legitimate area for us to pilot to start and one of the very very initial discussions that we 're having with government and it 's about the possibility of using the money that has left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for our a shared ownership scheme you 'll be aware that in Scotland and in the UK probably the Scottish one it 's a really good model they have a model where you can buy between thirty percent and ninety percent of your house and another entity wall but usually a another contributor will buy the remainder that would be an organization that helps you by their house you pay and a rental on their part and you own some of it and you work towards owning all of that or you can sell it and invest in another one but it means for example if you 're buying a four hundred thousand dollar house and prestige at the moment your deposit will be eighty thousand for young people to actually save 80,000 if their parents are not contributing is hugely difficult and so what we could do is drop that dramatically such that they could get into a house with the help of an organization that would in this case what we 're looking to do is use government money that make it very local to Christchurch to pilot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get in with a lot less money than that and owned and treat that house own that house and effect they would be responsible for all of the things that you 're responsible for when you own the house but it does enable them to feel secure and to actually benefit from any capital growth in that house as well so we are working in a very very preliminary way with the government to try and make that possible so that we are effectively across the entire spectrum in one form or another anyway there are more things that we can do and one of the things we may want to consider doing as the investigation of development contributions for housing that is either classified as portable or social I like the fact that we actually have a policy which is not a sentence I say often but i like more that there is an action plan that flows from it I think there will be a whole lot more actions that aren 't here but it 's a start point that means that we work across the spectrum because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to have homeless or we want to have the situation where people are looking at a lifetime without owning their own house I think that 's something that we wouldn 't wish on our kids and it 's not certainly something I wouldn 't wish on anybody else 's kids either if they want to are in their own house I think as a community we can find ways in which we can do that there are ways around the world and which that 's been done and I think with every certainly is a Christchurch community incredibly creative about particularly using the government 's money to make that happen thank you um I 've 10 yeah yeah yeah I 'd like said I support the strategy and I think actually it 's very important to have a strategy because if you don 't have a strategy you end up with ad hoc responses which i think is what we 've had over the last couple of years and it 's very difficult to actually pin down and work out what we 're doing as accounts will have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the chip primarily I think to access the IRS and wait anyway but not yeah but not without a clear strategy because we 're just getting one so it 's interesting i go back to the end of 2013 and i look at the 10-point strategy that we delivered and i remember talking to Glenn about this which was actually okay know what are the outcomes that we 're looking for and we came up with the reviewing at council housing assets partnering with external organizations to build new housing which we haven 't done and review council housing strategy and I think it 's really important to have this stuff actually nailed down so we actually know what we 're doing because then we can actually work out well what are the outcomes we 're looking for and then we can develop the strategy to deliver that so I think this is good piece of work I 'm interested in a lot of the rezoning stuff the housing bond guarantees actually how we build new houses for people which are affordable warm and accessible and I think once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are I mean I know super ACC they 're dying to get into this and they want to take a long-term leases we can change the way we structure tendencies so that actually there much longer if we look at the German model people don 't own houses you don 't need to own your home you just need to have security of Tennessee and I think also the homeownership piece has driven a lot of the speculation around housing where capital growth is actually part of the whole deal was actually in some countries that 's not a big deal its actual about living somewhere and having security of tenure so I think now that we have a strategy we can actually start to have these conversations about what is the best way to deliver housing and I think we 'll get some interesting solutions out of that have felt um look I want to think be in Livingston because I was at the housing summit four years ago the Glen lead and i think that the pot the draft policy which we have today is a as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's been done and i think looking back to in pullman and your staff but for a huge amount of work done to get to the state and it 's very timely that we deal with this today an infant so it off because we 're clear from the media and just our own observations that there 's no question at the moment of new zealand and housing is the biggest single issue facing our country and it 's as has been covered that the lack of housing has lead to higher none of mortgages and unaffordable rents and that 's also one of the biggest factors contributing to child poverty in our country and it is also happening unfortunately our city too we see the anecdotal evidence and I inhale in fact poor housing terribly affects children 's health and and I personally spoke to a family very recently who have a couple with four children they had an old three-bedroom house and with the two adults but the living in this one house but there was no installation at all in the ceilings or the walls and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they were not allowed to use and so they 're entirely dependent on expensive heaters no heat pump or anything like they 're so the point is though that the impact poor housing impacts on the functioning of any family and we need to ensure that we as a council also take a share of responsibility to have housing warm and dry in safe because clearly fits the health determinants not only of our city but of the whole country and they have to be met at some stage 2 so the point that in fact this is a crisis is absolutely real and it I 'm pleased that through our policy were addressing I 'm totally happy to support the policy what I like to see given us given the seriousness of the situation is that when the draft comes back that we look in fact at how we can invest more into our social housing so then fact we get the results which you really need and I applaud the efforts that have been made today yeah I just wanted to clarify to unfortunately because I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopting the draft housing policy and the resolution primarily because i don 't think we should ever be adopting a draft housing policy before that policy goes out for consultation so unfortunately i won 't be able to support their to drug and i will it says adopt the draft housing policy up raise doing before if it was worded approve the consultation on the draft housing policy i would be more than happy to support it oh if the mover and seconder of the resolution are willing to change the phrase that the council approved the draft housing policy for consultations then it would still chief exactly the same purpose so the mover and seconder are happy with that I 'll just get those with using I 'm easy with that yeah I am provided what 's clear we mean business in this as a draft policy yeah but it does not that unconcerned about know the adoption of it before it 's become so give it its adopting a draft but yeah so and I don 't actually think that the meaning changes so which is why I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few of both hippie I will change the wording from adopt to approve the draft housing policy for consultation with the following amendments yeah yeah yeah but I wanted to speak so and so I 'm going to and the I guess that what I wanted to add and and I actually think the debates been an incredibly helpful one and I think everyone has contributed different components to the issues that any city confronts but we more particularly than any other city in Christchurch because of the unique set of circumstances that we find ourselves own i guess that my disappointment and it 's not around this table as the view that is expressed that central government is responsible for every aspect of our health and well-being and of course housing is a poor critical part of the health and well-being of our community and I guess the question that I 've got us have we learned absolutely nothing from our experience of the earthquakes because if we 'd waited and said that central government 's responsibility to look after us after a disaster we 'd still be waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Maori wardens who actually came from all around the country they worked hand-in-glove with community associations they worked hand-in-glove with the Red Cross they worked with anyone who came and it wasn 't a question of whose job of was in fact we didn 't actually ask that question whose role is this it was who can do what to help in a time of need and what everyone says about the post-earthquake environment was that the silos came tumbling down do you remember that phrase the silos came tumbling down all of a sudden it didn 't matter what department you worked for whether you work for the council what part of the council you work for every single staff member and the council took up a civil defence role they changed what they did because of the circumstances and excuse me did someone say that there 's a housing crisis so if there 's a housing crisis why wouldn 't the silos come tumbling down why wouldn 't we actually get who can do what together make it happen and I really love what Paul said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own in fact it couldn 't be done on our own we couldn 't do it on our own we can only do it in collaboration with central government and with the NGO sector who obviously have a great interest but more importantly in partnership with the communities that we 're talking about because if we don 't do this and partnership with our communities then we 're actually telling people it is someone else 's responsibility but actually it 's something that we have to do together silo thinking means we say unless the savings come to the specific contributor then they have no role to contribute and in yannis point was that eliminating homelessness the benefits go to the health system or they go to the prison system or they go to the social welfare system so all of the benefits accrue to the agencies that do not fund housing I remember Helen Clark when she was the prime minister reflecting on her time as the minister of health which was actually quite a short period of time in the late 80s but she said that she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of housing for the health benefits that are produced and if you can 't see past the silos that actually divide us and actually bring them down to respond to what our wicked and complex problems then you know I sort of kind of struggle to think how we are going to get beyond the variety of issues that we still have to deal with us a city so I 'm really pleased to see this draft housing policy go out for consultation I agree with everyone who spoken about the opportunities that it represents for bringing others on board because this is not something that any one of us can do a line it 's only something that we can do collaboratively with others so I really congratulate you Paul and the team that and Glenn for leading the housing task force that has brought this to the table so thank you very much so on that motion I 'll put the amendment so the amendment is to change the words to eliminate to the words substantially reduce and so i 'll put that motion the amendment all those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I that 's lust do you want to record your boats yes so how many people voted for the amendment to destroy so too so David East and Eddie Jones and i 'll put the i 'll put the substantive motion all those in favor say aye as opposed they know that 's carried unanimously thank you thank you very much and on that basis I a June for morning tea and if we could reconvene at five past 11","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Report,9oEfjlLw6Ac,20160622,630.97,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1689,now we move on to the chief executives reports FSU and thank you and given that so close to the end of the year there 's not a lot of new information and the report but just highlight that in the last month and particular there 's been a focus on the levels of service performance to ensure that we 're meeting our targets and expectations by year-end we 're on target to meet eighty-five percent with a forecast tracking it currently around eighty eight point five percent operating expenditures trekking well below budget due to a number of things that operational savings higher revenues and such as fee to see this around resource consider lenders and pens in dta subsidies our increased trends weight dividend which have known about but also lease expenditure around things such as they lower debt servicing and lower borrowing listen the original budget capital expenditure yes they still well behind budget as a has been tracking the year but actually we 've probably had one of our better months in terms of capital expenditures and the growth over the year has actually increased as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through our capital expenditure and we hope to sit before we walk expect to see they continue in the months ahead as well so I 'm open for Christians around the report if there 's anything in particular to warp drive any questions are Jimmy oh thank you yeah on page 26 health and cept issue I know you have another the item you know iska DC but I 'm just concerned a abuse with in assault you know in may compared to April increased a lot what salvation air whereas due to restructuring all and also the weather are regarding to the are the kind of serious harm not have any affected by this abuse or assault and get it so there is another item as you know and yeah yeah of course d we 've really focused on increasing reporting yes around these things then particularly around abuse region assault and so some of our front line people were affected by that some of the work that 's on hand as well as that principles of parking warden wardens now have you know the little videos so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a significant consumer would actually report that directly to a place so some of us about this proportion but some of it is about our frontline staff constantly at risk of abuse and incidents that consume okay thank you okay have felt um thank you Karen I just want to ask you on page 19 in terms of the operational results and you referred to but favorable money 's coming in from hi NZTA operating their subsidies I just want to ensure that given that some verra cycleways projects have required further consultation that in fact we 're not going to be behind in terms of receiving the NZTA subsidies through the air group the government given cycleway fun doesn 't make sure that if i might ask day to respond to that i 'm pretty or a dozen as part of our relationship with NZTA we talk to them about the cat farm where those projects are going so there are we love year it actually doesn 't change the approvals that we 're given and us the ability to put a PEC slightly so no it 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um yes I had a question over the abuse street and assault as well I 'm sorry I found that a little hard to hear so forgive me if I 'm repeating something that 's a massive jump that 's the jump and I heard what you said about reporting increasing but I says the reporting only just started to be encouraged or because to go from 2 to 14 and to have 14 which is nearly half what was the total for the previous year reporting period is significant so I just I needed a bit more on that look I think it 's a combination of things I think it is about better reporting and because we now track it but i think it is also that you know people are stressed and there 's a lot more of an appropriate behavior that particular frontline staff seeing and experiencing right okay thank you clean well thank you i just noticed the number of legume o requests for may amounts to about two a day it was there any one particular issue its many from I think residence is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see elected members in that group yeah I 'm not sure that 's better but there 's only one that 's actually not elected member normally to member yes i know these are a range of things and so I see all the Laguna 's sometimes from residence through about personal things so if they 've had issues around the consenting process or concerns about other things that they 're working with the council on that have been prime armed often they are they 'll want for all the information that we have on that sometimes it 's round excuse me decisions that have been made I am people wanting a better understanding of power decisions are made but it 's a huge variety of things that people ask for more information sometimes we don 't doesn 't need to go through the legume er sometimes it 's better for that to happen network that way we make sure that we 've covered off all the information as opposed to providing just a response back around what we think is happening sometimes asking for technical information doesn 't give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking right and sometimes it 's better to treat her as a gamer request even though somebody might have rung up and said I want such and such even though it 's not counted on the terms of Alabama request if it 's a holistic view that 's required I mean one of the one of the elected members one but they were actually asked to use the Guam ER because they were simply asking the same questions that were being asked by another organization that was going through legume on and it was better to join it all up so that you didn 't have you know one side of council not not responding or actually duplicating work because if you go through the chief executives office and then it 's already being dealt with all of the informations being collated by the legume ER team it 's just crazy not to include the the council you say why don 't want it context visa V their graffiti bit fire yeah yeah all looks not only a report coming but just just with the recent gas man clothes they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confusion from both a cannon and our response to that odor do we have some clarity on that day as to where they with a problem horizon and has it been confirmed so so nothing 's been confirmed Eakins as I understand it Eakins information and their detectors interdicted a round of an area around the wastewater treatment plant but our staff with Iran the day and tested the plant and couldn 't find a source from the plant itself so we also staff that previously worked for a cannon this area around the broad area and they found that the odor that he up wind from the plant so I think there 's no specific answer but clearly we 're looking at everything that we do around the wastewater treatment plant to make sure that that we don 't contribute to any of that in the future does it give you some like and work down on you know because I 'm so something the strong is closing a school or two noises is quite a concern so it would be good to identify if possible even if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have originated from here so we checked all about our plants and the facilities that we have out that way and didn 't find it as a source of the odor so we can only continue to do the work we 're doing around those particular facilities he can of course has responsibility for finding the source so we 're working closely with them but there wasn 't a specific facility or site identified appalling or just a really quick question on on page 23 when you 've got your snaps in solve incident type and I see that graffiti well the last couple of months were quite high it goes up and down a bit but we 've also got the graffiti hotline so is there a comparison to our people moving towards snaps in solve or they using both or deceive any being done or need it be quite interesting to see um I haven 't made any comparison we do know that online and epstein solders actually increasing whether that 's increasing the number of complaints overall as opposed to you know cannibalizing one on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some other areas people more likely to use online and things like States next insult as opposed to bringing the complete line yeah I think quite interesting to see how many are using the hotline as well yeah we could we could done that could just element quite eat into cheek thank you all right I 'll move

Part 4,tHSyCrUoTJs,20160621,2436.46,"Christchurch, New Zealand",6248,"the amendments on the table early enough for us to consider them but we have I think worked through the amendments that counselor Johansson has has raised and so I propose that we just go through them one by one and then we can deal with the block and but although what what I should do is just deal with number one first so the first one is that we receive for shal i deal with the amendments because I 've got it we 've got to go back to now we 've got to consider the amendment space and then we then we some resume standing orders that right I guess so so could we have fun councillor yo Hansen 's amendments up and I will propose an alternative way we 're dealing with some of them and if that is acceptable they can just be written into the main amendments so sorry i 'll just trying to find them here they are so the first one is in relation to if it has specific to adult swim this one 's here sorry its specific did you send them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a number of amendments in relation to swim while they 're swimming pool entry fees and endorse fees for community you so that 's in relation to our recreational facilities that 's my suggestion that rather then accept something that would put 0.14 percent on rates and take us over the five percent my suggestion is that we request that further work be done on entry fees for swimming pools and recreational facility hire recreational facility court higher by the end of October and that will enable the uncommon Council to consider whether they wish to adjust the swimming fees before summer and it enables a proper consideration of the impact of the court higher charges so if that 's acceptable to you can 't see your handsome then I will add that as a recommendation 3 under fees and charges swimming pools can I besides the clarification stuff are we actually able to make changes to the fees and charges outside of the nufn process we have to come to a resolution and I mean we don 't need to go through a separate SCP to consult with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're just happy safe creepy this essentially is one we prepared it isn 't the seams of the million question is if we reviewed entry fees and charges captain October would we were out to amend them during the year yes yes wonderful without an entry fee without any consultation you 'll have to go through a process i think it is yeah they were a cutie depending on how significant that decisions i think you would look at consulting with people who might be interested in or affected by the decision the way of good process and so so who 's like irreducibly oh so do you think we need to go through an SCP to do an amendment to the annual plan fees and charges or just call it end all caught hi I 'm rid of the recreation no I don 't think so yeah that 's without the information in front of me but no I don 't think I think you would be able to comply with section 82 that consultation principles without doing a special consultative procedure but I don 't we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in from the date at which that report women so if it came back on october first we can establish so sweet and it 'll be at the end of october ok well the symbol first yeah we could back the principles we could establish the face from the date of that report coming back not at the next financial um like I don 't often I hear that don 't see any reason why not but I see Miss brandish looming say I get anything that I 've said I see this green dish looting of losing i think is the statement of the day I 'll see whether we 've got the same comments sew ins ins commenting on the legal ability to introduce it obviously what it would do is we 'll change the expected revenue within the budget line and so there would be a gap to budget from any change assuming net change to something in the same order and is currently proposed or even said good but it could give an opportunity to organize a trade-off then where you might save some money somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right it would if we didn 't already have plenty of savings to achieve open the budget we might get more people going crazy it also puts up costs yeah operating costs so that my decisions novel fees and charges can be made in the and in the 2016-17 year I mean the thing is is that I would feel a lot more comfortable having been through quite an extensive process on this rather than put take our rates increase our average rates increase over the five percent I 'd rather actually that we 've got some more work done on it and not former view about what that final position will be until we 've got the detailed analysis of what the trade-offs can be because I 'm sure there are savings within that budget that could be applied in this area and I was very mindful to perfect that the DHB did make a strong recommendation on swimming for chapters and obviously from a health perspective and wanting to work in a collaborative way with the health sector as well as with central government I think it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice on from them as well yeah the other thing is the indoor court face so I mean I 'm really mindful you know if you think of T up or how cheap it is to rent there we 've had the sporting groups come and say through the submissions that are concerned at the increase and the impact that that has on people is that here got until court fees as well give it the fees are gonna go are right so and then we 're going to consider reducing them later I just wondered whether we could wake it up auto why would you wait to the end of October that 's all I think we just need a very good report on it because of its our operational costs going up we we do have to get a balance to keep within five percent and I really want to see the information because courts and the seats are easy you 've got so many courts that can only be hired out for a certain period of time so you 've got a maximum rental but there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polls are the sign but a lot less a lot more fluid if you like but i think the full report would be really important for to make a decision yep can I make a suggested changing to the wording just around the the date because I think the intention would be that the report come back to council by the end of October which would allow a decision to be made before the opening of the the summer cools so request that further work is done on swimming pool entry fees and indoor cause higher fees and er rip and this be reported back to council by the NIH over 2016 day because that would allow us to make a decision of the last council meeting in October which allows any changes that you decided that means may be implemented for the summer pool it may not be meeting in October all I do know the caskets they have to wait I mean you could be looking at the same look we make a decision that 's what I was trying to think they 'll be better well I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fits all let 's go yeah he doesn 't reply I 'm happy for that yeah I I do think I mean we did get some initial advice on it but I still think there 's a major issue in our community around we don 't have a complete holes system at the moment we have a huge pressure on our indoor space but we also need to make sure that it 's affordable for those groups to use so well why are we doing this is the last minute I know it 's not consumers all I 'm doing and you know you know all i 'm doing is rewarding bad behavior so there we go the next one is that an able be added to the council strategic asset list and my recomendation here is that we add on a request to the chief executives list of requests which is somewhere right here is us so put at the bottom that prepare advice on whether counsel shareholding and enable should be added to the strategic assets list so that we 're asking the chief executive to report back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that without a report and without any advice from our officers as to the impact of that decision and yeah so that was that 's that 's that one so if you 're good with that then we can do that if you 're not good with that then we 'll have a vote on nothing it 's just add in a report back oh please if I prepare advice America shall be added to the street and report back by the end of the end of 2016 what there 's this work going on at the moment yani and you know perfectly well because you 're sitting on the CC HL board and I just rather leave it like that at the moment if that 's all right oh yeah thank you i have a question over this over with a kind of on the counter to it was advice along the same lines ever taken when s certain assets were removed from the strategic assets list consulted on it last year we were on to expand we consulted on assets full stock but we didn 't actually consult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office we did that was the particular focus of the long-term plan public engagement the consultation document made it crystal clear that the majority of us felt that there had to be a discussion about what was strategic and what was not it was a whole element in there and the consultation document says what strategic what 's not an infected even had the reference to the some of the the report that we had done on on what made an asset strategic and what made it not strategic so that was the whole purpose of the engage when it actually came down to it just came down to a straight-out vote do you want to take these off or not we didn 't go down this path of asking for a report but the other side of the equation yeah I know that but one of your colleagues has moved an amendment and I 'm asking whether this is sufficient to deal with the amendment and is that sufficient for you jaani so can I just check on the point that was made because okay you want more advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the staff advice back to it to that submitter on their submission that we consulted on us in the LTP and took it off the strategic a seedless no so the similar through this process said could you could you realist as a strategic SN so we would have had some advice back I can 't find it and the stuff that we got seen around her but I presented would have been some advice around the advice would have been simply that we consulted on it just last year and we didn 't indicate in the consultation document this time that we were going to amend it in fact we had no amendments to our strategic a setlist as part of our proposed amendments that we went and consulted on that 's fine but people can suggest that we put things back I mean that 's not that 's part of the democratic process so it suggests we take all I 'm saying is really good to have some advice to go back to that submitter over what 's happened but that 's fine i 'm happy to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that and I think that 's sensible I don 't think it needs to wait to the end of 2016 but if you want that just as a safeguard that 's fine yeah I think it is important that we do get if I stay on it and that we do you can consider it as a strategic asset and posting the submissions that we 've heard I 'm happy for us instead of a process that does that thank you now the next one we don 't have agreement on at all so I 'm simply going to put up to a vote that link has two part be added to the council strategic asset list so those who are and it 's probably easier if we just have a hand boat yeah suppose we 'll just be clear what it is is it the ground of Lancaster park is it the field upon you know which is the area known as link as deposit the buildings there that 's what we own at Lancaster Park be added to the council strategic a setlist so it 's the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think she 's really uncomfortable where she I 'm not stop an amendment it 's been moved and I 'm hoping my recommendation is that we vote against it that 's my recommendation to the meeting so those who are in favor of adding lancaster park and its present unto the form and let 's do the council 's strategic asset list because they think it 's a strategic asset put up your hand those opposed abstentions I 'm abstaining thank you that 's lost and that Ashmore mole Street be added to the street renewal program for the 2016-17 financial year do we want a comment comment on that from staff stop a big enough to have a look at Ashley moles changing it wouldn 't actually hit on a high priority list of us treats you would get so if you decided that way basically it would fund another drop but basically looking there in the condition of those words we 've got a lot of roads out there with beef dish channels a lot of roads and widen so basically it would mean somehow something that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the agenda for the priority to be given to earthquake damage and then back budget is where it 's going met doesn 't even have a national streets had its earthquake damage repaired is that correct yeah that CSU has got four different types of curve and channel it floods and it 's stagnant yes Skeeter so I 'm not going to take any debate on it because um we 've overlooked all God 's streets like this and oceans and some now okay so the question I 'd I just want to ask a question no no I want you to move there I 'm heavy chauffeur who seconds up it 's failed for the want of a seconder okay can I deny Christian on the curb in channel 1 no you can 't because that 's dealt with now we 've got a distress just dealt with your amendments good Yanni we are in this position because everyone agreed to submit their amendments on Friday and at the very latest yesterday you have put these amendments on the table at the last minute this was now the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amendments but you really have let down the entire team today by doing this and it could have been dealt with as a as a proper part of the process but you have chosen to do it your way that 's fine I 'm dealing with it so now we move on to lynnwood woolston pool and the proposal here is rather than putting money on the budget before we 've got a site selection completed that we pass a resolution as part of the standard amendments that is a matter of priority the high-level scope and site selection including community consultation will be completed by the end of the calendar year and a report provided to counsel for bringing forward funding for the project no no no if this is acceptable if this is acceptable it will become part of this I mean much substance what effect does this have on our on our budgets and on this doesn 't have an effect on our budget because the work program deals with the high level scope and site selection process to be commenced now so there are David can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the reality and we 've got the metro in that area we 've got the selfish so it 's actually getting that resources to deliver that I think maybe we 've got people from Rick it would have to go upstairs we don 't do it all for its you 're about justice so we doesn 't even really diverse not exactly that you 're taking our place so it 's the opposite of what Dave 's just told us so that the real side we talk about the operations that 's the question oh yes thats what is the money that 's already allocated there for now as it 's around 40 what do you wanna do so what 's that actually tagged for what does it for consultation and scope good eyesight well I said I 've got is that we are trying to work through a high level spoke document to decide what it is and then that would then be able to say then you can select a certain a variety of sites so you 're already doing a high level scope yeah yeah we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're undertaking it currently and you 've got the funding basically it 'll come from sport and ripping when I say score and workout involve fully in the Metro in the short term probably but under the neck no I 'm not sure we can 't do the song like if he 's already money they 're wanting to northern Sicily except to work so not bad okay let 's move on you know this is we just find out actually yes what would be achievable then so we by the end of the financially yeah could we get a report on a timeline it 's this one 's yeah um so so what why don 't we say here that is a matter of priority staff prepared a timeline for scope site selection community consultation but that the council commits to bringing forward funding for the project when it 's ready to go so that we 're making a commitment now that we 're going to put the money on the budget at the time that the project is ready to go but we want to create a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that there 's a feeling and linwood Wilson and I 'm you know both Paul and yanni have have really made the case for thus that that other pools are getting a priority over this and this was a priority before the earthquakes you know and it was very much so I think I 'll sign the petition myself and I was an MP so we don 't feel like the Southwest one is getting ecology over this at all no it 's all Swiss Pegasus busy we 've got an incredibly incredibly challenge no no no oh you know a big Tony finding that and at end of the limitations of facilities this needs to be achievable yeah I took what about the timeline is and counted that calendar year something yeah yeah so we 're gonna mention timeline bus releases yeah to grips with a project prepared charm is not a high-level scopus art section we 're bringing forward funding for the project yep look I think I can support this and I 'm assuming from staff comments at worst they can do this I 'm mindful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think staff with a huge amount of room there down and started and indicated in fact this will put them may put them under pressure gathered that they can do this but I think it 's really important to be mindful the huge amount of work that our staff have done and the preparation of this annual clean we were told that it wasn 't to do with money and it was so yeah but excuse me excuse me I 'm not having a debate about it so are we good with the phrasing here we just have to approach is a meta version there is a measure of urgency rather than priority then measure of agency yeah can I just get clear on that that doesn 't push anything else download down the priority list no this is the timeline free calls it we 're working on how many here run David Koepp we 've got the Metro we 've got Easton we 've got all be sitting in the air already at this point in home mr. Bailey so yeah Mary 's definitely been communicating that there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the work that is currently active the the proposal have been able to prepare a timeline for the high level Scott and site selection probably excluding the community consultation and bring that back for endorsement and critical by council so they know when the works going to be occurring and when we can start funding at work would be achievable including community consultation with the net phrase up there 's adds another well it 's including the process for community rotation so it 's not actually just consulting on the time line but actually Graham making sure that that we can see in the timeline how and when the community will be engaged in the process because there was a sense that we could go to the community once rather than twice yeah you know because and the eastern sport and Rec we 've gone for site selection we 've gone for scope you know and they 're sick prick consultations and we use different processes and then that created an issue so I think it would be quite good if we could bring the two together so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time yeah thanks for that clarity yeah hope so can I just be really clear that doing this does not in any way impact on the speed of the other leg order the delivery of the southwest Felicia center this would have to be new and additional work and not be impacting on the current workplace so so you can actually give that guarantee because you don 't actually know because this is a lot that 's just so we 've got money on budget Potomac capacities yeah there 's money on budgetary yeah well starve the other people put my favorite star kisses yep if this funding attached to this to be able to complete the work yeah me die okay all right so that 's that one and the last one was the oh just appeared there was a sebacean superfluous services money or give you have sort of being done but the council result operation operational funding support that limb whatever new transitional community called now we didn 't actually know how much money that was but is that something that you should you could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount that the community board and put poured its funded in last few years of ten tails and we could find there right so there 's off advices that that 'll be thirty thousand dollars per annum so it 's gone up from 10,000 to third so I 'm just reading the advice back from the council staff and response the community board submission should council supports level service the rivet solution should not indicate a potential contract or a type of organization it will require counsel to set aside 30 thousand dollars per annum so yeah I 'm just going to say we have we have the same situation here Pegasus with the the two-dollar ball and we fund an area where they re all right so it 's at I 'm gonna have to ask you to move at yarny yeah dover seconder officer paul i will put the motion all those yeah sorry excuse me if i could put a comment on with the the funding approach that occurring at the moment of if council is an operational grant to a facility effectively contractor grant the type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what occurs dramatically shifts and it shifts into the count ability that the standards of how those services delivery and I what you can do is generally only then when you 're dealing with it the funding it was volunteer organization and so so the differences between doing the community board ground round as demo from taking over operational funding ago so thank you that 's very timely advice so my recommendation to Council is that we do not accept this amendment so i will put that motion all those in favor of your hand oh right and right so that 's lost so that then brings us to Linda Oh with you we signed this one although yeah yeah yeah that one 's fine that goes into the standard amendment now I just need some assistance here do we do we now vote on the on the amendments or doing Stevens 's no woofer yeah do we resume standing orders in help me do we resume standing orders we 've considered the amendments or do we need me to put them collectively yep yeah resume standing orders and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receives the information included an attached to the staff report so all we 're going to do now today is number one and number two so we 're going to receive the information included and attached to the staff report and we are going to adopt the mayor 's recommendation set out an appendix B and that is where we stopped because the rates impacts still has to be worked out and clarified and we still need to get the Audit Office report so that will come back to the meeting on Thursday and will conclude all of the other items on the agenda is first up so we 'll just a journalist meeting until we know more later amendments accepted no no no you can 't you know they 're all dealt work so I 've moved and ref has seconded the staff recommendation so can we go a questions but when we asked when we have asked questions we 've been through all of this we agreed a process yeah we agreed a process that we would have a deal ya know but just in terms of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assuming the stuff but we 've done nothing but discuss this for the last few weeks but I made a loss time so in terms of levels on I just wanted to check because one of the criticisms that was made to process was the response back to a neutral submitters so I just wanted to check if we 're receiving the information that we 've been seen around the staff response to go back to the submitters in more detail and also there are a number of submissions that have been made that aren 't captured in the staff response and with a dog and individual response yani we agreed a new process around how we were going to report there that we didn 't want the we were having a general report back through the this time rather than specific to each individual one because they weren 't that yet that that was that we agreed a process we also agreed that we would review the process which we are in the process of doing at the moment and all of you have been sent a questionnaire which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope you all have folded on I 've certainly filled mine on and I know that guy Keenan and some of the team are going to meet with some community representatives tonight to get some community feedback on the process that we used and I think Pauline raised us on her comments and I thought they were quite good that we 've we probably need to get a balance between the standard way and the new way so that we can actually encourage a wider range of people to engage in ways that are suitable to them but also have a standard submissions process as well so it 's kind of learning as we going but I think we 're we 're on track but I remember receiving a letter back from the council telling me how my individual submission had been dealt with in the past and it told me nothing we want to engage a lot more clearly with people and give them some feedback I think the amendments that we moving will actually change the nature of what out what we report back to people quite significantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and requesting further reports or amendments to the bank I think this has been a really much better process than the first annual plan process anyway so I 'm in the end can I we have made that change that we discussed beforehand and your amendments with regards to the dcs i just before we adopt it yes yeah can we just make sure that they 're mean they 're so can you scroll scroll through yep so if you could just highlight number because we did make an another amendment ins and as I said some people have made so some minor technical amendments to wording without changing anything fundamental but this one asks for some work to be done on development contributions here it is so review the council 's rates postponement policy to ensure the current criteria and conditions are fit for purpose and consistent with the policies primary objective to assist older residents on fixed incomes manage the rates liabilities and investigate whether this is appropriate also for development contributions for the traditional granny flesh thank you and that has picked up two things one as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rates postponement policy that actually it 's too hard for people to access something which actually could be made a much much simpler and much more accessible and that picks up the dc 's on the traditional get granny flesh as well because I think that 's quite a good point to add thank you David to do it look just in that additional matter I 'm sorry additional content to your recommendation that 's come up today and the first bullet point there how do we how do we know or how do we account for any budget that may necessitate following a regeneration plan sorry well we 're promoting using the regeneration act to look at cranford Street particularly in flood flood and Esther age management issues where 's the mechanism for a budget before their lie because it well it depends on who does the consultation so efforts a section 71 process then the engagement will be the consultation is simply by notification and the newspaper and the calling of submissions and that 's done by the minister so and all of the work has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go the strategic partners are all consulted by regenerate Christchurch which actually makes the submission through to the minister all of the strategic partners have signed off on the change because they 're partners to the UDS and so I 've raised here as well all with with Grandpa yeah but you 're asking about and two different processes because the regenerate the greater Christchurch regeneration Act doesn 't just have a regeneration plan as a process it also allows the minister to amend the the district plan or the regional policy statement so he can do that and that may be part of a solution that we 're looking for and parts of the area that you 're highlighting as well so we don 't know until we get the work done whether it 's a section 71 or whether it 's a regeneration plan and I think that there are components of both areas that would be amenable to both options I agree with you entirely there my question probably stems around when in the regeneration plan is complete and it 's identified work that needs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a regeneration plan and well in my view when you 're talking about south shore south brighton and that but that 's north of bridge street as well then you 've got the land drainage recovery program you 've got all of the work that 's on budget around stormwater around you know all the three water 's generally so there are plenty of budgets that the work would be would be put against and as you know this council made a recommendation around some stock bank renewals and and part of the area just recently so there is budget available for the work to be done well I just noted that just five hundred and forty nine thousand on budget and the 2015 16 year that obviously hasn 't been used for for the boardwalk and car park driveways and paths in south south near brownie yeah well it may well be that we can do better than that and integrate it with the stop banks you know that that may be part of the solution as well Roger that has but all of their roll dough because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking is that a regeneration plan will slow things down it seals things up it is quite the opposite it takes us out of the Resource Management Act process and takes us into a much more engaged process believable and very supportive of that I just wanted to make sure that once we do a regeneration plan that it just doesn 't sit around because money no it will have to be winner will be a priority an absolute priority thank you very good Andrew thank you i was going to raise the enable issue but that 's now been resolved so that 's good but just looking at that next paragraph the council 's support for the a corolla why rail work community board so if we can just correct the spelling of why real one ah and if we can get rid of the word key in front of community board members yes I think all community board members are made equal that 's fine thank you will ya all right okay so i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye oh my god first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would you like me to adjourn the meeting till thursday and what shall I Oh genet 29 theory or short oh or should I Janet to nine o 'clock and we 'll deal with this boost nine okay we 'll adjourn till nine o 'clock Thursday thank you","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Part 3,tUvTWcnRYSg,20160620,1048.78,"Christchurch, New Zealand",2933,"five years on from one of the worst natural disasters that New Zealand 's ever seen is always going to put a council and charge in position we were very fortunate we had a strong balance sheet and we 've we 've gone through some pretty interesting times the challenge obviously with with our annual planners that we are in that process were going from the rebuild of a city or the recovery of a city through to the regeneration of a city we also need to balance setting aspirational goals and planning and budgeting for exciting facilities the settings going to need in the future but most importantly as well and I think this budget captures that is that as it is cognizant of the fact that people actually still need to live here today there 's lots of lots of things that we can look forward to in the future and I and I 'm excited to be in Christchurch tonight and I know that we 're going to have a fabulous City but we can never lose sight of the fact that we still need to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exciting as well I think we do do that and I think we can always run the risk of of planning so much for future and having such lofty goals that you lose sight of the fact that you do need to have a liveable city today so that was a major challenge keeping the rates under five percent because it is tough in this city there are people that have never asked for a handout in their lives and worked hard proud good hard-working people that are in dire straits they 're in a tough financial position and it 's pretty new to them and there aren 't a handful of people like that there is a tremendous amount of people like that more than we would probably kiss with Matt it openly so keeping rates at five percent and keeping it under under that number was not easy you look at Oakland that had a ten percent rates rise double they 're not going through the worst natural disaster that the country has ever seen only last year so I think that we do need to do need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give a pat on the back for the financial discipline around that to the staff but most importantly to the community as well because one thing that does irk me from time to time from comments from the community when we go into an annual plan is that you guys have already made up your mind you know what what 's the point in going through this process and from someone that is still as much of an idealist as when i first ran for council six years ago I say I still share those say my ideals today but that couldn 't be further from the truth we we present what we believe is an aspiration exciting but also pragmatic budget to balance the books for today and in set the direction for the next financial year but we have an open dialogue with the community to say have we have we gotten it right and we 've we 've been honest about our capital expenditure we 've reined in the capital program and we 've done that with genuine conversations with the community some people i think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time around but hey at least we 're giving it a go local government speed dating which was basically the the process to consult round annual plans in the past i don 't think was the best way of doing things and although yes there are learnings from this and we can probably refine it we 're trying new things and we 're putting ourselves out there to be able to be better at getting the information that we need and what we did is we sat down with the community there were no times there was no buzzer that goes after they hit me a five minute mark we sat down we said have we got it right do you like what what our priorities are what are your priorities what are your drive is what are the pressure points how could we do things better and we sat down and we teased out ideas and we had a genuine conversation with the community and from all the way through to the big things around the capital program of the reprioritization of the capital capital expenditure all the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually having that as a flat probably might not be the best use of this facility and it would be really neat to have a coffee shop or a tea house there we listened to the community and we try and balance the small things that collectively make up what make Christchurch a great place to be with the big things which is ultimately balancing the budget so I 'm heartened when I see this plan that is quite genuinely for the community by the community I and well aware that there are different views around the table with respect to asset sales with respect to how we balance that budget I think we all find that frustrating at times but you 're not deep down I actually think that 's fantastic because those different views are very real around this table just as much as they 're very real around the community and I think that we 've come in here and we 've worked collectively and positive end to try and find something that is that is pragmatic and it works one of the worst natural disasters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're actually selling here is a contracting contracting company we 've reached middle ground and we 've done that amongst ourselves and also with the community we 've been honest with our community out what we can deliver on and I 've been impressed with the work my colleagues the work of staff and most importantly the engagement from the community as well and at the end of the day that sought it 's all about so I support the recommendations and I think that that it 's a it 's a pragmatic way forward so thank you very much Jimmy Kim yes thank you thank you met no federal counselors yeah Jania speaking I still support is a new plane and also the amending a long-term plan because why the I think Elise is kinda of the after the consultations reviewing and we put on the realistic the timing no just I think that is the kind of the budget is a more practical ender are implementable for instant like weeks if we review the a long-term plan for the next three years first year I remember is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean is a 17 to 18 years 6.98 in 30 years 18 to 19 5.74 however we have to review know we can the other under control I mean Kenda this coming year is only the four point a knife for the next two years five percentage because we 're even not only the you know that is kinda media or low-income people can afford to pay the reads even though the rich people my understanding is basically those have a last year house however it depends on the pension know they still the can afford to to to to tailor these kind of reads so I 'm going to five percentage it I personally view this the benefit for most of the people that welcome that the pilot of most of community in the people this one second is I 'm very happy you know after the are the consultation or potentially regarding to the mr. the recommendation particular the cup in the channel in a full pass code review will increase additional for the 600 k I think that 's very important not only in the you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area still more or less that the kale or corrupt all those the full pass the curbside sh 0 the nature is not good the visual amenity so this the kind of concert into account we 're out with sponsibility to take this one as the higher the priority another one is unhappy you know especially in the local issue like I the new home be our new service center in library in the South wasted with creation aquatic center based on all the a drafter the annual plan we make the decision of these are all open a completion date where we keep earlier from the original the long-term bread in the beginning of 2009 team I think that 's well compiler most of the people especially the community facilities you know like my fellow councillor the weather 30 Commission earlier community facility no made a library service center or the Aquatic Center this my view is not nice to have facilities necessary no to low everyone this very crucial another one I 'm worried you know the treasure is that we kind of consider in order the kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if all those the low-income people if they have a kind of holding a committee service car they are eligible to have reduced 25 percentage for their kids and also the council can see the partition of 48 the kind of rock conscious women Matt learning to swim in the program because of this kind of swimming or learning to hottest women its knowledge as some specific group the kids that the kind of the likes this H is everyone every kiss energy you know to have these that are the privileged the ability to assess that comes of facility so these kind of most of the only welcome there are people so general speaking I 'm pi hope it is the annual plan and also amendment for the original the long-term plan so I supported is any play thank you okay um a lots miss it but I think one of the lovely things about local government is that the City belongs totally to all of us so we will always get lots of different views about what should happen in a city and unless you and have that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I regard our best asset actually as the 400,000 people who live here and the talent and the energy and the dynamism that they bring to this place and to the amazed and the amazing things that they are willing and able even though they sometimes didn 't know that they were able to do them to do in the city and we see that over and over and over again and just listening to these missions we heard of more of those things that they wanted to do so if we wanted settle where we think that anything is possible and that 's totally what i see is pressure then we need to actually ensure that we retain social inclusion and just to pick up on the point about social housing we have not gotten rid of social housing we have actually retained our social housing and we lease it that 's a model that is unique in New Zealand and when I think will work incredibly well we have in this plan and looked at those things that people told us we 're really important the cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for libraries and far more of them community centers and events that bring people together those helped to create that social inclusion then to get people bumping into each other and feeling good about the city that they live and the op X savings that have been achieved in this budget are actually quite extraordinary and I want to take my hat off and to thank the staff that have worked incredibly hard on those those are actually quite major and do make a huge difference and so to all of you who have done and and if i list you i 'm going to leave somebody else i won 't and i think that the job has been superbly done the emphasis on the repair and the most affected areas has been quite major and the additional funding for dcl which will stand or fall on the success of brighton is quite clear so the funding is there to do something with it to do something quite amazing in brighton and to make sure that those things happen one of the things i like about this budget hugely as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rivers ensuring that we still have good clean drinking water and hopefully the decision that they make over at their commissioners on the quarry 's as good on that but just ensuring that the hit and the Avon are actually good quality and that that is kept for future generations is really really important they 're psycho ways and the progress that 's being made on them is stunning the submissions that we received on the 360 walk the 360-degree walk the head-to-head the biodiversity all of those things are absolutely key to the quality of the city and one particular one that I love that is still in here is the removal of glyphosate and the non-use of roundup in our spraying and any public places which will face in which will happen over the next of 15 16 months city why I love that I love the fact that we 're taking an environmental lead on what is a probable carcinogen and not spraying it and Pete in parks and schools and footpaths and all those people all those places where people go who probably don 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love when people come in and they want to take ownership of things so the community taking ownership of stuff I just thoroughly love I think we met the entire and population of the dates bachelor in the last but it is a great to see groups from wherever coming in and wanting to own and run the things or feel like they own and run the community facilities in their area and and I acknowledge also the individual heroes that make stuff happen so for example you 've seen al castles bridge in here I 've seen singularity University and healer but we see that over and over again with groups and organizations with their sports groups or were they run community centers or they run the Gaiety theatre well they 're redoing the theatre royal or they 're doing up doing up the out center or their mess of array of groups and organizations within the city doing incredible stuff to all of those people I think we wrote a huge debt and when they come in and say they want some help I love the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen I agree that in terms of the rates being below five percent that 's great in terms of the assets are and the need for capital release which apart from this year sale of city care I also don 't think requires the sale further assets and I think we 'll get there without any of any sale and so that 's now reduced from 550 million to 400 million with none in this coming year and then two years of 200 million and and I think that is completely achievable and I think that figure may even drop somewhat by the time we get to the third year of that so I 'm pleased that we have had what I regard is an excellent process and thus any plan in terms of the way their council cancer laws and the staff have worked together and to achieve something that achieves a lower rate rise and lower capital release not for it not from any further asset sales as as I read it and needed and actually listens to what the community wants and tells us that they need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right so um what what I 'm going to propose now is that we adjourn for morning tea but just I just wanted to get a sense from the table because I know that yannis got some late amendments which everyone else managed to get an earlier stage but it 's be it as it may that 's what happened so but do I apart from there do I have a general sense that there is support for the amendments that we have in front of us moving around right so so that 's that 's really helpful so what I 'll do is I 'll just a June for morning tea and and we 'll come back at say quarter past well then yep got it first okay okay thank you","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Part 2,p8ecqmuPusc,20160620,2429.92,"Christchurch, New Zealand",6399,"let 's discuss it on Tuesday I know I agree so you yes I 've been like obviously pretty fair idea yes it came down to a point now what is that I don 't know any Marcus is just all I sleep when they interview right i would say i figgered or me all right so look what we 're going to do is we 'll just start with the with an overarching debate that doesn 't mean that we don 't have opportunities to tidy up some of the wedding I think Andrew and others have handed over some some weirding changes just to get things clarified and tied it up so so I would like to move the staff recommendations on page 5 of the agenda so do I have a seconder for that Rick and what i 'll do is i will open this up for debate but i 'm literally just going to go around the table and invite people to contribute to the debate and and i just want to start with just a brief overview and i think the first thing that i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan that we went out to consult on haven 't changed we went out there with an objective to bring down at the level of rates increase and decapitate five percent we went out there what they promised to put on budget the capital program that we could deliver but also to look at other ways of delivering our capital requirements and i think that what the amendments have done today is really captured the essence of what local government is all about and that is democratic participation and also the provision of future proof done for structure and if there 's any city in the country that knows how important it is to future-proof infrastructure Venna does christchurch and i made the point recently at an event that i attended which orion was hosting on the completion of their their their sort of network which has really future-proof the city in terms of electricity supply and i made the point that would a would a private sector and vista focus solely on financial return would they have authorized the resilience measures that I Ryan took in the early 90s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the answer to that question would have been used I actually think that the public ownership question actually meant that we could forego dividends and return for resilience and it paid off it paid off big time and it paid off in more ways than people realize it paid off because the it wasn 't just the amount of asset that was protected and I used the example of the small substations which cost six million dollars to earthquake strengthened six million dollars they protected up to 60 million dollars worth of asset but more importantly the power wasn 't off for over three months and I worry about other places that haven 't had that approach to future proofing their assets and actually ensuring that the resilience is built into their networks same with roading the same with with other elements you know that that will confront other cities in the future so I think from a lessons loon perspective there is a lot that we have learned here in Christchurch that we 're going to be able to share with the rest of the country but in terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my contribution at the end I think that what we 've managed to do with these amendments is to develop an approach which picks up a lot of the features about what it 's what what is important about living in Christchurch and in the banks peninsula and I want to pick up on some of the recommendations that we 're making here in relation to our own Museum and establishment of a working group to get things actually happening in their area I do want to mention the Ministry of Health Council partnership fund because i think it probably suffered from you know not being accurately portray the christchurch earthquake mural relief fund was set up when people from all around the country and actually all around the world wanted to make contributions to christchurch and the mural fund was established it was a relief fund designed to contribute to the rebuilding of the social and physical infrastructure of christchurch following the earthquakes for some reason that is beyond my capacity to understand previous council desire to put a million dollars of that money and to the earthquake memorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense to me I didn 't actually realize that they 've done it and in it it was just a small component of a series of recommendations about the initial donations that would be made from the pool of donations and I don 't know whether it was an oversight whether councillors hadn 't really appreciated what it would mean to take a million dollars of people 's donations and put it into a memorial net to me was not why people donated to christchurch they donated to christchurch in order to bring about a sense of relief it was a relief fund and so my immediate solution which i started work on last year was to get the money reinstated to the fund the Court is that the the money was already transferred to central government for the earthquake memorial and so by setting up this new fund for me it is really about taking those donations and reinstating them to the relief of Christchurch and if there 's one area community well-being and resilience that is the area where the people who donated to the fund I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our city we are still a city that has needs we are still a city that has requirements in relation to the psychosocial well-being and it was the one area with a transition advisory board seat to central government if you take your eye off the ball we will not recover we will not recover if you take the eye of the ball this is a fantastic opportunity of a new collaborative way of working with central government around well-being and resilience and I welcome up so I would ask councillors to consider that recommendation and the light of weird the true source of the funding is not the ratepayers of Christchurch but the people who donated so readily to our city 's well-being and its time of need i also want to comment just briefly on one of the items that we 're requesting the chief executive to report on and that is to really step up and take full advantage of the greater Christchurch regeneration act 2016 that piece of legislation has been passed in order to give our city access to powers that wouldn 't otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way that takes the community with them community engagement lies at the heart of regenerate Christchurch 's mandate so I think that this is a perfect opportunity for us to look at what knee to be done in our city and the land on the western side of cranford Street excluding the storm water basin and what 's known as the cranford basin always call it the cranford room because it 's the book that can be developed residential e to take steps to seek resolution of that to get it zoned residential that would be a really good outcome for the city and there is potential under that legislation to take make the changes to both the regional policy statement and the district plan at the same time and that would be a really good outcomes the second area which I 'm you know passionate about and I know that the submissions that came in on this were we were I mean done data and inundated as an appropriate word when we 're talking about floodplain management but we were inundated with submissions and so the idea that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Brighton and south shore where you 've got the history side of South Shore looking for protection from the from the ECE and also the other elements all the way down to the north of bridge street those elements could be dealt with I think in a regeneration plan so we 're asking the chief executive to report back on how we use the greater Christchurch regeneration act in a way that gives us a sense of security as a city again it 's about future proofing and it 's about ensuring that we get the best outcome so I 'm absolutely pleased that that people came forward with such strong submissions in these areas and enable us to think of a new way to operate under a new piece of legislation and we should we should grasp that opportunity and really take full advantage of it so there are a number of issues that are included in the recommendations as table today I think they do represent an incredible blend of all of the different elements that have been brought to the 4th so on that note I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vice and return it to speak great thank you very much and i also am pleased to welcome an annual plan that reduces the proposed rate increases and reduces the need for capital release as well this is required financial prudence and it will require ongoing financial discipline I 'm pleased to see a realistic view of the capital program has resulted in a capital program which is actually capable have been delivered as opposed to the ambitious capital program approved in last year 's long term plan which required the sale of assets to fund it and which ultimately proved to be undeliverable for reasons of capacity and due to its unprecedented size the capital program in this annual plan is much more realistic and as a result the need to release capital over the next year is much reduced I welcome this I remain opposed to the sale of assets and hope and expect that any further proposal for the release of capital will first of all be minimized and will secondly not involve the sale of companies owned by the council or shares in those companies but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short I 'll continue to oppose any capital release requiring the sale of assets in my own ward of banks peninsula I 'm pleased to see the fit out of the Okoro museum funded this will allow this project to be completed and for the museum in a Corolla once again to be able to resume its place at the center of a Corot is offering to residents and visitors I 'm pleased to see the work going ahead to look at exploring partnership in biodiversity with the possibility of a contestable fund to support bio diversity initiatives I 'm also pleased to acknowledge the council 's support for the a corollary commute akaroa River Community Board to establish a working party of kilo clock organizations and council staff to address concerns that came up in a number of submissions around the adequacy of refuse collection and other maintenance issues in a corolla and i look forward to raising this at the next community board meeting so that we can get this work underway in good time to get things tidied up ready for the next summer season I acknowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reality that there are some capacity challenges and that some projects that we hope to deliver may not be able to just be delivered within the original time frames but I 'm also pleased that we 've received assurance that some projects like the head-to-head walkway for example if possible will be able to have funding brought forward during the year to meet the work streams if that is able to be done if the work on the ground is is able to proceed in that way from a social viewpoint I 'm pleased to see the council 's continued commitment to swimming pools to libraries to community facilities considering the financial pressure the city remains under I believe that this annual plan is a pragmatic approach to delivering what has been you know really some challenges but doing that in an affordable way prioritizing appropriately and realizing that financial prudence and ongoing financial prudence will be required so whilst I continue to have concerns about the level of future capital release and the deferral of some projects these will be matters for the next annual plan for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of responsibility and response that I believe we 've achieved very well this year so I 'll conclude by thanking the public for their engagement with this year 's annual plan through a variety of processes and to say that I 'm very pleased to be supporting issues annual plan thank you Tim thank you I guess to keep within the five percent has been a journey and I want to thank staff my colleagues and the public for having an open mind and working hard to come to this that are keeping with us within this end not only have it kept within the five percent but we 've also maintained the ongoing repair and replacement of F infrastructure which is essential to our city but also what 's essential to our city is the future economic growth and it is truly essential for new people coming in and our city to grow and we have a couple of items there which I think are really important to mention one is the singularity University I think that type of thing keeping us in the forefront of the future of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our communities but really our businesses etc which has adds to our economic growth the other one which is a local issue as the Kashmir were small and hoon hay intersection with the ongoing growth that has happened in southwest and will happen plus the vision of the Christchurch adventure park and others I think that this work in the center section will only support this community in Christchurch the whole so thank you very much that 's it to staff my colleagues and the public thank you and fill it so I guess an annual plan really is that there 's been a huge amount of work gone into this and i also think staff in my colleagues but in its i guess today is an opportunity for us to really take stock to not just that we were going but i think we 've got good reason to keep in mind how in fact a lot has been achieved but we need to keep on we 've got so much more to do and and it 's I think the mirror is right this this annual plan actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've moved through from a whole stage of really I guess certainly what we call recovery and rebuild and now regeneration in setting up development Christchurch is going to be our part to do there so I think too though we I 'm very pleased that in fact the plan allows us to keep expected income from rates to the low five percent and also that as as Andrew Turner referred to the the program is benefits by the capital program actually being able to deliver what we would expect rather than some kind of some kind of higher ideal we 've got better cost estimates to go on which which also allow us to do there and basically to having being able to reduce a capital release by 150 million dollars for that for this for this annual plan certainly helps keep a far better balance because of the beginning of the long-term plan process I certainly recall that we were told were given a claim we should sell off all of it area sense and clearly just like close church was in a very good shape before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assets to help us get through this generation regeneration part so that is all part of building our resilience as a council so I 'm certainly going to strongly support the recommendations method thank you like a lot of other speakers so I 'm pleased to support the Emir 's recommendations and also pleased to be part of a council that 's supporting a rates rise of under five percent look I applaud the realistic and fistic fiscally prudent approach to the capital program that we are adopting now previous annual plans have had unrealistic capital budgets the council 's been unable to deliver and I do support this more pragmatic talking of the eastern suburbs my side of town there has been a groundswell of discontinued you for quite some time for me it 's been quite pleasing in the last and the long term plan process last year this year that significant numbers of people in the eastern suburbs have have made submissions to the lot firstly the long term plan and again this year the the annual plan I know that a number of people prominent people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality is it does reflect the frustration of residents about the slow progress in the long term apparent apathy that some people perceive about the eastern suburbs I am encouraged when we are looking at regeneration or the regeneration bill that 's been passed through Parliament in recent months that it it does provide a mechanism to be able to address some of the problems that frustrate a lot of people not only in my ward but across the city so I 'm very much in favor of the the portion and the mayor 's recommendation where we embrace the the notion of regeneration plans to address some of the issues across the city that have been particularly frustrating my one concern is that we we in are going to embrace this new philosophy but as a council we must make provision an hour and our budgets to actually be able to enact these regeneration plans one they are finalized the last thing we want to be doing is engaging in another round of torque fest and delays to getting these things done so in summary is I think this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the table and coming to this annual plan has been commendable and I certainly will be supporting the recommendations going forward thank you clean thank you I to support the recommendations in the wider context one year on we now have the from the last plan the establishment of dcl we have the greater Christchurch regeneration legislation and place for places like you brighten this in my view serves to exist as the best chance for it it 's actually in legislation I 'm not sure how much better the locals could want then to arrest the attention of government central and local in such a way the regeneration process in my view has to match the project so regeneration at its heart means an entirely new thing so if we 're talking about an entirely new thing then that the kind of power dynamic has to flip over from Sarah days it has to be one that actually takes people with it on our plan itself I notice I note as tired of feeding into this wider context the comments already made over under deliverability the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the the income from that you 'll note in page 9 reduction of 620 million in the first three years of the plan it pans out to 132 over 10 years I still have some questions in the plan for instance over south shore south near Brighton and the Easter itch questions all together that approximately represents a rating in come to the city if we 're only talking about that in financial terms of 1.74 million dollars a year what are we doing to ensure reasonable protection for the residents there I still have questions over the proposed sale of city care given the net debt to revenue ratio pushing out a lot further and being lower the under deliverability again and the capital program and the fact that city care provides not only of the natural but a social dividend as we saw in the Great River cleanup recently I 'm very and you 'll hear my views later on the proposal to support the ministry of health with mental health for me that is fundamental to our recovery and I will make my views known at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's important that we that we stay on our toes over not only our decision making but the delegations we 've agreed on so we still live in a city with an amplified hierarchy of needs people still want the roads the infrastructure fixed and we 've got to do those things but when we go and do things like put things and rivers would you tracking a lot of attention that reminds us that we still live in this tension which isn 't always easily resolved and that we have to stay on their toes and make good decisions because we have people are people whose most fundamental needs needs are need to be provided for and we have others in the city who are wanting to reach for the stars and it 's not an easily resolve of contention but actually we have to just as leaders just stay on our on our toes Oh in conclusion I have an agenda and interest in ensuring greater equilibrium in the city with investment in the East as well as the West I want to rewrite the balance there and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avon or Target or river corridor which is arguably out our greatest asset so I 'm pleased a year on that we have this legislation anthes partnership this ability to work together but again the process must match the projects we have to ensure that our people are taken along on the journey Ellie thank you well I 'm very supportive of the amendments as we see them today I think when we received advice that getting road and pavement repairs completed is about capacity is about having the resources to do the work and not about the funding I was very supportive of a lesser release of capital I can 't question the advice of those who are far more qualified to make that cool than I however I am supportive of the sale of non-strategic assets if required none of us not one of us has ever promoted the sale of all of our assets and for anyone to seduce that as just absolute nonsense it appears though that some of my colleagues do tend to vote as a block around the table as a political group and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the detriment of the people of Christchurch I think basing block voting on political ideology and not necessarily the actual issue issue by issue is very dangerous for a city that said having a good balance of independent councillors and politically affiliated councillors around the table for this term has actually seen an ability to make decisions that are not necessarily the result of political bloc voting and I hope for the next term that that can continue and the resulting collegiality can continue as well the work that 's gone into this annual plan by staff and our mere particularly as huge as has already been acknowledged and it 's satisfying to see people at the center of this annual plan whether its facilities whether it 's keeping the rates increases down as low as possible or keeping fees and charges as low as possible it is clear that people are once again at the center of the work that we do Thank You Pauline thank you look I support this better and more realistic view of the capital program and our timing of delivery I support the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy work our psychosocial health it 's the basis of strong functioning communities partnerships and collaboration give us better bang for buck someone had to say it it also applies to my support for biodiversity partnerships as well environment is sensual without environment we actually have nothing environment comes first we must take care of it I support the flood plan plan and estuaries edge management resolution priority work it 's already in the land drainage recovery program but submitters have once again highlighted this we are sensitive the difficulties and challenges and to the suffering of residents caught in these areas I also support the Mount Pleasant Community Center the 400,000 for them to complete the appropriate this is an incredible job that they have done it 's been community lead and they 've shouldered most of the finances so let 's also highlight the importance of these community facilities to our psychosocial strengths and our communities the community centers connect people and give us strength so let 's also look for opportunities elsewhere in our communities when we 're building these facilities to make sure we get them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is a good plan with rates increases well below what we have predicted last year we hope to sit around five percent instead of possibly two percent more that we predicted last year I 'm particularly proud of our land drainage recovery program which is really kicking away in within budget we 're moving from the investigative process through designer now into construction all over the city it 's wonderful to see and our primary goal is to relief flooding inside people 's homes and that is an urgent driver our cycleways program is also moving heat quickly from design to construction there 's a huge amount of optimism in the city now we hit a new approach to the submissions process this year we did have some teething problems I think for people not actually realizing what the process was but a lot of people gave wonderful feedback into heaven coming in and being able to speak one-on-one with one councillor to three councillors staff the chief executive people really got a lot out of and I 'm hoping that next year if we do the same process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great opportunity it is to really speak frankly and freely I think everybody who came in and participated and hope that they can actually see that we do listen we prepared to make changes it gives us an opportunity to realize what they value what they prioritize and what they even their ideas that they have four different ways of doing things so thank you and Paul last night yeah we were developing a long-term plan we were faced with many uncertainties unknowns and had to deal with many assumptions there are some who did not believe that we could deliver a long-term plan he 'll pass you of Adolphus but we did we 've actually built back a lot of trust with the community and the government which enables us to concentrate on what is actually important and here we are today with a long-term plan that 's more realistic deliverable and pragmatic we 're also see the realm to reduce the amount of capital release but let 's not forget that we currently own more assets now than we did when we first took office we 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ownership of the company to ensure we place they can 't refocus on its future direction I seen this plan we continued off a hand-up approach to our community enable him to a more ground-up approach and that 's what we do as a council and I think that 's something we need to continue on and do now we saw the long way to go to bounce back and sorry bounce forward and actually I look forward to being a part of that process because we don 't want to just bounce back to where we were we need to go way past where we were and bounce forward to a place that she makes us christchurch the place where people want to come and live work and actually contribute to a great future for the city thanks so much yes thank you in regards to this plan I think it 's some ways quite misleading to say that it 's an annual plan in fact the changes in this plan as significant as what was in our long-term plan in terms of the capital changes so I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually significantly fundamentally changes our financial strategy and I just want to commend the work that was done around the capital review in terms of the realism rather than the huge amount of money that was being put on and carried forward so I think this is a start of a really important process where we actually really have a good look at how we deliver and what we deliver and what the reasonable expectations are and I think although this plan is um started to address some of that if you go through this still a complete lack of synergy in some areas for example we 've got money being spent on the Central City accessible transport program we 've got monies and intersection improvements a year or two later which is a complete duplication likewise with some of our master plans we 've got significant money being spent on master plan areas we 've got rating improvement scheduled several years after that as well so there 's still some work I think to be done to look at how we get the synergies Arab spending money and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital program are repairing and rebuilding facilities and communities most affected by the earthquakes reducing flooding risk reaffirming our commitment to the eastern suburbs so the outcomes and levels of service even across the whole city ensuring that there 's good social infrastructure so people feel safe and involved and there 's key facilities libraries rec centers and pools prioritizing the repair of our streets pavements and curving across suburban areas particularly the worst affected communities and areas prioritizing spending on water quality including protecting our groundwater and raising the quality of our urban rivers and prioritizing suburban regeneration while balancing submit suburban central city projects I still think we still have a way to go in terms of that continuum and if you look at just the small amount of money being spent on road when you 're through example that are and some of the more historic areas of the city that have older types of kerbin channel and those communities are still getting four different types with the skirt repairs so we need to I think continue to be really strategic around how we 're investing our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually take a best for the city approach not a not a best for government approach because the best of government approach today has shown that we 've got load standards we don 't have modern environmentally friendly designs that cater for communities we have designs that actually in the long run will cost us a lot more because we 'll have to come back and fix them later so there 's a number of things and the plan that I agree with and likewise disagree with and I guess it will get a chance to have a debate around or put some of those amendments shortly but fundamentally I think it does it those priorities for me or what 's really important and there will be changes that we do as we go through the process to make sure that those priorities are really at the top of our mind the other point I want to make is that I am concerned about the match funding going into the government I actually question why it should be coming out of that budget when this council currently spends quite a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our grants our community grants process so I have no problem with our spending the money that we 're already spending on her but I do worry about the precedent that this sets with government that to get government to fund the cool things that government should be funding we have to stump up as a council and I think of the housing issues that we 're facing where we actually have been excluded by central government from being involved in social housing which seems extraordinary so I think we need to be mindful of the concerns I do take on board the mezz point and I actually voted against the money from the council going from the mezz Welfare Fund into the earthquake memorial because I didn 't believe it was a right foot so I think it has better use of money going into this and but I do that we should think about the existing budgets that we have rather than additional money coming from other budgets in that regard so um I think just finally the point was made that we should always do what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the city is retaining our assets retaining our strategic assets one of my top Instagram posts was the photo of the parking being charged five dollars for the first hour in the central city from a private provider so actually owning car park public car parking buildings as a huge impact on people i know just recently in auckland people were fined by wilson 's 65 of parking over 15 minutes late in their private car parking building so you know things like public ownership of our assets i think are incredibly important for the well being of the city and this budget shows and that actually there is no need to sell off our assets is known no reason and my view to do so in fact i can 't see what 's good for the city in the long run maybe there 's a short-term gain but in the long run I think it will put us at a huge deficit and it 's something that we should avoid selling off things that bring an income to spend on things that lose money and require ongoing operational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good for the city long-term regardless of which political party i choose to belong to it 's my view from even from a financial sense there is no case that 's selling off things that raise revenue and raise money and have much more wider strategic advantage to a city through social environmental and cultural well-being as well as economic well-being is the right is the right thing to do so um yeah thank you good breath thank you most of the big issues have been canvassed but one thing I would say is that I think the process ran this on your plan was very good in that counseling set a strategic direction from the beginning to the organization and the organization followed it very well and I think that 's something that I think we can get better at it 's a lot easier for the organization to develop strategies and policies when they know what a big picture is rather than counselors making random decisions and round and requests throughout the year so that 's good and I hope that will continue clearly that the rates have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I think council could look at actually making that a permanent cap I think that would send a good message around financial discipline and the capital program i think is actually the big piece of work in this you know we 're going to spend four to four and a half billion dollars over the next 10 years and how we do that is very important and it has to be room for some savings in that big number so I think that is a piece of work that will be ongoing started last year we recognized in the long-term plan that that work needed to be done we signaled it and clearly back then the external advisory group were very helpful in that process and I think now we really need to look at how we can deliver that program in the most efficient way possible so that 's yeah that 's it i think it 's it 's a good annual plan and I think you know we 've still got a lot of work to do but I think we 're setting the right course and right direction

Report,M0sEJNBRA4g,20160609,602.12,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1658,a sketch we put this up from the district plan review subcommittee which is the review that was undertaken of our district plan review process by Robin mcElhatton associates and the report that we received at our meeting last week has been good here to Council so I 'll move that we received the report do I have a seconder Tim 30 discussion yani yeah I just um I mean I was just concerned that the reports based on the premise of the Peter window report rather than what we want as a council so you know at the time when we received the window report had very much a focus on developers and on the government expectations of us rather and there was kind of an absence of environment and community and by and I see in the stakeholders that are on this report again it 's you know if you go through it it 's the ihp he can Sarah Knight are attacking property development cdhb MKT developer airport central city business district chamber of commerce and foodstuffs and property council but there 's no one representing I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are we able to actually get some Empire from that sector and to their expectations because it does seem to me that I mean the concerns were raised before which the I was ready to raise in terms of this report as that a it 's very expensive for the community to participate so there 's a huge barrier and be this is this report I thought when we met with the consultants originally it would be wide-ranging not just focused on the initial window report because maybe visit misunderstanding because am I in my view this report which was initiated by the chief executive was in response to the independent hearings panel what 's that strategic directions chapter coupled with the Wonder report and I guess the the reason that we wanted to put this out in the public arena is because you know that there needs to be complete transparency about what is a about a process that is not entirely transparent because of the way that it 's been been running as I said I would never agree to do it as a as a truncated process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and future if any one ends up in the situation again is to look at what needs to be done in the post-disaster environment prioritize that and do that first and then look to see what else would be useful to be doing in the context of potentially as we 're now looking to regeneration so that to me would would separate off that what needs to be done immediately I guess the important thing from the chickens occurs point of view no I won 't speak for her but she needed to understand that our Council as an organization was capable responding to the challenges that have been put up by the independent hearings panel because you know at the end of the day even though this is not the ideal process I 'd rather have this process then no process because if we hadn 't had a fast checking of our district plan review we would have simply had central government imposing changes on our districts man hollis bowlers so there wouldn 't have been any element of consideration and we have made whether some people feel it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to what would have happened to our district plan absent this process so that 's if I invite chuckling thank you so I think there are two separate issues one is about the process around the district plan review that um we needed to engage in was this work that we did here and the window review is really about our response to that an organization and the things that we could control as a result of the concerns that were raised about the way that we were delivering on that and so that was around those areas of you know capability and capacity and about the culture and the planning processes and and about how we worked with people you know who were involved in the disappearance of the in fact I think there 's been really good improvements and there 's a lot of positive feedback around there that 's putting aside the issue about the whole process which is a should be subject to a different comment and then what they roll of us are review is for typo sorry I think the my points when my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked to a certain group of people oh yeah but we had to do a full lesson seriani well I agree it better for worse but it 's not what we 've done here this is to get us through the independent hearings panel process yes and that 's and I accept that that what I 'm saying that process you can 't separate out the resonance groups for example who are struggling to participate sony Yanni but we got to change the process I mean I thought this is where I totally get your frustration but you can 't change a process once you 're in the proceeds understand so you go out and ask the community if they 're disappointed at the process that we 're running at the moment he 'll there it 's not I mean look at the coastal hazards it was a complete unmitigated disaster to go out and consult in the time frame that we had it wasn 't sufficient time with that we pulled it back so we are going to end up at the end of this process with an understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the process that we 're in but it doesn 't help us get through the independent hearings panel process that we 've got in front of us an hour sorry ice dam understand it but if you look at page 39 for example one of the responses has been to a point of panels economists external the CCC to address consumer section 32 reports for some people like the community boards have expressed concern around the social assessment and the environmental assessment of our section 32 reports currently now that work underway so you know why haven 't we put in place a panel of sociologists or environmentalists to provide that same level of advice into those reports now which is part of this process out of the legal response to the section 32 criticism from the independent hearings panel as this that 's a legal issue it 's a question about section 32 reports under there Sorry mate we have not been fully compliant safe our 32 reports have to look at the social and environmental impacts as well as the economic so what we have is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of view but don 't actually address some of those other impacts that possibly are being accessed but but that came out as a capability issue within our resources within the organization now we do have expertise around some environmental when social issues so but this is a specific deficit that was identified in the Wenger of you that 's because we only talked to the people I it 's not but it 's because we 've only talked to those people it is yeah I 'd actually argue that the planners and the urban designers do fulfill that function and the reason that the comment was made about a lack of economic input and that is around urban and land economists is that actually that it has been missing and my question was actually gonna be who is on that panel so the main people that we 've used to being both internal staff members but we 'll also use market economics and property economics right because I know I mean in autumn Chris Parker he 's been employed by the Auckland Council 's done a lot of work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy state when a lot of that has been driven by the work around the land and urban economists around all good actually understanding what the drivers are around yub which united did bring up at the beginning of this process and what we haven 't really dealt with that so I think that is quite important to have a kind of a broader view of not just the social and environmental pieces but actually what it 's driving the price appreciation inland valleys which obviously is a huge issue as well so I 'm glad that that 's happening but I 'd be quite interested to see what advice they have provided or more particular issues just in general I 'll see if I could just add that whilst we raise that number via the report does actually recognize the huge commitment of staff and professionalism in terms of dealing with the issues that were raised and that they continued under quite enormous pressures that the whole process had put them under but to continually improve that and to do things such as the mediation and working together to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happening before so in terms of their auditing and peer reviewing enormous amount of effort has gone on to change that and the feedback has been very positive from a number of sectors just in terms of here right so i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye my face they know that is carried,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

evaluation panel so it 's better a good example of a joint approach to this this issue on the Sumner corridor so that 's the background members of the the team is quite a large team as you can see have come here today and they 've been working on this for some years hopefully we 've got all the technical expertise to answer any questions you may have but I 'd like to hand over to learn lynners been running this project as a project manager for council now for several years and this is an important milestone so I think over to lend to just give you a quick brief background with her team and refer to a few items on the map that 's been passed around thank you very much Chris thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us on to your agenda so I 'm learn armitage project manager for some reopening project showed me we 've got my own he 's one of the principles advisers team who have developed the original concept design and tow a preliminary design and now we 're moving into a working design phase in next time Charlie Watts also part of the principles advisory team so these music people have advanced the original concept design that you will have heard about a couple of years ago and to a neat compact design solution and now we 've all worked together through an interactive tender process to advance that design further really to move into the detailed design phase now so this presentation just gives you an overview of how we 've moved along from that concept design into what 's going to be a working design solution for summer road so I 'll hand over to the GTECH team started thanks Lynn and so this is a being a collaboration really from a consultant point of view between golder associates and jacobs both geotechnical specialist spoons so if I may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of you yeah yes we give us our diligence we 've done the lights will be a lot more intimate thing so that so this this this image shows the sort of key areas of of sumner road three be as as its referred to the red little red lines show the the end points of the of the project area being Evans pass and at a point just west of of two galleys above the coal loadout facility which is visible at the bottom of the image so some road is clearly marked the the key sort of geotechnical issues are around the the bluffs area which is marked there it 's a steep very steep cliff slope about 100 meters high and two galleys to the to the west of that which have directed some rock fall which I 'll show you shortly the other key element in this image is that is the quarry gone on to a quarry on the right-hand side of the image so as you I 'm sure aware during the canterbury earthquake sequence there were a number of large earthquakes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road and led to the closing of the road significant damage was done to to various features of the road but also highlighted the the risks of road users as the road will reopen so so this is a closer view of the of the bluffs themselves as i see it about 100 meters a high they 're fairly substantial perhaps you can see on this image a few places where there are scars from where parts of the slope have fallen during those earthquakes and fallen onto the road so so I 'm just highlighting the desert if you like the the bluff Syria itself also generated by far the majority of the of the several thousand cubic meters of rock that fell from from the site onto the onto the road so rip this area represents the what major hazard if you like so that the concept design that that I think you 'll be familiar with involved principally cutting back those Bluffs in a number of benches and the objective was to lay the slope back so that it was no longer so steep and to try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that area in the order of a million cubic meters of excavation was proposed for that area as part of the solution and in addition to achieve that that that excavation haul roads would be required in the area of the dashed lines on the right-hand side of the image to to take that material to the quarry so those would be fairly substantial haul roads to carry large equipment in addition to reinforced earth rockfall buns were proposed in the two galleys to the west of of the bluffs to to prevent further rockfall that may occur from the bluffs from from impacting on the road so the over the course of the preliminary design phase in the and the contractor involvement phase of this project various changes have have occurred to the design the designs been streamlined is as Lynn said the proposal is to create a catch bench rather than rather than removing the the large amount of rock from the bluffs a similar effect can be gained by constructing a substantial rock drop from catch bench at the base of the cliffs this is in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a road crossing the slope the the amount of earthworks if you like involved with that would have reduced from will reduce from in the order of a million cubic meters as i said before down to something like ninety thousand cubic meters so that 's a substantial change in in earthquakes body the haul roads that were proposed as part of that solution would no longer be needed and and summer road can be utilized as as a haul road for that for removal of the material needed to create the bench some scaling has been carried out some removal if you like of potential rock falls source material from what I 've what what 's referred to as area G the Western gully on that that image and that his that work has been carried out and has meant that abundant is no longer required in in that Western gully a band is still required in the eastern galley area if on that that figure to to prevent any Rockville material that might come from the bluffs at the head of that gully from from affecting summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a what we call a top-down construction method where all construction works start at the top of the slope and and remove or deal with any hazard as work progresses down the slope so the catch bench cannot be constructed until the slope above has been made safe as it were to allow construction material construction work to carry on on that bench in addition there is there are two areas of planting that a proposed as part of this works in and around the around summer road above above and below summer road in the area of the of the two galleys so that that summarizes the the change if you like of the of the of the design or progression from the concept design through to the current state of design so I 'd be working you 'd be welcome to have any questions any questions yummy um the visual amenity about the visual impact do you have anything that kind of shows well I guess the the short answer is clearly we 're going from seven benches affecting the whole of that that the rough Syria to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's going to be a fairly substantial change between those two in addition I suppose it 's partly represented by a reduction from a million cubic meters of of removal of rock down to sales and all the results I 'm just um I presume in terms of the level of safety and liberal r us that you 've talked to the fuel companies and port and when I know previously we were we were told that they had real concerns about the resilience of this corridor and just we got to know kind of what their viewers of what 's been proposed and we 've had an online working relationship with LPC as part of our project team taking them you know through the design as for progress they 're comfortable with the direction that we 've hit it on it gives probably more resilience in some ways than the previous concept giving us a wider catch line down by the road easier to maintain we 've got a very strict level of service requirement for the road in the case of the design trigger event readers rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within three working days so yeah we 've worked closely with those stakeholders and what about the fuel companies because they look as part of the LPC of connected theatre relationship yep Paul and Phil and Andrew just on the visual amenity pardon obviously that 's going to concern a number of people I would feel and wouldn 't be fair to say that obviously the scaling and venting and so forth initially is going to create but a you know visual change but over time that those changes will soften and with the you know which color of the the scaling back with a changing and the company you know more I suppose normal or natural natural to us natural surroundings a good example of it as you look at the photographs of the site immediately after the quake the blacks looked quite gray ink brown look at them none they actually look like green so in the period of five years even more long going rock for those sites preview just hope and another example of that would be along if you remember what that 's like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and start you look now it 's actually food green green and it just naturalizers that stuff we saw some shots and behind the containers a lot of it peacocks got all the kind we left us right all the faster yeah so this will review to take part of the landscape development plans you know we 've got some plant in u.s. plane is some screening planting and associated with the beautiful road which is the beach you know calling along and there is covered in the eggs that favors there 's some of those education also assists with some of the Rockford and the gullies it does yeah because it 's a tertiary protection it takes a long time to become effective but it is very helpful and it 's obviously a good conservation I 'll see for the floor and for you yep Phil so um thank you it 's a really good report and it helps us get your head around a huge project so i just wanted impact if you could give us a steer on I think on the amount of material being removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million cubic meters of rock so like could you put them into big trap lights or so we can a picture was it suggestions are enormous amount of rock is an enormous ability just don 't quote me and I could come back with the fact of the surface for you that when we originally considered moving a million cubic meters of material I think that calculated to be something like thirty six thousand twenty foot shipping containers of material I 'm don 't quote nick is not sure I remembered critic but it 's something like that it 's a massive amount of material to the engineer at the other anyway yes calculator I don 't did get out my phone and you always are pretty sure that happy today we thought of it yeah denso it 's really a lot and I wanted to get out of it effect and put it back on the website though this is something like that we tried to describe it as shipping containers of material because as you know we have a lot of shopping attacks would be to look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um two questions one on timing and the other on visual amenity clause 3.8 on page 20 and works within this contractor expected to take 20 months and be completed in early 2018 what does that mean for the opening of the road we would at this stage we 're expecting to be able to reopen the road in really 18 we 're planning to advance the roading repair in parallel with this deity quick that 's excellent news thank you for that and then coming back really following on from councillor lonsdale questions on visual amenity and unaware that there have been some concerns expressed particularly by residents on the opposite side of the harbour so at diamondharbour una pura around the the effect on their visual amenity when they look over the water particularly looking for is 3.3 and 3.6 referring to 90,000 square meters of in situ spoil and the size of the Bund for example you talked about planting earlier are they the areas where that planting is expected to occur to mitigate the visual effect of of those man-made structures or results there is some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there those landscapes to plant clans as they develop would be really happy to come and you know share those with the community boards and counselors so you get a better feel for it yourselves but you see as planting plant around the bunt and again there 's a screening for the for the beach as well there are some planting planned yep I think community engagement around that would be great weather with the community board or the wider community and purely because you know I know that there are some concerns around it and it may well be that what 's proposed will set aside some of those concerns I 'm just just talking about the planting where we 're working closely with dot on bio source seed and the like the plant species that are there they 're college us to have been out to survey designs you know make sure that we get the right sorts of plants from a conservation to speak to but working with the GA tech team as well to make sure that we plant the most suitable plan to give us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a combined cohesive effort on to the landscapers a bit to take the community along with you on deck to is quite important we found that it spits at all when they have new trees planted and one of the streets and we had a meeting with the residents and even giving them options of trees to choose within a suitable choice it just empowers them to have some ownership over so you know you can because we could do that through our e-news vehicle there some elevation total inhibit dropping 500 now you should do a cross ward motion so Paul lonsdale moves and return a second and depressed just one other question yeah very quickly um I just thinking of cyclists so is anything done to improve cyclist safety along the stretch at the same time as the work scale we returning to the prefect level of service such as a two-lane road just by the nature of the works the road will be I don 't want to use the repeater but i 'd say probably slightly improved from a surface perspective view cube and channel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of adding a cyclone back the road itself will be new improved the nature of the think that 's just being replaced we had just occurred to me just remember there was a lot of cyclist that used to come around the littles I 'm three to sing and we have had a lot of complaints around cyclist safety around that the port hills and the rides so I just wondered if there was anything that we could do just was known as long base circuit it was yeah so what is it I mean it 'll be better than it ever was so like but the work will be the same it will be this there is no room to make a bigger and that 's also the requirement of the GTI funding that we were tuning to our pre quite but they 're literally isn 't spaces you know half the line yeah that 's the trouble and I mean this this there 's no room there 's just literally you 've got the shoulder over the look and the downhill from there give them a mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to governor spoke the roads like the keys fast yeah you 'll never get another time to do pretty good alright so I 've gotta move into second does so i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye there

Remuneration,b_nwmsaQZWM,20160609,770.83,"Christchurch, New Zealand",2132,remuneration which is slightly right so because we 've got some proper wedding here now so y is 3 country why are we why do you I thought we were just dealing with the donation yes take out three we 're not we 're not i 'm going to do that after the election i guess i 'm here right right resolves that christchurch city holdings limited because that what happens at the moment is that all of the directors of christchurch city holdings have instead of receiving directors fees they don 't receive directors fees but see CHL pays a donation to the miRs Welfare Fund at the end of the financial year so what we are asking citi holdings to do on behalf of all of us is to donate to imagination station an amount equivalent to the fees that would otherwise be tabled to two directors for the year ended 30 jun 2016 and the balance of the donation and lieu of council director fees to the miRs Welfare Fund and that just explains and well I think reasonably simply what we are doing which is making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire year first of july twenty 15 to 30 jun 20 16 goes to imagination station rather than the me as welfare fund and that will get imagination station across the line and they will continue to work to find secure funding for the future I 'm very heavy to move it but I 'm not sure if I 'm conflicted no you know well I 'm gonna have and Janey move incident is there any discussion Oh briefly my position on the directors fees is very clear i 'm actually going to abstain from the sapote i don 't think it 's my place to actually decide where people 's fears it should be down to those under the jaw directors I know that this is being done as a group but that still goes against my position on the side will be abstaining briefly today you 're just briefly I won 't get into the directors remuneration area like that but just just touching on this particular resolution here just the only thing I want to say is I I think for all of us you know it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ post-earthquake and I can 't imagine will be much fun being a kid growing up in Christchurch post the earthquake so having fun things in the city i think is absolutely essential and you know this is a really good cause and high level there were two counselors that would like the equivalent of the directors fees to go to the imagination station and with the council 's support on this as a result we are we get to play a part and bring a little bit of fun to two young kids in christchurch who are most certainly deserve it so I 'm delighted to be sealing this with epi good on you Jamie oh good oh okay I strongly support it too in its as a short term and because no one wants to see their me as welfare fund underfunded anyway given the demands on there um and there 's no question that this imagination station is fantastic for kids my green kids have taken me sometimes and entire so but the thing I just wanted to if I 'm assuming that this is happening there in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ongoing sponsorship for imagination station I see Vicki nodding and yes there is there is there talking to three potential organisations that might want to be involved and I mean the important thing I think in just the outflow of emotion that came around thus when the the idea that it might actually close was really interesting was interesting to be down there on Saturday when Darth Vader Maleficent and hope I love others to induct thanks it 's not often you get to stand next to Darth Vader and Mary province at the same time but just the the number of kids who are going in there enjoying it and I think now that a setup that 's so well used there was a queue to use it because there is a limit on the number of people that can go in it at one time and just to take it apart now would just be horrific so very very keen that this goes ahead so look around future sponsorship we don 't have a note in fact that 's all they are talking about that and this would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half while they sort out the long-term thing and they are talking about a range of long-term options and some other interesting exciting things as well which I 'll leave it for them to tell thank you Paul I think this goes to the spirit of the original decision around use of Directors funds right back at the beginning one of the reasons i supported is so that it goes to worthwhile things we 've all heard from our our schools principals who have come to see the various boards around the issues with the young people in our city and the issues are face post-earthquake jus do you know the appearance and things I 've been dealing with and the kids have often been forgotten so having something they can take their minds off give them a wee bit of excitement is a really really important thing and I think it speaks loudly to a number of things we 've decided is a rather multicultural strategy making sure that you know people work in a clever tough way the counts working collaboratively with people who are delivering some really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really really important so I 'm ready happy to support this it balling yeah I just like to endorse what back councillor lonsdale said at our board we 've had the principles coming in as well and telling us about extraordinary unusual behavior that they 're seeing in children and it 's a big worry so anything like this is going to really help our city and I think it 's really important that we support it and and I 'm going to support it yeah I really like to pull what Jamie said I thought that was great in our to me it reveals an attitude that like it 's not our money we only if you are a director yoni receive it by virtue of being a city councilor so and it 's about the city it 's about our children in recovery so yeah right stuff Jamie I think that 's the way to go oh yeah anyway yes I was just wondering um are we doing anything in this report about directors fees no it 's really not smell snow it 's not doing this just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this oh I speak to these phenomena oh okay um so you know I support imagination station I think they 'd be good to get a process hopefully the wider context around the weather directors fees go and a contestable process for if it 's not the mirrors Welfare Fund for for it to be distributed back into community projects I have strong support for but I guess just um one thing to that when you think about these wonderful activities hat back it 's kind of a shame that we don 't have more of these activities happening in Council owned facilities and the central city like our buildings like our libraries because actually what a wonderful thing to actually encourage others to come in who might not come into these facilities and also when you think about the ability of sustainability going forward we were constantly being paying market rates for high highly expensive property in the central city in some cases maybe not in this case no I don 't know the specifics of it has been amazing you know I think it does raise an interesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of these really cool stuff into our facilities that we 're spending a lot of money building that hopefully can have a lot of community access around all sorts of fun and interesting things for our young people and our children but really happy to support us David then Andrew like I support the notion of supporting imagination state station why views are well known for Kelly I support the notion but i think i 'll do an early end up straining and voting on this issue Andrew thank you on also supportive of this I think this is a really good way of ensuring the imagination station is funded I think it 's entirely appropriate that we should look at some diverting the directors fees from the mayor 's welfare fund to imagination station in this way I appreciate that the funds that are going to a imagination station will therefore not to be going to the mayor 's welfare fund the spirit of the original decision has already been discussed and I would actually take this opportunity to publicly encourage those counselors who are not currently contributing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing so so I 'm well I want to comment on this I think this is a pragmatic solution to an issue that has been raised with us and I 'm really pleased that the way that citi holdings have taken the direction around see CHL fees to counsel the directors has actually enabled it to be available to be distributed in this way I think that in terms of the overall policy though I am going to leave it now till after the election because I think people need to stand for election understanding you know that if I become the mayor again then I 'm going to really pursue a policy which says that no one gets paid more than other counselors for equivalent work because whether you sit on a board or not you 'll sit on a zone committee and you 'll work how many hours does oak that is 8 and the reading that goes with his own committee I challenge anyone who sits on a board to say that that 's not the equivalent of sitting on a board so I think that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's that selection processes for who sits on boards can become an issue as well and I don 't want it to be an issue I want the best counselors to sit on the boards that that we do sit on because they 've got something to contribute to those boards from a governance perspective that 's what I want to see happen so I 'll make that absolutely crystal clear as going forward so that nobody who runs for council has any particular view that they will be well it 'll be a council decision ultimately but i will be putting it up as a council decision I agree with yanni that we need a distribution process that goes with it so that the collective shares and the distribution decisions the miRs welfare fund was a convenient holding pattern for that but may well be a recipient of some of it and the future but that 's that 's that 's what I want to sort of kind of put on the table I think to deal with it now in a way we should have dealt with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different boards that were being reviewed and different bodies that were being reviewed I felt that it was we weren 't able to get to the position of actually forming a full policy last time but I think it 's important that whoever runs for me makes it quite clear what they expect in this regard we can 't let the organization 's off the hook in terms of not paying directors fee equivalent but the distribution decision should be belonged to the council as a whole so that 's what I 'll be pursuing if I get the opportunity to do so this is a good result for donation station so i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye boy and no okay and abstains eligible thank you,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

the secret that 's an instruction from the big udders room yeah just talk to it as well of a care question oh yes question so this is such an excuse musical so there 's this part of the thing that came the other day yes isn 't it is follow yes headed reputation at the last man sir that 's right excited question last time I didn 't get to I might ask you this time what happened with their insurance because remember they came in said they didn 't get a proper insurance payout after the fire they had any had builders in shirts that was a problem so Gordon insurance doesn 't cover the entire because you 're inviting they have normal fire insurance yeah well it 's it 's the builders insurance which I think zoo point nothing anybody can a cheat older but builders insurance is quite different to normal insurance and it doesn 't cover everything that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for insurance cover for the far as it was not directly caused by the contractor this Creek police and fire department advised that it was awesome but your people earned that 's fire insurance covers us and doesn 't obviously not in this case well that 's not sure Lou I think you find it that is an issue when you 're building a home that could be a loophole but it is a problematic for people may actually have damage caused by other things other than the contractor less contractor assurance which is a sin and I suppose they could have got a policy to cover but think about it what we have to remember though here is that they got there and their insurance payout it for the earthquake damage they were mostly through rebuilding the thing under their contract insurance and then someone came in and cause the Arts and which burnt an entire end of the building out and damaged on quite a significant part of the building which left them short we also have to remember that the Canterbury bowls and or bowls association allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use our Park which is near there your facility and they are going to be holding national tournaments here and they have come out of members i think it 's i think this is a really good case it stacks up and the endowment fund from prospective about the only year we can actually pull it from but it says here that the endowment fund will be in deficit so how 's that working for me here 's six hundred counting dollars coming back into it shortly i understand this is a God salon it 's a full point yep anyone March as shown in the financial yeah it 's an agenda prisoner at one point one yeah the a million dollars went back into it from the insurance claims all right yes 31 March it was silver bitumen flammable I 'm just talking about 4.3 point2 just says that funky being deficit under where the cash is coming sorry I 'm not someone just feel I 'm being dead it 's okay for a three sixty four point three point two just as the couple endowment funds available funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're taking the money from that fund and I just I 'm checking we just bringing forward funds from next year or I thought there was a I thought it was a bit left in the advantage Cesar and Fort Worth one that there 's farm is available at 26 2016-17 on 653 thousand dollars so i suppose i 'm assuming that that means that the funds will be given out in the new year and i 'm happy to make an amendment that it comes on the first tee july it just means that they borrow a little bit more in the meantime so if that 's that 's a concern I thought there was things we 're actually we 're actually leaning the money anyway so sort of its one-half of okay so I mean it 's not early so it does say from the 1617 financial year 623 so would it be beneficial we just put making amendments a the money will be allowed this grant we available from the festival i gotta say from illness 1617 here which is the same thing thorsson the resolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little bit of reminding that the same way of deficit but a little elevated corners so yeah they came to the council meeting we ask for a better school don 't see what the issue I 'm just I 'm confused now about about why the capital endowment fund cuz I can 't see how the monies I just think it 's confusing us like yeah let 's say that this year is in deficit next year the funds were but we 're not asking for money from this year yeah that 's my don 't understand why that 's I guess we 're asking why does 4.3 point to exist yes yes this is okay and if I can turn to the if you can look at the appendix at the same time you can see where forecast to be a deficit it 's talking about it 30 jun by 34,000 that 34,000 comes under the unallocated funds brought forward line where as you can see about four downs line four lines down and hold and allocated funds carried forward of 653 and that refers to the second part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1617 financial years for allocation council is not yet considered a prioritization of these funds so i think with a net basis and you don 't need to make it one july or 17 18 it 's appropriate within the 16 17 year for your choice okay that 's fine thank you Andrew thank you so a process question and probably want a Peter actually as well here we 've got a resolution in front of us to make this allocation from the capital endowment fund is this the normal process for doing that because I know there has been some confusion around how the allocations from the capital endowment fund are made and what the normal processes for that would be is this part of that normal process or is this an exception I would suggest that this is an exception that the the the bitter way in which to allocate out of that cap endowment fund would be counselors to take a view of their their priorities and you 'll see that from the skid film you do already have a number of aspects in there that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any work been done or is there any report back coming on that allocation process from the capital endowment fund I know it was raised in the context of the events and festivals funding if you could perhaps remind me whether there is any work going on in that space to report back or to bring information back to us if there 's not i 'd suggest that now there is yeah I think that 's the spirit of my questioning I think it would be good to get some clarity around that because this is another area that shows that there probably is some confusion or lack of information in that space so I want to take to check status if we don 't have that work underway will we 're gonna that 's right thank you do we need a working party or something to euros oshio kev right i 'm working currently busy yeah yeah so it 's not arbitrary it 's actually quite a bit in fact that would could if she comes through that committee if you wanted to three live happily well there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept it on down surround at the moment so I wouldn 't I mean we 've got other things that we 're looking at in terms of the city foundation so this

changes but I think well thank you very much I think that 's been through a good process you want I don 't know whether anyone 's got any questions I think we 're all good to go yeah um come forward yeah yeah yeah thanks um so at the committee we asked for some additional advise um is it possible just to scroll down a little bit so there were some areas it was an area particular through mid wetlands which I just wanted to add as a permission required area it wasn 't resolved at the committee we asked after report back on it staff of seen a memo round so I just wondered if you wanted to maybe elaborate the response you got or whether you 're still supportive of just making an inclusion and I 've so I 'd like to move an amendment yes we did we talked to the park staff they were supportive of that very need wetlands being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edit our council property edge but how would we describe it theory meet whittling very made wetland wetlands peril they 're all wheatley wetlands wetland it is wet lens right and yes may I also ask sorry but I just when it could I ask whether we could have a a third resolution around the top if you do decide to adopt the policy could it be adopted from the first of August don 't you allow to allow constants with the web page to be updated ya know that it 's fine so are people just happy to accept that I mean yeah with effect from the first of August 2016 robust yeah is that right yes yeah Andrew there was a question around and probably referring to the banks peninsula map is the best place to deal with this attachment see on page 267 oh no way and why ruwa were two areas that are not in blue or having the blue line around them there 's a road runs obviously along the side of yr awel and the one side are now where would be a sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vein as counseling your Hansen 's amendment should be considered for exclusion as well oh cool i did chicken are we as well of course because after the strategy and finance committee meeting and of course i realized the reason why hadn 't we had including the first places and now we stopped department conservation manage lee and so we are only able to give permission or not over our own over council property so now it would be outside of our jurisdiction so we can 't and why rewards the other one well why me i 'm sorry i didn 't follow i didn 't pick up on that one at the committee my understanding is that when we do Drita meps around the count the coastal boundary it was all our legal we included all the legal coastal road unmet yeah and the road along the side of why row would be state highway rather than council road so that again would preclude that wouldn 't ya alright thank you good Phil Haley I just want some clarification clear and the difference between what this the committee decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was a community so against so FC there about four case from the airport and hospital the hospital and the other Halle ports if in fact then submitted yes that the council sorry the committee resolution as the potential for that to cause some confusion because there 's a different thing with the Civil Aviation Authority rules I don 't believe it will create confusion the suit the ca rules are quite clear that if you 're flying in controlled airspace which post a video here obviously is then you either fly shielded or you ask for permission from from the aerodrome operator sorry each engineer is there you can fly and can 't fly is the the civil aviation was different in some ways from what councils with no we all we doing with our work with the council policy it 's just saying these are the areas in which you may fly without asking us or if you 're over one and half kilograms you do have to ask in case by case but CIA they don 't specify like in that sense all they do is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town and they say this is controlled airspace because of the airports in the area here so for them it 's just a matter of thing you fly shielded in the area or you ask so she shielded being below your own tree yeah Thank You buildings Kelly I just had a question on page 258 when hobby groups and commercial users were consulted things they were mainly concerned about understandably were issues around low cost the approval regime and it being a reasonably user-friendly system this feels very bureaucratic and another layer of time and effort and energy was any consideration given to making CAA or one-stop-shop essentially so that because at the moment drawing people who want to fly a drone ring selection legally obliged to do this so yeah but was there any way that gets the government 's decision I don 't know just let me finish if you 've got a policy in place why could you not have the policy in places through the legal diamonds but enable people to use CAA to actually gain the approval to fly over these areas I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't go to CAA they go to the airport operator my understanding is they get permission from CAA they run the web or not I land in the sense of this this policy so this policy is just saying that you know CAA rules the new rules say that you master s an rpi use all drones operator must ask for permission to fly over someone else 's property so this this policy simply enables the council to say which properties that will won 't give permission to under what circumstances so it outlays the US giving permission the council giving permission to people to use it once we 've done that they can fly provided they how they fly the drone is they must adhere to CAA rules but don 't I understand that understand it it just seems that so now drawing people have got to ring up here get permission from here then ring them oh no no no that 's the whole point is that we 're brittleness specifically so they don 't have to do both cbt at least 70 that 's why we left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Airport they 've got they 've got to do there but it 's over our lane we 've got to have rules and they were over 1.5 kilo since I prefer Hector yeah but no no that 's what we 're putting on place I 1.5 the original draft had a lower level do you know if one kilogram but yeah we took you know the retailers are saying is sit if you make it 1.5 you 'll capture about seventy percent of all the operators anyway so they 'd all going to be able to go out on the morning they decide hi so from a hobbyist facilities this is a better right ok hmm alright would someone like to move the adoption of this was too jaani and ref just work inspector yeah um I think it 's just there isn 't an supporting the revised committee recommendation versus the staff recommendation as I 'm really mindful what happened with freedom camping when we limited an area to such a small area within our city actually what we saw was a concentration of the problem and the nuisance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of the starting point but I am hopeful that we can have a review in a certain period of time so if there are any issues that are being raised that we 've got a process to record it and also to feed in to the development of the strategy but I think the starting point is that we shouldn 't be overly restrictive to start with given that we haven 't had a lot of complaints around the nuisance and if you looked at the map that was proposed originally again it only had a very few areas where people could have done it without getting the permission of council so I think this is a good starting point and I appreciate that we 've tried to protect some of the more sensitive ecological areas within the city I think that makes a lot of sense so you know fundamentally don 't last thing we want to do is create another layer of bureaucracy that means it 's difficult to enforce buts huge restore a huge strain on our resources if there 's not a significant problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or evidence that we 've had that there is a significant problem but accepting this an emerging technology and that as things develop we may be in a different situation as we go forward but it 's fundamentally support the pragmatic approach that the committee has agreed to which is to have less restrictions now and so that we can disperse it across a wider area of the city rather concentrate and in a few hey I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye suppose they know that 's carried

Application,FSLoBycf__Y,20160609,1574.78,"Christchurch, New Zealand",4137,Russian application I know that each year of the strategy and Finance Committee does not want to move this recommendation but nobody i have raised with the with the chief executive that in future for papers when we actually need the the resolution has moved and seconded by the committee so that would have been claimed it should be playing on the face of this record that it was not supported by the chair because i think that 's a significant issue for the council 's consideration and so but in order to are there any questions that people have got that they 'd like to seek clarification from from our staff and then i 'm going to ask whether anyone is prepared to move the strategy and finance committee recommendation and then I guess the default position as fur as the staff recommendation so some questions yeah Pauline and Phil thank you just on 4.11 that the council considers their owners of red zone properties will have received reimbursement of any DC 's paid as a component of payment received in the acquisition of a rezone property do we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul 's receive compensation from the crown when they acquired the land and we don 't know for sure and I don 't know that when the deputation or room it before the committee that that they could confirm whether that was a component of their offer but we do know and we 've got an example of a valuer contacting the council to ask about the amount of a development contribution livre your credit credit that would be available on a piece of land because they were going to fit to that into the value they were putting on the piece of land for a crown offer lend so that 's in a different situation but we are we lose attention red zone area not residential red zone it was we heard from the legal the 2007 rating valuation so that wouldn 't have a valuation attached to it I asked them the question what was the basis for their payment and they says the 2007 rate and graduation which i assume is just for the land yeah so as a general legal though I guess the value of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've already has under has an underlying village development contributions credit and that is relevant to a the value of that land he 's 18 valuation for 2007 included the development contribution that would have been paid for development even though it was in a residential area what I 'm just saying to genuine so not the specific value value value a shin method but somebody coming along to buy that land later on does not have to pay a development contribution already over again because it already has an underlying DC huy credit attached to it yesterday at some level that has a value to it somebody doesn 't have to pay that development contribution over again just all that though sorry just continuing that they will have received reimbursement this is what the council expects that they would have received reimbursement that 's what they considered that 's what council considers that I mean this is a weird illness and the council 's policy it is the reason its reasoning for why we wouldn 't do transfer of critical or why we treat red zone I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were building back on that site no they means receive a reimbursement they would be they would be allowed a they would be allowed a credit yes yeah if they were going to ret they 're not reimburse that it 's it 's little and yes a red zone credit sits with the land until it 's used on that site or it expires so in actual fact the person that currently holds maybe this is a question the Kenya confirm that the person that actually currently holds the Reds the credit for the previous site as the crowd yes yes of the crown Stallone 's that language I assume they do is they have the they have the critter so they hold the critter yes yes right and just on that just to prove the one that how long before or has it expired the Creator 10 years 18 years that 's a call editor policy five teams is present thank you yeah a fill and then Andrew look I just want to clarify any possibility of this Watson cause 4 11 and especially with red zone credits been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if F council was to grant a remission for this for the struggle that in fact it would make it illegal I don 't believe so the the clause about no red zone credits can being transferred or sold and the policy is about the underlying credits of the lane not being transferred the remissions clause and the policy is about granting a remission of the DC charge so they 're two separate series yeah Thank You June if that answers a question yeah Paul you had a I 'd I was just a shoe just to give some context to the room the credit so for example sakes they intensify that land they will pay the extra for the intensive again it 's only for what was there before yes I am Andrew thank you um with relation on page 243 to close seven point five point to the statement there is that the decision could be made to approve a reduction if the council agrees with the bishop so that 's the bishops letter in 4.1 referred to in 4.1 2 and four point one three on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were unique and compelling circumstances then we could agree to the inconsistency with the policy I think I mean you 'll see there we talk about her that 's potentially inconsistent with Klaus 2.3 as I 've just explained it it actually deals with a different a different subject matter the credits compared to the actual DC charge that 's being charged so and there 's a potential inconsistency it 's not i think this was puttin eater just highlight that but he 's certainly if you find that there 's unique and compelling circumstances under that remissions clause then you can grant a remission yeah and then my second question related to any issue of precedent setting presumably if this is seen to be a unique situation I think the arguments that it is that would would then limit any precedent that would come out of this because of the uniqueness of this situation thank you I just oh CLE clean thank you mrs. me counselor Livingstone I presume yes I 'm think of a reply every time you say that just to page 243 looking at discretion 4.9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's situational depends from case to case does it necessarily set a precedent would that be your the derivative Clauson of the policy where it says edits sole discretion a 3.6 mature years how do we interpret that okay well so the discretion is with the council and um I think that you all had was circulated Amina i did for ya funny chief financial officer so there was a bit more detail you hear about and you 're considering unique and compelling Inge okay you know eater just I think of a situation as unique just from Costa made some yeah and staircase none okay all right yep good okay so if something would someone like to remove the the stretchy and finance committee recommendation or the staff recommendation I 'm happy to move the committee recommendation materi commendation Andrew second ago Phil so open that up for debate ng um to me this is almost legal question whether this is unique and compelling and referring to clauses 4.12 and 4.13 I tend to agree that it is and the reasons for that that I agree with a set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I referred to in my question seven point five point two is certainly the other clause in the report that supports our ability to to make that decision so it 's I 'd I think it 's important that we we stick to the facts of this particular case and we we look at the the considerations that would allow us to come to a particular conclusion there 's a wider context that we could take into account but in terms of that question is it unique is it compelling I believe the answer to both of those questions is yes and that 's the reason that I 'm supporting the committee recommendation lien they kill just wish they offer a perspective from Ward as well as city that Ford ellington the first quake of September the fourth literally traveled through this church so broke it at that point that lived ellington without any recognized community focal point to the extent that when the febri twenty-second point rather event came along that we ended up with a shipping container as a community hub in a community that was about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isn 't that sufficient to meet the unique and compelling test relation to the rest of the city on this we can see in another report page 198 4.21 it 's not as if this will necessarily deplete revenue from DC 's either we 're already ahead with the dc 's but that 's not really the point the point here is does it meet their unique and compelling test I can 't think of any other place in the city that 's been affected in this way this is situational we do have discretion and I urge you pleased to support the option to approve the remission alley well with respect to my colleagues I would rather be taking the advice of staff who say that the circumstances outlined do not appear to be unique and compelling and that is why I won 't be supporting this I think with danger here is that we 're setting a precedent and I can think of several emails I 've received in the last two years that would argue that their position is unique and compelling as well and could they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking on very thin ice with us and as i said as i started i would rather put my decision in the hands of staff who had four devised in fact that this is not unique and compelling Paul look I agree with counsel jones sam i don 't see anything unique and compelling about this here and i and i 'm certain that if we agree to this today to what 's been up on the board here we all have other ones come out of the ground that else she will say they unique and they will come back and seek out some some recompense from the council so i won 't be supporting this today me yeah things look fundamentally this has been an argument about whether or not the situation is unique and compelling and from my perspective I just don 't believe that it is unique in compelling enough to justify the Preston 's that will be created around it you know do I think this is a good cause of course I do and do I think will be positive to allow the church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into educational facilities on this site absolutely you know it 's positive but the earthquake whilst it was unique you 're all unique just like everyone else in the world and everyone was affected by the earthquake and everyone has got a story and everyone can tug on the heartstrings and everyone can make a compelling case and we have policy in place for a reason the fact of the matter was there was a deep DC credit on that land in the red zone we understand what 's happened with that and it 's been paid out but point of DCs is simply a user will cause a pays scheme to be able to fund the infrastructure that is required when increased demand is placed on their infrastructure that is underground there are lots of places in the city where there will be DC credits they 've chosen not to locate on the site where there is a DC credit they 've chosen to locate on a site that the infrastructure below the ground does not have the adequate capacity for the increase in demand is going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it if we decide for them that that means everyone else in the city is going to be paying for their and that means that the causer is not paying for that infrastructure which needs to be upgraded I think the president is a dangerous one and I also think that the situation isn 't necessarily compelling enough either because they actually have the money in the bank they 've got the money prepared to pay the DC system in the bank account which they said act the committee further to that the settlement was actually not a settlement on capital value the settlement that they got which they told us at the committee meeting was that they settled on land value and land value alone they then had a quantity server and negotiate with the insurer on the above-ground se it 's now any quantity surveyor that is half capable at their job will be arguing every single bit of added value that they can squeeze out of a time so whether you have a resource consent that 's there that hasn 't been executed whether you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting all of that your insurer and the Catholic Church got a global settlement there is no way that a quantity surveyor would not argue the value there is no way they would say no please don 't pay me the extra additional funds that we that we have only want us that 's the point of taking the land value and then negotiating directly for your insurer with a global settlement they 've done and they 've got the money in the bank they 've chosen a site which does not have the capacity for the infrastructure or the added demand on the infrastructure they 've chosen to create and going against the user pays situation on a very very clear policy which actually what verbatim says that specifically state integrated schools I required to pay development contributions I just believes it 's a terribly dangerous precedent because we will hear unique and compelling story after unique and compelling story for the end of how days if we go down this route and I think the staff advises prudent for very good reason David I 'm like I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while they there but I think L Council of golfers probably said everything and more that I would would have said so I 'll just refrain from further comment and just stays at all we won 't be supporting the agreement though so in fact in terms of school particularly schools in Christ huge this is clearly actually a unique incident and you what happened to the spots and Francis the combines of bands of school in the original girlington school being shifted is absolutely unique was the only school in Christchurch which was required to shift because it was red zone so they couldn 't have possibly you know stayed on the red and the red zone land or rebuilt on the leader Reid 's inland so it is unique it 's also compelling in that they had no option actually that they they were forced and then fit required to move somewhere else that 's absolutely compelling so there is a clear case that in fact for some francis of assisi school it was both the circumstances were both unique and compelling i think like it 's easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket in fact we as a council ll DC rebates for developers in the central city they have money in their back profits that they wouldn 't always necessarily tell us what they had their back pockets but that 's like a a subsidy which they also receive actually so and what the staff I understood the staff to say there 's in fact this as an exception and that it 's not it doesn 't necessarily create a preset at all because this is a particularly unusual situation I want to say to that if children of these children were attending a state school and I 've been a state school which had which was forced to move that that school would not be paying these things the crown as unit as you reading the report is not obliged to pay development contributions also what to refer to the whole point of that the the private schools integration aired and that 's that kids and school and Catholic integrated schools they actually have equal rights to kids and state schools and so you know i think that the argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what what it means is it that if i think of council doesn 't support this today and in fact these children compared with their state school and colleagues they would be discriminated against and i think in fact that isn 't the way this council that does things at all so I 'm urging am urging and the council to take to support what was the original committee recommendation right yeah just briefly I think Jamie 's would have covered most of the points around the dcs I think for me I mean I would have had to see some evidence of significant financial hardship here to see this as a compelling case and we haven 't got any the church made the decision to build the extra classrooms they would have known the dcs involved in that process they have the money in the bank account they 're proposing to use this cash if it 's remitted for general facility improvement at schools around christchurch city so it just doesn 't pass for me that compelling test just on that basic requirement so I work and I get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very very compelling stories a major financial hardship people paying rates of multiple properties because they 're not repaired in time for health issues and you really actually think those people are struggling they don 't have the cash the church does have the cash they 've told us they 've got the cash they should pay the dc 's I want to comment as well it 's and does as I said it strategy and finance this was really hard harder shoe to actually formulate an opinion on because it really could be either way I mean I even said that I was kind of sitting on the fence I didn 't really know which way that that I should go on it because to me it is a unique situation when you the only school that 's been red zoned you know it 's unique so I think the unique as as as certainly passed and I thought that the compelling side of it was the fact that they really were faced with no option of going back to the site where they were so they they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school site and turned the same it tuned to two schools into one school so the noose and Francis of Assisi school took over from the two schools that previously existed but quite some distance from Derrington which is where its home was and I know that the school community actually didn 't want that amalgamation to occur on the Ennis roadside but but that that was the decision that was made by the church and it 's theirs to make and they and I think they did that in a way that was an effective use of their land because they only had to build two additional classrooms in order to meet the needs of the expanded schools so they went through a good process but as others have pointed out they are perfectly aware of the development contributions obligations because they 've set the money aside to pay should this decision not go through they then but the so from me unique and compelling you can argue that both of those tests are met but then I come back to the plain wording of 2.3 which I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meeting which is that residential and non-residential lots women within an area classified by Sarah as red zone that are subsequently dumala will retain the assist credit with the lot so it stays what the site not moves no red zone credits can be transferred also but will remain with the land until they are used on that site or they expire and we know from the policy that they expire after 10 years I 'm not sure when that transfer was actually made but it wouldn 't have been made before it wouldn 't have been made before 2012 i 'm guessing would be the first transfers under the residential reads and i know 'd Ellington was pretty close it was one of the first suburbs to be red zoned but but but I know actually they didn 't they didn 't they only did residential properties to start with so actually was probably a wee bit later so so there 's another there 's another at least seven years probably sitting there on that site which is right on the edge of the red zone available for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're being asked to consider us as is really something that 's against this policy but through another means which is reversing the remoting the development contributions the council considers that owners of a red zone of red zone properties will have received reimbursement of any development contributions paid as a component of payment received in the acquisition of a red zone property well we 've been through a global settlement and I mean we we have to accept that that 's it 's ins and outs and ups and downs and it you know and the total scheme of things that 's probably neither here nor there but that 's the basis for our policy but that means that the red zone credits x year owned by the government and they such on that land with the government and if the Catholic Church feels that it hasn 't had a fair consideration of beer situation then really they need to look to central government because that 's who owns the credit so although I supported the passing of the resolution at the strategy and Finance Committee on through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development contributions policy is not been met so I won 't be supporting the resolution so I suspect that there 's a split vote so can we have that have we not got the system working we haven 't addressed to me if what you digitally so those in favor of the of the resolution is moved by Councillor turn accounts of Clearwater could you please raise your hand hey if you checked everyone Turner scandrett clearwater neither 7707 yes kata livingston johansson and chin it is given all and then opposed also seven so them so the motion is not carry which means that the development contributions cannot be remote so right usable reverse gesture described yeah status quo which would be the policy okay seven all right all right so and we will move for,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

develop E and the progress report to chair will be provided so thank you for this opportunity and we look forward to strategy being in those named finalized as a consultation paper at to date thank you excellent would any other members of the group lighters say anything i should say the camera is now working so you 're being live-streamed oh my gosh there 's a lot of pressure yeah over to her we just want to thank City Council for considering the multicultural strategy um this group of people who have come together to create the strategies in eighth month of long hard work and a lot of discussions a lot of knowledge and experience from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very long time we have people from the education sector NGOs youth leaders multicultural council and also councillors um I can say that the people who have been representing the people of Christchurch and for those who are the voiceless I hope that we 've done our job well and that we have come to a place where we can contribute and advocate with those who don 't have a voice and can 't speak up and really can 't share what they feel about how they can be part of Christchurch I mean speaking for myself are the very first time like I took you know my very first breath I talk on earth I was labeled as an asylum seeker and the very first time I put my foot on New Zealand soil I was labeled as a refugee and I took about 13 years to feel like a New Zealander to feel like in cantabrigian and that fighting myself and I 'm finding myself as a canted rien there was me who stepped out of my comfort zone with me who tried to find ways to feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who pushed me forward who gave me confidence who opened that I platform for me to advocate for me to express my voice as an individual and I can tell you that being in the youth sector and being the spokesperson and the health coordinator kind of refugee council being a founder and advisor for the new zealand national refugee youth council who is now international and going and supported by the UNHCR and supported by the Asian Pacific refugee rights group to speak on behalf of refugees we live in New Zealand and contribute their voices internationally and nationally I feel like that we 've come a long way and it 's because of the contributions that people have made and the possibilities that you guys have given to us and for opening up the platform for us to be here and to make a difference especially thanks to the counselors for allowing that and to the members for contributing the experiences because it is not easy advert the COS to be in this space and to be questions like who you are to be in such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we want to share our experiences because we want to make other people 's experience as New Zealanders who are labeled a certain title to feel like that they are contaminants and they belong here and they have the right to be New Zealanders because they are citizens of this country and this strategy of really does push forward for making other people feel safe and find themselves not 13 yes but earlier than that we call ourselves the multicultural city and I think that by embracing diversity and especially counsel for being at the heart of the city and leading the way for us to show that we can be a diversity we can embrace multiculturalism this strategy is the way to do it we 've been waiting for this for a very very long time and huge thanks to the people who 've been in the sector 20 25 years who are advocating that alone I have only been here for not that long six years and I 'm just like wow and a really huge amount of gratitude to the people who 've been here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the things that I have had the privilege to be part of and to be standing here to speak in front of you people who have been advocating secular very low town made that possible for me to be here it made possible for me to go to Wellington for the new zealand national refugee forum where refugees will not allow 10 years ago to step into that form or that conference they were placed outside by security so people before me made this possible real contributions your experiences makes this city so beautiful and we shouldn 't be pushed down by the color of our skin the culture that we bring for the different languages or the food that we hate those are the men administration of beauty that God has given us and is the beauty that we share to get the s people and and that what that 's what unites us all and I 'm very very excited for Christchurch so thank you for the opportunity to be here I think so thanks to me just like to ignore some people in the room to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the early 90s we know nothing that many people were called down a summer where a Nigerian man was attacked at that stage was the catalyst for some very good work multicultural field and counselor butter consulted the Anita tour of the priests who agreed to have a series on the various ethnicities and Christchurch every thursday and the cottage press quite a prominent thing on page three and that was fantastic and successive Mears and counselors and indeed currently at the end and they professed his ministry of immigration in those days to did a lot of work in via that work as she did at national level it was also quite a spin-off for varsity as well a lot of hard work was done by Gary Warner 's capacity as mere as well in various counselors and those days they were Amir 's wife and party on ethnic relations and come sort of really good consultations and things are clear and now I think that it 's testimony to do you figure on the table that this has happened that this the four councillors have come on board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yelling Johansson and it 's been fantastic working with the counselors and the officials the council staff and ourselves it was great well you know it 's a complex thing but it 's been discussed and debated well which will speak two different views and just lastly I 'd like to say that a key focus for us has been the recognition in the cottage city of everybody having ethnicity not just really arrived migrant and Refugee people but especially is your hands here acknowledging that they are disenfranchised inherently to a certain degree and this vehicle gives them great opportunities to be here and felt listen but also you know people of n blow Celtic if you like culture also here is dusty we all have ethnic in this room and very much this project is about recognizing that and we just respectfully request that the council see it on that line as well but every citizen and in this city has an ethnicity and the culture to be respected thank you me air mattress opportunity also acknowledge some of the staff council staff the clear Phillips the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are Tony we order a staff fully support in the administrative support is impossible you know we step is this the document so we do appreciate the stop the gala involved in the support and also in here we have more little community leaders sorry poppy poppy thank you so much we have a quite a few times you know ever consultation with whisker in Somaliland Molly deters we got into this attractive and multi-culture strategy Technic document yes that 's great so thank you that i 'm going to i was gonna say go the welsh that 's all yeah typical giant damn Yankee did you yeah all right tysons pick something um it 's about stone for us here because I 've been driving their multicultural issues for a long long time good twenty four seven years and they 're working to CD for forty-odd years so I 've seen the changes I tell Colin creature if this one we will just about we do under the major council that have a good strategy are here and also some goals and outcome now the challenge for the counselors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a really good note so um I 'll call the this part of it to to an end and I 'll invite Jimmy chin to return to the seat and weaken peps move the motion that we have before us and and then if the people can if you if you go back to your seats and remain for the debate that would be that would be fantastic but thank you so much and thank you on behalf of the cities for what you 've contributed in terms of bringing this to this point i think when we finally celebrate the the adoption of the strategy as a as a whole we will have real cause to celebrate and we will do that in a fishing way so thank you thank you so Jimmy you 'd like to know maybe dinner yes Thank You action would somebody like to second the motion lindell instance tell me would you like to start the debate yeah yeah okay sync your mail is sync your mail into my fellow councillors believe you all heard enough automotive culture or working party to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas I just feel like you know to emphasize some of the crucial point the first one is this is the result of 25 years of a democracy for the council to have this a multicultural strategy so I 'm very proud that we are able to see here to take in as a group we present this to the mayor in my fellow councillors and also this strategy actually is a commitment by the council to support and embrace the diversity of the people in Auto Taji pie church so in order to ensure the strategy delivers so we 're happy action plan will be developing setting out a range of actions for a council to implement over five years a period to 2021 as I presented to you earlier this strategy is being created in partnership with the leaders from the wider community so a multicultural working party was established in meter 2015 so members of this group is made up of four councillors and the also learn aight community representatives a chilis so good a model not for the partnership with the community in the council so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they sacrifice their time they contribute their selves they give us the wisdom gives a guidance to make these that happen and also this working party has identified the key features of the multicultural strategy for consultation with the community so we have a kind of high-level strategic document love lesion the principles there goes like excuse and also for the implementation so which means this trade digit ichika document provides the framework and the set our goals and the actions to ensure every person in quite church feels a sense of belonging is very crucial for all of us so I 'm delighted that the council chair committee you animals are pulled estrada strategy plus the Thursday so I also urged the mayor in my fellow councillors your animals adopt this draft our strategy today name for it to go to a public consultation thank you thank you and I 'll take clean and then Andrew and Yanni thank you my view is that the time has definitely come for this I failed as a nation in 1990 with the 150th commemoration of t2d T we were beginning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have actually I think in many ways we 've regressed if you follow some of the commentary around biculturalism and multiculturalism today I think what Winky has said is really important that we make a statement as a metro jion 's comment I found very disturbing you know asylum seeker and yet if I think of my forebears and probably yours and my brothers and sisters from the Pacific Islands they share you know the same dream we come here you know for a better life that 's what they say can 't you know will be seen to be carrying that dream rather than be kind of segmented there 's a really good insightful colum mccann painting and title with the promised land and it talks about how hard it is you know people come here it 's a lot more challenging than what they anticipated with the strategy let 's make it runs lives a lot easier there 's no need to have more obstacles and they 're what they already are so I think the time has come congratulations counselor Jimmy and the whole working party tremendous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a little bit if we need to but absolutely thrilled that we 're at this point Andrea thank you as one of the counselors involved in the working party I 've particularly enjoyed and found in fact this piece of work particularly educational informative and one of the things that 's amazed me is is the huge amount of work which has already been done over a long period the huge amount of knowledge which is held in our communities that we 've now been able to bring to one table and put into one place as we have developed this strategy as a counselor there are a number of pieces of work that you you get involved in in the diversity of the work that we do never ceases to surprise me but occasionally there 's a project that you get involved in a piece of work that you get involved in that that really presses the right buttons and that really you know stirs up something emotionally I guess as well and this for me is definitely been one of those pieces of work so I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've got a recommendation from the the ched committee to approve the draft for consultation clearly this is a piece of work which is long overdue and we we put this out for an approved for consultation today and I look forward to the the results of that term that consultation I think getting that wider input will be hugely valuable to making the final version of the multicultural strategy the best that it possibly can be and has already been acknowledged having a document is one thing bringing that document into play in our decision making and our actions is is the more important part of the whole process so developing a strategy is hugely important getting that right is hugely important but even more important is making sure that we then bring that strategy to bear on every aspect of councils work from that point onwards that 's the point in doing all of this work the the other comment I 'd like to make is around the process the the idea of bringing in external members is something that really has worked we 've seen a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diversity around the table that we would never have been able to achieve with with just councillors around that same table and in that spirit I 'd like to to thank the members the external members of the working party you 've given very generously of their time their knowledge and their experience to get us to the point that where we 're at today so thank you very much indeed for your your passioned involvement it 's fair to say I 'd also like to acknowledge the work of Jimmy as the chair of that group in bringing all of this together and I 'd also like to echo the thanks that have been made of staff in bringing all of this together as well so and certainly encourage councillors to wholeheartedly endorse the the draft strategy and support this going out for consultation thank you okay jaani thank you a lot of what 's been said I won 't repeat but just wanted to make three points and endorse the comments that have been made in the work that 's gone and um I think this process highlights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether it 's on our committees or working parties I think we 've really benefitted from that so I think that was a really good decision we made and thank you to those young people that put their hand up and agree to go on it it 's interesting just to reflect on one person who hasn 't been mentioned but who has passed away which was Jim Fraser for me if you recognize someone in the city and the part of the comments that were made that actually he was president of the Canterbury caledonian society who had the Caledonian hall and he was also former president of the ethnic council and had a huge amount of work for the promotion of of ethnic communities and Christchurch and in New Zealand but to go to an African drumming night at the Caledonian hall was an experience of many different cultures coming together to celebrate and I just thought it was important just to recognize Jim Fraser and the contribution that he had made previously to us as a city and I know he 'd be looking down on us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally just make the point that um for me there is a bit of a personal element to this I you know haven 't gone to the hairspray at the Theatre Royal last night and obviously how timely that we see the issue of integration and the whole issue of racism through that that production which was a great production but you know I grew up half in America and I remember being in high school and the Rodney King verdicts came out and you know it 's a moment of extraordinary just quiet when when you had the tension that was in the air and obviously you know what happened with the rights in LA but you know for me the most important thing that we can do as a city is to make sure that we celebrate and understand different cultures rather than be afraid of them and that will mean that we live in a lot greater harmony and hopefully peace and less conflict than other places around the world so we 're incredibly fortunate to be able to live here but I think this is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible to make sure that we do celebrate and cherish differences of culture rather than being afraid of them so I think it 's really important step forward look can I also join and congratulate counselor Jimmy Chen for providing the leadership that is required to bring a a strategy consultation document to the stage and its journey and to thank the members of the working party and the staff who have helped make that happen and the other counselors who joined council chin on that and in that working party I like the Working Party approach it does prove that a few brune external players to the table and not just rely on the counselors that sit around the table that you actually get something that 's greater than the the then its parts you know the sum is greater than the whole is greater than the sum of its parts I always forget that one but and but but but that 's because you bring a whole range of different points of view to the table and whenever anyone is dealing with issues of complexity it requires different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's why not having you know people with different experiences coming to the table that 's why you don 't get to tackle complexity very well and often you have what i always call group thing when you don 't have different points of view because we don 't all have to agree with each other in order to come to the right conclusion working issues through so i really think that this has been an exceptional process and and this has been a good result it 's got another element of its journey to go but Petra took me back to my days when I was the Minister of Immigration and I remember and I was looking for the that what I actually said when the immigration office opened here in Christchurch than the new one which is no longer whoever it was that was on Capitol Square but I challenged the Immigration Service on its branding at the time and and I think it 's really relevant to this conversation that we 're now going to have because this is a bigger conversation we have to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this conversation is and I 've changed I challenged them on their branding that the Immigration Service brand was that New Zealand was the right choice and I wanted them to change the brand to something that said let 's make it the right choice for you because the difficulty with the phrase the right choice is that that wasn 't matched by the experience of people arriving here without a proper settlement process in place or a resettlement process or policy in place and the language today is the multicultural strategy but actually it is about belonging and that theme comes all the way through the document and I really congratulate you for choosing that word of belonging and I talked about people coming to New Zealand but the residents these are stamped in their passport without realizing they had little hope of ever achieving their ambitions I wanted to encourage potential migrants to arrive with realistic options not pipe dreams that could never be fulfilled the right choice was also too one-sided it says that it 's the migrants choice alone not one we could share with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of focus on settlement outcomes rather than just the numbers of people arriving in the country so in a way I feel like I 've been on a bit of a journey going from that role and central government to this role as the mayor of Christchurch but knowing that we have such an extraordinary group of people around the table who are able to embrace a wider group and actually come up with a strategy like this so congratulations I always say that the citizenship ceremonies that I conduct every month my favorite one of my favorite three favorite events that I undertake and I always talk about the fact that each one of us or our forebears actually was a migrant they made a journey to make Musial and home whether they came by walker or by ship or by plane they made the journey and it 's the story of that journey that 's what we have in common with each other and the stories we should share with each other that builds understanding that builds respect and it actually takes away the opportunity for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning so look what we what we use this document for an hour is almost as important as the process that 's been through because we all of us have to take it out and to the wider community we need to really embrace the language of multicultural society in the context of our bicultural nationhood and it is in that context that we will I hope see real change in our society so it 's not going to be words on a page councillor Jim it 's going to be real and the winky tunes are challenged to us at the very end to say now we 've got to walk the talk that 's something that will do together so congratulations I 'll now put that motion all those in favor say aye I hope those opposed me know that 's carried thank you so we 'll break for a cup of tea I think to be a good idea I took,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

statement of intent and a good discussion about that strategy and finance so as you 'd like to move it for that yet since you all see how we put into other delegate to central plains how sickened about David ok Paul hit a good discussion about that David and I went out to sell one last week to have the the joint committee meeting and we asked it was of the trust they seem to be very keen to give us as part of that in addressing those issues that the strategy and finance brought out was the fact that up till now with stage one being in the process of being completed there has been no financial performance indicators to monitor but they expecting that that 'll be the case from now on they 're moving into stage two stage one becomes operable so they 've taken the suggestions on board and they 're having another meeting fairly soon to address those so that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think ed I 'm nothing probably one of the food and comments is really that we 're in catch-up mode and we should probably be participating in this wee while there are one or two things that we need to be better informed on but at this stage I think the important confirm there 's no no alarming issues that we need to address the statement of intent we have raised the points that we 're addressed by the strategy and Finance Committee and particularly notes that no financial performance measures have been included falling talk about that a moment ago the ratio of consolidated trust funds through addressing that and I think the other thing that was brought up that the drafters psl I was only for a year where it should be 43 so these things are all being addressed at the moment and you know I think Paul in agree we 're on the right track going forward yeah I mean the last meeting that they had the committee head was in august 2013 so it shows you that there was very very little labelling of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding which will be the next water trust meeting between the company and the trust so and they go to review the emo you between the City Council in the Selwyn district council also and also I think we 're going to once the income is beginning to be generated will be focusing as the council rips on the environmental conditions and the only a statement of intent pardon be given how long that income about to come ahead of that folks this would be really good yeah now just be really really clear on this in that there is no possibility of any financial liability falling on this council from us remaining here on this with we 've already made the decision no I just want to hear every year but strata to answer the question I think I did some work on this a couple of years ago and came to that conclusion that there was no liability on us absolutely sure as sure as sure as anyone can be no there 's no trail back to us we are a set rule of the trust first we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're not playing anything either nope anything but we made the decision to remain at whatever switch I wasn 't here at the time that that decision was made and I was surprised at the decision but the report back that we 've had from both Pauline and from David is that we are welcomed by so on is now playing a role as set laws of this trust so that 's that 's what we get we 're debating today as receiving the drive statement of intent which is based on a trust that is pre-exists things we can 't change the terms of the trust with this resolution but we are recommending that the Joint Standing Committee strengthen the monitoring environmental effects and consideration for increasing the environmental livi the included in the statement of intent so that 's that 's the direction that we 're giving to our representatives and yanni so I just want to just I mean my understanding is the trust holds the consent which is used as security for the lines is so that 's the value so if the trust lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our liability look I couldn 't answer there that it 'd be a lot of implications around there well maybe we could get some equation i unhappy to provide some advice on me just in terms of the counselors that went to the committee was there any discussion I was consumed the committee that we didn 't have the financial information but was it any discussion around increasing the living because when you look at three point 11 I mean yeah for that 42 thousand dollars out of the millions and millions and millions that have been given to that scheme so did you have a discussion that that committee about raising their living forget no I got what it usually was the discussion about whether it was tied to a particular sum or whether there was the ability to increase it and there was information going to come back to the committee on there it was one of the questions for you ask yeah it was a feeling informal meeting is as I after no meetings but since 2013 it was a bit like feely informal and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and though that information will come back unix meeting and believe he was one of those yeah thanks okay can I just say that it was actually a good meeting I had the feeling that sell one hadn 't been doing too much in the committee space so was I think they were quite pleased to get some momentum going again to ya know i think it 's it 's worked i think that that the letter from mia was was kind of a trigger for us considering and I guess that he and I both had an expectation that that would be that we would pull out but the decision of council was to remain and I think everyone 's accepted that that 's a good outcome and your arm will continue to contribute he 's young all right so i will put that motion all those in favor say aye so i suppose they know that 's carried and it 's not mad because we 're now got to 10 do,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

anything yep okay um beer would Pegasus I can 't see it Andrea here but there anyone should just come clean one of a couple of points to raise and I just like to draw a couple of things to it was 20 minutes in the first set of the reference and on page 616 to the item 7 about a discretionary response fund application to a local piece of artwork and I just like to sort of a simple tell Council is that it 's a quite an unusual situation with the land there the local community wanted to put this piece of artwork on the road edge as you come across bridge street heading into south near Brighton the road edge is not particularly wide at that place which doesn 't really allow for the artwork to sit in there so we were looking at the land adjacent to the to the road edge and at this stage it appears that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ownership of it so there 's a quite interesting piece of work going on to actually find out who owns the land and who has the ultimate permission so I 'm looking forward to the outcome of it the other one I just wanted to draw attention to is on page 121 the T walk an error higher self Brighton group who have taken over the use of an old Baptist Church there they applied to a Facebook campaign where a local company was offering to lift and repair the building and so many votes needed to be achieved to to get that across the board and I 'm delighted to say that they want it and that building will be restored for community use it has excellent potential for South frightened and will be I believe when it 's finished will be a huge asset for that area that some it 's lost that shopping center and as proposals to try and get that up and running again shortly so in terms of commercial and retail activity in that area is pretty light and this proposal hopes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cafe gallery and have been a venue for local cultural activities so I 'm absolutely delighted that they they won that good to have that building and checked up and repaired and they said it 'll it 'll be a huge asset for South bro there 's a real campaign on that on neighborly and all sorts of things I got love it yeah okay sir they did very well yeah we sort of couldn 't back them because they 're about three entries from the ward right you know you can 't go about you can 't choose whatever but so it and this is all okay with the owners of the property that they 're all yeah well they 're actually looking to releasing it but they would quite like to buy it so that 's another it 's the church I don 't think is the corner getting today but the churches and church isn 't interested in going back in the short term they will be leasing the building but they do have a desire to buy the freehold of it and that 's another project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be too yeah yeah I 'm just interested from the from the because there are a lot of well not a lot but there are different funds that they can apply to yeah not with own counsel but more broadly yeah so that great outcome it 's a great outcome thing did you want to displease we may just a couple of quick things one in relation to their mother rule cleanups event that we had a few weeks ago just some interesting stats it covered 158 kilometers above Dylan hunt from city care one point 16 square kilometers of land that covered and nine tons of rubbish was collected so that it was tremendous where we 've had a lot of learning we 've had a deep two other quick things in the next report relation to sudden place David mentioned kind of ambiguity over land ownership and this is where the slips into sudden places in an unusual space that kind of green red zone interface so we 're trying to push as hard as we can to get some resolution but we are in a holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then midway street just to give you heads up residents really want to know what will happen following the Dudley Creek option going down the middle and just looking at the robe renewal budget it 's 50,000 it 's not much so they just had a chat will follow it up but just let you know though they 're really wanting some answers went up head streets around them fixed such as Felicia Avenue and the other one leading down to the Tennis Club so just clarification is it Midway street west route that 's where the Dudley oh just wonder if we could seduce perhaps a street meeting through them sorry it 's just been brought up to me I said I go away and I 'll find out what 's happening but I 'm happy to do that to any way we can reinstate better roads as we go through but just think I 'm you know updating them on what 's happening with the land drainage program along there and telling them what we 're doing when we 're doing it and how and it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to achieve it yeah they have had communication from council but that in their view day they 're feeling like it 's mixed messages so it 'll be good just I think a single a meeting and maybe even a maybe even a newsletter you know I mean Carolyn 's given a really good example of how staff can really combine to put that effort in so maybe that would be a good way to resolve it and I must say that the land drainage communication team are doing a really good work with the comms the leaflets that they 're putting out now they look really good got good messages and getting good feedback it doesn 't say I think we 've found in the past that site meetings like Julius terrace went really well you wait to lose a lot of trees along Leah and that went really smoothly so if you want to progress that I 'm heavier yeah when we were doing some of the mouse movement stuff work right after the election you know that those those street meetings were invaluable you know that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in the street and answer

just that little joke okay okay so i 'll put in motion i doing fun things yea though just a couple of little things i just wanted to mention the camera on manchester street so the board resolved to fund that for one month we felt that with the poor weather over the two week free trial period that it that may have affected the number of working girls on the corner so and in fact that has been borne out with a couple of incidents at the weekend which we 're just police is falling back on or rather the camera people are spoiling back at the moment to see if they can pick it up it was a damage of a vehicle but we 're so we 're running that for another month but we do think it 's got potential citywide so we 're going to be looking at that but more broadly the other issue and it is becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in parking and side streets around places like Northland small we understand that the mall as part of its resource consent has to provide parking but we also believe that some workers are charged for that parking and that car park is lawful so it 's actually causing a lot of the side streets to be very choker and as a result rubbish trucks and things can 't get down there as well so we 're having probably at least one of these delegations a month at the moment concerned about the parking and that relates to the intensification and the aim to intensify homewise building wise and business-wise and our lord went into the medium density yeah meeting needs to proposal in the district plan so our boards nodded to submission and I think the chair mike is going to speak to that in July and he 's been working with the James evidence as well because they 'd say it 's a character Irion isn 't it I 'm they 're very concerned about the immunity around there and they 're also concerned about the parking as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes by and we don 't do more yellow lines approval surround Northlands and it 's spreading further and further out away from that activity area so it 's a big concern actually especially with the expansion splendor mm-hmm just I just wonder if there 's any ability for the council to through the consenting phase of these expansions whether we can actually insist that the these key activity centers supply more parking fooled their wrath with your staff clearly it 's causing a major issue around the streets and I just wonder when they build very large car back stake we saw us two and a half thousand car packs in that building but that an offer what they offer very little to their the staff they actually work in the place no and I think with Northman 's they were charging the staff to park this so they weren 't using it for quite a few years in putting pressure on the surrounding neighborhood now whether they 've removed that charge I don 't know because it is a ride around the city though I mean yeah it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mall evensen George 's Hospital you know it 's these key activity centers they do cause major issues if you made it difficult to park it on rules they might get on the bus and come to town and shop what yeah i mean like we 've got the same issue in eastgate where they had a non notified conceit and they were only required to provide i think a third of the car parking wall two-thirds of the carpeting were quite on the district web and now that that 's promoter in city area we 're going to have all sorts of not the same problem so we 'll be good to try and look at that through the consenting point of view I 'm making sure they are requiring give condition the demands i have you have as your board asked for a briefing on the expansion plans of them all and how the consenting let 's go no they 're not at that stage yet but we 're certainly up on some of the developments including this for most ten going in as well so we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well in these areas which are already pretty intensive that that 's one of the major concerns that 's coming in from residents as well but as you 're picking up on Pauline 's point around you know the public transport mode again here 's a situation where a key activity centers expanding and here 's a classic opportunity where we can actually integrate our public transport system which has happens all over the world and the ability to actually make these the character visitors put in some space to allow the connection of a public transport node as part of their expansion the railway line runs right behind Northlands yeah and there is a hub us xchange habit Northlands planned or am not sure should be 30 part of them all it should I get an update yeah and that was the good vibe a bit maybe we should just give an update across the cause of severe dissenters yeah you 're going to get the Northlands record ends expanding Bellamy skate well this is here 's the great opportunity where we put ash integrated so if we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Westfield and and we could do it with with east gate and the palms is a say great opportunities yeah alright so if we could get an update on all of the key activities seem to us that was being that would be great alright so that 's moved and seconded so i 'll put that motion

objective investigating the extent of housing problems including affordable housing in littleton and staff are also working with groups in the community to partner with the board in holding a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a few things that are happening from our board not forget anyone got any questions ok yeah thanks um I 'll just interested in the page 31 the deputation in the pipe kilometer at our speed I guess I mean we 've just had a briefing it out communities will run speed limits and we 've got 30k is being put on we 've got 40 KS in some areas and now we 've got another 135 k mm-hmm and one of the comments has been left in some of the community is quite confusing they have such a wide range sure what was the rationale 135 k well it 's because in this case it was because there is a sign on the bend where at the sentence just before this intersection that is one of those advisory type signs that tells you to slow down to 35 so that 's why this deputy picked on that particular number but the advice that the board got on this was that the NDP NTTA have advised council that they 're not going to do the routine speed reviews that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're just asking Council to focus on places where that traffic volumes have changed while they review the whole process for reviewing speeds on local roads so there will go on to our quite a long list of things that might be looked at in the future one net that new processes would get thank you been quite useful to get a update for counselors on I think I mean I wasn 't aware of that but sounds like it 's going to be a more integrated process I don 't know what NZTA got in mind for the process but look at an update I would not have her the cowl council as it comes through your committee filth well it 's going to Community Board year and in GTA during review to leave the June and after that we 're that 's that talking then it 'll come to chair a committee yeah I guess having the concern but last I think it was last year when we did this or the year before we had reports come to community boards they made recommendations so record and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been no ability for there 's only been in formal sort of feedback but there 's any no formal process for people who put forward speed limit errors but you can after june because recommended exactly the same again okay so we good questions I can we can do that yeah but see the sugar Scotty said they 've not been working work coming from NZTA brought to the council after June they are currently limiting a whole range and they 've sent us all that list of the ones that they 're limiting so they 're lowering speed limit and a range of streets and then after June we can put forward all the other ones that we want dealt with and we can start dealing with 30k areas and the 40k areas that a number of residents are saying that they want and it but I think yannis point around consistencies actually get destroyed yes so yeah yeah what I understood was that NZTA are a reviewing their process for allowing that the process that the council well overtures previously used if it could be good to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll just get them me my from them too so that we understand exactly what the cottage crazy says alright so I 've got a mover as an Andrew and the second is on ma Saleem of the motion all those in favor say aye thursday

to hearing from you I 'm talking about traffic safety thank you I 'm Kathy Baker I 'm a teacher at Romney school and also the bromley community center chairperson the children and I have been working hard to work on safety around the school and we have a huge concern with Romney Road so each of the children has prepared a little piece to share with you so here we go off you go baby thank you for allowing us on behalf of family school students to speak today about our concerns of the children cause it normally road to get to school asked I don 't wear over 40 liters of concern to the hadley fermi board we think we need a crossing as the cars and chats do not slow down and look for kids we 've had several students nearly hit as they ran across in front of cars this is a high traffic area as the trucks are using he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their children to walk to school it is impossible to cross bromley road in the morning without giving pitch we did a survey is in 10 minutes 100 vehicles mostly trucks went down Bromley wrote into Keeley 's we have a lot of parents with 5 year olds and preschoolers who don 't have cars who walk in the mornings and afternoons and due to the heavy traffic they get stuck on the side of the road and have to run across the rope so please support escal and give us some form of crossing thank you for your time mmhmm yeah we 've you know had a huge concerns with the children and we 've had three lately that have nearly been hurts particularly when the cars are turning from Keeley 's road into Bromley the cars don 't even lock their just what round the corner and often there 's a child in the middle of the road so we would really like some sort of support so our children can safely walk to school because we don 't want parents driving them when they could come by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this up like the Hagley ferry made community yes we have yes and that there 's been a positive response from the boy yeah my understand his staff originally there was no funding available so would have been elated to come to counsel and get funding but staff have found through operational budgets I think it 's about twenty five thousand dollars to make the safety improvements and the from the first of july in terms of a financial year and it 's my understanding that it 's and visitors to be done by the current calendar year so what I think also that there 's been a commitment from the staff to work with the school and the children around the design to make sure that your artists things that we can do to make sure that some you know it 's something that we appreciate that you 've raised and you should be involved in how we how we designer good well this is this is exactly what public participation is designed for to enable people to come and have to say about things that matter to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have come to make a presentation to council if any of you ever done that before tell her I did it was a very professional presentation that was great you can be very proud of yourselves I hope they get lots of fun lots of stars and the and the homework book we allowed to give them a night off homework watching so make it point at they can take Agni fear me board to do this deputation but there was a mixup in their timing so they had to leave if what I did your deputation so that 's why they here today due to do the devastation and give the kids a chance to have a have their say well we 're the winners I think that I think the counselors would like to thank you very much very much we chop Justin 's just wanted to add one other thing that probably didn 't come through the dictation but the school itself the the staff and the students and parents have put a huge amount of work into this as well and at the Bromley carnival they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on on the road so congratulations to all the artistic and and the other work that 's gone on there has been a lot of effort that won 't have been presented

organization serves primarily is a conduit for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ register we 've worked regularly with various agencies over the last few years and that register is available on our blog spot and for your information that register is maintained for us with City Council assistance through cinch and is available through there system among this group is the nominee from taverna tequila two tequila kotaku Catherine well outline our co papa as a group and you know and our Papa for you and I 'll add a few comments at the end before you head just before the opportunity to open up for questions Catherine your dress let me know a clear coat oh um just you 've had a one-pager spree circulated I don 't know if any of you have had the chance to look at it but one of the things I draw to your attention is the resource that we 're putting together on the valuing of third sector organisations let 's have a lot of input from a wide range of people and as Rex has indicated we work in a treaty-based way you have in front of you a copy of Chris horns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sarah did as a sort of a I think they call the legacy project that 's another resource there 's a forum on the seventh of July to look at the priorities that are established in that report but primarily today what we 've come for is to follow up Thank You cliff elk for this from the previous get together that we had with our statutory connections that 's what we call you your statutory connections at the end of last year we have actually now got a clear what a hunter o 'regan calls triage point with all of those except the Christchurch City Council and so what we 're looking for is a place to come with the issues we are we are working with a whole range of City Council staff and I 'm quite happy to give the details of that but it sort of feels like this sometimes not a connection between them and so what we 're looking for is a person who is in the Christchurch City Council who can can do what Hana is doing and at the moment in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commissioner Cagle has been identified to do and he can and so on so we just haven 't got anyone in the see City Council and that 's what we want so that 's really why we 've come today and we we do need to do some significant work on the register to make it more I think accessible but there are a lot of voluntary organisations with a lot of action that is voluntary in the city at the moment and I just want to finish with a quote which I will send you which was part of the PowerPoint presentation which comes from a lord in the UK in 1950 and the ants had this before there is an interest of the state that must not be controlled by the state therein lies the realm of voluntary activity and what we 're trying to do is to provide a worker on which all those voices can be carried with integrity so we have a lot more material we can share with you but that 's the point of coming today Rex did you have anything in addition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see the City Council look at right again and I 'm not sure the appropriate places that because I 'm sure I understand your system but writing into the you 're the way in which your groups operate that the there has to be a role here to consider the third sector is a partner in your consultation processes and we 're prepared to lace with you and talk about how that could be achieved a separate from what we 're talking about today we 'd also like to see the the staff and counselors if necessary recognize that the registers fear that it is available for the emptiest to check to see what the relevant community groups would be if they are in the consultation situation and we 're very very keen of course that you realize that we 're we 're here not to speak on behalf of those hundred and thirty groups we 're here purely to act as a conduit for you to communicate with those 130 and for those 130 to communicate back searle us with the relevant authorities and Christchurch Ernest is being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person with the City Council who could oversee the different connections that we need to make with the different parts of the council daughter does anyone want to ask a quick question or thank you very much and but I mean this is just a another engagement opportunity and and also to to speak to us but I think that through one of the committee 's will probably want to set up a more regular reporting arrangement or a meeting arrangement is it have to be terribly often it 's just every now and every now and again she that sort of is then we 're sort of going like here this Chuck 's yeah yeah all right thank you very much for coming yeah thank you what,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

you apparently you have a presentation for us few minutes hey what time is just a wonderful pose ok oh oh I 'm just gonna call that sitting on their side Oh put this off ok ok thank you so yours and so I just like to get the opportunity to welcome Ross open to the table so Morris is from ghd has been independently running this versus on behalf of the council so Morris has got a brief presentation and watch the background in case to clean spoon look what I wanted to do was just give a just a little bit of context to to the report cuz I 'm calm I 'm aware that what 's sitting in front of you is actually the terms of reference document that 's meant for an expert panel and I think for this discussion I wanted to give just a little bit of context about how we 've arrived at that reports in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just talk briefly about my role I 'd like to run through the process that we 've undertaken to get to get to the terms of reference it 's in front talk a bit about the principles that have been agreed when working with the community and also with council through that through this period and then finally just just provide some context around the terms of reference themselves and also the expert panel and hopefully what I 'm hoping that you will all agree here today all right ok so there 's the there 's a resolution that was some has put forward act from from this council in December last year and the bit that I wanted to focus on was this last sentence in particular bit around the details of which will be determined after consultation with affected communities and essentially that 's what I 've my role and what I 've been doing since since April of this year so I 've been working with communities develop the terms of reference the second part of that role is to point a peer review expert panel that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will respond to that Tim 's a reference and the third thing is to support the panel to deliver a final peer review report and and ultimately bring that back to Council here are the process to date so whoever started was was I was working with the community governance managers back in in March now they set up a number of community meetings with four of those in fact and they we had a range of respondents of this little community members that came to that ranging from sort of 22 200 at at a number of those events now some of the feedback i guess i wanted to share with you was I guess my observations from those meetings was that there 's there 's a real mixed views on the findings of the report from from the community there was really polarized views on the need to act on on the sides itself particularly around kind of climate change in and sea level rise and on the description of I guess how those those impacts would translate into the local environment here you know things like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wide range of views shared also in terms of the role of government and local government and in terms of responding to this and and also just what 's going on in the physical environment out there so there 's a real variety and the final point around that was there was a lot of mistrust in the process I guess to date and there was also even in the process of developing this terms of reference and and arriving at a point where those terms of reference and independent panel in their process so that was the feeling very much so on at the end of March and an April when we had those meetings since then what we 've done is we put nominations out to the community and for the community to to nominate members for for a community representative group and that group is a group that I would work with more deliberately to develop the terms of reference and that was important because it was quite difficult to deal with 18,000 people or even or even the two or three hundred people I gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process so so we had people from put forward from New Brighton South Bryson South Shore Sumner diamond harbour and an acre or so from devotion and so a really good representation from a wide group of of communities that were identified within the report so I 've worked with that with that group from from April mid-april through to mid-may we 've had we 've had two very long meetings and lots of debate and deliberation with the nose and we 've worked very much owned by phone in and online to arrive at the document that so that 's in front of you now the two things we looked at work with it that the drafting of the terms of reference and the second was on the the list of experts so that list of experts was informed by the community so they put for their seduced suggestions and and all residents have the ability to do that we informed that process as ghd in terms of approaching a range of experts from across New Zealand and internationally to come to come forward as part of a process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been debated by the the community reference group and they 've and they putting forward as you 've seen in the report their recommendations of of the panel that they would like to see taken forward through to to engage in the teens reference and that 's leading us to hear that where the terms of reference being heard today so that 's the process today so what I wanted to I guess here with some general principles that have come out in in that engagement with communities that started with the the the bigger meetings we 've had with them with the communities as well as through with that community representative group so the first principle is is this real desire to have transparent and open process through you know through this process but also just engaging on this issue the second is that is this notion that all questions that were raised so with our raised at the community meetings where they sent through through submissions to us and we had we had over a hundred submissions we had over 60 phone calls long phone calls and durations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those questions raised should be visible to all so there should be visit visible to the council they should be visible to the community at large and also to the peer review panel as well so they just get a feeling for the range of questions and initiative in roseburg community the third point there is it there 's a real desire to keep this moving as what I 've heard within the community not to the detriment of good process but there 's there 's certainly a kind of a desire to seek to move towards resolution of a number of issues and I think that 's a that 's important and that community group that I 've worked with over the last month have worked very hard to get to a point where this terms of references in front of you today the general aim when I was working with that community group was was towards consensus we didn 't achieve that all the time part of my role I guess was to go with the majority when when we needed to push that forward and move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and collaboration respect safety I think you know I think it 's been a lot of issues and pointing around individuals through this process so wants to make sure that we can remove a lot of that through through how we operate I 'm an integrity so it 's you know it 's constructive it 's open and we 're doing what we 're saying doing so that some those are the kind of values that I 've shared and we 've agree and working with Q through this process and the final point was around taking steps to address bias and and so what do I mean by bias is that is it all of you and everyone here has a view in pertaining to two lots of these but in this issue in particular as I 've already sort of intimated these are polar views around a lot of these things within that within the community so how do we take steps to remove bias and and I think we ended up with a really good group of people as part of the community representative group that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had to work through that too right to work towards consensus and that 's similar when we 're thinking about and pointing a group of experts to you know to review what is you know considerable issues sitting and and and I guess we 've looked at a number of ways to do that and in one way is to ensure that we 've got at least three scientists because the Mon may slit mostly a science-based review three scientists who are on that panel so they can remove any kind of bias and they can bring me their expert knowledge and views to this okay finally around the principles is just I guess questions around the the the responses or actions so we had to agree what was our scope and what was very much in scope was was around the science and methods and data and things used within this report that some forming decisions to be made what this wasn 't about a lot of respondents responses that we 've had from the community have been about about what are we doing about this risk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and can we kind of get some some movement eyes at those areas so this is not about that right now the scope of this review is not about management options it 's not about defenses you might want to put in place around risk like this it 's not about the need for additional monitoring or policy responses or even what goes on limbs and you know it sort of suggests have been working quite costly of community just to ensure that actually this is about the science the reports and decisions we made feed into this and that at some point these things need to be examined in some point of future so the terms of reference themself so the scope of the of the review as agreed with that group is is to review the report so this is the report is undertaken by tomconn and Taylor around hazard assessment so around the coastal environment so so very much the report but also the brief that was report that was provided to tomconn Taylor and that they responded to so that 's in scope for for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to to look at that brief but also is to look at the reports adherence to national policy and statutory requirements so so I sit I sit on a leash a team within a engineering environmental and planning consultancy and obstinate often we refer to national statute or policy to inform our assumptions or methods or direction that we take and this is what 's been asked of the penalty is to look at those national policy and statutes and just ask the question have they been used appropriately within the the findings of report and the methodology in sump shins be made okay and then I guess that fine point there is that really we want the panel to access all information so what you see is a short terms of retro two terms of reference with appendices which is all of the background information has been provided okay now responding to the questions raised so so that 's it 's a big undertaking for any peer review panel to try and respond to every individual question that 's been raised by the community in this regard and and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to happen and certainly that 's a view of the community reference group as well is one that in addressing the questions we want them to look at a range of things so first one them to look at is the question relevant to the scope of the peer review we all I want to desert to look at sure the question be addressed in the report or should have been interested in the report and if it has has the question sufficiently been addressed within the report and then what we also want to make sure that we give skype to experts we 're going to Commission experts let 's ask them to recommend or guy or provide any guidance that the panel might want to provide around how we could address some of those questions if they feel irrelevant going forward okay then the experts so there 's only one point I really wanted to make here is that the community reference group had put together a have have recommended their panel of experts that they would like this goes long deliberation around this and and what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no guarantee that those five people have been put forward are the ones that that we will be able to secure in the coming weeks should we want to move forward next because they themselves are only seen as terms of reference in the same time frame that you 've seen it too so I 'll need to be negotiating with them and making sure they 're comfortable with the role they 're going to play and and one of those five might suggest to that they might come back and say well look they don 't want to so that 's why I wanted to put up a wider group of shortlisted experts that are there so where has been a very long list it 's come down to a shortlist that short list in my view is as a a group of people that some that the community represent represent ative community would be fairly comfortable with I don 't believe that all there 's going to be ever ever absolute consensus around that and that 's something you might need to work through if we don 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's next so after today hopefully what we do is will appoint a peer review panel they will they will respond to the terms of reference now the set that we 've asked to put into that the community represented group have asked is that is that we get a draft of that review report that comes from the panel and both the community screw and the council get the opportunity to review that and then go back with any points of clarification and then there 's a time period that the peer review panel can respond to that and and then a final report will come and come to the council and there 's a again I reciate the width is it there 's a timeline that were a me full hedge but should that timeline need to change then you know in for whatever reason for example the pair of you don 't believe they can actually do their work within that time frame then we might need to change that okay so what I 'm hoping degree is is to get broad acceptance of the two of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a range of questions and there that need to respond to but actually it 's I really thus the intent is that the peer review panel assist those questions in their own right allowed Lee experts that 's what we want them to do and also to agree the shortlist of experts you know starting with the nominations that have been made by the community reference group I just wanted to make you aware that this information and the process and we keep regular updates out to the communities a website up and running we send out every every fortnight an update to those community members who are registered interest we send that information out and you know and moving forward I think there 's you know there 's a guess and observation for myself is a real desire from the community to tackle everything through this process you know including the solutions with solutions we talked about but I also think that we 've now appointed broad recognition that this is just one of those steps that we 're going to have to take you know to gain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ munich community and the actions that both council and the community needs to take responsibility my own view is actually there 's an opportunity to build on this process around how you bring the council and community together once once this peer reviews been undertaken but that 's you know that 's like it sets my own view on a ship II thought well thank you very much that that 's an excellent presentation and I have to say that you know it 's been hugely challenging assoc for for the council and I think that we got to the position that we got to because we were in a rush through the replacement district plan review process and we were required to do every single chapter of our district plan I think if we 're going to do it lessons learned from our experience the lesson would be that in a post disaster environment if you 're going to use it as an opportunity to review your district plane just choose the areas that need to be done in response to the event and allow a longer time frame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community engagement and I think the model that has arisen out of what was a disastrous entree into the coastal hazards arena is a superb model I 've been quoting the can soon motto you know when it set itself up what one of them mottos was the wisdom of the community always exceeds the knowledge of the experts and I don 't believe that 's that 's correct I believe that the knowledge the knowledge of the community no sorry the wisdom of the community coupled what the knowledge of the experts always produces more than one can do on its own and it 's the collective wisdom of the community and their knowledge and experience of the environment that they live in and and some of the history of the area that obvious that may not be documented but people have got great memories that you combine that with the wisdom of the experts and you end up with a really good model for engagement so I just think that this is a stunning piece of work that we 've seen but we 've started off down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm the in my coastal erosion to zone and I received a letter from you to invite me to participate in the process and I 'm nowhere near the coastline so it was it has been a stunning process and everyone that got those theatres knew that they could engage and register with the process but I didn 't register because I trust the process so thank you very much Glen Phil Yanni I thank you and just on the processes at your sense that the community does own this process where our red zone meeting last night about process and the community you know they decided how they wanted to be engaged with they call the shots so are you you sense that over this dude do I see to do ever since that they own the process I think I think that this is you know this is about collaboration ultimately and and do you know there was a real sense of of emotion at the you know at the outset from those folks first those first meetings and that my guess might sense around that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know the more that we can involve and get and get communities involved in that process I think I think a better outcome because it 's no doubt in my mind that hazards generally are things that need to be owned by the community and as well as counsel and other organ oh and student organizations and it really requires real collaboration well and I want to ask you about the links with communities to because clearly not only the local communities who 've been directly involved who have effects most immediately had been fully involved but given that it also affects every community across the city I 'm just wondering about the in terms of the recommendations of the panel and clearly it 's an illustrious group of scientists and end unpeopled legal if appropriate expertise but i 'm just wondering given how important the community part is if they could not within the terms of reference be a second local scientist expert in addition a given and probably especially because our local geography scientists would have the best knowledge for example of Pegasus Bay in the coastal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a still scope to strengthen the local science component on the panel I 'm not sure we get this back up on the screen here we go so so we 've canvassed a number of local scientists through the through the process and and some of them have have taken them out of the process or being seen to be conflicted by the community representative group either because of the past I guess involvement with with the authors of the report or with council themselves and so that that made a quite challenging until finding local representation Martin single who 's up there is available and could be included as part of that process I my view is is is visit you know there 's a cost issue altima tlie as well in terms of how many people you want to get involved I think three scientists is a good is a good number whether you want to you know include another local scientist we take out one of the Nationals of the port or or international I think clearly it has national implications it does um but equally this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to get it right you 're all agreement on that so yeah I guess it just seems to me that if you have a combined dual local specialized scientific knowledge on that panel that may well assist getting the best result I 'd agree with that and don 't think it getting hard agree with it um Yanni yeah um thank you very much I was really outstanding presentation and it 's really comforting to hear just how but you 're working with the communities and its really really really great I was just I just had to come questions really what one was do you have any concern that people in some of the areas that aren 't traditionally associated with the coast have been sort of left out of this process so I thought I better leader yeah well I understand that but when you think about coastal erosion and coastal inundation obviously for people that live on in the coastal environment they 're quite you know probably more well well aware of the issues the people in lumber Walston you know bromley i note on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one from that area so yeah that it Gaffaney by dinner fired or is that an area that you 're seeking to them I worker so so certainly the people that were identified being affected with in bromley and you know in those areas they they certain got a letter and and i know they were a number who attended some of the community meetings as well and and and were you know were able to nominate people through to that process to so in terms of process i 'm feeling comfortable there was the ability for those affected people to feed into that process i think there is a there there is acknowledgement in that in that hazards whether the coastal or others actually affect everybody in the city and and you know i think i 'm looking a long way forward you know how you engage with with the wider community christchurch around hazards i think is is really important and then the second question was i 'm just still not quite clear about the relationship with the current district plan review so for example in areas been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle of these coastal inundation zones and it just seemed to me but kind of odd that you would have yo the peer review happening but then also at the same time you kind of approach to intensify housing and then like that limit area when that area is subject to this review the Christian or what how is this review performing the current district nine work I mean I thought initially the whole purpose of this was to reduce intensification or development in areas and it 's the end point yeah no that 's after we process the information so we actually haven 't done the coastal hazards chapter this all inform the work that we will do on the coastal hazards chapter which we will not mince until after the amazement district plan exactly commencing a system of intensification and one of the areas that thing with you yani that 's not for this question you know it 's this is the person that we 're brought on top to help us do it preach teach me a review of the Tolkien and taylor report your question is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you know do you think would be wise to halt the intensification proposals until this peer review spanking the leaders yeah ok get thankfully and I you know I don 't think it 's it 's it 's in my it 's not my role to comment in terms of the the policy and an even infrastructure or other decisions whilst we go through this process you know I do think that this process needs to feed into wider discussion and debate about policy as well as infrastructure in other decisions and I dearly i will get to that point it 'll feed into that process yeah um thank you very much um Jimmy okay thank you yeah at two questions the first one regarding the timeframe especially from today here the third of june in only eight days in my right until next friday you need to engage five categories different especialista science that may be legal adviser and also the kind of another expert to whether one weekly is too optimistic or not so so I 've already been quite engaged with all of those experts yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all prepared and we 're really waiting for the outcome of the decisions made here today i will be i 'll be in contact with them directly after this you know our first meeting at from tomorrow to start negotiations that need to go into the terms of reference so so they 're all aware they 've all said to me direct that they are available they 're available through the timeframe that we 've specified here to feed into this process and what they 're not aware of is the detail with in terms of reference they 've got that now through this public process and and over the over the coming days and week i will be i 'll be getting their feedback on the terms of reference and and in negotiating the contractual arrangement arrangements to start undertaking this work yesyes it okay thank you i 'm confident that we can do that that 's good your second question ships well hello you can total us roughly the coastal regarding to lease the kind of peer review course laughing ruff so yeah yeah yeah look I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about that once i 've gone through that negotiation of the last week look I would expect that you you know this is that they 're experts there 's quite a fair bit of work for these for this group to to work through I think it 's really important that we have a legal representation for somebody like shown or Gordon as examples they 're great people have been able to bring that together into one outcome and and they 're worth the wait God so so how long 's Peter shrink you know it could be anywhere between 15 and 30 thousand as an example but I haven 't got clear figures on that yet okay thank you David no look I actually decided that my comment was more of a point of debate and I 'd like to just probably signal my desire to move this paper and I 'll reserve comments to the bait ok so it 's moved by David seconded by clin I 'll open it up for debate well look I 'd like to flag an amendment to add an additional member if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be my point of my debates ok that might be good well well it could I just make the point here then that I think and still reserving my right to reply to the debate I disagree with them and what we have approved an independent and transparent will community reference group and I think it 's like a hearings panel they 've come back to us with a recommendation we either accept it yeah listen it 's my view too but a counselor is entitled to move in a minute so so we 've got a motion that 's been moved and seconded an amendment as to add an additional representative who has problem i would say it from the ship from the shortlist that 's been provided with with us for so besides dr. Deirdre heart it was really on on the pit recommended for the panel that we also include dr. Martin single okay so do I have a seconder for that Pauline um right ok location all those names have been okayed by the community groups victory yes so yes now I 've asked that exact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy with all of the names that are on there I 'm broadly I would suggest that this bossy not might not be consensus I think there 's broad broad agreement of the heavy I certainly think I certainly think from my arm from my dealings that I don 't think there be any objection to Martin that 's good Steve okay so so I open it up for debate I 'll open it up for debate and but i 'll put that but you 're debating the amendment and the resolution and then i 'll put the amendment and i 'll put the resolution at the end so David would you like to kick off the debate on the on the moon on them on the motion on the amendment we know we 're we 're going to do it all in one debate so if people could speak to the amendment as well if they want to as well as the as well as the resolution but you 've already spoken to the amendment but if you want to lead off the debate I 'd rather did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get a writer report I 'll get a ride okay um I 'd like to probably be unbusy yeah I disagree with phil on the in the amendment of putting an extra panel member on here I believe that we have gone to great lengths to avoid any involvement of council staff council laws or anyone else in this process we have turned it over to a totally independent group and as I said a moment ago they are an independent community reference group that we 've set up and I believe that their findings should be treated as if we were receiving a hearings panel recommendation we either agree with their their recommendations we reject their recommendations or we send it back for further consideration I don 't believe that we should be altering the the report that we have before us here today and I actually totally reject the amendment and I 'll speak I 'll carry on I suppose I 'm this is a subject that 's been very close to my heart for a long time and it sort of goes right back to when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us in Council and I was the only one that voted against its adoption subsequently that report was used to as the basis for our district planning process with coastal hazards planning and mapping was predicated on that report that then evolved into a considerable amount of angst in our community with the coastal hazard mapping and coastal inundation mapping that resulted and eventually after quite a lengthy period of appeal to the independence hearing panel the government removed our that we need to do our district plan in that area we then called for a peer review also I 'll just backtrack the one of the issues that has given rise to this call for a pair of years the fact that 6,000 plus residents have information on their lumps that we as a result of the local government act are required to take note of and whether whether or not we agree with the report that we have we are required to acknowledge it so consequently that 's led to a further calling for an independent peer review process we 've gone down that track now I hace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we weren 't going to be totally independent that council staff would have a nun fluence over over the process and i met with Morris last night and I said to him that I I had some initial reservations and the fact that he had an involvement with a road show with Tonkin and Taylor but look I 've been kept in the loop with this process for several months now Brendan and Clive have had regular meetings with me just keeping me up to date with the process that 's been evolving I have had extremely favorable reports from the members of that community reference group who have worked tirelessly over a long long period they have had meetings that have gone for an excess of five hours debating a number of questions and scenarios that have been posed to them so look I 've looked at the the report that we have before us here today and I have absolute confidence and the the scope of works that we have commissioned Morris and his team to do and I look I would urge people to look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scope of the peer review and I 'll just read the paragraph amia the purpose of the peer review is to provide the community and the council with a nun partial and expert view on the data methods and assumptions used within the report when responding to the brief set by the council and doing so the peer review panel might want to review and critique the terms of reference provided by council and the peer review review brief and report by the hume consulting i think this is all encompassing and there are a number of four bullet points below that of really specific questions that drill down into the whole core of how this panel was going operate the final but was item seven of its own Morris alluded to before that we are in this process getting a draft back of the peer review at which time both the independent reference group and council will have the opportunity to to look at that report and address any questions of clarification that may be required before finalizing the report and the last sentence in there the report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not those of their respective organizations and for me that is the key part of the whole peer review process that we have engaged in a process that 's totally separated from our council staff ourselves and we have come back with what I believe is a very comprehensive and all-encompassing recommendation and for us to be suggesting alteration to that I think is totally outside the the terms of reference we have set the squirt and I 'm very happy to recommend that we adopt the report and the shortlist of expert panel members as presented to us today so and you will accept that that you 'll write a reply as well come it will accept that you 're right I should have put the timer up for the timing but you 're okay with that you might want to die I mean I honestly think you know because there are the area is that right thank you clean thank you I just want to very quickly just touch on which I something which i think is very pigment that 's the dynamic that sits behind so what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is about humanity owning the process it 's about thoughtfulness and respect it 's about similar things we heard last night at the process over future engagement over the residential red zone what I see here is a shift along the iap to spectrum from and forming which we did to collaboration and I think that 's what 's really critical here now that the person 's that 's been proposed to be added to the committee I don 't have an issue with the merits or otherwise of the person their skills whatever but I actually do have an issue on the basis that it hasn 't come from the community and I think how it will come across it will be interpreted as another kind of council doing this to us so look I 'm not against you know Paul on Phil and Pauline 's suggestion or on the grounds of the Pearson it 's just that this is so sensitive it 's about the process so i actually won 't go with it on mostly filled um look there 's a sensitive really to every community in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some additional expertise but how can that actually be wrong in terms of arriving at the best science and and that 's the object were not objective is to check does a report represent good science and an end and modern single is on the shortlist we 've had from morrison and fat and his view that the local and community reference group wouldn 't get to dr single being part of the panel it 's really it i think the whole point is how do we make sure that this is best value for money given that it this is a huge investment by this council and end its part to me having its scientific expertise as as the mayor said fits alongside and it actually adds to the expertise and knowledge and wisdom of the community so it just to me makes total sense that you strict that you strengthen the panel and like it may well be that one of these members isn 't available anyway but they 've both been shortlisted on on page 167 and I just think to a part that needs to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expertise around Pegasus Bay and this these two people dog due to jahar and in dr. Singhal have studied this for a good period of time they all of that information is right at their fingertips I 'd urge counselors to include that expertise so that this council gets the tonkin and taylor report right um yani and then Paul yeah oh thank you um look I mean you know like a number of us would have received letters through the post and we could have chosen to engage but actually you know I had confidence as the mayor has stated that it was really important that we did actually stand back as a council to give the community confidence in the process so I strongly endorsed the points that have been made previously around actually there 's been a very clever of community process around the appointments of the panel members and I personally can 't see any need for us to change that now and I do worry about the signal that that will send to them people that have on top of all the other stresses they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all the drama that happened previously but putting all the good work at risk of us coming in at the last minute and putting an additional person on the panel I think isn 't worth it so it 's strongly urge cancers to allow the community process to do its thing and wait until we get that peer review and then make judgement is to the quality of the information and if you wish and if you want more advice then then go for it but at the moment I really don 't want to get in the way of what I think we 've heard the presentation I think it 's been an outstanding process and i would strongly urge counselors to reject the amendment Paul look I just wanted or see everything that 's being said so far but also acknowledge the work that has been done it not only that both the experts hear it but by the council for step I 'm saying we 've made a mistake but move too quickly and we haven 't got it right we 've actually stepped back engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on straight away but here we are today we 've got the process right I 'm really really comfortable it causes a huge amount of angst amongst the coastal areas in particular but I also want to take a yannis point around making sure that we we do continue to talk to those people through bromley or out through Linwood to the to the Lancaster park areas which does come under some issues with projections are correct in the future so I just like to make sure we do still continue and talk with those communities make sure they are fully aware of what 's going on but I 'm really really heavy to support us here I 'm happy to support the the amendment to go along with it and i look forward to getting this process underway so we can make a good solid decision well done Andrew and yeah I certainly understand and respect the arguments that Phil puts in support of the amendment madding the extra name but on this one I respect the view of the ward councillors who are closest to the affected communities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I think this has been a really good and really collaborative process I defer to the ward councillors who are closest to the communities on this one it 's so important that we get this right so whilst I understand the arguments of adding the additional expert I 'll be supporting the resolution but without the amendment I also feel the same way I think that you know that things did not get off to a good start because we were in such a rush and under so much pressure we 've got time now to step back from the process and I think yannis Woods was spot on that 's stepping back and allowing somebody with some independence to lead the process an engagement and a truly engaged process with our communities I just think as as a process that I want to support as well so it so I won 't support the amount either so on that basis can I put these in madam chair could I just point out and the two reference from ghd on page 16 six months even have a short list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community reference group have nominated its preferred expert panel and as Morris and assisted we still do need to go through a process with with us the five all the sex that have been individually identified in I 'm just wondering if one of those wasn 't able to participate in the peer review the intention would be then to go back to the short list on page 166 and 167 and to continue to work through replacement within one of those categories yeah but i think that the replacement has to be within the category because otherwise admissible wraps just so the international national and local yes yes the next muted so so is that do we need to change anything on this I just wonder the recommendations a and B and a find that if you were to make a resolution specific to I had a sneaking feeling it 's not going to pass I think what they 're saying really is that the would put the actual shortlist up there sorry the actual recommended panel but and are we sort of by that recommendation confining ourselves to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the protocol 's too short to prove the recommended list of expertise to form the panel and any anyone that end to sub stand to allow substitution with an elephant shoe question within the shortlist shoreless relevant category the relevant category of the shortlist should they not be available yes yeah okay so we 'll put the amendment first body busily right up those words and the amendment is that Martin single be added to the panel and that 's been moved and seconded so i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye aye those opposed say no no that 's lost but I will have a show of hands tho those in favor what she are those would bother me let 's just see if ya the amendment are you mean my moment is the one you wanted course for them to go yeah you fix your woody I got ya I just need a mean that I mean boo movement its fills them in that those of me you 're actually voting to Orlan does it i think it just all right was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be just the amine mouse so those in favor of the amendment amendment those are men think you 've a she 's got my payment to that I just scroll down it 's just that Martin single pitch a dirty bastard did you earn it only the amendment Roger so who 's in favor of the amendment i likewise rolling here and those opposed yes right so that 's lost be so now the resolution as as it stands just tidied up there to at our substitution from the short lists should any of them have that from the relevant category of the shortlist yeah yeah Kevin peruvians um all right i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much sure is excellent we were right and we will now adjourn for lunch so we 've taken out okay have passed the two returns okay thank you","(-43.5320214,

NZ,NZ,Christchurch City Council,Christchurch City Council,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZETwErnCvvgbvBbnnHfyxA,26.5.2016 - Item 8 - Social Housing Portfolio Red Zone Compensation,-nIFmgSeQHc,20160526,827.43,"Christchurch, New Zealand",2381,bought from community housing red zone compensation I have a question myself on us which is have we have we provided sufficient money you know like that and unkind you know like with there was a decision to transfer for 4.2 95 million dollars with property to compensate for what have been lost in terms of the what was taken out by a red zone so have we actually got there with this amount of property yes the total amount of the list of properties there 's four point two nine six but following the chip meeting for the parks or park-like properties were taken out so the remaining list won 't meet that amount so we 're going to have to come back with a number the number three point five five seven when you don 't include them yes so without those it doesn 't meet the requirement so but I thought they were being removed or they just left there yeah maybe it maybe if I can make some comments cuz i met with angus and other members of the property team yesterday or a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the facts that were included in the list particularly considering that list this list was meant to be a list of properties that could be transferred without hopefully a need for consultation without a need for community board involvement or any of the issues that might be raised by the reserves act been involved in any of the properties as well so there were some concerns expressed around these parties been on the list and that 's the reason that they 've been separated out in that separate resolution 3 so there 's a further report will be coming back on those properties which I had questioned whether could be brought to this meeting today so that we get some early resolution on this I 'm advised that the property team needs some further legal advice and there needs to be a full report brought back which will need to come to the committee and we 'll be coming in July so that will allow us to resolve that issue the wording of resolution 3 refers to any other properties that may be available so or may be suitable so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it turns out that the part properties are not suitable or available and we just had some concerns of the committee that you know park you would assume by definition would be public open space something the community boards and communities would have an opinion about and therefore that there was a concern that appeared on this list of property that might be able to be simply transferred without a need for consultation so we 'll need to wait for that to come back to the committee clearly if the park properties are not suitable to be considered part of this list we will need to look for substitutions to make up the full amount that needs to be transferred as per the resolution on page 78 it 's the Petrie part 1 I couldn 't quite relate the picture to the hits so the tech this is at the an attachment a but it says site of the form of Richmond MSA bowling club located within tea tree park the bowling club is now being demolished and the cupboard knows future use for this land so it didn 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the picture looks like you are no we are the bowling clubs that white area the two square Ares to the bottom but green space are talking about the whole park and that 's where the committee 's consumes word is that the decision has been made to take the park out of the parks network but that we don 't believe has been made directly and with consultation so good on it sorry who made that decision grant green space no no but they don 't get to know and that 's exactly what we 're saying so your cheek committee with the reporter and ourselves privately cheek committee see we need to revisit how that decision as being a or it doesn 't sound like it 's a decision not just sounds like it the oceans a recommendation from within the organisation so it hasn 't been through a process you correct right meets wire in the sweater bus was there two different issues one is the former bowling club area or is it or is that still now regarded as a part of ptree part I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing needs to be considered so this is exactly what we 'll need to them so when people have but it make you want it it 's exactly why we have this resolution here okay yeah all right thank you I gleaned yeah thank you just something I thought since this meeting anchors there about 25 dwellings roughly in there that I can identify Emily would be currently suitable to see look number two I think all but one of those is actually living money is not 25 you know and I may have the figure wrong I was trying to identify how many works big Wellings but how many other is only I was northcote road pages Road grays Road carries run for Sonny five dwellings they 're all those are power road properties just empty sections you know I think all but one of those five are suitable to be loved in and are being loved him anything all four of them for ya it 's it I mean it 's just coming out we 'll wait for the report being but I just I just thought that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have the value that 's been attached to them but you know checks I guess up to the I mean it will want to see that the resolution as as as meat meat you know in terms of the numbers so the numbers will have to add up at the end of the day alright so do are you moving your habit of emotion seconder when you 're doing a discussion yeah yeah I mean I know we want to get more information back but some like picture park I don 't know why we keep it on lost I just don 't think we should be getting rid of green spots and that 's why so no it 's not I don 't think that all of those as seeker through the report on the platform us stood below in any other world is very suitable say it isn 't what I just wanted to know was when that report comes back or I guess what I would strongly encourage is that we actually look at not just the value of getting rid of those no no no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's all been disgusted butt cheek nutty come on sir it is not it is not the intention to include these hearts properties we 've asked for further work to be done they may come back and I know that the Petri park residents in that area are very concerned about seeing that part actually being redeveloped as a proper part for their area so you know that this is not a decision to do anything with the parts lights but also to look at them carefully and as I say there are two components to that petri part one is the former bowling club site so you know it 's also the same for Beverly Park yes yes exactly the same so that 's great so we 're gonna get a listing report back around the future yes yes well no you 'll get you 'll get a report back that talks about the requirements around consultation in terms of local government act and decision making no no no no no no I think I bother your full options report on what you can do with those properties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list and deal with them separately so he knows remove Beverly Park and Petrie part from this we will we will get a different mechanism for reporting if that 's the case because that is not the intention I think from the cheek committee yeah certainly the the comments that were made at the meeting that discussed this list in the beginning there is no intention on the part of the committee to be selling any parts that are in current public users at a public open space that might be subject to the reserves act where we 'd fully expect the community and the control to be interested or if we 're going to make a decision to remove them as I say I 'd hope to be able to do that today I think we need to do that on good advice we need to know exactly what it is that 's been considered but there 's no intention from the comments that were made at the initial committee meeting to be removing any parks from the network as part of this decision yeah or quite possibly at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the list because and and then I think that the staff are going to have to work with your committee as a in terms of a process for actually addressing some Parker she 's so it and it 's a set pradesh a so there are two issues that come up as a result of that one is the issue around the parks and how they ended up on the list and how we deal with those but the second is that there 's a quantum of funds that are required to fulfill the original resolution on page 78 that will not be met the numbers that will not be met with these properties removed from the list so we also need to find substitutions for the same value so that we can meet the transfer requirement yeah yeah can we take also having such off please but my understanding from the parks unit will we 'll talk parks with the property is that it was not green space so some of this land was where they 'd brought neighboring properties to land bank potentially for future use or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space but with bowling clubs and another it was that had some extra land war potential driveways so the parks area which I checked with CID Nana none of this land was actually current green space at all so so it 's not intended to reduce to I understand that but Damon side drive we 've got a like in the middle of a dance I drive at the moment we 've got rid zone infrastructure and plans that we still haven 't with room what we 're going to do and depending on what the outcome is there it actually may be quite strategic to put an in-house ecosys where this property is but we don 't know that we 're not going to know that for until then wings of stuff so you know that 's what I can 't see any sense and desperate could we take can we just remove the two that remove that part of the thing and change the resolution so six have further report on any other properties that may be suitable so that way when we 're just removing it because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have asked that we don 't take action on land is contiguous to red zone lind and we made that quite clear in an earlier resolution in relation to the use of pirate park which is right slap bang in the middle of residential red zone because there are a lot of issues that we 're going to have to address as a city in relation to infrastructure access all of those issues in relation to the residential red zone in terms of future use so I don 't think it 's appropriate to transfer that to the housing portfolio at a time that we 've asked for contiguous land to the residential redesigned to be treated quite quite independently so is that all right so the mover and seconder comfortable with the change where we 've ended up am I agree that we need to seek further reports on properties that may be suitable but we still so as it stands at the moment there 's nothing in this resolution that deals with the parks properties any differently than the rest of the list so as this stands at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make all decisions necessary including on these Park properties so if we 're removing or the pad properties so they 're the ones in the original option three so is there something in the resolution that shows that they 're gone though yeah that 's not there none of the none of the properties Alyssa this is seeker further so that you have a mother country news and their remote Connecticut yeah yep nice fine i console with that is it 740 that we need to make it was that I thought the resolution of good counsel was lower than their so 739 was the value of the parks properties the ones that we 're removing yes I know but I thought that the resolution the original resolution that the council resolution was compensation of 4.2 95 million and there so you takin things you can use the absolute 0 I seem right right right yeah yeah yep ok all right so i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

quickly yes yes I 'll get it inspector who would like to second the motion Andrew are there any questions oh so you 'd like to pay them just want to talk to about the safe city strategy and here we go for we are I became chair of the committee March last year I 'm not into a number of issues requiring actually addressing first was the city had lost its safe city accreditation that 's the World Health Organisation safe city accreditation it got suspended and second we need to refresh the strategy to make sure is tough for purpose for post-earthquake there and some of the issues were facing in our environment the Refresh also allowed us to look at restructuring the committee 's I noted that just didn 't have the right decision makers around the table to actually drive the changes that we need to see and we also want to strengthen the Alliance and the partnerships which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe city Kreutz crisis ready is a citywide strategy and it 's not owned by the Croatia City Council however the council has taken a lead role than the implementation of the safe city safe crushing strategy and it 's actually mandated through the local government act and through the long-term plan 2015 to the 2025 it should also be noted the strategy compliments of many other strategies and initiatives that have been developed to keep our city safe so over the next five years the plan is to focus area bits on implementation of a range of actions that will contribute to safe city improving connections between those who are working to make crisis to safe places to live work and visit and collectively we can achieve results unless you make a difference this is why a number of one priority and the strategies to build proactive partnerships that have a shared commitment to safe city and I 'd also like to also invite you all to the reaccreditation which we will get back on the 7th of June and I 'd also like to acknowledge share the staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and team and getting this safe city strategy on the table of frontiers today and getting our accreditation back in june next year we were the first large will the largest city in new zealand to actually get accreditation and having it suspended was actually bit of a disappointment here we are today mm-hmm new strategy something we can work correctly with our partners and we have a lot of partners and delivering the strategy so what part of this therefore any questions no no I 'm gonna I asked if it were any questions so I think there 's a lot of support supporter very so quick question around I can take it offline uh yeah I guess no um yeah I was one ish it with the debate I think kara clear but this way to talk about there 's one thing is raised by yanni around son Jaden and clear does have an outcome on there so if she could a six-year the ability to say that she said it it 's fine yeah thank you and I spoken briefly with you for the earlier than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they responded bet by saying that this is in relation to some shades and playgrounds around prostitute that they 're currently working on the parks plane recreation facilities network plan and they 'll be considering shades and in playgrounds it 's a fair way off so I 've instructed one of my staff and the youth and children 's advisor to do a bit of an audit of the playgrounds and throughout the city and have a look they aren 't get that bit through the shed commercially as soon as possible questions the other equals the address 1 equals my question clear and I fetch the government it 's just how is the safeness policy or strategy how do we have it linked to other aspects of sort of wider safety for example like civil defense or sewer you say cute local community flood defence work which has also be done as well it 's hundred percent consistent with the resilient strategy which we 're working on now that that we 're going through so in its that the consistency that 's what I looked at for was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this dream ultimately that we won 't need a squillion strategies we 'll just have one strategy to rule them all when and that is the objective but it 's absolutely consistent with all of those strategies and everyone 's been involved I supports what is that it does it 's under there doesn 't it look at the yield yep you and the same partner SAT around the table yeah okay so but no I think I think in the excellent job has been done and thank you for for the work that you 've done but do you you took up a role that that I wasn 't available to take up and you 've done an excellent job and and I think represented the organisation very well but actually brought together a really powerful group of people to implement now the some the strategy so think David great pictures too yes yes looking good here at the front page I shall put the motion all those in favor say aye all right those opposed say no it scary,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Report,Yl5WhZUd7io,20160526,1073.72,"Christchurch, New Zealand",2798,books the chief executive support okay so I 'm just going to highlight some of the key points and I have my colleagues here to answer the more difficult questions three so I 'm just noting that operation results continue to improve operational expenditure year to date as well under budget revenue and funding and year-to-date is favorable and forecast to be high the budget so that after carry forward the operational operational results are forecast to be about 37 million bitted and budget we have cared Kepler and expenditure will have noted in the report of updated to align with the draft 1617 annual plan that has still well under budget with hip level of services without carry one liberal services heading about ninety percent of the targets category two at about 78 Center the targets and three and four and about ninety percent of the targets as well some of the other key highlights are we have for the month 760 consents all processed within the 90-day target which means that since 1 July there are about 700 7200 consents which represents about 2.5 billion dollars worth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls a month so that 's a significant amount of course coming into the organization in being auctioned we 're reducing their fridge handling time and even those these issues are more conflicts or getting more complex we are actually processing and closing those more quickly at the same time we 're also improving the way residents can interact with the council so we have a lot of new smart services coming on stream including the online part payments a lot more online reports and we are from producing a customer or Chris management system where you will note that there 's 40 projects that are in various stages of consultation so um have got a lot of interacting with our communities and our residents at the moment the other highlights the council has introduced a new digital news channel and that 's involving both counsel information and information from other organizations we 're also using more images and videos so these can be picked up and used by other media and we 're also using social media a lot more to interact with people and actually and link them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highlights don 't know if there 's any questions um bling thank you just the third column page 23 the actual trans waste dividend could someone tell me please what that is to Christchurch City better go to the CFO not off the top of my hip note but we do make sure that we capture the trans waste dividends on an ongoing basis and reflect that into account that reflects our ownership percentage within the organization and we get our fair share of it that 's a thirty-nine percent of the total given it yeah we with it I just had another one two totally different we just clarify that percentage of the profit is paid by way of dividend can 't tell you off the top of my head I 've got a board meeting tomorrow from other than promotion for if you would be good to know and because with update for all the other companies that would be very good tonight what we do here continual about the trends waste dividend but we don 't actually you don 't hear anything about translation that 's it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it 's sort of clouded a little bit with the bear with recovery park operation not paying any dividend until the project is completed just the percentage of their operating profit that they pay by web dividend would be really good to know good Sam well Mary my question is around the OTA Community Housing Trust and I just see in the third paragraph via this reference set to trust the asking to be responsive what r incident in C management and day-to-day maintenance major appears would stay in the council 's domain so what I 'm interested knowing is could we expect that it also be an income stream at all from the truss to counsel in terms of depreciation and long-term replacements yes that 's what eighty percent of the revenue does so would come back to council orbit so foot under the lease agreement the vast majority of revenues received thing currently eighty percent goes back to the council by way of the lease agreement thanks for clarifying it okay okay um Jimmy okay thank you a to question I follow the fear the question this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trust the third paper last the sentence major repair in the rewards would remain in a council of men so whether funding come from whether those are party dice people into the long-term press just up yes there 's been two major 50-year plans done by Deloitte 's for both the community housing provider and for the City Council and the lease allows for roughly eighty percent of what is received and means to go to the City Council and that allows them to do the repair or maintenance and the major upgrade that 's needed on almost all of them on a large number of the units they do the major maintenance as does anybody who 's leasing the units and then the trust operates with Emily income net it receives and within the capacity to develop the 50 million dollars are at Auckland that is transferred over from social housing no rates impact and 45 million of that is actually by way of an interest-free loan rather than crowd okay thank you second question is on pages 30 regarding our health in a safety issue it was reviewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the match last night however the second era our item the medical injury we increase two and a half times this engine have any delight learner kind of the risk or not this way it 's a severe or ISA just minor well they require medical attention so they 're not just one serious harm on the box hmm the definitions are the WorkSafe and New Zealand definite definitions counselor gene so the Detailers in the box at the bottom that will vary and so you can be in hospital overnight for example for a sprain or you can offer to be in hospital overnight and for a long period of time afterwards for a serious injury so it varies we 've got one lost time injury debt is a requiring serious in a long period of recovery and it 's primarily contributing to the lost time injury statistics thank you and it 's ok Andrew thank you just noting the so community engagements on page 25 two questions if I can the first one relates to the a Kuro West water project thank you to those involved for extending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and giving people more time to to respond as there 's extension impacted at all on the date by which we make the decisions and has it required an extension to the timing from the Environment Court decision I 'm not aware of that and all seem to be my apt to check on you can get back to you yep oh I can 't great thank you and then the the second one was some little to encourage a fencing consultation do we know which part of the corridor that 's referring to known again I 'll get back to you within memo thank you David Davis if it covers all around the funding area we when we went out with the first level of consultation we were doing the buns of three areas my point just by the summer library we put fencing rather than that was a quite controversial the buns were all right so we 've gone we 've said to the community will come back with another series of options around how we fix the issue that you 've got is obviously people can 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to rock fall so we need clean seem to keep it out what should that fencing look like well you did have a mixture we had some solid fencing we had some black fence in which you could see through there was another option but I can 't remember but we 're going back with the number of those great thank you okay I 'm just want to clarify something you see Mary you see so far this year 7200 building consents Beverly 2.5 billion construction I think it 's 7188 okay yeah yeah that 's right right okay thank you and the second thing was the operational speed which was going to be I think you said 37 million lower than what we 'd anticipated think that 's in the report item Santa is good is that is that the figure that 's in the next year 's annual there the operation will spin this year doesn 't impact on next year 's know and synthesizer Carrie Ford the everywhere we talked about elements of carry forward in this year 's plan that is reflected in next year 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not look at them in detail will they align with that amount of anesthesia okay the carry forward amounts will there will be degrees of underspend which are not carry for its there are simply savings yeah from operational wrong yes ma 'am operational expense there are savings and though they were budgeted yeah but we 've hit a reduction you know I know that they will use to dip those ones yes to the extent that we achieve over budget which we have done in some areas in those savings over and above the budget and that will be a reduction and they will be treated here they are not carried for they simply create a better result this year and what I would show you on the result for this year is if you look at in the middle column financial snapshot and the right hand side we 've got three columns on the right hand side the plan was for a net deficit of its call it 97 million and we 're looking to achieve a forecast of minus there and round figures so we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than planned by a large degree but still remember that 's a deficit as we expected a disability yeah thanks um Yanni oh yeah um thank you um we 've obviously had a few stories about skirt and the media recently but we 've also had the oag report so my question is really um are we going to get normally when you know I guess a significant report on on something that we 've got a huge amount of money invested it is there a process for us to actually get a formal report back and response to the OHA report into the skirt program we 've invited the office of the auditor general to come and brief us on our space right and I 'm assuming that that will then lead to a reporting function coming back through the organization okay that 's great and then the second question is there concern over the quality of the skirt appears that has been in the media what are we doing as an organization to ensure that the skirt repairs are up to a certain standard well we 've also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone else that said that we 're spending 100 million dollars on that ceiling of the roads right it 's not it 's not the question of us I know there 's an issue about the quality of the scoop repairs which actually about what 's good camera here and cut that 's really within their budget so basically there are some areas that people may have thought would have been covered by that budgets and it wasn 't so it really not quality there is a quality assurance process on the weakness fear and I think I think that if you actually go back to the original you know people that sign the cost sharing agreement on our behalf as I mean when I say our on behalf of the city that there was an assumption that measures would be covered by the scope program that infect have been determined by central government not to be covered yeah I 'm not talking about the skirts and standards I was more interested in in terms of certainly the few no complaints that I 've received and what it 's come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chip seal breaking up almost you know quite soon after its laid so it 's not the scopes and standards issue it 's actually the quality of the of how the roads have been repaired even though there are being repeated a much lower standard that that still is an of satisfactory nature to actually you know to have potholes opening up since seems really unfortunately got an update demo I 'm sorry I give me the specifics and we can have a look at it but certainly anything like that is followed through we do have a closeout normal compliance reporting and they get tidied up prior to going so I 'm sorry I can 't really answer and it 's gone over specific yeah I but I think that let 's leave it for the reporting back on the scoop program because i mean it is an issue that 's been raised with a number of councillors and yes every time we leave yet no we 're not we 're not leaving those standard that causes concern yeah thank you so are there any other questions I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and salt so as a result of d as a result of the annual plan process we had a group of submitters the central residents association from rakuten central briquette and residents association came to council they described an environment which had parking damage to the local infrastructure booms the you know and and and just a whole range of issues and they are fighters myself and the local councils and no they don 't invite the little oh they invited Jimmy becomes a little but he wasn 't available they invited Mary Richardson to come and and so we went and it was an extraordinary walkthrough I can say that from a from a community perspective you know the way that they conducted the presentation on sort of on site as it were was exceptionally well researched and presented and they didn 't have to mock anything because it was there for us to see and I was taken aback really so during the course of the walk i came across a dangerous situation which they highlighted to me that they said had been damaged several times and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong place they were in the footpath and not and the boom closest to the property and so I snap sindh solved and it went through to the council the following day now they didn 't know that it was the mere sending it so the following day I got I got that an immediate response saying that they would look unto it the next day I got an email back from the council saying dearly in this that these should this shouldn 't be where it is so we 've instructed city care to go and move them so actually the problems really genuinely being solved and with the system now is unable to give the feedback to that person please Center done so I just want to say a good congratulations that 's absolutely working now and it 's working the way that we wanted it which was snaps in solve but now solve and send the response is over here here yeah well done ok so I 'll move that we receive the report seconded by Tim I 'll pop that motion those in favor say aye aye dost they know that 's cat carrier,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

2,PcqqzRF3M48,20160525,569.63,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1502,"invite the alum from the cell 1 y hora sign careful oh come morning me and want to cancel us thank you for the opportunity to come in present Daniel report and thank you thank you for taking an interest in their work now I just want to say that you know I 'm very very proud to be involved with this whole collaborative process and I think we actually can achieve a lot over the last few years and the report itself looks pretty short but there 's a lot of work that 's gone behind it now what are those or just take it as read as well but I 'll just highlight just a few points in the last five years you know we 've committed five hundred thousand dollars to enhance the natural environment woof about further 250,000 from the farmers and other parties in 2011 ahora te ahora was set up to investigate protocol options to come up with a work program to clean up the lake and also stage one of the central plains water irrigation scheme was completed in August 2015 and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groundwater to surface water irrigation enable aquifer recharge one of the key achievements to is just happened there started this year is the clean change one to the land and water regional plan what that basically does it has been posed really tough new rules or tap rules on nutrient leech and limits on farmers who managed to water quality in quantity and we believe those litany Tremlett leech and limits will arm or drive efficiency about 300 300 properties if developed farm environment cleans so another key feature of the water plane is the cultural landscape values management area which recognizes the significance of that hill over on like Alice me a turn at tahoe in terms of making a koi nahi tofu my hunger I believe you know we 've laid a fairly solid foundation for improving water quality Xin the zone but I guess you know Judith legacy effects we can expect things to probably get worse before they get better it 's each lead summary sir thank you inefficient calling yeah and I hope that some thank you for coming in I hope it 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the third bullet point down on the top left as part of the plan change all farmers will be required to be operating at good management practice by 2017 and reduce nitrogen losses by 2022 so I assume you would have had a report on later yes that there 's actually a industry agreed good management practice which all families have to operate before their time there 's also a baseline which they have to operate to so the baseline is calculated from their nutrient losses at their that occurred is between 2009 and 2013 so the carrots lead the baseline and they have to operate the good management practice as a green by industry so you 're welcome he didn 't feel that they could request that timeframe be shortened at all I think it 's probably a bit unrealistic they have it shortened so but beyond their they have to operate they 're better than good management practice so for example the theory seemed that has to achieve another thirty percent reduction than the in their leaching limit so it will happen I think people are quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this week i think it was about flushing the nitrogen out of the ground water at around age boutin was actually admitting that the nitrogen is linear and so we certainly don 't want yes it is in there yes and it 's a big concern because it takes it can even be a long time for to come be honest and say that 's the reason we have the central plains water in all those controversial it is actually kind of needed to recharge aquifer is an idea of that is that some of the water will flow through to the logan street so you get better flow in there Logan strings and that would help with the biodiversity in that and how learning strange I guess it was just might those thrust of my question was that if there 's any chance that was your committee I would have any way to reconvene to shortening of their time found that I do hope that you 'd be exploring it yes I I think that by having the leaching limit so as lows of this 15 kgs BP yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can go up to that or if they 're about that they have to do a Jewish person percentage to come down to them this bill or can actually ask with you I kind of bankrupt into mini Thomas ah that 's a financial reason there was actually a reasonable values yes it would cut spending our generation would cost them financially to reduce the link chain with me so you know is interesting that there 's always a cost associated with fair efficiency improvements and so on I guess it 's no different kind of asking say cross active residents to stop using the log fires and so yeah we get cold and so this you anyway that your committee actually had access to any of those financial costs that Joanna 's might incur if they looked at reducing their nitrogen yes not only was it done before my time it was actually pass I wasn 't asking for the figures are just asking if you need access to them I don 't got exams removing the copper oh so there 's London City you know I don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a link to report before or they chose one in hearings and they 'll be good thank you okay yes all that information is out there great look thank you very much and again it 's been great to have this report and if you 're comfortable i 'd like to make this an annual reporting directly to the council but with the regular reporting to you know it will be happy to do that and I guess then I 'll make a request or so today I guess I hear that Tricia city council is going to be part of the co governments and other the lake well we haven 't made a decision on that year and we were invited to participate as an observer in order to establish whether it would be appropriate for us to be invited to join that dead invitation has now come but it may well be that an observer status is actually the the better status because of the long-established partnership that 's developed but we want to kind of be we want to be involved but not as you know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's a conversation that we 're trying to have at the moment I guess in the last few years and I 've seen unprecedented collaboration between various our sectors yeah not from just the family community and cylinder from industry but I quite like to see a little bit more between the council 's as well you know guess they 're like Alice me to me when I was a resident of Christchurch yeah we 're always kind of head out to the salem district unit all their outdoor recreation so whether it be the lakes high country lakes or like Ellis Mia it 's just right at the good people crush it so I encourage cruise ships to participate yeah we want to participate the questioners as the level so at the moment Pauline as representing us at the tie white water co covenants meetings and and that will that will continue regardless of the regardless of the decision that 's ultimately made can test it great thank you very much so I 'm not going to go back over the resolution I 'd expected these reports to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to propose that the council 's to refer the recommendation back to the infrastructure transport Environment Committee and delegate to that committee the authority to make a decision on behalf of the council on this matter for that the intention of bringing people here for this presentation was not to have a debate about that everyone obviously any council can attend that and yen contribute so can you can lose second that motion I 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much so you now move on","(-43.5320214,

NZ,NZ,Christchurch City Council,Christchurch City Council,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZETwErnCvvgbvBbnnHfyxA,26.5.2016 - Item 12 - Zone Committees' Annual Report - Part 1,k-mFTEjeD1U,20160525,1872.82,"Christchurch, New Zealand",4772,and now we 'll move on to the zone committee annual reports and I 'm not sure whether the three chairs are coming up together or whether we we go one by one as to one by one so could I invite the christchurch west melton zone committee to come to the table got a tatto get a boy home right up here del Zelda thank you very much for the opportunity to talk on annual port for 2015 I take it it 's being read by wall yep i 'ma nada I 'm not a fan of reading what everyone 's already written so I 'm not sure here you want to run this which is like to ask questions on it now might be to talk a little bit more about the report I 'm really in your hands we haven 't done it this way before but I have to say that after our you know sort of discussions worth what they can commissioners that it you know we keep being reminded that this is a joint approach between he can and the Christchurch City Council and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instances as well but it 's an incredibly positive collaborative approach and I know Pauline sits on this one for for the council and in feedback we get is very positive so it seemed to me that we were missing an opportunity by not using the public forum of the council meeting to receive the reports and to invite the cheers you know to provide a bit of a flavor for the issues that they 're grappling what and then perhaps to engage in a bit of a exchange with with counselors in this forum bearing in mind that it 's a it 's a public forum and it 's a great opportunity to be really reflecting on the work that the zone committees are doing as part of the Canterbury water management strategy packing it in mind then old I 'll go on to looking for challenges and opportunities going forward we are very grateful for the opportunity to submit jun 2015 on the storm water management plan of the city five-year plan since then one of the challenges we 've had and been identified by community as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that it may not venture wit due to financial pressures changes in counsels x-men with accessory and some have said that we 're not valuing the waterways as much as they would like the community to value in waterways but working alongside what we 've come up with as that a number of them would like to see more more work done sooner rather than later a number of them quoted L Benjamin Franklin one why put off till tomorrow what you can do today so I think others have mentioned that the cost of fixing today will exasperate flexing in 15-20 years time and if that is the case which is possibly likely would they be fixable so what we 're asking is that working together with us being a conjurer with the community as doing that behavioral change together that 's paramount and that not just with community but with the business groups community groups and in farming community that we do have out there so so there 's one of the challenges is how we can not look at saying each other has to do there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're quite blessed in the way that we have a lot of really good community groups out there from the Styx River right through to the Haven we are everyt I in your bubble so it 's really around bringing them all together sitting down with zone committee counselors you 're looking at how we can all do this together much sooner and at least this costs we 've had got some wonderful opportunities ahead we 've laid the groundwork with a number of projects already in particular the erosion and sediment trials that we 've been doing on the portals we 're starting to get some of those results back now and Environment Canterbury already looking at them and how they can bring them into that are their guidelines around developments or the portholes the Medusa project around the Riccarton we 've got University of Canterbury trialing runoffs from our residential Xandra fix that all those contaminants have on the ward ways we hope to have some of those results table delighted our zone committee meeting with more trials coming out and following months might pay if we explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discharge of urban stormwater here so that 's a bullet point three is it yet so yeah that surrounds contaminants from from housing from roofs from using copper down pipes all the runoff from your car parking and it 's not just the residentials but there 's others as well we 're targeting around Eddington Brooke in particular with businesses simple things like unpainted roofs and the fix that they have the the contaminants so one solution could be to just to paint all those unpainted roofs the shopping malls car parks and make up a huge catchment of contaminants brake fluids battery yeah that 's sort of thing so it 's around making changes hope behavior changes but also there may be the need to have some type of enforcement policies in place as well just to encourage them a little bit more to participate so yeah that 's that 's where we see a lot opportunities over the next two years working with Environment Canterbury and crush City Council on the Selwyn District Council happy to take questions yet yeah how does that all click off with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seems to me that that we actually need a almost a new zealand wide approach to you know I mean I hadn 't really been aware of the significance of the copper for example just you know I 've driven past brand new buildings grown up and gone gosh that copper looks great and then I had no idea that it 's damaging our waterways through the storm water system and and that is really nothing that you can do to stop that and it just did just you know it really concerned me there that why wouldn 't we have built that into our performance or war requirements around building standards before we started using so much copper it would probably a little hesitant i think in when i think back to Helen Clark with the showers shower heads it was such an up she got quite a bit of backlash around it that the shower head you know using the environments in waters that use less water looking people remember that the backlash you got from that I think that stopped them trying to regulate building standards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know I mean people can you know run a political campaign around language like nanny state or whatever but actually how are we going to take responsibility for environmental you know for our environment if we don 't think about the front end of the decisions that are going to have damaging and tax on our environment and that 's a for me at all policies process that to me that 's all about values and it 's we need to show we really do value our waterways in Christchurch we have some of the most pristine waters drinking water in New Zealand yeah and I notice it every time I travel south north west we are so blessed with drink out the drinking water here untreated is that and even from a physical presence you know our waterways the recreational values that holds cultural values of social zoning even spiritual values I cast my mind back to previous quake days when I long our box with terrace and I used to see people out there in the early mornings doing Tai Chi on the riverbanks and I 'd stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of any better place to do that morning outside the flowing waters so there 's all that spiritual connections and the emotion the emotion is tied with fitz and goodness knows our the community of christ church we need some uplifting other communities in thank you I 'm Vicki young yonny and thank you I 'm just noticing a lot around the Riccarton island area particularly the ground streams drying up the summer and I notice in and report the importance of rain fall and the winter months to recharge those but then also i 'm wondering what 's being done about the very real impact of climate change given the dryer certain sectors that will see on the east coast and the fact that that rainfall which recharges those streams and will probably diminish what is there any work being done on that or is it not being we weaken as I 'm where we can 't change climate change to suit every day at the moment what I do know is that we will have less frequent rain days but they will be more severe so it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's they need to think of ways where they can capture that water during those weak moments or the dry period is your group doing any work on where we 've got yes we 're getting a reports either tonight 's meeting or the following meeting on on the strings we had a quick presentation a couple of months ago when it first came out in the public on oh sorry that was at the st. Knox community yeah we 've looked into it we do know that drinking water the whales are not affecting it or not we 've been told that they 're not the cause of it yeah no it can I just what we river near but the saying that the zone committee we don 't really have any powers of such but we can recommend to he can into council and out of these reports we will actually bring some recommendations for preps management systems and controls in suggestions and we 'll be doing that tonight of the blood jenkins report I believe okay thank you Yanni thank you I was just interested in page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieve the targets there 's no specific action for water use efficiency Oh list of action for irrigated land area no specific action for energy security and efficiency and I was keen to understand why not and what you 're doing in that space and also whether you had any target around monitoring and enforcement of the waterways given that the concerns that have been raised to run the number of complaints and the lack of enforcement kill them so the irrigated land it 's a lot of high priority for us student that only five percent of the catchment of the irrigated but we are keeping up close a performer the only irrigated land majority of that five percent sets out with solemn district around west melton area and there 's a small percentage on the south bank someone of community around Tucson so we don 't see that as a main contributing factor or water quality water quantity and zone but we 're happy we 're happy to keep a watching brief along with other zone with the joining zones on their water use efficiency other than encouraging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homes we certainly advise them on how to communicate with the public community we we 're not in a position we haven 't looked at putting I think I 'm Barbara can we already have those regulations in place around water use in the monitoring it 's just that they don 't wanna to do I 'm sorry residential hit the residential each each house has a has a well meter but we don 't actually monitor use it could be in years to come that the farming community say enough of us we 're not blaming what are the residential care are they best using near water yeah we can 't keep blaming the rural community for the degradation of waterways or a level of the quantity and they will say one day what are you route what are you even people doing to monitor these use of your waters and the same with that quality so we need to pick our game up and that I don 't know if we want to come down here we hand it on the residential properties and limit the amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home we have restrictors but not in Christchurch we 're not allowed to really get use of water for drinking purposes in the house only whereas communities and Christchurch they can use it to water their gardens what are their vegetables their cars washed their cars on the weekend or whatever yeah so there 's literally wasteful to me very good water that all ends up down East almost so you got drinking water pure of drinking water that 's untreated ending up in your storm water I know and it 's just crazy that Rubens actually pointing out that there 's many mechanisms to actually address the water supply issue rather than even going straight to say charging for it is just not on the agenda at the moment but no no no it is but but the zone committee could only make a recommendation anyway no it 's not a that 's not on the agenda but I think what you 're saying is is that a monitoring use and actually feeding that back gun I mean I agree I mean I think we 're perhaps we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are easy ways that we could help support people to put on water collection you know rainwater collection system so they can order the gardens and mostly cars with that you know I mean there are lots of different ways that we could help people to put those systems in place and and actually we build resilience and our communities and infrastructure by doing there anyway yes that 's around how do we need to incentivize will change incentivize as opposed to punish yes yeah um felt so um Thank You Reuben because at this report came to infrastructure varmint can be earlier and we appreciate other York all of the council 's can consider it I just want to ask you about would have qualified aspects and like you 've got some plans for increasing awareness by working with community groups and that kind of thing but I 'm just wondering it is this given the issue isn 't of that the seriousness of the quality of air water is there something in fact we need a more vigorous education program to actually achieve the goals that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water quality over over the five years that we 've been operating it 's I think the trick is for us is how do we communicate that back out to all those various communities and are they what what is what does it and then understand what 's an acceptable standard from them and then look at how we can attain those standards with we did it earlier project along the Abram of a sperm whale where we 're engaging with community groups and a few individuals that 's something we 'd like to repeat again be a part of city council for the or power or heathcote river but I think that the answer to that question is come as what is what is the community 's acceptable levels and how can we reach those standards yeah so and the part of that too then is intrusive if you take Eddington block where you 're working with businesses and industries to it to get this only get the message but but improve the quality of their systems and so you 're working alongside them but but at what point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a back up action by way of some enforcement building compliance could be one way I don 't like using the 10 policies in it but at some stage you can only ask them to do so much and it 's up to those individuals to actually pick it up and run with it but for those that don 't is how do we get them on board that those what the minority that our stall you know work for whatever purpose against some of the lives with the residentials that we put an incentive veneer the stick and carrot yeah I don 't know capturing that point of sauce makes a logical option saying that we will not accept X amount of a liberal certain level of contaminants from your property they could make that means that they make they let the capture it on source cleanse up and then ship it up yeah something something like those lines I 'm not sure yeah thanks Riven thank you no I 'm bit soft person that was the last question but otherwise I would have had been and a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you very much for your contribution and it 's a great start to think of much more engaged reporting process so we 're very grateful that you are able to come I just add to that Tamara power is doing a brilliant job this team members on the committee and they 're all volunteers and most of them are highly skilled and knowledgeable about water and it 's a pleasure to be on that committee and its really I feel it 's really finding its feet and the recommendations from the committee I think are going to become stronger and more focused in the near future yeah thank you thank you very much Jordan um there is a council recommendation on this one and if we could just quickly resolve that we allow the christchurch with melton zone committee to all to support them working with Environment Canterbury another territory authorities to us central government to develop national measures and industry standards reduce contaminants from metal roofs and brake pads to improve water quality I think that since all Pauline would like to move that second if I felt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay well um I 'll just wonder whether we should move on as the debate can they 've been on well no I just no I mean his staff going to be here for this report or is it just the zone committee basically yeah it 's just the zone committees have already been to ite and we had this discussion we were simply going to present the report but maybe you know just in terms of Part I I just had a question about the concern that 's been raised around metals okay let 's let 's leave it then I 'll call the next that 's no no no oh no oh no no that 's awful question I don 't want to I don 't want to i want to get that all of the committees reports dealt with so rather i haven 't got staff here to foot I 'm sorry I 'm let 's just move on to the next item I thought it was relatively easy just to pass this resolution but it 's not so could I invite the bank 's Camilla 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you sorry about that i thought it was a straightforward going to do because that had already been to a two to the AG committee but i just rather leave it and then move on thank you thank you i gave this report three weeks ago i think to the ite committee so for those members who were there i 'll try to vary what i say a little bit for your benefit within the context of the earth report what I pointed out at that report the makeup of the committee which i think is worth dwelling on for a little while if you turn to the back page you can see that they are a very handsome lot and got it we have an interesting composition because there are four rune occur on the peninsula and each has a presented to on our committee and the commissioner who is present at our meetings is Elizabeth cunning and she is also a member of toluna all night tom so we basically function in a bicultural way this council is represented abeley by Andrew Turner and the staff present are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our community representatives as well as being two of the members being chairs of the two community boards on the peninsula and paula smith is with me here today and she is chair of the littleton Mount Herbert community board so this makes for a very interesting committee there are ten zone committees that comprise the Canterbury water management strategy and they all deal with very different situations and predicaments fortunately on the peninsula we are not compromised by our generators or irrigator zor intensive farming and we basically have the opportunity to do the best that we can within the strategy for the environment and this is what we focus on and perhaps leading that is our access to what is called immediate steps funding which works out at about a hundred thousand dollars a year and the idea that is within the partnership with the local landowners and volunteer groups and with schools we can subsidize the planting of riparian strips and fencing and we have done this now and we 've expended about 3 360 thousand dollars it 's gone up slightly since this report presented we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really the the strategy meets the ground we 've been successful in fencing and planting two streams on banks peninsula cuter kitay from the mountains to the sea so this is really quite significant and it 's one of our priorities that we do this to maintain the biological diversity of those streams and as you 're well aware I 'm sure water quantity is an issue on banks peninsula fortunately the immediate problems have been relieved by the recent rains but until those rains came there were lots of streams and wells drying up because we depend entirely on water which falls on the peninsula the other significant issue is sediment sediment from the volcanic soils of banks peninsula which are rich in phosphorous and constitute a nutrient and you may be aware in the press recently there been articles about the state of lake why they were which is extremely problematical and a very tough problem to solve sediment is also an issue in fauquier opal and at the moment there is a management group being established comprising of the city council he can truant the rune Anna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charged with producing a strategy and action plan for the whole of the catchment of littleton hub it will in course include the port company so this is a major initiative which is just about to get underway formerly a lot of work has already been done by he can to provide the background information but very shortly that governance body will be announced and I think it is going to be a very exciting initiative and hopefully will do a great deal to come to terms with sediment discharges and other discharges in foco Robo when I spoke to the infrastructure committee I talked about climate change and how both the city and the peninsula are exposed to the era of consequences as I think of climate change which we are entering into this goes back to the unstable soils of banks peninsula the likelihood of sea level rise of flash floods and of droughts and all these things which I 'm sure we 're all going to have to grapple with in the future if not already I think that those are the things that I really wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and be happy to answer any question just a couple and clean Andrew think you just a really would like to be able to ask this of all the zones but whether in the opens more frequent reporting peps quarterly given the significance of these issues right possibly i mean this this is suddenly happened because we haven 't been reporting this is the first angular in quality we 've been in existence for five years and as i say within the last three weeks i 'm suddenly doing it twice we 've also done it with he can so it 's three times and if there if you perceive the value in it and we would be more than happy then reporter that days if Andrew thank you Steve for the presentation and I 'd also like to take this opportunity to thank you for the work that you 've done personally in raising the wire our issues certainly very aware that you 've made some comment in the media and so on raising the issues there but my question relates to the whole of harbour catchment management plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to what extent do you feel that it 's important given that this may well and we hope it would infect embody the principle of kiyotaka tie to what extent do you think it 's important that the local community and the wider community are engaged in that whole process in order to get the most out of the opportunity I think it 's vital and I don 't think it 's yet evident how that is going to be done it 's quite possible that i will be asked as chair of the zone committee to be part of that management group but my expertise doesn 't lie in profit opal I think there 's quite possibly a very real need for input from people local people on that management committee at the moment one person perhaps we 'll be there that 's June swindles who represents the rocky but I certainly think there is room for another community person to be on that management committee they can be identified and of course whatever happens we 'll need a wide extension of that and inclusion of local communities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the last eight or ten years and know that their own harbour very well so yes they should be included but thank you very much I 'm the zone committee 's report how frequently you 're going to be monthly don 't believe they 'll be monthly from now on so I think if we stick to the annual reports here at the council it just it just keeps a a public eye on the work of the zone committee from the council being in partnership with a can so I think I think with the monthly reports to a Tyvek then lifts the awareness at the at the our infrastructure transport and environment members of that committee so I think that that will work really well but thank you for the first time you 've appeared before us in this role and I too like to join with Andrew and everyone here thank you for the work that you 've done thank you and will continue to do thank you,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Homes",kcMk3D25hOs,20160525,2393.17,"Christchurch, New Zealand",7278,ah and so now we 'll move to item number eleven contractor parking permits for residential clients invasion from the infrastructure transport an environment which endorses the current commission based approach 2000s presentation of contractors vehicles that need to be packed for extended periods and Street series their parking restrictions apply I 'll speak to that but I print some bit clarification of the staff yeah I think I think that might be useful because it seems that there 's a a slightly different perspective that I got from the deputation today then I had realized when I read the paper here 's yeah received we did receive more emotional day so I asked the staff about there too okay so um would you like to start with peps offering a question to that to the staff well I 'm just wondering like clearly the submitters and it 's implicitly report if indicated that the current system does require some changes so I guess my real question is you know but particularly around making us information more widely available to the public about the current system how much you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the submitters clearly highlighted thank you madam chair and in response to that I guess so just to clarify there is an existing permission based system so anyone any contractor their wishes to park inside p120 can ring in to the council and record where their parking and then registration plate and that is pass through the parking wardens whole system does exist which is which has been working for some 20 years I acknowledge that that probably needs some really well it does need review because it could be open to to some fault at times if the message wasn 't passed on I guess in the current situation with a lot of new contractors being with in Christchurch there are possibly many that aren 't aware of that unofficial system we do acknowledge with the modern technology the property of more intuitive system could be could be invoked and we are reviewing that as part of the upgrade to our our own systems and services in terms of morphing more accessible to the public and it may well be that a text based system or an internet-based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room for improvement and probably acknowledge that there are a number of contractors out there that aren 't aware that in the in the suburbs if you like where this system would be need that would work on the say the p1 20s those sort of contractors probably aren 't aware of that permission based system and then might thinks because my other question is if a peer counselor to up for a trial for a permit system just how in fact that what sort of risk that would be for us around potential fraud or abuse in how we might mitigate it I guess my like my concern are out around the trial is how you limit that do we limit it by area in which case all contractors would have the right and the ability to apply for permits within that localized area or you do you limit it to a number of contractors in which case we 're open to challenge from others as to why they 're not involved in the trial saucy there may be some difficulties invoking a trial to say we are reviewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sticking with the necessary with the current permission based system one of the things that 's important though is one our system of the moment puts the control at with the contractor where the what we 've been asked for is to put it with the house owner now as with any contractor they could come in the morning or in the afternoon they can get delayed with it being with the contractor they have got more flexibility of actually asking for that permission the house own house hona may not be home till we actually give out that ticket so basically if we can modernize it and make it I do wonder whether that 's in a philosophical point of view whether it is better to keep that permission with the contract doors rather than with the householder so my last question is what what other ways could we modernize the current system and David well I think Chris is we should be making it so they could text in as they context in to pay for their parking meters they could do that at the moment on think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system so basically if you could do it online at one side initially being though suddenly you go around to someone 's place and you want to prune there roses or whatever and you think it 's a two-hour job and now takes you for obviously they can never ring in this some flexibility and say well I don 't actually want their permit until tomorrow now for that for the next hour so there is some flexibility about that exam in a question I think probably online especially you know I 'm not sure whether we could actually even derive an app to do it would be a pretty easy sort of thing to do probably I think some day thank you to a large degree much more questions have been asked but I 'm hearing that essentially our system today relies on the contractors being permitted and we 're asked being asked to to look at other options do you see this as being complicated exercise or worthwhile to look at variations and I 'm of them I 'm Overmind to foreshadow a a second point of further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these people you know we live in an age now where technology is advancing every day yeah and I think because we 've had a system that works for 20 we 've stuck with for 20 years doesn 't necessarily mean that it 's going to be fit for purpose for the next 20 years so i 'm interested in your ability to adapt different systems and also to full share of a an amendment to the motion to to look into the sorcerer you will that um councillor Goths poor shadowed emotion as well and because it seems to me I mean I don 't kind of want to interrupt the questions but I think we should do a little bit of work on getting that resolution right because I suspect that people would like to see some work done on this rather than just leave it is endorse the current on motion based approach but I 've got Tim thank you and then Jamie I mean in a previous life i have used that the current system and it worked really well because i do think that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the council because i know that i 've done it I know how many vehicles I 've got and you see route variations but at least I can personally sort that out and things change with or whatever but but one of the things I 'm hearing is that some of the newer contractors are some of the contractors don 't know the system so rather than perhaps pinging them with the ticket that we could actually give out some information saying by the way this is you know if we 've got an a sign written and we know that it 's a contractor and they have great you know over the time limit they are doing a job rather than paying them to give them some information about how they can get on and give it a heads up on the system but i do think as a council we 've really good look at eps texting another one you know we 've really got to move on and i don 't think we hit perhaps and i think exactly that is there 's an issue around how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system that is appropriate for the 21st century or and so we need to modernize it but i also think the issue with the contractor if you don 't do it right it 's either gets the ticket it 's not the householder so you 'll put a responsibility to get it right on both sides of it but if it 's not right and it 's a householders folk it 's still the contractor who because it 's a vehicle that the the only thing that we 've got any enforcement on and so um certainly i 've got no issues around staff having a look at how we could mod madam i think we 'd have to get some IT people in it and how could we do better publicity around making it no one certainly i think it would be very easy to do online forms i would imagine not being IT person but I imagined even some of that would be very easy to do your suggest your texting and with a great way to you know and we acknowledge that in the report that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it could be certainly improved with modern technology but and we would like the opportunity to investigate what those options are they are used are elsewhere Auckland Transport use apps 24 for parking etc is it 's not that difficult it 's just about getting it right so i guess around the table thing i 'm probably only one that 's used in a commercial sense and i totally take on board the resonance frustration but like you say you know as a contractor a heat contract is my responsibility i know i 've done it and i found it it 's actually being very good but there are variants and it quickly into the modern technology side of things but also bring up the the knowledge within the commercial community about what the process is and how to do it would be great linda night um yeah Jamie Benn yani thanks it wouldn 't add the permit system Bay the permission system but simply least susceptible to fraud surely the permit system has got all the checks and balances to make it far less susceptible than just picking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a permit system obviously requires the administration set a system sitting behind it we currently have other permit systems for people like plumbers they are they do take some work to administer and control to keep some verification in fact the right people of parking and the right plates are not abusing the system so that there are some costs and times that go with ricotta manual dress over systems could we off seat it with a nominal charge the administration on it and it could be I wouldn 't say well that charge would be no no yes can be determined and I agree I don 't have a problem with it being with the contractor or not the homeowner because you know it 's a business that spins for them as well so it think that 's logical Annie yeah thank you I 'm from the deputation and I don 't know if you get a chance to see the material that 's been presented to us um but it seems to be there 's two main issues and I just wanted to check whether that 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and also an issue around residents parking so there 's quite a lot of conversation ramen or modified consent for the shops we 're parking concerns were raised so in terms of your understanding of what issue we 're trying to address is it just the contractor parking or is it actually also the residents own Park and Rec Department oh yeah this report was written purely around that contractor parking so you know we have a wide range of issues when we bring in parking restrictions and all the rest of it when we look at that and that 's why they all go through community boards to get that permission of timing and public consultation when we bring those restrictions so I suppose we are here really discussing this contracting parking for residential homes right so is there a process to address the other issues identified on the deputation there is that 's been delegated by the community that by the council to the community boards my understanding so the 01 I must admit i read this just very very briefly when i walked in here so them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did notice that there was all the parking restrictions stuff in the front end of it answer your hands either so okay so really the focus of the report from the Eddie committee is only around contractor parking it 's not today or any residents great parking okay thank you for clarifying that sorry Oh walk that just it seems to me that the kind of elephant in the room is the fact that this was predicted at the time that the shops were doubled in size and it sort of makes me wonder how we got onto the position that we 've got untii i mean we 're not reflecting on fact that this was all avoidable at the front end of the decision-making process the residents warned that this would be the impact on their on their residential neighborhood by doubling the capacity of the commercial area solian it 's not just that the deputation quoted effect that 's a lot of these trucks cannot get into the properties yeah yeah yeah I know but they wouldn 't have parking restrictions outside their house there hadn 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're going to see all over the city with you should get you yeah just what we do it 's not which one yeah which ones need to address it we just think told this is that contractors parking not about you son is on track to suck he said its contractors but it 's got a cool I don 't know anyway the point that I 'm making is there as there it is something that does need to be tested and just endorsing the current permission doesn 't do that so but I just wonder whether counsel Goff we need to go straight to trialing a contractor parking permit system because I have an awful feeling that they 've create another bureaucratic response to something that doesn 't you know in the modern age need data will say I think we were all kind of on the same page I think they I think we can we change it that the council develop alternative mechanisms to ensuring that bit there is a an easy way to grant dispensation for contractors vehicles that need to be part for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got get get the staff working on an alternative mechanisms and then report back and a relatively short period of time just more money says hey it 's not difficult just you know write on a piece of paper here 's your permit yo no it doesn 't cost a lot of money no we 're just dividing the council spend a lot of money with more than courts and you know no well I don 't want to do that what on what I don 't want to do is to is to hear people 's I mean the answer to the question was will have to set up a whole you know structure bahama payment system and I don 't want do it I mean we have a very simple system down at the Botanic Gardens don 't we just give the volunteers a little certificate they renew every year and stick on the vehicle is exactly what we should be doing with us yeah so simple in cost efficient that sounds like a system already is us see an injector for the missing link here has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I things so this is what we 've got for so with that in mind can I ask that that aspect of a width of awareness or publicity that that we included any resolution to so because it 's more as pets it 's part I guess part of the mechanism to make sure it works but I think one of the key things that has been raised as a lack of awareness by a lot of new contractors especially pursuit what 's the simplest way of fixing it I mean is it I just think it 's a permit by system that 's exactly what they want nice we just had to be a little bit careful though because we had central city which has got a huge amount of contractors in it and we just can 't allow them you park it up all day taking our little car park site I wonder if we should remove the center city not the wording of it is not good because it 's a general thing but this is a residential areas that we 're talking about David would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back end of it and staff look at a publicity campaign to make it widely known and modernize it with current technology munication which is part of the process that we 're doing at this point in time this is just do a simple trial for here okay and let 's see how ants well that 's difficult if we 're in the back can I just say oh no we 're not an abate we 're just trying to sort out with a bit whether we can get a resolution you know I comment on the economically comment just I want to reiterate the staffs concern about the trial and fit you be limited to one area it 's another many layer of bureaucracy a far better because I think that what so that 's what of trial it 's you 're taking a small area it 's like what we double cameras on hedn yeah why can 't we use text it wasn 't save it this way tonight no no no this is what I don 't want to do I don 't I don 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it 's as it is even with you know I 'm not sure that I agree that it 's the best way to go I said it sounds as though the system that we 've got works as long as there were better ways of interacting with it using different technology and a higher level of awareness that has existed that to me seems like a really simple problem to solve that doesn 't require spending twenty five thousand in the first year and ten thousand a year thereafter I think this is a really simple problem that we can just do a little bit of work on fingers I just would not want to see if you carry across to the city center if here I think it should be suburban areas it is about suburban areas it doesn 't say that this is sounding half-baked and I think we actually need a bit of process we 're spending a lot of time that 's just not sticking so I suggest we find seen a bag did I just as I mentioned before I had used the system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as that that we can update the technology but we can also update that the knowledge of the contract is that the system again I 've used this is a clear difference of you some people think that it 's a good idea to simply its trial it and others don 't so I think we should just put the two resolutions down and we should we should deal with them so the first resolution is to endorse the current promotion based approach who wants to move there but it was probably fill our movie but I think it still requires further work to be done around the two issues that I raised one of which is making it easier to interact with so using new technology and raising awareness I view is that the current permission based approach works but there are some things that could be improved about and I would see it and also just some wording that reflects on us said okay 32 the subject to a review of a review of increasing the ways it can be interacted with and raising awareness of the existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an amendment what is not a foreshadow most not an amendment that says yeah well I want to trial the contractor parking as further I wonderly and if you think it might be a better way to go about this because that I just simply foreshadow their motion so if that fails then it just may be closer we 'd go Metro would be better to have it as an amendment to the resolution because then we can vote on it first okay which as openers of me matters accumulated a number three that there so we draw a trial a contractor parking permit system option to for a generation of us is that just for this area yeah for this area first of ya know I would know it there it won 't the option to nearly hey whoa a contractive yeah you did to contract a parking permit system it doesn 't need option 2 4g in this area and then either in the homewood area or is it or in the area raised in the homework right well in the end the vicinity of the heart homewood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what road roswell road yeah full stop hey and justin in homered right okay that the council trial a contractor parking permit system and Homewood road it 's none of the side streets do they and the homewood Road area for a duration 12 months it 's no I don 't think there 's any parking restrictions down those side streets okay and we trialing a parking permit system where the parking permit is caged to the restructure this firm after the homeowner not the contract yes yes yeah that 's the whole point yep a parking permit a resident based was a resident base resident based parking permit system for contractors yeah we want to get a resident based parking permit system for contractors take out option two yep and and homered in the homeland Road area and refrigeration of 12 months so that 's an amendment that 's moved by jamies yes and isn 't it by breath right it can I ask a question regarding the amendment yes a question staff so if the amendment were to be carried would that then give rise to the financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm followed by if we decided to continue at ten thousand dollars per annum after that so the cost of implementing the amendment would be twenty five thousand dollars or there abouts is that correct one of the real issues with it as if we gave out say look I don 't know how many houses down homework but if we gave them all a payment they could actually put four vehicles in there on their permit at a time you could have no parking near at all now with the current system we can actually control it you see in this report they talk about like a now they impart my motorhome down there you know for while it refreshes every 24 hours and that 's why we are suggesting we believe it should be sitting with a contractor rather than a home base because we lose total control of Park it over there because that goes for parking opportunities at any one time to every householder down there so basically I 'm just trying to work out how we would place it and how we would deliver some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do through that parking is it a hundred and twenty minutes along the entire stretch of home and right no just we are shops just with a shop sir so how could this possible it 's only in the restricted areas that it supplies so that I mean it that it 's a tiny little area how on earth could that cost that amount of money and how no I 'm not saying how much it would cost scientists how could you be saying that it 's gonna bleep people gonna be packing their motor homes there it 's for contractors um it season here potentially and also for motorhomes so the answer to the question that i put regarding cost is that you you really don 't know what the costs would be because working out how this would be implemented is difficult yeah thank you sorry I 'm that the resolution that we 've put in front of you is a resident based parking permit system for contractors that would not allow them to pad the motorhome course not so I 'm just confirming should explained it really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of the stuff is being missed it 's for contractors who cannot park in the off street parking yeah so the engineer 's report doesn 't actually address the problem ok and the permit is issued by the resident to the contract yeah so maybe we just put that clear a resident based parking permit system for contractors we had no off-street that where that where their vehicles cannot use off street parking yes in the council must officially approve a time would have to pay for it so you don 't know the council 's not going to appoint motorhomes yeah and I think there was a someone see that the residents who have the permit can only have one vehicle using that permit at the same time great yeah it 's basically if you could we go back to the history and like the second document that was sent to the community board was very much about a lack of parking for residents it wasn 't just about contractors it was it up um oops I think it 's read hearings if it was it something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's not what they 're asking for and I 'm you know and I have to say that I mean I hadn 't seen the paperwork that went to the community board but I 'm saying that there is a history to all of this all we 're asking for and all that the submitter asked for was the council trial a resident based parking permit system for contractors we 're off street parking well where they can 't use the off street parking the car you come drunk yeah it 's official it 's where they can 't use the off street parking and the whole mud Road area for a duration of 12 months it 's booked in it it 's only for the restricted areas yeah and which is a tiny little booty me to this sunburn as they mention an integral yeah so why don 't we limit it to those that have actually been consulted and was in theaters where I 'm very ready for this to be put we 've spent a lot of time on what I cancer is a minor issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on no in the city with like book stuff to deal with and we 're spinning yes i know i know that is the case and you know we can all you can all we can all be perfect we can all be perfect after the Fed ever smokers dream so um all I 'm does anyone actually objective it being included on the resolution I 'm concerned that we 've got advice from staff that was proposed may be unworkable and we don 't know what the cost implications are going to be and I also see the substantive motion actually solves the problem so there 's no need for any further work to be done i think if we do what we 're asking for in the substantive resolution in the main resolution sure then there is no need for the amendment to be but for that work to be done at all and on very wary of approving something with unknown costs and we 're advised by staff that it may not be possible to implement effective problem is the existing system isn 't working it hasn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it because they 're veo en dis one we 're going to have a debate about it so i think all the questions have been asked and answered so i 'm going to open it up for debate if people could debate the amendment as well as the resolution then i 'll put the amendment and then i 'll put the resolution right start Rev okay well I mean I support the amendment I mean you know Stewart has spent a lot of time explaining the problem and I think we need to focus on what the problem is the problem is that contractors have vehicles which are too big to park in the off street spaces the engineer 's report doesn 't actually address what the problem is because these folks is just on residents parking that 's not what the issue is this is likely to be used you know a handful of times a month and if that or you know gardeners or other contractors whatever I think trialing it here there should be zero cost we have a system where we do issue permits for things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra costs the resident can pay a nominal sum for the permit and then they give it out to the contractors it 's as simple as that that 's what we 're talking about but I think it is a useful trial just to see how it works I mean as for parking in general it needs a complete overhaul and we know that but that 's not what we 're addressing here so I think let 's not overcomplicate it let 's just pass a simple trial in a very contained area and see how it goes from yonni okay um yeah I mean I I support the amendment but i do think actually to shame to limit to just contractors actually the request was wider than that as I read the submission that 's been put in front of us and it all stems from a non notified consent for a commercial block where concerns were raised and ignored so I think really there is a much deeper issue here which is how we 're doing resource consents but at a notification level and also a traffic assessment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to address that because these problems are only going to get worse if we don 't but I think it 's really clear what and it 's great that you 've added a reason of based parking permit system because I think that 's the key difference between the current system and what 's being proposed and I would you know have real concern of just allowing it to the contractors because I could see that you could have every contract or wanting one but actually when the needs versus the wants were measured up it would be incredibly difficult to enforce um to police or as I actually think it 's much sensible have it like we do with residents parking in terms of the central city we 're there 's good exceptional cases for those residents they can apply staff can weigh up the assessment and it can be granted or for not based on the facts and the evidence of the case but I think there 's only goes halfway to dealing with issue that was raised which was really around both contractors and also vehicles that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so but I 'm happy to support of a limit to get something happening Hey yeah look the reality is if you look at the first point and the staff recommendation around why we keep the status quo that says that it 's working at it adequately the reason that we 're in our at quarter to eleven in the morning of a council meeting and why this has been to the edge emitting it 's been to the community board is because it 's not working at it for me that 's why we 're in the situation it is not working I 'm on the community board in this area and there are issues stemming from it it is a slight red herring around the the RMA the RMA issues there and the in the expansion of the properties in the sense that the residents said if this happens and it 's not notified you will end up with a problem that is this the council disagreed and we 've ended up with a problem that is exactly this so I feel in a sense that we actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that let 's work collaboratively with you and try and solve this issue that you actually quite correctly said would be a result of the expansion and they were completely right the other red hearing is what I think yannis brought up and it 's around the resident parking but I think the fundamental thing to bear in mind is that if you solve the comp or contractor parking problem you in turn solve the resident car parking problem so they their techniques of hand and glove anyway the addition that I am that I 'm proposing here which is sickened by rev can work very much in 10 with the first two and I don 't think that you 've got anything to lose we 're not implementing this citywide we 're implementing this in one Street in Christchurch and it 's not even the whole street it 's about it 's about a tenth of the street so well staff say that they can work with the existing system and try and find ways to improve that that 's great but we 've got an opportunity with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solve this issue right now so we can fix the problem today by passing there and then do you know what if staff can come up with a really good system that works citywide great after the 12 month trials got finished will them to mean that in problem solve but why why would you limit your options because if the poet based system works and is cuts down the fraud solves the problems isn 't that the whole point of a trial that if we 've actually got another option near that works we can implement that so I don 't think there 's anything lost you 've only got something to gain long term and you 've got slain to gain the short term so I think it 's a win-win all around ng thank you this is a far more protracted debate than I ever imagined they would be on this issue but I don 't dispute there 's a problem we 've heard from local people there 's a problem and I 'm quite happy to accept that there is but to me this is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of raising awareness and in terms of making the existing system easier to interact with would actually solve this problem we 've heard that any system would be used a handful of times a month we 've heard both in the report and from staff that there there will be costs around implementing a trial we don 't know what those costs would be we 've heard that there could be difficulties with implementation of a trial and we don 't know what those difficulties might be so to me the simple solution is to modify the existing system which with a small amount of tweaking an addition could be made to work perfectly well I can 't imagine that that would take long particularly if staff see the urgency and we apply ourselves to it quickly for that reason I support the motion but I don 't support the amendment third in turn look I think it 's been clearly acknowledged that the system the current system isn 't working adequately that 's been solutely clearly acknowledged today was to air committee I don 't support the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't know how much that is actually going to add to our information once the trial has been run this is really an atypical part of the city and small part of phenyl t 'en and I don 't think it 's going to add much to information and it 'd be far better to run a proper trial when we look at the basic changes which need to be made and which are included and one and two so I 'm not supporting the trial because in fact that there will be a large no matter what the actual final dollar costs in trying something like this there would be quite a significant cost and staff costs in terms of staff time to set up their trail even for a small group of people and Tim and then David well I don 't support the amendment the fact the matter is the key here is the contractor if the contract had known the system then we would not be sitting here we were not read if this would not be here the Fiat the matter of this contract it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they go throughout the city and there is a number a huge number of contractors that do this type of work and other sorts of work throughout the city so earth as Andrews thats it earlier on if that the the key is getting the information out to the contractors and making it easy for them to change and adjust times etc when they are working and i think that the points 1 and 2 will cover this I think we 're just starting up a whole can of wounds and whole process a new process which we don 't we don 't need I mean I used to do this kind of thing when you used to go down pay you twenty-five dollars and get the shroud for the pack I mean that 's how I know I 've looked at old but you know that the facts of the matter are this system does work it 's just about lifting the technology to current stars making it easy for the contractors to be able to do it but also raising the awareness which we 've discussed thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case outline today of issues in this particular area that have given rise to parking problems and we also hearing that we need to review our parking permit system I think this is a two-fold opportunity to look at addressing a problem that has occurred in a small area and also being able to trial a system that 's been outlined to us that may be of some benefit going forward so I 'm actually going to support the amendment and I think it 's a good step forward we also hear that you know even in our current system where there are a lot of contractors that don 't are unaware of the provisions that we have and often the message even though they may have found in the message doesn 't actually give back out to the to the to the parking enforcement people so I think it 's worthwhile giving this a go it 's another process that can be evaluated so I 'm happy to support the manor thank you um I 'm also going to support the amendment and the reason I 'm supporting it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have recently introduced parking restrictions but there are significantly Wars no no they 're significantly more today than there were before the earthquake and it is an environment where we 're doing a lot of earthquake-related repairs and there are large vehicles coming into these areas that won 't be coming into these areas in the long term this is an opportunity to trial a simple mechanism that works at the Botanic Gardens for the volunteers for goodness sake seems to me that if the system were abused or misused in any way it would be easily picked up on a trial so I just can 't see the harm and doing a trial at the same time as making sure that the current permit system is actually effective and communicating with the contractors and letting people know that the system can work and then including new technologies to make it truly effective so on that base I 'll put the amendment all those in favor say aye those opposed say no oh it 's going to get that do we have a show of hands you put the easiest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those opposed you want to be recorded as opposed doesn 't matter okay that is carried I 'll put the full motion all those in favor say aye aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much right can I just quickly note that the item number five presentation of petitions there were no petitions and could be now a June for morning tea and if we can come back here at ten past eleven,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"
