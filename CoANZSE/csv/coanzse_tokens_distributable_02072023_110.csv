19,_rnzmGaBvEU,20140514,624.78,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1679,like to invite an burden from the tech matura residences of sorry presidents ratepayers Association welcome i 'm not sure if you 've appeared in front of the council since the new council was a league do i don 't believe we ever have while you 're most welcome thank you good afternoon ladies and gentlemen i am secretary of the tachometer ratepayers Association an association covers both residents and ratepayers who have either permanently or have holidays homes and the tachometer area I 'm here today for a submission for the technate or domain reserve the tach motor domain reserve was first gazetted in 1866 as a reserve Andrey designated as a recreational reserve in 1979 at present that present times this reserve has been stand gated it has no public access it has no facilities on it and I don 't believe that the council actually even maintain it in any way by even putting a little more or more across the area the reserve actually has historical significance for an 1845 three block houses were built on this reserve to a burst through to a garage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and but the block houses were never ever used for the purpose that they were built and mid-2012 our association commissioned a landscape plan or the reserve and we consulted with our local community and we adopted their plan we took the plane through to the railway we 're a community board they were supportive of it and they sent it through to council that is actually where it stopped we have regular meetings three meetings a year and before each of these meetings I contact pam richardson to put it back on the agenda and she contacts the council but we haven 't gone forward since then the connection with the fridge is that the wrench navy actually bought built the three block houses and we contacted the feechie embassy because we thought an interpretation panel on the site would look very goods to inform the public alike to historical significance the rich ambassador was very supportive of us and he suggested that we fly through the new zealand france venture fund for funding but because the reserve is absolutely gated and can 't access it we can 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landscape designer we gave them three things that we were concerned about we were concerned about where the blockhouses cited so we asked for that not to be no plantings or anything like that on it be left unencumbered are we asked that there was no tall trees to be put around it that it was because of the nature of the land was one part is quite undulating and it 's wheat that the plantains be smaller and suitable for wetlands and for the habitat of the wildlife and also that but also put that as that the views from the neighbors houses were an unencumbered we this site is actually on the council website as as one of a sought-after reserve on beck 's peninsula with facilities for the public to enjoy and use we 're actually quite active in our community and we would like to participate in any way that we can to be able to get kicked costs down in any particular way we could you know we 're quite happy to volunteer with the plant and I 'm losing myself but thank you very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spot where I 've been asking questions you know you know as the community willing to come on board we are willing to come on board gateway yeah we are do you know what the cost is no because to do a budget on it we were doing and 2012 and now we have 18 months to two years down the there have been just blown out of the water that budget we 're not asking for a lot of tall trees we 're not asking for any sort of facilities we 're not asking for toilet facilities we 're not asking for playground equipment or anything like that we just wanted planted to be able to put a board walk through for the public to be able to walk through because of the ground is very very wet but you could literally build that as a community and implant well if we could we could do the planting but I can 't I can 't commit to any funding from the Association because of course it has to go through committee and the membership I mean if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the boardwalk you could literally well we do have members in our community who are professionals we 've got professional structural engineers we 've got builders we 've got our impressions and things like that but we 'd really just like to be over able to open up this reserve right okay thank you I 'm poor lane and then entry thank you can I just ask for it speedster haven 't done a site visit or anything but I have no idea I used to live in a Corral 20 odd years ago and I used to take my son round to the stream at talkatora and I can always remember it 's being fenced and gated it 's before the years before the earthquakes it 's always been like that it 's silly I don 't think a lot of people actually realize is actually a domain I think a lot of people thought it was a piece of land that was land bank by some some private owner know if the fences were down would it be accessible you can you could walk through it but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boardwalk because it is quite swampy because it 's right by the sea thank you right sorry Andrew thank you and yeah thanks for the presentation this afternoon i 'm loving what i 'm hearing in many ways in as much as we 've got a situation where you know you 're saying to as if council were able to to fund this the community could do a lot of the work which is excellent i mean it certainly sounds as though you 've got the skills there in the community to make this happen in your view would waive their so two questions i guess in your view would away for would be for your residence and ratepayers group to put a budget together and come to counsel with a specific plan if you like for the project and second question to what extent would you see the community contributing to ongoing maintenance using a similar model i 'm guessing to the reserves management committees and so on that we have on the peninsula the resume take the tour is probably never ever came under the reserve management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see if I had a reserve management board on it and this is probably why the reserve as the way it is I knew I do know that thick that there are council workers that do come around and do because across the road from me there is a small reserve and I do know that council we go across and maintain that and i 'm pretty sure that they also know the foreshore in front of the reserve too we can do a budget and we can bring it back through to council to be able to give give costings than that but we you know we just want to see this piece of land opened up and then we can also apply to the new zealand france friendship fun to get there some funding through for an interpretation panel if i can just make a further comment i 'm wondering whether a way forward with this might be and we 've just done this at casper just outside a little turn to establish a reserves management committee maybe as a side group to your existing group and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this as a reserve and move on from there under the reserves management committee model would that seem an acceptable way forward I would have to take it back to the committee to find out I can 't speak for about it as an option that might be a good conversation between the Association and the community board and I 'm certainly happy to raise this with Pam Richardson yeah but I pam has been knows all about this because I keep pressing to her every time I see her whether she 's actually heard anything from counsel David my questions have been asked answered thank you Oh Vicki I don 't know I don 't know with councils blessing will take it down is there a stock or does sometimes people did actually put stock on there just to keep the keep the grass down right there 's no stock in the present time there is as I don 't know if there 's a waterway that 's very swampy in a particular area let us let us give a some some information but I think that you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very much wants to support communities to be able to get on and do stuff and so if it 's just a question of finding the you know the right information to support decision making we can just get on with it so but anyway but we 'll look for some solutions and try and help you through this and get back to us they will and thank you very much very very good submitted now our next submitter,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

18,FnVmOdYjujA,20140514,614.04,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1849,Richard 's Valentine 's I think you think you 'll hear your submission touches on the wrong plane rather than the annual blame I think if some some advice might have been given your way around making the submission to the local welcome other local what is it called that the psycho substances plant you know there when it goes out for public submission because it 's not really part of that annual plan but they see if we can I 'll attempt to retrieve that may I I 'll bring around something more relevant excellent excellent pinky I would like to begin by saying that Valentine 's truly appreciates the support of the community which was enabled us to get going again and in particular we 've appreciated the support from the council which many levels has helped us or facilitated our rebuild and so many people have been prepared to listen to us when we 've got problems on that and communicate to us and I suppose through that process we 've come to appreciate them the difficulties that the council faces but there are two areas of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice precinct and I appreciate the opportunity to just run through those quickly now give you some time to ask me some questions the first one is the retreat of street parking building we urgently need a decision on its future and a commitment to get on with the decision that 's made the until the decision is made those of us with land around it can 't make decisions on our own property Valentine 's had a building to the east of the rich really pattern building which came down on the earthquake and that interconnected with the parking building on all levels there were four levels of car parking two levels of retail and another basement of car parking and we 're all interwoven seamlessly now if the parking building goes that 's one thing if it stays it 's another thing and we need to know the gutter II seem to need to know if it 's going to come or go they had a major internet and indeed the whole planning about our quarter of the preset depends on the decision on the return of street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new Christchurch that he Center said the physical plan must convince with access accessibility and circulation resolving the needs of the total precinct for parking as well as for easy access of agrees the question of the council own little street car park is that the heart of these considerations and the future of that car park must be determined as part of the total plan it 's very evident that there is a critical part of the retail precinct plan and we would ask you to make the decision and end to get on with it I find out on the the 0 today at least a public set to rebuild plan showing the the council 's attention apparently is to start repairing the count the car parking buildings in the third quarter of 2015 and we think that 's too late because I 'm sorry but if I haven 't even seen a sainnite document no you were you were probably in a meeting but that 's what it says and it 's going to be too late the Justice priestly sorry we 're we 're held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan which I 'm our building is apparently in that and the picture that they 're drawing but I don 't know we 're that 's up to and I don 't know when it will be concluded but we cannot make a decision about what we 're doing until there is completed tipton we hope it can we make a joint approach to the government on that case and have a chat I mean yeah I mean it is my important I mean the thing is is that there are so many layers of things that are going on at the moment and I don 't mean to express frustration in front of you fill up because you know I know that you really hard to try and hold the whole thing together and and we know that we have a responsibility in this regard and we really do know that we 're going to have to act before we 've got the financial security to do so and it may be us that does it and it might be somebody who does it on our behalf or it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behalf and at some stage in the future we might have a we might have it returned to to our interest we 're looking at a range of options but we 're getting ready to make a decision but we are slightly frustrated by the this latest master planning process which seems to have been imposed at a relatively late stage in the process and I 'm absolutely unclear as to what 's driving it and and why our building space is included in it but I mean I presume that staff have been involved in that and the master planning process but I can 't just a national representatives on that body right with it but is this that what they architect out of Wellington that 's dying that 's great yeah so do you know where that 's up to I think there 's a report due at the end of May it is the new end of May next week well two weeks so it is coming to a conclusion so it is not our intention to wait till 2015 we will we will make a decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon as we possibly can it will be within within within weeks not months excellent thank you for that Mara to say that anything we can do to help we would like to do and we have had a history of working was the Council on parking I can go into it in detail but not to them looking at I don 't know we understand i did i did also want to i submitted on the legal highs and you 've pointed out that was inappropriate so i 'm going to make it appropriate posay the situation 's changed a little bit anyway the reason we submitted on it because our staff were being frightened and arrest by the people who are coming in to buy the legal highs especially was there when they were going home at night and sometimes our customers were commenting on being the the big in and harassment that they were getting and it occurs to us that when the inner city is the inner city is rebuilt it 's it 's imperative that we have the highest degree of security in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost no I don 't know how much you we can expect the police to do but I think we 'll come at a cost of the council also and and if we don 't have a safe environment it 'll it 'll damage all the blue blueprint plans you know you know the bus exchange used to be an unsafe place at times and it needs to be a place where people through feel safe and then I 'll use it the visitor industry will be badly affected if the city isn 't safe people want to live in the inner city people won 't got to shop in the inner city and so it 's not only legalize it can be alcohol it can be even tagging all these things diminished from the the ambience of the inner city so I wanted to say if anybody wants any questions if Mei when you you certainly have them touch the court on that one as well have hub yeah I know exactly what you 're talking about Yanni thank you um I was really interested in your comment that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retained and kicked under council control one way or another could you just elaborate way think it 's important that counts all owns and controls car parking buildings on the central city if the history of car parking his own standard the the council took it upon itself to provide visitor parking from the outset and a lot of the parking was funded by development contributions from people who build new buildings and didn 't that provide parking so the little street car park was built it in that way and it was sited on the originally on instant foundry site and there was some land left over after the first two days were built and the council sitting wish to sell up valentines bought of about 16 years later when the council wanted to expand the car parking we saw it back to the council that a discount of twenty percent and had negotiated some excess rights pathetic car parks on our roof there 's an awful lot of interchange between landowners and the council that 's if you like created an implied trust by suppose that we work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand each into the lift we 've just worked together and it 's been to the advantage of the retail precinct to assist the council and it 's been to the event that advantage off to have the council controlling the car back ultimately if it falls all into private enterprise and what we fear the code that we fear the possible consequences I mean you 've ended up on the in the space where we are in terms of the you know what the way we 'd like things to be and what we can 't afford given the the constrained environment that we 're on especially around insurance and we have an insurance dispute at the moment which I think the difference on this building as it 's over 15 million dollars it 's a lot of money to be separated in terms of finding a resolution yes we understand that public-private partnerships can be formed which my leg of the control and in the meantime to private hands and ultimately the ownership of the park reverts to the council yeah that little thing would given up an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's right pursuits and as I 've said to you before all of the options are on the table and we have had proposals put to us that cover the game up all right so I think that 's all thank you very much good to see it and,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Moyle think you 've met Amir you know that I hate it yes exactly I know how to put the needle in army thank you for an opportunity I 'm here representing hands off Hagley and we like musty Exley before me are aware of the financial straits of the council so we would like to point out where there are a few opportunities for the counselors to have a look I think it 's important to put things into perspective under the proposed changes and the city plan as a proposed increase of a dollar per hydro slide for a child from five dollars to six dollars which we would completely agree with so for child bought a hydro slide ticket for seven days as my compulsive kids would have required that 's 42 dollars a week Canterbury cricket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than a cup of coffee a day so why do we subsidize professional sport when we 're removing subsidies from our disadvantaged and less influential citizens so far cry CM city council spent 3 million dollars are developing higley able to icc specifications and where does that spending stop if you look buried in your metro sports plan you will find a line temporary seating I suspect you are buying the seats for the new stadium there 's a 300 thousand annual cost of maintaining the Oval over ten years that is three million dollars which should not be a charge on ratepayers the city council doesn 't pay for or maintain the netball courts at Hagley pack in fact netball even maintains their own gardens around their building the Hagley golf club are responsible for and pay for ground keeping of the golf course Christ 's College pay a peppercorn rent of a dollar for the use of their grounds in hagley and return they maintain them at no cost to the council and make them available for school and sports events meanwhile a professional sport that generates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the twelve hundred dollar annual lease into perspective the going rate for the daily hire of the netball center or the horticultural building is twelve hundred dollars per day the bed for the World Cup proposed that the 14 million dollar costs of providing goods and services will be met by the local organising committee this committee as being as as described as being made up of CCC and other stakeholders would it be prudent for the council to inquire who the other stakeholders might be and what they are bringing to the party in the World Cup proposal the higher of the oval for the games has plotted thirty thousand dollars per game donated by ccc I hope the intention is to charge this to cricket after the World Cup for example for an international game crowd of 18,000 paying twenty dollars each would give a revenue to cricket of 360,000 a thirty thousand dollar higher as 10 as less than ten percent when the average rents are around about fifteen percent of turnover and finally in the Environment Court decision the judge imposed 92 conditions of these relate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these include noise control traffic movement management temporary structures and parking all of these need counsel two pyramids and supervision we would like an assurance that these costs to the council will be met for by the user just as we would when we apply for a building consent and not by ordinary ratepayers thinking questions I think you 'll find there 's a lot of money buried in your books I think there might be a contract that signed by people who were here before I was right yeah thanks for that that 300,000 dollars a year cost to maintain the able he 's saying that that currently as a council obligation yes I understand and was that part of that original contract I have no idea I think that well I don 't know is I 'm very critical of your original contract and I don 't think it was actually I think the public were doomed yeah because I was under the impression that wasn 't actually costing us any money well might be worthwhile going and having a look to make sure it doesn 't I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever released so I don 't know that it if it 's in the public arena or not does it might be good honey you 're the source of all knowledge and information on these measures how much are you talking about the lace are you talking about the contract the contract for the Cricket World Cup right I haven 't seen that document so the lease was delegated to the chief you know the leases the lease isn 't that issue the lease is what the leases built on what was agreed and then signed contract between so i have this any book I don 't think the later members have seen the social contract okay so um it 's slightly ironic isn 't it made a mirror that we 've that the city is bound by something that a counselor that will say at the table hadn 't read well that 's that 's true of the cashier agreement as well it 's just it 's the way life is and it may not be life as we want it but it is life the way it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a result of your submission today is to establish whether we are able to release their original document because I think it would be informative and would enable people to see exactly what 's been agreed to because the lease agreement was absolutely required as part of the agreement and there was there was nothing that that would stand in the way of the chief executive signing it I know because she got my approval to sign up before she did and she had she was under a legal obligation to sign up once all the conditions were meet them Gary grab a copy of your night Steve just certain because I 'm my memory 's not that good my handwriting from that fast I really just possibly crazy thinking is good a question I don 't know how closer you 've been following the domestic cricket debate about becoming privatized as well is there any comment that you would wish to make in that regard in terms of things we should be watching for it does seem quite extraordinarily we 've given public security of that asset of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security to to Canterbury cricket but any comment on the future of privatized cricket or what all concerns we should be looking at in terms of protecting us well it does seem strange that can be quicker to proposing to sell a 49-percent holding in in cricket and the rate payers are subsidizing this and going back to the 300,000 annual fees or the up key I I note that in the world cup agreement the world cup proposal the council have agreed to pay all the fees you know 100,000 as per annum for their head groundsman there certain the other but I think that only extends as far as the world cup beyond the world cup i 'm sure you can have a look at that and i think particularly if cricket are able to attract private sponsors then surely we should be charging them at a normal rates we shouldn 't be carrying that the normal citizen shouldn 't be supporting those all right well thank you very much food for thought the end thank you good to see both and","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

16,ZvMvszrKpRI,20140514,806.47,"Christchurch, New Zealand",2335,Jim in the room but there 's a smartie XE welcome thank you thank you for the opportunity to speak with you firstly before we go to a cup of Mel 's of detail and our detail is really around the ability to deliver programs and before we go there I just want to recognize that we do understand the council 's challenges and trying to balance the box so to speak well you know and that includes balancing your day-to-day business needs with the needs of the rebuild and also the needs of others who wish to have investment in new transporter initiatives including the agency but I just like to highlight a couple of areas of change in your annual plan that you signal from the three-year plan regard to passenger transport firstly would like to acknowledge that you have made good progress through the working party cheered by councillor just lift or NZ he has just lit them there is feel clear what over there the the working parties make good progress on passenger transport and we acknowledge that in as a bit of a false start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way yet to go and next year 1415 is a big year for passenger transport in Christchurch will be two major changes will be the new bus interchange completed by about April next year that is being co delivered with the council Sarah and ourselves and the associated network improvements in the central city but importantly next later this year early next year sees the next step change and the services changes that are proposed by II can under their hub and spoke model now in order to make all of that work there is a need to get timely investment and some services improve its through weekend and infrastructure improvements in action with the City Council and we do welcome the opportunity to work with you we just like to you know get a refined plan together that we can all commit to next year I think it 's important to recognize that in order to get the benefits from passenger transport for the wider city both in terms of dealing with those who don 't have access to a car necessarily that includes the young and the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also the fact that passenger transport does offer opportunities for resolving congestion we heard an earlier speaker regarding opportunities for bus rapid transport into the future but buses do feature largely in the plan for greater Christchurch and so solving the total transport solution so it 's a mixed mode solution with passenger transport walking and cycling initiatives and some road improvements and the sort of the parallel point there is in regard to the speaker earlier is the plans for infrastructure upgrades have been on the books for a number of years both for suburban interchanges and for network improvements but we just make you very slow progress and I think and it 's understandable we had a delay because of the quakes but there is a need to push forward and get some of these improvements underway with the cycling Network improvements we realize the council 's decided to stretch the timeframe from a 5-year to 8-year delivery program for your strategic cycle initiatives but we would like to have discussions with council in the next year about potential funding for some of those initiatives we did make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implication for funding our staff yeah that 's what those submissions says and I 've written down need to get advice on earth and big letters so we are waiting for the council to provide an application for funding which if we don 't make an application really by sep tember this year it 's all over over for the 2015 year potentially yes yeah i mean the circuit these are essentially and luckily we 're not averse to investing it and last year we signaled our appetite from visiting in your signaled network upgrades our staff are working closely with the city council staff to you know refine a business plan for the for the primary routes and we do wish to see some of those on the ground next year we do have some funds available not a huge pot of money but we do have some funds available still waiting to be allocated to the city and so we 'd like to get on with those yep I guess just on a wider note we we are concerned about the lack of progress on the council 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the City Council indicated somewhere in the order of 112 million dollars worth of projects that wishes to make a start with we could only earmark 30 million dollars for our potential half share of that and the National Land Transport program in the year today which is the first year of your three-year plan we have only been asked for and approved money to the value of 1.7 million so we 're barely in attaching twenty percent if you like of available funds we 've got 14 months to deliver potentially the balance of 30 million then we start a new planning cycle with government so my plea is we 'd like to see progress more quickly or certainly a signal that you 're not going to utilize the money so it would be reallocated somewhere else in use in but it 's being held at the moment for Christchurch because the government 's desire to see some program I think we 're all what here I guess just I think the other thing I just like to make a comment it 's not now submission but some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been there for some time they predated the quakes yes we need to make progress on the rebuild activities but we also need to continue planning for and delivering projects for the wider network we 've seen over recent months a number of issues regarding congestion put it particularly in the northern part of the city and yes we 've been able to make some very small tweaks to improve things but the long run planning and delivery of the projects that will work into the future is still important so we we have made an offer to counsel on how we might assist funding some of your share of that ahead of time in your program and we do reaffirm that we prepared to provide some advance cash for council in order to meet some of those deliverables for the northern arterial thinking god Phil look Jim thank you very much you say that 's not jealous are you doing my glass no let 's make sorry he sitteth I 've talked with with Jim and and yourself that Peter public transport proven i think the the governance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to need to do is make sure though that between yourselves at in GTA and ourselves as counselors and that we lead this i guess more aggressively than we can has been done and so clearly there 's some areas there that we need to refer to staff a comment and we will thank you for your submission thank you and did you say some cycleway monies available as well correct how much we nationally we have about 12 million dollars it to allocate well we 'd like to see it allocated and actually fully spent if you like by 30 june next year but that 's not included in the 30 money out of it it 's an addition in addition oh yes I can feel a cycleway coming Yanni um just a in regards to the cycleway the road that you done by the John 's right there 's no cycle we 're going in there but you you 're saying you 've got money but we we haven 't been able to seem to convince you to build cycle ways where your existing projects are helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that 's a good question and the challenge around cycleways is you know where 's the right place to locate and what 's the right form the challenge with putting a cycleway on on the road as it has it 's been designed it 's a very high speed high traffic environment it 's a what 's called a limited access road so the abilities for properties to gain direct direct access to the road is limited so therefore where 's the right place to locate that cycle facility at the moment there is a study going on with council the airport company and kiwiRail and that western part of the city to look at the wider network issues including planning for cycling we have in the plans for the route improvements out there memorial avenue and here Wood Road incorporated cycle improvements to get traffic our cycle traffic across the highway the challenge is to provide a parallel network that connects up the cyclists Christian um you talk a lot in here about Sarah and you do raise the issue with the central city Recovery 's plan and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree and the orders of general had a very good I think analysis of some of the lack of strategic direction from Sarah over the skirt alignment with the different plans so but I 'm interested that you haven 't really mentioned skirt and new annual submission have you done any work around possible cost savings or cost benefits to aligning the skirt work in the central sea with indeed ta and with council and with governments so that we 're only going past in fixing roads once and getting the desired outcome rather than doing it in a kind of we seem to be taking four or five guys at fixing roads firstly you know the the we 're not the project lead for the central city but we do have a relationship with both Sarah and the City Council on the planning and the funding for them at the top table there is a lot of discussion going on at the chief executive level and down to the officers about trying to best integrate the various programs so we do we 're possible have what you might call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in as you say potentially digging it up so we try and minimize that where we can the challenge in that as the timing doesn 't always work to to fix the pipes boo this is necessarily doing the network changes for the transport so we do try and line them up as best we can to minimize that and in many cases where the roading improvements can 't be fully implemented as was the recent example in kilmore Street some enabling works by the by the way of putting in ducks for later cabling and the like a pudding while skirt is going through so we try and minimize the amount of rework that 's just the reason that we 've been told at salisbury street and kill more can one with skirt is because there 's no money well so if you have cash that you could bring forward for us to align that with the skirt rip here wouldn 't that be a sensible thing to do could we not look at doing that so we can actually get them done and complete I guess the financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the crown and in that cost sharing agreement there are some limits on the amount of money for what is known as phase one transport projects that 's limits on all sides so that 's the council NZTA and the crown so you know I guess what you 're asking for can net envelope be widened and that would be a business case that would have to go through all three parties including the crown I 'm Kentucky we had a submission this morning from the spokes group and one of their suggestions was the creation of a circle advisory group do you have one we started one for Christchurch you have got one yes we 've got a national cycle advisory group which includes all the main advocate groups and we just started one in Christchurch which is just at a very introductory meeting and they will be providing more input into cycle planning for great Christchurch over the coming months well can we share your you 're part of it Oh council Council will be perfect he 's ever cycle user groups are part of it just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came and asked for it this morning that 's already done yeah I know but it 's but if we 're part of it hey no no but I 'm just saying if there 's going to be a sort of Sun cycle advisory panel it makes sense that a shared one rather than just one organization yeah so that it 's kind of shared with us yes yeah that 's the unchangeable some of them can do both but it but it is a suit it 's a citizen cycling advisory panel so its base nice intelligent missing two years one of our managers is the National advocate for it yeah very good ok I think that 's all so look thank you very much for your time it was great yes in advance,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

15,ygKcrX_NraQ,20140514,701.12,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1767,"Tim Hutta from crash eh in kinder berry tourism welcome Tom thank you for your time today and I 'm presenting today on the annual plan proposal for cct because of the profound importance of our work to the recovery of the tourism sector we live at the heart of one of the most substantial tourism regions in New Zealand and there 's little doubt that tourism has a core economic sector was one of the hardest hit by the earthquake events the effects are quite frankly been enormous and have lingered for far longer than any of us would have thought possible back in 2011 who for example would have thought the three years on our largest holiday market Australia would be forty percent lower having only recovered six percent in three years secondly international arrivals from all markets into christchurch airport are still twenty three percent behind 2010 performance the Alliance have removed so much trans-tasman capacity that we 're back to the levels of 2004 the capacity levels so ten years of capacity growth has disappeared in one hurt and we 've gone from being New Zealand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the conference market to being the least preferred so notwithstanding these rather miserable observations cct has how we 've made some very effective progress in a number of areas that I will summarize very shortly but I want to make council understand that the earthquake itself eradicated over 1 million dollars of private sector income for the organization to to a big decline and visitor center revenue and contribution and a huge drop-off and income from our business partner program and this happened because many tourism and hospitality businesses failed after the earthquake and in the post earthquake environment the weakened ones that were left could not afford the pre-health quake business pattern fees so in 2011 we had to have these fees keep the program alive although council held its core funding to see CT after the earthquakes which we thank you for the private sector revenue losses we suffered required us to downsize cct fundamentally and in april 2011 we made forty five percent of our staff redundant no other council entity took a hit of the size so i want you to understand that we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done that to remain solvent and to stay effective there are five areas i want to highlight today that we continue to produce sound results in 2013 we substantially upgraded our window to the world our website christchurch NZ calm and we optimized it for use on mobile devices this site today is a powerful referral platform for more than 700 canterbury tourism operators in a superb planning tool it now attracts 450,000 user sessions a year and we 've grown web traffic this year by very encouraging forty seven percent secondly we 've escalated our efforts to tell our earthquake recovery story to the world 's travel selling industry through electronic means by hosting travel sellers in our region and by attending many tourism New Zealand travel seller training events around the world why have we done this we 've done this because of third of the world 's travel companies that sell art enris to New Zealand have taken Christchurch out of their product offering and it 's not going to come back on a time we need to go out there and actively ask that the suspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very important to changing perceptions about Christchurch and building a far stronger reputation for the superb tourism experiences that exist right across our province our work last year to develop Christchurch reimagined campaign was a very important step in reimaging Christchurch as a creative innovative and resilient City that was well worth visiting for its attitude alone this campaign is 16 major age of Pacific advertising awards far more than any tourism on campaign in recent years and as it was helped enormously by the Canterbury tourism partnership that we developed in 2011 this essentially takes five hundred thousand dollars a year of the council funding and leverages it with an additional five hundred thousand each from christchurch airport and mb 's tourism growth partnership initiative this year I am confident that we will finally see trans-tasman Airlines bring back more capacity on to our Christchurch routes and they need to do it because over the last summer they 've been bursting at the seams and that we will see the rewards of very active communication strategy with Australians over the past three years the efforts of our Convention Bureau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half people have been quite remarkable through the very close work we do with all available venues in Christchurch with their hotels we have recovered thirty-eight percent of the conferencing business we lost in 2011 this sector is particularly important to recover quickly because conferencing is what fills our city in the winter and shoulder seasons and the conference business is what gives hotel investors the most confidence to rebuild here and I 'd remind you that we 're still operating with forty four percent of the hotel capacity we had before the earthquakes counselors all of our core functions are listed in our written submission and overall tombs council currently provides cct with 2.8 million dollars of funding per year and we raise a further 1.3 million from our partnership work our business partner program and other revenue sources our work is vital to tourism recovery of the city in our province and with fiscal concerns about inc i know some of you may wonder why is this important right now it is important right now because as i discovered when i came back to work in christchurch in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a very empty place before the earthquakes visitors made up a very large proportion of the inner city population by day in most of it by night and if we want our central city to redevelop economically must create a thriving visitor industry to bring it back to life my last point is more of a technical one about the annual plan proposal the draft annual plan contains a note under proposed changes that indicates an intention to transfer the great wine capitals projects to see CT in 2014-15 the rationale is listed as cost-saving the first we knew of this proposal was actually reading it in the plan there had been no prior consultation but our first observation is that we cannot understand how simple transfer of the great wine capital project could or would achieve it cost saving it simply transfers the costs to see CT which after all is primarily council funded whilst we have been involved in the past three years in the organization of the best of wine tourism awards we remain unconvinced that great wine capitals provide any material benefit and attracting more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those concerns are currently all of the 50,000 currently being expended by council has been spent on administration meetings and travel there is no budget allocated to marketing to international travelers and there never has been any budget for this secondly we observe that great line capitals organization has little reach to an international traveler audience it has a poor website it provides no evidence of active marketing strategy to global wine trevor 's and it seems to be mainly focused on hosting member events thirdly and really from the perspective of the wine industry in the South Island the foundation concept of Christchurch south on wine region is neither accepted or understood as being a particularly marketable combination by the wine industry across the South Island and this stems from the fact that wine production capability in Christchurch is minuscule and doesn 't align well with the individual strengths of Central Otago wiper at Nelson and Mull bruh which all have well-established in much stronger international brand recognition as wine regions the local wine grocer I was actually already convinced on us when I read it so I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for quell maybe I get to the point deal and a good point just wipe it off the budget all together I think so okay i just want to i do want to leave time that I could just he just basically repeating what what I 'd read and it was like you made your point really well yeah I just think of times like that sometimes you have to sacrifice projects so that you can overcome it to others yeah no I agree anyway Glenn and then tongue thanks Kelly just looking at the fears and sector numbers there do you think it 's peps more a case of tourism accommodation rather than necessarily a convention center per se and I 'm you know I 'm asking that I 'm thinking of the workroom air force museum and other places which to my mind in relationship yeah that 's as I 've attended as much like we love the wig ramir force museum it doesn 't have all the necessary features of a convention cedar in terms of breakout meeting spaces and it also involves a lot of coach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accommodations so far away so there 's a long-term solution that 's not great and it does mean that some conferences simply conference organizers simply cross it off because it 's too difficult for them distantly and I 've got Tim look I think I think the demand for Christchurch is very good I mean we 're getting a lot of inquiries you know 2016 17 18 but we just the big ones we just cannot get them confirmed at the moment without a convention center and we were the most preferred conference city in New Zealand I believe we can get back to that status quite quickly once we 've got their capability restored yeah I suppose the answer your question is we 're least preferred because we haven 't got the resources that they need for their conferencing yeah yeah we 're sorry yeah thank you sorry we 've run out of time so could we move on to the New Zealand Transport Agency","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

to make submission to the Indian plan the submissions on behalf striped places can it be my name is Mark chair on the chair just briefly we 'd like to make an observation on 500 point seven two city governments and decision making and it 's equates to the measure of levels of service and all the times we 've done deputations and submissions etc we 've never been surveyed or about a process or institutions etc I understand the mirror in a council meeting made some observations about the incorporating deputations with the council agenda it wouldn 't be all bad news if the counselor servatus surveillance they 'd find it extremely comprehension of the council 's community advisory staff on the committee 's advisor so who 've been extremely good on obliging and very good so they 'll be good news but we have that chance to sound so we welcome the opportunity moving on to activities and services on community sought support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intention of keeping the level of funding for grants as unchanged thank you we do make point that that the council 's actions do empower the Heritage team 's efforts and we should acknowledge and we 'd like the concert to acknowledge and pass on our appreciation to the council heritage team who 've worked hard to retain the Seas heritage and we found the Heritage staff to be informed professional bludging and curious and we 're very very grateful as regards activities and services 500 point eight seven and witches of guards levels of service and Talia Kuchar we fully endorse and support the council 's and its intentions as outlined in the plan now we come to under activities and serves the City Planning development 500 point eight nine I night night to the footnote grants for art center and landmark huge funding to be reduced by point four five and point three million respectively this dark places can it be strongly disagrees with the council 's intention to reduce landmark carriage funding by 300,000 we consider the move to be short-sighted and detrimental to the retention of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incentive to owners to building owners who might otherwise considered demolition also the grant really ensures because of calvin 's etc that the betterment and retaining the city streetscape and urban environment so we strongly advocate for the phone to be reinstated to its current funding level our reasons for reinstating the 300,000 our follows the city 's in a post-quake environment where owners are still assessing to hear heritage buildings future the reduced funding will have a direct negative impact on the CC huge team 's efforts to facilitate retention of a curettage buildings we know that section 3 eights are still being sought and a number of heritage buildings are still at risk to reducing the funding by 300,000 is significant and it would indicate to a reasonable person that the council is reducing its commitment to our city 's heritage if there 's a perception of this the owners might adjust their motivation to retain heritage building we also note that in one year the grants made with grade 22 heritage buildings and the proposed funding could easily be absorbed the new level be absorbed with one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking to one of the high street building owners 300,000 will actually bring back one of the shops and the duncan berlin by the estimate fully restored and up to code it 's that it 's that straight away the hpc historic places can be request the council consider alarm arts grants as a mechanism for economic rejuvenation we note the rejuvenation of the economic tivity in the central city thus far aside from the pop-up mall are those and retain strengthened and restored existing heritage buildings c1 the old government bill in Regent Street the bulletins building there 's an example of what I mean by that and just strike good example as noted to me talking to a listed heritage building owner the latest council assessment for their building has the land at seven nine hundred seventy thousand of dollars make it exact amount and the building is assessed as worth nothing once restored the total value for rates assessment will be three million dollars that 's a straight direct return the council will get and quantifiable it within two years I 'm not sure whether you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other investments that the council may do whether in the central city that 's a Liberty so you will get a you will get something back for doing that needs to say two years is a pretty good time frame for bringing the city back we 're also in addition which I can file we 've also been through we went through a workshop in 2010 and the council officials are there by her people you 'd call on building an economist called Donna Kripke and I can provide the material and he makes the points that on what he refers to his heritage rehabilitation that sixteen point five percent more jobs are involved and that then a new construction so in other words the money you spent you get a higher unemployment it makes the point on her a million dollars of our watch this is really interesting so Anna pieces George as an example and their own units that has got there that on computer manufacturing they get for jobs per million dollars output for new construction it 's 14.9 and heritage rehabilitation you get 18.1 those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually free environment as local the jobs don 't go offshore whilst we 're discussing heritage is so economic rejuvenation a huge contribution I would also like to make the observation that Historic Places Canterbury has a shot in seven and the cathedral junction so the tram goes right and past which some of you been in there and which we 've got a lot of our heritage on display some lost and present we have noticed a significant increase walk and people attending a train going past and some factors the case of 5 to 10 it is quite significant we 've also noticed to the transepts come in almost like a destination path the tourists actually follow it through I think continuing and closing in the loop will bring in the bonnet ins building and also fingers crossed maybe an incentive for ccd you to finish and start start accelerating the development on high street hunters you 'll feed some of you on the community committee nikki arts deputation that will be incentive on high street bring that through and bring through and it 's a sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submission for the other reasons we are aware that the city 's under stress but we should also make the point that 's the council landmark is now a major source of heritage funding for private building owners the canopy earthquake heritage buildings funders fine art and and cannot be considered as a major contributor funding for heritage protection in the future now the landmark grant is relatively small for the overall city council and could easily accommodate a less vital project we 're to be deferred underspending often occurs and another projects and I think this is a very important point council produce can be and and often deferred but the potential demolition of the heritage building through glac of grant funding results and the further decimation of our cultural heritage and once lost there is no opportunity for a huge building to be resurrected in the future once it 's gone it never comes back a council project can be inferred once it 's gone it won 't ever come back thank you very much councillors for hearing loss and sinners thanks mission good questions Pauline you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this that we heard this morning that we actually currently very short of stonemasons which old connecting with the Art Center no I 'm not familiar with the with stonemasons though I understood in conversation with the number of here just projects through and there was one discussion which was made in relation to a large building huge but in the central city that because the project was so long involved was not achieved to set up a school training hmm but I think that if that 's the case it 's probably going to prolong the restoration time it 's going to take which an effete the funding reduction might not affect that it 's not going to stop or slow it down a bit I can 't comment on a jewel cases on that budget or the stonemasons on it hmm other questions hmm so good oh thank you very much you very much really to get to say and the next one","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

13,HBpbfUw_h4c,20140514,368.61,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1130,submission is from david welch hello David nice to see you yeah I haven 't had much time to prepare anything but I just wish to make a heartfelt plea that City Council including the coming annual plan to look at car at baskul a corridors bus rapid transport systems this system this that he sent to be strangely ignorant of these systems which have been implemented all over Australia and Canada and places like that and a far more effective way of bringing people into the city from big distances so I 'm just asking really there that be included I 've been campaigning since 2002 12 years now to get this idea looked at the idea in particular just become more sophisticated and I have a few pamphlets but I can also just pd effective and if they like there 's a bass way from Belfast it comes down to the whimsies road that 's cluster the green land towards rutland street down through retina street and down through with messy present and this is much since the variable of course area to on the Caledonian Road Deon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new best way there this would only have one stop there wasn 't the best priority stopping it 's probably really ever knew the risk the stops would be able to be a bus probably the buses just keep moving the lights changed before they get there so you 're talking about 12 minutes from world-class into the city with their system and also along riccarton I can 't understand why they 're wasting time trying to put bus lanes and a really congested street this is an outdated technology running buses and busy cities on streets you try to get them off the streets now and give them their own corridors not just lanes macado 's running along it back in the more their maximal street you can take it right across down to Middleton road or down a foreigner you rode on that same alignment by cutting through several short streets full of old state house is full of all student flats they 've actually if you look at the possible ones that might be torn down they are virtually all run down flaps and probably sometime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flats will be brought right across the line of this alignment but this way you can have you actually doing this idea of think they all boom bass you 're actually creating a corridor with it 's mainly bus priority build a bus station on the corner of clowns road in the back of the mall idiots right beside the instance to the mall and also you see the catchment the actual catchment Overton 's mainly there and on the other side so I consider a matar shut up now because that goes on but anyway if there 's an eerie sense of it I do wonder why though wonder why after year after year after year either cities and doing this auckland spent almost two million dollars on public transport violent and said 700 million about the builder 236 million dollar busway this city is not even got only a gym day you know it 's just very bizarre i think well possibly and it 's you know year two of a three year plan that was put in place I think that the concerns that well what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know at the front of people 's mind when we get to the long-term planning process because I think the idea that this city has to have a strategic approach to public transport and and identifying corridors and exactly the way that you 've described makes so much more sense to me than trying to jam you know sort of yeah increasingly difficult buses onto onto already crowded and congested streets that doesn 't make sense to me but I 'm not a planner and I 'm not somebody with a public transport back back ground but I know that your passion has been the subject and when I read your submission at you know it 's a very garbled as I 'm a Cal to work and other states it now I 've got seven days to make its mission and I just does it have an early for group so rushed through that so as a no no but it 'sit but it 's what you 've been thinking and and and working through and I know how passionate you are about it I think there 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about public transport as well and would like to see a much more joined up approach at the moment we 've got a keen for example owning the roots and making the decisions in that area and we have to deliver you know the interchanges except for the one on the CBD and then you know it 's just there 's this kind of a bit of a mishmash around public transport at the moment which we think that we can lift up and out of that out of bed space but I don 't know where the fill is our transport guy you 'd like to follow on from that just look thanks for your suggestions and you have been passionate as then said about suggesting alternatives and the suggestion you 've had about the street for example behind them all certainly we can ask again engineers about the possibility of including it but that we have We certainly have asked for that to be considered along with your other suggestions okay think that 's thank you very much Dave I really appreciate you know how long can I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better at a document that i could PDF to all the council member 6s all right if things cooking mutual it 'll make for this and if i don 't care up that i believe these elementary and just for this is a bit cheeky that going public with us because you actually do about taking fewer times but I submit the Malaysian 40 houses put system and you I mean amazing skiing Oakland segments yes silly we 're seven thousand homes go what sort of them yeah wide off the meter so yeah I I mean I think sometimes you just have to look at these things in a more holistic way than we have in the past but thank you very much day and could I invite,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

that yep a mish Clark okay this one okay thank you thanks for the opportunity to talk to the submission that we made unfortunately Gary who is representing and South back can 't make it apology so we 'll just see me talking so I 'm the development manager for Waterloo and this submission relates to the annual plan or causal junction road extension effectively a piece of work that we 've been working with the council over a number of years and it was identified a few years ago but never actually got into the plan and so that 's what we 're supporting so a little bit about Waterloo it 's a commercial development as Lincoln covers 114 hectares and our being is basically creating a industrial space commercial development and we 've worked over a period of time some careful sort of design and attention to detail so the people that actually go there enjoy the space and also over time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the of the protein if I go to the next slide so we have created the as a part of a master plan process it is 114 hectares and effectively you 've got some fairly major roads that this piece of land sets within so you 've got powned road connects with Maine South Road at the bottom corner through the butters butters road that piece that 's actually quite a difficult one to get out on to this will reach to get out onto the main South Road which is a bit of a pain but we 're doing some work with NZTA to improve that but so pan road up to the airport and Waterloo Road at the moment runs along by the railway line and in the future will actually come into the subdivision and this and this is work that we 've been working with the council 's as we develop this site now causal Junction Road effectively is the top road and it is coming down and there is a missing piece to it and that 's basically what we 're talking about so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happening in the business park or what we 're trying to create so if we run through those numbers there when the development is completed we see there 's probably potential for 100 businesses 5,000 employees built space would probably be that 's probably close to 45 years of built space we 're doing it over various stages four stages we 've got two stages one and two underway at the moment and part of this is also creating that environment where it 's not just a large industrial tract of land but actually because you 're sitting in that location you 're going to need immunity and so whether that parks or some shops as far as some retail or restaurants cafes and all the things that you need in a slightly peripheral kind of location so and we 're also getting approaches for local community situations for sport recreation and combining all of that so we 're really looking to enhance the experience oh you should say so this plan doesn 't particularly well show so this just gives you know an idea of where it 's sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is we 're then we 'll do business park is so it distance the airport roughly 10 KS 10 minutes CBD 20 minutes and out to the port and as I was saying that it 's really this is this connection point so what we 're basically supporting as a change to horrible Junction Road which now if you see where the words are on that it runs up to that right hand point where the railway liners and it 's a fairly young really poor driving experience I guess would be a nice way to put it as far as so you 're running large vehicles through residential locations resolve the issues with safety disruption to those residents and pollution and just the road not being able to handle that kind of traffic and when this was put out through the consultation process we actually talked to a lot of those residents in that area and and it was amazing the the feedback that we got back as far as you know that they disclosed was a fantastic idea and so I 'm guessing that a number of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of congestion at that point as well and I what this will do is speed all of that up by taking it out of that residential location so this is what is proposed effectively it gives a straight shot of causal Junction Road basically which which can go from pound road and then you 'll be able to get straight on to the motorway back into town so you 've got the connectivity of the site as far as the pound road main south road basically back into town and so this shows that overall so that pink purple e1 is this whole connection from panda rode right through to the existing horrible Junction Road and so we 're really just some more supporting that the plan the amendment to the plan so it 's that effectively the main points it 's the improved connectivity improve road safety the redirection of the heavy traffic out of those residential areas and to enter into a park environment where we 've actually work with the City Council over the time that we 've developed and planned this so would work closely with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ network and really this is the piece that needs to be to complete the puzzle so that 's basically we were sitting Thank You Jimmy one questions regarding to you mentioned earlier has been the engage with the local community I said the local sports car or maybe the son of a resident is individual resident have you been to engage with the candle templeton resident Association kill Porthos Western Association or maybe week when the resident Association or not goober tops and um you 're just so I met with the chairman of the Gilbert ops one recently and he was up to speed overly with what was happening and so you have any feedback that was a problem really consider the temple in reston Association because this in the collection joinder the area and especially power sorta town central yeah yeah and I guess that 's the point there 's a number of major roads that are left that piece of land sits with them so totally totally understand what I 'm saying thank you there any other questions very good thank you very much then","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

of background first on crushes tramway so who is crusher tramway well it 's locally owned and operated the same owners is christchurch gondola and punting on the avin known as have mated since youth quack the owners have made a long-term committed Christchurch and the recovery of tourism and the area they have an excellent working relationship with both approach the City Council 's hero how the

down here every city needs an icon to separate it apart from the other cities and world and crushes tramway is an icon that 's internationally recognized we need a reason for tourists and locals to go to the city and the tramps tick that box its royalty before the trams length of various shop precincts it 's a hop-on hop-off service which encourages retail spend and you know unlike other hop-on hop-off services or other things we actually drop them right outside the front door instead of dropping down the corner so definitely encourages retail spend unfortunately the earthquake we lost a lot of heritage a lot of buildings but the trans bring back much of a much needed here at ish back to the city you know they really look fantastic going around the streets more and more today that the world or people want to hear a story about places their visit and the tram see that also with the live driver commentary so tell a story about the past about the prison and our bear out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are established the trans will link with those also and it 's a means of access for the mullion people sorry for people to explore the inner city and easy access for the million people who still

tram opening bring something back foot familiar to the city it gives them sense of confidence that the recovery is underway and it sense of pride you know the number of people have come up to me since the opening sayings and fantastic had the trams back has been really overwhelming in the trams a part of the community support various charities and hosting events for instance currently we are giving away in conjunction with more if in giving away 500 annual passes and that sort of aimed people struggling with the after-effects of the quakes just on the annual pass the end pass is heavily discounted it includes the tram and the gondola so for 55 you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every day of the year you like since reopening we 've had sixty thousand passengers and since November it 's been a lifeline to new Regent Street Cathedral junction and we think probably about half of hopped off and spent money and it 's initially international it 's been nationally and internationally recognized and SOPA nning that builds confidence not solely within the region but also for outside the business outside the region as well so to the extension ah this is what we think will be happening febri next year so we 've got the loop going down our my street operational and we 've down the bottom there we 've got a dogleg that goes into cashelmore and back again the problem with the dogleg is that the trans need to go backwards and boards and logistical e that cause problems and problems with frequency but the council were aware of that and it would say meeting in October they asked the council staff to investigate construction of a type of a crossover track which would return the trans back to cathedral square then investigation is underway and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost involved so what 's involved in closing the loop I don 't you can see on that slide there but there 's a small amount of red track they 're just next to the cathedral so probably 50 meters that 's young check that 's required to complete the loop that track some storage that 's quite simple and the line and blue is the over here which is required and with the building to the would have come down of course we need poles but you can see there that basically Luke to complete except for a very small section why close the loop well we 're talking about revitalizing to see this continues to revitalize the central city by linking other shopping precincts so such as high street shops and we 're talking both the northern high street and the southern end which again increases retail spend the voids trans going backwards so to spoke about frequency you know we really need to keep keep she 's going because that keeps the people coming so a bit of frequency means more people in the city more people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Council money on the traffic management plan it will save money Sultan fees additional signage two-way traffic lights makes a figure-of-eight so by making a figure of eight means if one part of the track is cannot operate you to construction or deconstruction the other part of that track can operate in over ninety-five percent of the tracks late so you know it 's like having a building that 's ninety five percent built why wouldn 't you furnish it and get a return on it that 's exactly what will happen so completing the sloop will increase revenue for the coastal city council support for the loop overwhelming 25% around about of all submissions to the council on the annual plan are in support of closing the loop we 've had letters of support from property developers minister well Shawn Stockman Anthony Goff accommodation providers or the major hotels in the region of course Christchurch and Canterbury tourism the new Regent Street business group Cathedral Junction business owners and of course the High Street business owners so in conclusion we have some important events happening next year the Cricket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cup of hockey championships and cautious tramway would like to expedia closure to the loop and time for these events and therefore would like to see funds allocated completion of the loop and this year 's implant thank you you hit the amount that that would take I still brewing care clatter Burt and sit in excess of a million but probably some one and a half so below 1.5 million to complete the 50-meter that 's completely 50 meters in the overview and the Oviatt right to be operable yep to be operative ok Tim just on who irons welcome aboard crusher tourism group so it 's full shareholders but 12 and so so it 's a local business peace so it 's not an entity or else what gets locally owned yep okay thank you Yanni thank you it 's good to set it you 're here you 've got a good relationship with Sara what I don 't understand is like given the transport plane and given the retail developments that are happening the car parking the changes to the public tressen passenger transport network what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trans book chapter that government have done there is ZERO map that shows what the future is I mean transport plan is more focused on traffic cars vehicles buses whereas the the to the tram is more focused on in a city the inner city transportation is opposed to bringing people in to see so I don 't think it actually specifically covers it yummy sorry but if government are closed I mean they own a lot of the roads now they 've got designations over area if we don 't have a common plan I think some of us would be quite nervous about spending money not knowing where the government will come in the next time take that land for a bus to change or a fast super stop so it 's like how could we get there we went up we 're sure that current loop isn 't Sarah understand where we going what 's happening we 're going to come out of meeting this morning with Sierra on the trends going down our mastery how that fits into the avon river precinct development so there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any conflict what they I guess that the area I 'm particularly concerned about is high straight the bus interchange literal street with the retail pricing that 's going in with the bus interchange and with the innovation creasing no one seems to be able to show us what the plan is for traffic in that area yeah I don 't know that that 's a fair question to put to the semester though that 's there 's something we have to address Vicki I don 't have a question I just want to say a huge thank you to you guys for what you 've done and Christchurch I think you 've absolutely put a half your money where your heart is and I think it 's fantastic I think our responsibility now is just to get on and affects the bit that you 're telling us about thank you very much for an excellent submission I just stood have just one last question which is on what what part of the trek are you not able to use that 's already been lazed so we 've already made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the moment because it 's not operative because we haven 't closed the loop is there any part of it they can 't be used at the moment because we haven 't closed the loop ah so you 're as 's kettle wall down to history background the back of the cathedral 60 what I 'm trying to get to us is that it isn 't just the cost of of putting it n it 's actually the opportunity cost of not getting a return on what we 've already invested in the ground by not completing the loop so it 's not as simple this is a cost we 've actually sank a whole lot of cards room that we 're not getting a return on at the moment because we haven 't closed the loop that 's right but yeah it 's a bit like that the building example you know your building you 've got a building that 94 that 's ninety five percent complete you don 't get a return on tillis hundred percent complete we just need to finish that last focusing excellent thank you very much please okay,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

NZ,NZ,Christchurch City Council,Christchurch City Council,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZETwErnCvvgbvBbnnHfyxA,14.05.14 - Item 2 - Hearing of Submissions - Part 9,imd0kzG8CtQ,20140514,929.37,"Christchurch, New Zealand",2792,"i reopened the meeting to hear submissions on that draft annual plan and I 'd like to invite i can see ryan reynolds and anyone else from the get fuller trust in life and the vacant spaces charitable trust ryan reynolds as well is it you 'll buy yourself wrong all by myself with support so the submission i recognized a lot of people of the years ok so this submission is formally on behalf of gap filler trust and life in vacant spaces trust but also with support from greening the rubble yeah represented here as well first of all just wanted to say thank you and for your support and also congratulations and ccc has been very forward thinking from my perspective since the earthquakes in the setting up of rebuild central and in finding some new ways to enable some good things in particular obviously we 're interested in the transitional city activities where council was quick to establish some new protocols and seed funding for external organizations such as ourselves in order to support activities that are either too time-critical difficult or possibly risky for council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for instance one of the key people from rebuild central was recently headhunted by the CEO of Adelaide City Council and snout leads a new place making team over there facilitating exactly these sorts of activities so CCC is developing a reputation here certainly don 't envy the task of the new council we understand it 's very difficult to have to do everything simultaneously but also prioritize broadly the submission is just arguing the value of the transitional city activities and pointing out one area where we think collectively we can do better than we have a bit about gap filler in life and vacant spaces and previous submissions we 've focused a bit more on on our sort of broad accomplishments I don 't want to belabor that but a brief overview especially for the new counselors so in the last 12 months we have done or enabled 90 projects in the city on 38 different sites and have around three active projects right now at this moment we 've worked with ten schools including developing some curriculum have been more than 40 companies involved in our activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aligned with specific projects that we have we 've had more than 500 volunteers given 2,500 hours given around 60 presentations to 2,500 people and have had a hundred plus kind of key media appearances including New York Times Deutsche Welle and a few big ones there so broadly speaking this movements doing a lot of good for the city experimenting creating opportunities and incubating ideas is hugely important right now give tourists reason to visit and give people reasons to stay in the city obviously that 's important as the recovery plan inevitably experiences some delays but even if the recovery plan succeeds since the plan mostly focused on big scale projects and it looks like small players are being priced out of the market that a lot of artists people in startups and innovation are terrified and this movement is part of the support ecology for them in this city um and in the last 12 months the transitional movement is gaining economic traction there have been quite a few businesses as I 've said supported by our projects a few that have grown out of our organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pallet pavilion where the community activity there has supported a number of cafes food trucks and so on and more recently we 've had a number of projects in vacant shops in Cathedral junction we 've now been asked to join the tenancy group there so we 're actually working actively with the commercial tenants there to make sure that our activities are compatible and are helping the property and then and the neighboring commercial tenants and with the help of Tom Hooper from the CDC we 're now in conversations with Auckland Melbourne Adelaide Perth and Wellington City Council 's all of whom want to in some manner replicate the successes that Christ Church has had in this realm so within at least some very small circles Christchurch is seen as a sort of world here in the short term this transitional movement looks good let 's say in spite of or in contrast to a general lack of progress in the city but in the long term we only look good if we contribute to a holistic and successful city so we must make sure that our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's part of what the submissions about thus far we 're still entirely reliant on what 's generally seen as property owners generosity so despite how many vacant sites and empty buildings we see everywhere we still frequently struggle to gain temporary access especially with guaranteed tenure of more than a few weeks which of course severely limits the range of experiments that can take place and how much people and organizations will invest in these activities if for instance they might get given two weeks notice at any time so our suggestion is just that ccc undertake or commissioned a bit of research into incentivizing this sort of activity and or discouraging owners from leaving their sites and buildings vacant so broadly this would probably involve some sort of rates rebates for property owners who allow temporary use for public benefit obviously would require investigation into how to control and manage something like this set the parameters ensure some sort of cost cap is in place but it 's entirely possible that in organisations such as life and vacant spaces could act as a sort of filter there or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratings unit database and some discussions about the cost of compliance because I don 't know the details of how the rates bills actually go out and stuff but but it 's all possible and this is happening worldwide where it 's sort of a matter of course a lot of cities are putting in place vacant property registration ordinances so they identify owners of vacant properties and hold them to some minimum standards of care i just want to run through a few quick examples overseas just to give a sense of what 's possible so in the UK actually countrywide full business rates are due on empty commercial properties but if charities occupy a commercial property they qualify for an immediate eighty percent discount on business rate and actually the local government has the right to grant them the extra twenty percent discount so charities are actually approached by retailers and landlords to take on a tendency of a vacant building obviously good for charities does raise some potential risks won 't go into now very recently passed in California was an urban agriculture incentive Act which allows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it allows landowners to get a property tax break in exchange for dedicating their vacant land to commercial or non-commercial agricultural use for at least five years so it 's recognizing that certain activities such as agriculture are absolutely unfeasible on very short-term sites which is a current problem with a number of Christchurch projects like the gorillaz urban farm Baltimore similar thing have rehabilitated vacant dwelling tax credit so if you spruce up your old building and make it habitable for community activities a tax credit there they also implemented which a few places have vacant property receivership so they actually take away the owners right to demolish a building rather than restore it to use and can actually claim properties and for public purposes some cities go the route of disincentives I 'm not generally that way inclined but there 's a proposal in Wheeling West Virginia that if a property has been vacant for more than six months you texted it twice the normal rate and if it 's still vacant six months later double it again and so on until there 's no incentive for leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so the point is just that there is a lot happening out there to take inspiration from and we reckon that someone needs to do a good cost-benefit analysis in Christchurch including social benefit analysis and make some specific recommendations here so and that 's broadly our suggestion for how this movement can make the next step and start to I guess answer that question of what role these temporary projects can play in the longer term future of our city thanks much microphone not to know I thank you very much and can I just say thank you very much for what you do for the city I spoke at a conference squeak them and Queensland done spent quite a bit of time talking about how a disaster was an opportunity to do things that you never thought you could do before and how this transition had created a new ways of doing business as a relationship between the creative artistic sector and the regulator 's you know us at the other end and Europe so I haven 't seen you since I gave that speech so thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the team behind you that the that the New York Times and lonely planet even look at Christ Church at the moment so you really are bringing huge benefit to the city so it 's an investment thank you for your submission I 've got Jamie then I 've got Andrew and then I 've got Thurman Yanni thanks Lee and I think I think I 'm Mia said the nail on the head you know in the factors you know I class you guys as some of the heroes of the rebuild so congratulations on everything you 've done it makes us pretty proud to be in tears when we see the good word he doing I don 't know if you 're aware or not just from going through the submission but um I posed and I had adopted by the by the council full 100 seen rates rebate for any property owner that offers the property for a transitional City use and the city in used examples of such as get further in the life in vacant spaces charitable trust so that 's that was adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been running for over the last year one were you aware of it and into aside from that which we have adopted is there anything else that we could be doing because of course you know you you want the carrots not the sticks but we need to be incentivizing as my understanding I don 't know about what was actually passed but the way it 's been implemented in practice is that there is a small quick response grant fund the transitional city grants fund that is managed by council and from about eight months ago or whatever it was I said if projects are applying for funding from the transitional city grants fund they can apply for additional funds to support a 100-percent like the equivalent of one hundred percent rates for the duration occupying that property is that your understanding as well right so so it 's somewhere and how many projects have been funded through that each round about three or four yeah so it 's up to the person proposing the project if they are applying for funding from that specific fund to choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so it 's so I get some sort I don 't want don 't know ways you don 't want to take any more time so otherwise that 's not working well enough there so I get it was everything we obviously have to do it but more work harder and Andrew yeah just very quickly referring to your last line on page 66 your recommendation that council undertake further research in this realm preferably with our involvement what would that model turned on its head look like if it was that you were to do further research with councils involvement clearly I 'm guessing there will be a need for some funding there but would you have the capacity to to take this as your project and have council 's support you in that rather than the other way around I would think so yeah absolutely would depend on time frames and things but but certainly we 'd be willing to do that as kind of the model that we did that get filler did when we first proposed the establishment of life in vacant spaces was a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and counsel then seed fund identity sir yes Tim what time for you um I 'm very interested know your philosophy and the current it seems that the current council philosophy with events is that big ticket items and it tourism that we 've seen that the small things that are intimate to the communities into the city and give it vibrance really what 's important and also what is important to us I 'll be interested on your feedback on their they could take a while but and bro broadly speaking I mean we see the need for both both the kind of big-ticket things that hit the New York Times whatever but also for the you know the smaller things nestled in the community a little bit we 've been steered by the council grant funding which requires us to do number of projects within the city limits and so we haven 't done we haven 't had as much activity in the suburbs as maybe we would like to with gap filler certainly at our last kind of annual strategy meeting we 've adopted a policy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphasis on that aspect and I guess a bit less on the kind of big tourist attractions yeah these expressions of identity and I think the role that small-scale stuff does is also innkeeper Tory will have actually allowing new ideas and some of those might have a commercial component but that today might cross between being business hearts community those they are really really important because it elsewhere very very few places where people can test ideas in a supported what well interestingly of it as you guys are in the new york times it was the dancing met that was seen with Prince Charles etc and it 's the soccer area that of the corner of he referred and colombo street that if we 're making World News it wasn 't the big ticket to us up so you know there 's a nun time just kind of interested in there so yeah thank you thank you so no I bet sir I 'm afraid would come to me into the time so thank you very much tremendous submission or not you 've given us some some great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can we just get a list of things we agreed last time from the acting chief executive because I am concerned at Jamie 's point and i have previously i can we followed that up afterwards we don 't want to take out any submission time so we agreed that we would follow that course of action i had one question is it ok just very quickly no because I honestly it 's just I really hate this process of having ten minutes for groups and five minutes for individuals I was an individual who arrived as a member of parliament for an area and was told by the meter that I had five minutes to present my case which means that I threw away my notes and answered questions so but thank you very much for for making the presentation I think we 're going to have to read think how we do these hearings at some stage in the future because i think this process doesn 't give us the opportunity to engage in a way that we 'd really like to i could invite Rowena watson come forward","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

8,9iySxiDyc4A,20140514,1075.69,"Christchurch, New Zealand",3377,Pam Richardson sorry too I thank you very much thank Mike for a meeting didn 't use it but it 's really quite appropriate that I out share it with me today it 's a little bit of information about a karai and I 'm seeing some of you may not know a pariah terribly well I thought that probably it 's quite important that you have this somewhere and you can file it away that tells you a bit about thanks payment or about Erica area of community board and some of the important statistics of bounds that we 've got one percent of the population with over fifty percent of the land area sixty-five percent of the holiday homes last cruise ship season 75 cruise ships 185 thousand patients passengers and crew to the town and we have an average of 400 millimeters more annual rain falls on Christchurch there 's some interesting facts the air talks about our governments the roads page is a very interesting page state highway 75 54 kilometers of state high runs through our area six hundred and eighty kilometers of form road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city council looks after 1400 11 hundred and forty-seven unformed paper roads and there are issues with bridges culverts tourist storm events abandoned vehicles braiding ice in winter so i won 't actually carry on through that that 's those few papers but it does give you some of the things that the that we 're dealing with perhaps I should go to issues facing the board it 's after the picture of the flooding I 'm sorry the pages aren 't numbered I should have had numbers pages and but it talks about the issues facing the board at the moment and there 's quite a few of them few of them they 're interesting very list of issues there and on the last page as our board objectives this is a work in process progress when we get time to around community outcomes so if if you go to the submission I so many things that we could talk about their in and need to talk and it 's at some stage about but I just wondered what mean where the questions that that you wanted to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are a number of issues there that are very important to us at the moment they 're my ones and the Sun well what I think is a misunderstanding of a cost to the city which wasn 't a cost of the city but i won 't i won 't go and today it 's the resilience that Eve network we 're getting funding from the Rockefeller Foundation absolutely I mean I know it 's ready as you but we can 't know but we can 't relocate money that we 're getting from the Rockefeller Foundation to other purposes of the council so I don 't think I suggested that today well you said that we should be building on material that 's already available and identifying programs currently underway and that alternative funding should be found to resources activity which we 've done right okay well what I what I was talking about was he that the city has a number of programs already that are absolutely amazing yes but there are number of bowl I don 't know kind of bitter okay there are whole lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and everything else Christchurch they can all come together then instead of having a squillion different meetings we can have one under the umbrella of resilient cities well that 's what I 'm referring is there actually going to save money that we bring all of those things all together absolutely don 't do that don 't redo them again no just no fee under my knife is going to reinvent the wheel I promise you there so I just wanted to give you some comfort right but that 's unfair cuz I 've now button to your time Yanni really interested in the little rubber suburban seems to me in light of the flooding yes and in the issue around the rail trail yes so so currently there 's no work program for that to happen you know that 's not asking that we create results to do that it 's just that we have a small amount of funding five thousand dollars that some starting us on the way along the program bits on the bottom of page five there 's a huge number of issues around little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're just doing a scoping excite at the moment Susan balance from Lincoln University who was actually involved with the resilient cities with us as doing they 're undergoing that project to look at what all the information information then come back and hopefully it might feed into the suburban prep my recollection started to up my recollection was going back about six years that there was a neck Aurora and a peninsula town and settlements policy strategy it wasn 't a car on Harbor small settlement study it was only on the acre io Harbor basin and it didn 't include look didn 't include little robot no but it 's a similar sort of thing and that needs to be done for Little River great thank you is there anything else that people would like to fold think of him not knowing your support for your social housing and give in your area no it 's smaller but it 's is that your support just a question around your concern about regional parks and the reduction of funding you 're checking out the when we had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would be what wanted us to support the head-to-head walkway so I assume if saying this if council did put in some funding for that I can I just check that your your board would support that yeah I assume would end or so though that it might allow your concerns about the reduction and funding for the regional parks it 's on your page 53 so our regional parks are very important to us we 've got a number of them I mean it 's misty Peaks tioga and another of a number of little small parks that obviously the council look after so we just noted in it that there was a direction of a reduction of I think of five hundred and sixty three thousand dollars in the regional parks budget so you know that the regional parks team that work with us on banks peninsula already do a tremendous job of working with us as a community we were just concerned to see that that was being reduced would you also support the head-to-head walkway money being reinstated well we haven 't our board hasn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're not aware we haven 't had a briefing so I 'm not aware of what it 's at about so I casually on the port levy right thing yes where are we pitching bay with the next one over such not part of our but it 's fact it 's only water yes sorry but anything to progress anything that 's walking yes I mean it is as important the banks peninsula but until you really know what the the whole program is a be a project is about I mean our board hasn 't had any briefings on it so I can 't make a comment sorry yeah yep there ever perhaps I should highlight what you is well one of those things that have just come to us recently is a the purchase of land at the head of the agoura water supply from major forest restoration trust a North Island organization that 's prepared to cobble together a an agreement or a purchase to purchase some of the land that 's the headwater of the air our water supply and i have included there a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be owned by them hopefully with the city council perhaps being part of that that program as well assisting with them with some funding towards that and managed inappropriately protect the water supply the city council also owned round the top musty peak so it would really complete that ring around almost complete that ring around the top abeka ffor with land and owned by or that 's retired for conservation purposes or for the community water supply it 's very important to protect the community water supply stop needs to be kept to have the water supply whether we 're aware of its taken from it needs to be managed appropriately no no gorse or weed spraying and you don 't want to have sprays and that in your community water supply so they came to us with them looking for some support for for the application and it 's along with the rod Donald trust so you 're obviously hear about that down the track when they first came to talk to us about it was not I thought it was about a hundred and forty hundred and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much larger larger figure and mind now now i 'm also very aware that you know we 're british cash-strapped but this is part of a community water supply and perhaps it may be considered as part of that water supply purchasing and retiring that top piece of land as it considerably reduced price graham couriers a well-known a Corral family and king to see it retired and managed appropriately around the community water supply so something else are there any questions about there have you raised that with staff of years where where is better than the process well where I we just went to mark Christensen Lowe 's counter and I went to mark just to see you know was it something that we might actually support and so we 've done no further work on it right I believe it 's up to rod Donald trust and the native New Zealand native forest restoration trust to lead that we were just sort of finding out did the City Council was it something that you might look at supporting so we were just really putting our fingers or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then set aside wat for reserve or yes it would be would be would it have a qe2 covenant on it right there is a and the in our submission that is attached there is a management plan that 's attached with it and gives you a bit of an hour okay and there is a little support from a North Ireland local authority that switched with the organization before that they are coming the rod Donald trust are coming and I think they may be coming as well to raise the idea to make that submission pet scream yep carry on seawalls in around the town page sixty two harbors and marine structures now there 's been we 've been asking for a number of years of regarding this issue that would like to see something done around the sea walls and some of the sea walls were built in the nineteen eighteen and nineteen eighteen we 've got records when they were lit two companies in those years in those early years and they are really deteriorating they have protected the town of RR and many other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our other major issues as our roading and we have had a real hammering in the storm the state highway also has had a very bad time in the storm and this morning it was not looking particularly good at all as we drove over it are there any other question sir do you meet with the with with transit over our not transit least museums in sports yes i do you do in sport we hope we 're meeting with Barry tomorrow morning at ten o 'clock at a seminar prior to our meeting to hear a little bit more about it but there are some quite massive slots that have happened on the road if anybody 's been over for a drive really I just wonder whether you know sort of this almost like three or four of your subject matter should be coming together you know like some of the the little rubber suburban seem to plan the concept of you know the resilient cities as well but it 's also the you know stormwater and and some of the other issues that you 've raised I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right and Little River you could just about you know sort of you develop a model for how you would deliver it because I just get the feeling that that doing things and and the banks peninsula part of our constituents say as is slightly different than doing things than the and the cvd area certain years and there is actually a sub-regional plan that 's being written for the land and water plane at the moment year working with the City Council environment and Environment Canterbury to look at a planning process for that so there is the opportunity to do that the flooding has come at the right time it shows us a lot of issues raises a lot of issues how is that the stormwater dealt with them and the area how 's that dealt on the rule and either a huge number of issues there and the better you know me the more we work together the better the community board would like to play a leadership role in there yes they we are involved with that I 'm on the zone committee as well but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important and of course the lake the first one there on page there 's a talked about page 36 the first one there on the submission there is a lot of around the lake people think the lakers actually cause the problem but it 's showing that it 's actually not the lake so we 've got a lot of education we do need to do in the community that all of this work requires funding to do it I think once the full technical report has released I think that 's going to provide a lot of insight hunter and to the flooding issues that little rubber I 've personally read it so but then I 've read the whole 325 pages right right oh we lose York forward to you it shouldn 't be too far away and as soon as we can release chunks of it we certainly will right yeah Andrea Thank You Pam now on page 55 in the middle you 've got some couple of paragraphs on the banks peninsula ecological survey yes and clearly there 's an alignment between this piece of work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the resources that are required to complete this work and the risks of not getting the work done in time well just recently we had we did have a meeting with an ecological survey meeting with Liz gassin and her team and this has been a long lengthy process that came as a result of district play and work a number of years ago we was a consent order was required to identify land on banks peninsula and the council have been working tremendously with us they 've nearly visited me every landowner on banks financial air over the time to talk about one of the special areas on their land but we learned that the the budget was going to be reduced for a an ecologist that would actually work with us as landowners and bakes furniture to help us understand the issues it 's good to have people that we know and can go to and talk about our land about what values we 've got on it and that come to us and help us appreciate how wonderful it is important it is so yes we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available as part of that but we hope that this will be or stages of it will be completed for the district their district plan review and it will be ongoing for many many years as spanx peninsula turns up new things all the time there any other questions or comments nope well we 're wound up and we have 23 seconds to go so I just say that a lot of work that 's been done on the cruise ship and the last 12 months ago and a lot of new counselors around the table so if there was anything that Lincoln University two numbers surveys we 've also been on a recent trip to littleton and find that they 're very reluctant to put in a cruise ship terminal and in littleton it 's going to be slow progress we had a meeting with Peter Davy last week as own committee meeting when a tour and learned that it 's that that 's cruise ship services and Middleton maybe last down the list other things have higher priority so you know we do need a lot of support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard the complete opposite so did you yeah so yeah so it 's either something has seriously changed since that has not noticed it 's not fall another no no it was the first thing they were going to do so because they needed to free up the warfare that they would previously have used for cruise ships so but they 've got a lot of community engagement to do around it because it is bringing the cruise ships right onto the heart of Littleton so but but we let us follow up on there because I know that it 's really important to little turn that we get the cruise ships back there so perhaps we should be a garage should be actually part of that engagement process as well I think so I have maybe they thought about that be they were but it 's we should be part of that today it would be really good and I 'm just about looking at council Tanner so that he can play a leadership role on bringing that together yep theory goes I 'm getting good at delegating now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very important so but thank you very much and thank you for making the effort I know it is a long way for both of you to come and join us today but it 's been thoroughly with well as it always is whenever you come and contribute as a group so as a community board it 's a valuable part of you know that the outer reaches of our constituency and you never ever let us forget that you very much a part of our control we 're a family together yeah so did you know we 're actually all board chairs we 're talking on television we 're on CT but we 're doing something for ctv so i 'm not quite sure whether all the board chairs are getting that opportunity or whether it 's just I know paula was last week right exfo I 'm about flooding though very good all right well thank you very much and and on that note I will now adjourn the meeting until ten past one,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

7,M4CGwr5hfwA,20140514,1029.26,"Christchurch, New Zealand",2412,the photographs are available to anybody here thank you don 't mind I just only did I notice my Maura come into the room but I heard his cell phone ring so I would like to now invite him to come to the table and just remind him that there is a five dollar fine that he is now I 'd liable well I think there would be the last straw with respect to my day today so far well well you 're most welcome here please please don 't waste any time sharing your the tragedy of the day with us but I 'm sure over a cup of tea afterwards people be more than happy to to help you work through those so she 's if we could go back to the Riccarton Wigram community board submission which is on page 33 and you 've got all we can we start the 15 minutes again up in looking for your submission so thank you far away thank you very much and please accept my sincere apology we understand what more normal prep it 's difficult to get around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that everybody with a red that storm water flooding protection controls is an issue in the as we know throughout the city and it 's a real concern around the halls will area with the amount of of land that 's them that 's being developed and the ability for the for the system to actually control storm water and they upper reaches of the heck it am surg collection and treatment and disposal or is the the bike are the bypass that 's being installed now there has been delays of course through earthquakes and weather but that is holding up the ability to develop some areas of if halls will in hornby power through the lack of sir its ability and also the water supply at the stage that I 'm referring to the arbor Tia block which is suffering from the inability to develop at this stage because of the lack of water n dem and surge capability regulatory services and enforcement activity is a bit of an issue and I think it 's an issue that 's causing our community board in particular and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the staff to or the enforcement unit of the council to actually keep on top if a lot of activity that 's happening in our area with non-compliance and I can mention the record person and 288 Springs Road just as a couple of examples we just know that that the issues seem to be lack of staff to be able to enforce conditions of resource consents and it 's a real concern when a resource concedes been granted with specific conditions and you get two operators one complies with the conditions of the resource can seek to the bill to the letter and others blatantly for year after year after year never comply with the conditions of the resource consent knits it 's very very frustrating for for everybody parks and open spaces one of the things that 's happened in our and our ward and numbers we just we are just raising this as an example where developers actually used the halls or domain as a basin to accept their storm water discharge rather than on their own developed land at this particular instance there were the shortage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ association in the balls will domain sports association along with the support from our community board for 416 hectares of additional land at the end of the battle we got 11 hectares of additional land and then we found and we also are involved in relocating the halls will pony club from them domain to the ANP site and then we found that a storm water discharge conceded been allowed for the developer of halls will on the park to discharge storm water under the on to round the horse will domain taking it quite a huge area with usable lens so we just didn 't see that practice as a benefit to our our area and end the ability to use open green space and for sporting activities when it 's got flood retention systems built into that domain that we 're never ever there originally Economic Development City Council 's a major shareholder in the Christchurch International Airport and we were we consider that a departure tax should be considered in the next five years to contribute towards the financing of the city 's infrastructure rebuilding as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airports throughout the world and throughout this country do have a significant departure taxes and we think that it would be an excellent opportunity for the City Council to increase its revenue to to speed up the the rebuild of the infrastructure etc and the recovery projects so that it benefits people that have been in the city and an hour departing tourists etc democracy and governance the board expressed support for the indications that the City Council community boards are likely to be given the delegated responsibilities the board agrees with this intention and it 's a positive change that reflects the renewed recognition that in the part the boards will play in the new city councils government structure governance structure so we 're we 're sending a signal here to say that we are eager to take on more roles and responsibilities we recognize the fact that City Council itself is very very very very busy and we recognize the fact that the community boards are the people on the ground and we can help relieve some of the load from the City Council and raise our role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city and the proposed changes to the capital program we agree with the funding adjustments to the proposed cycleway links and record and Wigram in the reasoning behind the change of the board but again emphasize the the growth that 's carrying in the southwest button does not agree sorry that 's just a continuation of my frustrating day so far I will carry on must have been a bad one it has been trust me so the the importance of prioritizing the completion of these particular aspects of the cycleway program and recognition of this aboard would suggest that the timing of the project 's timing of light project in other areas of City be considered for reprogramming and we support the road network project ID 924 for the extended hallsville Junction Road pound road that 's going to be part of the of the Islington or the Waterloo business park so the horrible junction road part of holes will junction road come out called the Saket and holes will junction made the limp then go through and provide an excellent freight lick north and south via the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also the flood protection control works projected for the lower mills road and I 've already touched on that the need for the ability for the area to contain stormwater and in a high rainfall events and I 'll just reiterate the halls Henderson 's basin is Henderson 's basin and it always has been in Dyson 's basin it was identified in the city Black Max as a as a swamp area and we are developing not only additional land drainage systems in that area considering the ground water levels are very high so the ability for that to drain to back into the land is very restricted so it just takes more area of land and the other concern we 've got as the halls will North subdivision that 's planned for a huge part of the Hendersons Basin area that is a real concern at the stage I need development contribution or just a little worried you 're not going to leave any time for questions or are your whole submission well rather quickly with the southwest aquatic facilities we lost the software and Paul several years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first cab off the rank for a new pool in the southwest and I just can 't stress enough that we are very very lacking with these facilities in the southwest of Christchurch very very very lacking there is no case yep I 've got some I 've got Tim David Pauline thanks Mike and Mike was a gas to flow protection and Henderson space in it yes we went on a talky ticket or with our around and that we were showing the flood retention basins and we 're gurram at cetera now as we all know they work like you know what whistles up added a comment staff made in was that the ones that will Graham didn 't fill up at all now here 's your board been given or shown I mean overall that 's what the staff MC but anyway move here 's your board being shown or given an outline of an overall management plan IE who 's responsible for managing all the retention basins because they do work with it and why I asked that question is a comment came back to to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gates the floodgates had been left open they hadn 't been managed and that 's why the water just flowed out that 's why they didn 't plot and fill up and also the plantings they meant to be empty so they soak up as much water as possible but you look at a couple of them and they 've got carried away with you to get more planting and something that technically shouldn 't be planted have you is your board seen any management management plan of these but not an overall management plan for this for the southwest of Christchurch I have just recently received a plan for the extension of the Hendersons Baines Henderson 's base and storm water system on the east side of banks road but if there 're more of design of building or an management of how they are managed so there 's one organization and one group of people making sure that they are operating correctly no we haven 't seen such an integrated plan I can think we haven 't but what I can say in response to your question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it they have been very full since that too it could as you said it 's something close the gates at some point following the incident thank you any other factors of course there 's a lot more development to take place at Wigram skies and it did allow me to see the the capability of the existing storm water systems at the stat the saturation point that they were recently knowing full well that there 's a lot more development to take place on that site David thank you I 'm just touching on your economic development proposal does your board have any view on a level of levy if it was to be imposed for a departure text five dollar tree was suggested yeah okay aunt Pauline thank you I 'm just on page 34 with your you 're suggesting here that perhaps we look at reprioritizing the cycleway program is that correct yes do you have any suggestions on what could be delayed so that what you 're suggesting can be moved forward that of course in the financial situation that we that we 've got as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than respond to this question i think we had need to have a look at where the traffic volumes are increasing we 're the Podesta pedestrian and cycle way best specifically cycleway usage is increasing and compare that with areas where there has been a drop off in such activity so that 's that 's a really a big question and what we 're asking for is the opportunity to have a look at that with the view of prioritizing it right so you might not be suggesting that the car ones that are underway being halted but perhaps more than X funds of the rink be looked at yes okay thank you Jame Alaska regarding to the southwest Aquatic Center your particular mention the staff report was you know in the end of the 2011 so they figure was incorrect so affect a lower than forecast goes in the southwest for seven years but you mention you have your world provider the update information in response what did you have a information right now we do have some information right now and we know that the the the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neuville the site we dint novel is because it meets all the criteria for major aquatic centers it 's close very close to many of the schools it 's close to a mall it 's closed on the major bus routes all the buses stopped and started from home be more so it meets ticks all those all that criteria but the fact of sense of losing qe2 since the earthquakes there 's been a lot of pressure put on the the council for aquatic facilities in the east to replace that and we acknowledge that for what we 're saying is we were hanging out for a pool before the earthquake came and i understand that the budget now that was in for earmarked for the southwest Paul has now been shunted out is that correct capsular chin that 's right so that 's the real concern that our community have been the opportunity for an aquatic center has been moved a lot further away than where it was originally and that is still a concern of in the southwest yep thank you well that 's the that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presentation and we have one more before before we break for lunch,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

the sixth member of course is Andrew tuna and I 'd like to clarify he had no part in the preparation of this submission oh no nobody 's advocated for the something that 'll turn my bikini water is unanimous in its support for the head-to-head walkway because we all know it has strong community support nearly everyone thinks it 's a good idea and I think we acknowledge the difficult task you have budgeting for you for the year ahead with everything that has happened and in this climate of great uncertainty we congratulate you on the plane you have drafted which we generally agree with we would like to be able to support it in full but there is one thing we do not agree with something which is very important to our community we do not agree with your proposal to amend the three-year plan and defer funding for the development of the head-to-head walkway the head-to-head walkway has been a long time coming I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that attach to your submission if it wasn 't I have a copy here that I would like 60 laters no timeline anyway the timeline illustrates how long successive littleton Mount Herbert community boards have been trying to get this project off the ground when a significant sum of money was included in the three-year plan by the previous council we thought it would finally happen late last year the board set up a hip-to-hip working party made up of representatives of key community organizations to work with staff and board members on this project in just a few months real progress has been made and we were looking forward to finally seeing the first sections of the walkway up and running later this year so it was with dismay we learned that you proposed to defer the funding we did not understand the reason given on page 93 of 95 staff have done a lot of detailed work costing the three existing sections of track to bring them up to an appropriate standard we have agreed on a logo and have capital endowment funding to prepare a brochure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poised to begin rolling out and we feel like the rug has been pulled out from underneath us that 's not the head he will play again now this the view from the Starship Enterprise over here and what we would really like you to understand is that a lot of the work costed for the head-to-head walkway is actually work which needs to be done by the council anyway much of it has been identified in various council plans for coastal reserves around the harbour including the recently approved Stoddart point management then we ask you to reconsider please find a way to avoid deferring funding for the heated walkway and our Jane and Adrian will tell you why my eleven-year-old daughter recently announced that was pretty cold how she loves 500 meters up the inside of an extinct volcano takes a boat across the volcano 's floor drives and a bus through its outer edge then goes to school on the outer spur we live on Mount Herbert she takes the black cat few then the bus through the tunnel and goes to school on heathcote Valley she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity with the heck Ted walkway to create a tourism venture that will be both economically positive and enhance this Harbor and our city will you go to Wellington Auckland London Sydney Seattle I could go through the alphabet and name every city in the world there has any water they maximize it the Thames walkway in London has risk in recent years has transformed the areas of Butler 's Wharf the likes of walking that were once pretty industrial areas and make them vibrant happening and lively close to home the Otago rail trail has brought huge economic benefit to Clyde the Chateau Craig otha and a whole lot of other towns along the way Martin Sneddon recently stated in his role with New Zealand tourism board that it was an excellent example of what tourists come to New Zealand looking for and look what we 've got 15 minutes on the bus and we can offer something that could be equally as you make and the Foundation 's there and ho look we all know how much foundations cost to build on the city we 've got the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build this track so why do we wait people like oh unconvinced that tourists come to Christ Church and that those who grew up here like myself return not predominantly for the big cities lights and the big city life I think they come and that we return to experience the quintessential Kiwi great outdoors many of us are returnable actually come back from cities like London Sydney we 're escaping that way of life so why not build on this great outdoor recreational asset that we have sitting there further north the abel tasman walkway is another great example of how the economic benefit to smaller towns look at much greater turcica why can 't we do the same belittling governors bay Diamond Harbour we 've got so many creative artistic people people who could hire kayaks are beaten breakfast opportunities living springs are sitting there

from Australia to do that hundred and eighty dollar a head of course they want to come they want to buy a slice of the peninsula lifestyle that we look I can just see the pure Clubhouse cats making and selling homemade lemonade the walkers walking along the beach when I Drive home tonight and reach the top of dyers pass i 'll still be blown away by the vista and tomorrow when I 'm cooking in my cafe at Diamond Harbour I can bet your bottom dollar that at least one tourist will say to me wow how can I experience more of this place so let 's give them the hit a block way and while we 're at it let 's see the intercom economic benefits that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay right rape and in challenging our little sorry there 's more but wait we 've got another four minutes to go much oh okay four minutes includes questions they know that I 'll be very brief I 've just showed people raving child that i SAT oxygen from the rim when I start talking so let 's go very very quickly a little you know we don 't have to convince you about the need for this the what we 've been waiting 18 million years another two political terms won 't matter but it will matter to us announcer in the moment I was watching as kolkata was looking up there at probably one of your places on the furniture as well a council goth scene there and they 're quite quite a lot and I we 've all got some kind of relationship with it it 's the geophysical and actually the mirror physical and the actual birthplace of Canada it 's where people come to I was recently in a conference in New York guys wearing canopy t-shirts people don 't come up and say hello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a conversation with it so canobie likes to acknowledge that it 's its knowledge of historical literacy the historical literacy of this community actually starts the year ends there and all roads lead back to that particular place of the 19 runic oh they are night I finally age of them are on the peninsula three of them are in our region particularly two of them support the idea of this so the rationale around it is not so much about whether we should we know it should and you know it should and it 's really important it 's really about prioritizing and we feel that it 's the right thing to do given that you know of the importance of this it 's sublimity of my particular conversation you 've said we 're out of my life that I 've never heared it 'd be so grief but anyway questions right race yeah thanks Adrian I can still breathe just I don 't think anyone needs to be convinced that this is a great idea that the issue and I think this goes back to the cycling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that this is not a particularly a budgetary issue it 's an implementation issue so I mean this is a question to start we 've asked at many times the same with the cycleways what is the holdup in terms of actually doing this it 's certainly not a budgetary issue so I just want to make that clear my understanding that when you were briefed was that theory house said that it wasn 't ready to go we query that we don 't believe it 's true we think it is yeah so this that 's what we need to drill down on with staff Jimmy okay The Guardian to priority yes I you know then eyes this very very important a project based on the presentation but I 'm comes in the prioritized because the base on the staff where the accommodation here is default one year only to align with overall work target pocampus please tell me if released are funded modular 294 cake transferred to learn repair the damage the pump station or Porter hall or underground the assault assistant water producing which one is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul of crusher eats people outside of the city yep it 's about repairing the damage of the solar for other people of people and Christchurch it gives another option for them by creating the support way allowing us to just kind of get on and enjoy it and this is a recovery issue because so many other tricks around our communities our clothes because it 's too well as a whole lot more closed because of stored an image but because of the earthquake and there 's a real need for recreation opportunities not just for our local people but for crush your city as a whole and I don 't want to see any more people at northland small a torus asking what can they do I mean we 're not tourists to go into the malls to spend the day hanging out I send them to the Condon Paul yeah i think i think this there 's a lot of support around the table and and so what it 's going to drill down to us as as as how we get this inside the inside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its about this is more about capacity than money and if there 's a way that we can broker some sort of support so maybe i 'll just ask you the same question of us others as that as thera is our volunteer effort out there that wants to be part of building them is here absolutely yeah including the farming community and the local volunteer organisation do you have any trouble with red tape for volunteers no they 're really law abiding citizen Ohno no but I mean we don 't forget all the stuff what we 've been told as they 're sometimes some of the red tape that we put around health and safety and stuff like they 're actually at disables volunteers from making the contribution that they would otherwise make do we need to break down some barriers as the question if you could that 'd be great I mean Eric to say now experience with the reserve management committees with organizations that are taking on repair of the church beowulf I think there 's a group doing helping with that is that there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to sort sort it out right I mean there 's a big group of people I mean particularly in the diamond harbour area I 've organized companies where they 're based there like Johnson 's for example as one there 's a lot of fulton hogan there 's a lot of really good knowledge that is used anyway that i 'm sure we could pull teams together to do some of the words right well thank you very much for your time it 's are much appreciated and it 's great to have a a submission with such a strong presentation and great photographs as well so very much appreciated thank you","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

forward thank you good morning Lee welcome well we 're not asking for a lot we realize the council situation at the moment but you will got a submission and our biggest request is the bishop Dale library and community center we still want them to go ahead and that sad but just then really in the ward at the moment is there anything else you want me to explain that that 's known and I mean it 's a very straightforward submission but I guess it 's an opportunity so Vicki could I just find out exactly about the bishop Dale library community center what 's actually holding enough well it was damaged in the earthquake and the counts couldn 't give them to it for a long time it had a deep EE ah nuts and that 's why they 're counts couldn 't get into it I don 't know what 's holding it up it was one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have got no idea yani i 'm just so i 'm clear you do have a temporary library that 's been established yes we do and how is that working very well people are using that so i think really one of the things in terms of bishop tail is that with because council has changes tooth quite prone policy to enable buildings that are possibly under thirty four percent but not having critical brittle collapse mechanisms that can open staff have been relooking at Bishop del to see with it enli whether a policy change we can we can open it I are you asking us to to reopen it auto repair or if we could spend less and get it reopen but not up to the same level of his great proneness that as we had in our policy what would what would your guy sleepy well it 's difficult that that community center did need some form of betterment it was a number of years ago 10 years ago the council was talking about demolishing and rebuilding it that has never happened and some of the things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community center but it 's a very busy community center and its really the only major one we have got apart from avis hope and the little old library and findell dhryn that we have gotten our Lord my understand going to the community board in two weeks mid May so we should hopefully be able to get some more information before we finalize that but there is an issue with our insurer as well which is mulling things up hello k thanks Phil and the field Alton library which is open and you refer to the opening is and that you your board would like to keep the current opening hours yes um really like to keep the current right yes and I don 't understand why in terms of the accessibility and availability for people if in fact council still want decide that we need to achieve some cost savings in this area I 'm just wondering what do you think would be people 's preference if they ours had to be reduced would it be better to say have them open later in in the in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know that your boards first preferences that there be no change I 'm not an authority on this but I would like a couple of evenings open a week in Saturday mornings I don 't know about later in the morning because when we go under near for meetings that are always people queuing and waiting to get in at nine o 'clock so i don 't know whether you really want to open it later on the mornings that 's maybe losing a couple of evenings would be okay if that 's what we have to do thanks film thank you and Ellie they 'll can I just ask about long ability and community with regards to the problems with the lens is a lot there are a lot of blame the shoes around parts of your ward and houses having come down and see Tyrion sup and insurance companies what 's your own ball especially with some of the older members in your ward well I think like the rest of Christ which is a lot of stress fear and a lot of it as insurance companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than what we 've already jelling it 's slowly working through what do you feel as being longer than the Gorn what do I feel dis communicating with them and giving them information but really they have to deal with your insurance companies themselves EQC is open and and the finish and service center to help them with eqc matters but it has really insurances and clean my bills I 'm obviously across the city a lot of improvements on land of increased out of evaluations if you put any parts of the board where the land is XD cropped in valuation or is that it largely increased support know from my experience the tc3 land and our area has stage at the same level it hasn 't gone up in value but from what I 'm looking at they when they 're rebuilding they can put good platforms down before they build their houses as expensive what they can do it okay well thank you very much valid it 's a great contribution we always like submissions that says start off by saying this submission does not ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but thank you very much thank you much appreciated,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

4,GAYv4YqDwq8,20140513,1059.78,"Christchurch, New Zealand",2648,and duke de loup i think are you coming up together okay very good it was quick I don 't even know it was all on the public health well like eating out the helpful video just introduced us this is big delay the spokes can 't grease officials convenient I 'm just spokesperson love it and I 'm Claire Simpson currently the chip the Secretary of spokes Canterbury which is the local advocacy group for cycling in Christchurch thank you hope our PowerPoint is going to show up ok on it rice screen rather up to you yes so either lunch yeah yeah okay um here 's if you can do those screen lights that 'll be fantastic just by way of introduction would like to thank you very much for you time today we know you 're in for a long day and you have it meet us before most of you being knew that some of your head we have a mission to promote the bicycle for everyday transportation we 're going back in fifties folks we have a vision by 2020 Christchurch will be among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that number out of the Lonely Planet Hulk of Christchurch demon top one of the top five way to the fifth top city in the world so we thought well goal only cleaner and our goal as a comprehensive connected community center Cycle Network and we strongly believe they 're exciting infrastructure is not just a nice thing for a city but it 's an essential thing it 's an essential component for an effective transport system in our city and our aim of our presentation today is to convince you that good cycling infrastructure makes sense financially and socially so at this point is there a relief congestion affordably and we have many examples all over the world of cities that have found it by providing good cycling infrastructure they have relieved major congestion himself would be Portland Oregon others would include Copenhagen and closer to home Melbourne so many cities are finding that shifting people onto a cycling network a reliefs congestion as an affordable change to our transport system I have pushed the wrong button and here you go and the cycling train the Christchurch transport strategic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeks to shift the transport mode choice to active in public transport and very shortly you 've got a campaign coming up about carpooling and transport choice so we buy into that and to support the transport strategic plan this annual plan must provide widespread cycling infrastructure improvements such as on street separation circles having an early start of the traffic signals the provision of signage for cycle ways at cetera and providing cycling infrastructure as part of the rebuild is the least expensive opportunity the council ever get to affordably solve the issue of traffic congestion infrastructure can very easily and inexpensively be established at the early stages of street change so it allows people to become reacquainted with our rebuilt sitting straight away it starts as we mean to go on the Sharon idea exercise the council asked of the public showed that people wanted to take advantage of the rebuild opportunities didn 't have a more actively an active transport City skirt cause these sort of changes betterment so we 're buying into some of the we 've got we 're facing some of the issues of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without leadership and sanction from the city council council staff assure us that they are doing bitumen wherever they can but unfortunately we don 't see a lot of evidence yet think hands are really tied by some of us 40 speak in some of this insurance speak so we glued you to do the betterment take the lead now time is of the essence it 's sensible in financially prudent for the council to seize this opportunity to provide funding to scoot to improve roads for people on bicycles commercial developments can be induced to provide end of trip showers lockers secure parking carriageway woods must accommodate all of the people that are going to use them and with homes in businesses relocating this annual plan is provide for that kind of movement and the infrastructure to allow people to choose new residential developments must be required to offer the carriageway woods and infrastructure to provide for safe on and off road cycling in to give cycling advantage through three ways psychopaths and also on-site storage car parking can be provided off street to prevent conflict reviews and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eton some cars or still comes with people unemployment shifting we have an opportunity to allow people the choice to cycle by offering them instead inviting cycling infrastructure so this is the mojo choice and shift that was envisaged by the transport strategic plan and we believe the annual plan must put these provisions in place with specific funding we know congestion has been increasing for many reasons if this annual plan doesn 't effectively provide appealing alternative transport modes and congestion will strangle Christchurch and bankrupt the ratepayers and we 're not just we don 't just talk about cycling we also buy and domestic transport there is a measure of social justice here as well with fifteen percent of people cycling Rick community has been very clear and demonstrating the need and desire to choose to cycle safely that nearly a third of the non cyclists want to cycle and feel intimidated by an inhospitable rose there 's a silent condemnation of decades of neglect of our cycling infrastructure people want to be able to choose that transport mode which suits their needs we want you to change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identify and capture all rebuild opportunities now the quakes brought us hardships and they brought us opportunities people realize that we could rebuild for the 21st century yet too many rebuild opportunities to provide much-needed cycling infrastructure have already been lost skirt requires Christchurch to provide planning and funding if new cycle infrastructure is to be included neither the three-year plan nor this annual plan provide funding or direction to provide cycle infrastructure as part of Road rebuilding rebuild opportunities must be identified and funded give cycling is to be a priority all road and footpath projects must provide for cycling please fund for planning and implementation accordingly new roads and developments will also need to provide adequate cycling infrastructure and room for future expansion as more people will choose to cycle please fund this planning people will want and need to mix travel modes providing secure cycle parking a popular bus stops and the bus exchange working with Environment Canterbury to provide for more than two bicycles on a bus are some of the basics please fund planning and implementation spokes understands that the major cycle routes are a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now the roots will work best if they are well connected by inviting cycle infrastructure some of this may be the betterment opportunities from the rebuild some will be identified by the community staff will be aware of others funding to identify an implement will be required christchurch is fortunate to have an active cycling community council can benefit greatly from both the professional and real world expertise found in our community by reestablishing the cycle advisory panel as an integral part of all projects which impact on cycling please make this part of this annual plan the christchurch strategic transport strategic plan recognizes cycling must be supported to this plan to work the major cycle routes are a key part of making a CTS be successful building them sooner rather than later is possible if the staffing and funding for construction are provided in this annual plan the census found that seven percent of people in christchurch commute by bicycle christchurch city council staff founded fifteen percent of people cycle regularly and thirty-two percent who do not currently cycle would like to but are intimidated by the lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by sharon idea respondents far more frequently than other issues submissions on many projects have shown similar support with fifteen percent cycling regularly and thirty-two percent wanting to cycle allocating at least fifteen percent of the roading budget for cycling is simply fair this is especially true given the decades of underinvestment and the demographic shift away from cars christchurch city also benefits from lower road maintenance costs and congestion reduction as recognized by the cts-v sadly this annual plan fails the community fails the cts-v and fails the promise of cycling city of cycles by allocating a mere half a percent or about 2.1 million dollars out of eroding budget of 372 million dollars aside from the major cycle routes funding the only other mention of specific funding for cycling is found in the act of train support operations budget we 're out of 14.8 million of funding cycling receives just 349 thousand eight hundred and five dollars while this is in keeping with the priority accorded to people who cycle by former councils it is actually less both in percentage terms in actual dollars allocated if House funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this annual plan are clearly not in favor of cycling this can be easily remedied by reallocating funding in alignment with the goals of the CTS be the communities clearly stated support the need to cease rebuild opportunities and by committing funding to writing the long-standing neglect for the health and lives of the community and specifically for those people who continue to cycle in spite of attitudes and actions which threatens their health and lives we would you choose to emulate success stories that we see not only around the world Portland Copenhagen Melbourne but also to look at success stories with a new zealand such as the communities of new plymouth and hastings in the diagram there is a summary of the NZTA model community success stories of hastings in new plymouth and i have the booklet here if anyone would like to receive it it comes from NZTA how they did it we can do that too easily so our key points are condition is relieved by fewer cars prioritize investment and cycling infrastructure and mass transit purecars make life safer for everybody and this and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parking require developers to build for people and their land uses and help people get around safely and enjoy living in the city Leo Dion who I think made me recently as the Dutch cycling ambassador said recently there is so much potential here in Christchurch it is a chance an opportunity to transform the transport network if you don 't grab it now you probably never will thank you thank you very much Yanni and chewy cookie thank you very much for your presentation today I 'm the counselor for the banks peninsula ward which of course is a part of the Christchurch City as well and two of the main population areas closest to Christchurch in my warder littleton and diamond harbour and I 'd certainly be interested in your view as to how those population centers could be integrated into cycling networks bearing in mind that for diamondharbour we 've got the the water to cross a course or to go around and littleton is separated from the rest of the cycling network by the tunnel and the hills i 'd be interested in your view on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has encouraged Environment Canterbury to consider putting in a shuttle specifically for bicyclists because with two bicycles on a little tin bus going under the tunnel the experience has been that many people have given up on trying to get a space because it 's always full as far as getting across the water well you got the ferry and short of a colonic bicycles I don 't know um Yanni you think you um really what I hear you asking us for is not betterment it 's actually different doing things differently not necessarily more expensive be given that skirt are made up of three partners indeed ta central government and US and so we 're a minority have you talked to Sarah about the strategic opportunities to get some of the ideas that you 've talked about we have spoken with Sarah we spoke from the skirt we 've spoken with christ church council staff who have told us quite clearly that if City Council was willing to fund the planning and implementation of betterment opportunities as part of the rebuild skirt would carry them out but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to fund not to allow the not even talking about spending more money just talking about putting things back differently have they given you any responses well they haven 't told us that they 've told us something quite different so that 's very interesting this is where we get into the the insurance fake debate as well and what we we speak to a lot of groups we speak with you can we speak with the bus drivers who sleeps the truck drivers we speak with police we 're all part of those any network that involves moving around we 're there without fail Sarah skirt the council workers the council staff the bus he can staff will say you need a champion and the city council elected councillors because unless yearly two counselors say well bugger it do it do it we want it done they feel their hands are tied now I just can 't emphasize that enough I I 've asked and asked to ask how do we get it to change and they all have said you need a champion and they have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be comforted by the fact that we have just recently passed a resolution to ask how we change the parameters of skirt to align to what they call the natural environment recovery program but I think you also need to be aware of the statutory limitations that recovery programs add this is a recovery plan and the powers at sarah NZTA have over recovery strategies and recovery results yeah I think I think you 've come here to look for solutions rather than their barriers and and the solutions are are actually in our hands as you 've quite rightly identified and and in order to have betterment you know as part of a project signed off by skirt then we have to vote the money to pay for it because the money isn 't sitting and waiting for them to spend it they have to come to us with proposals that are outside their they 're very strict returned to as it was with proposals to get a better outcome but you had come to the end of the 15 minutes so thank you very much because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take on board what you 've said it on I mean I think a number of us feel that we need to get this right this is our opportunity to do so so thank you very much I understand we 're doing yep cheers thank you thank you,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

3,4kaSFTNe9Cc,20140513,943.35,"Christchurch, New Zealand",2632,"Pegasus community board and forth welcome welcome PL thank you for the opportunity to come and submit on behalf of the ability versus community board first off I would like to thank Paul in Harlan for acknowledging the east on behalf of Sierra and myself we both looked at each other and at the same time we mount that 's nice second it 's good to feel not not abandoned so the submission on the whole the board agrees that the plan clearly set out what is required to be done as the city faces the challenge of recovery and rebuild page 35 of the annual plan we do feel that to date the consultation with residents and the flood management areas and information around that has been insufficient do acknowledge that there 's additional things happened with that arm the stormwater team tark forecast course that came out it 's been because of the recent flooding but we do feel in our waters though area south shore south bright and Avondale going turn and east burwood are being a little bit neglected as far as the information that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planned performance around the flood water protection for four households per thousand and a fifty-year rain event that 's somewhere around about eight hundred to a thousand houses and the city and a fifty-year rain event we 've had several those this year and we haven 't seen this with a level of flooding so it just raises concern that the year methodology and understanding what happens in certain rain events as flawed within the in your plan so just like to highlight that regard to the maintenance of waterways in imagines we feel that sixty-six percent of customer customer satisfaction as far too low and we would like to say that most of our ward would be the thirty-four percent who does satisfied because in our ward we 're really aunt we 're not happy with any of our ottaway ages the maintenance that has been under so far we do realize it 's a transitional stage but we do feel that a room for improvement we do have in our submission that on the first of May we were meant to meet with council officers in Sierra staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed so to have the retaining walls that have been protecting the end of the spit and what the recurring storms those have been eroded so we just like to acknowledge that that 's been that meeting has been deferred but we would like it to still go ahead there is quite a concern about the ongoing erosion along the air and as that erosion continues the risk to the remaining houses will only increase if we don 't get on to that we would like the current performance of river overflow of imps to be recorded in the annual plan it wasn 't for 2011-2012 in 2012-13 where we 're that those figures are probably quite different due to earthquake but they do need to be acknowledged we think by not having the limits trying to just hide the reality from bumps in the far as the rating network paid 41 we would like to ask that consideration be given to more transitional repairs a lot of the potholes are remaining for four weeks and months often a little bit of gravel cronin the more a bit of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our vehicles to ourselves driving around in those conditions we would like to see the resident satisfaction increase over time at the moment that remains static and the plan we think that the needs to be a commitment for improving of that service active travel the board is concerned about safety in the east shortly after the thievery quake I remember hearing that we would hold that on main footpath main roads pedestrian roads that one side would be repaired so that at least people could get down at safely this has not been the case particularly for example pages road on a motorized scooter with a pram both sides are significantly buckled potholed significant trip hazards the whole way along and we would like to see particularly on main roads that one side of the road the footpath has a permanent repair or a transitional appear to make them safe our ward has a high number of wheelchair users of young mothers with cams with children trying to get to school because there 's not a lot of this car ownership so we feel that that is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and events that are held in our ward in across the city and we recognize the important role that those are playing in the psychosocial recovery in the community well-being there 's been a submitted substantial it is an award I look at transitional and particularly around foot cars again walking tracks that people need that chance to be able to get out and go for a walk and safety and we do think that that is a really priority our board has repeatedly felt and has been confirmed of times that levels of service have dropped in our ward due to the damage of the earthquakes with that we feel that this is unsatisfactory because quality of life for residents within the ward and we would like to see that addressed as far as democracy and governance page 72 the board would like to see keishon the awareness of what local government is what it does how the public can interact but to see that improved we would like to see better liaison between arms and in the in your planet stated in the drive in your planet stated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see civil defense meetings to me an hour water 56,000 people that would be 10,000 people attending a civil defense meeting that 's not our reality I don 't recall in a civil defense meeting in the last few years so I 'm rather perturbed by that statistic and would like to know yeah about that it whether it 's meant to happen it because it certainly isn 't happening based on our experience the social how we concerned about the policies around mixing elderly with other residents in social housing and see that we just don 't generally where were unhappy with that we are supportive of increasing the availability of council operated social housing as soon as possible the board would like to be kept informed and consulted with respect to preparation of stormwater management plans to date they feel like they 're happening outside of our awareness we 're often being asked what 's happening it 's a real concern in our community and we would like more information brought into the community we would the increase in publicity around Q able cards we feel that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full extent that they should be so most most of our submission is around communicating engaging and engaging with the board in the ward providing useful information much of the information and the and your plan is vague it 's hard to interpret plane missing the general feeling in the ward is one of pragmatism we know the rebuild will take time and we understand the financial position of the city however the ward does feel left behind and it was of service transitional faxes two roads footpaths stop banks etc and addressing these would make a large difference to the quality of life in safety for many of the residents thank you maybe if i click on off on that because i do totally get the psychological impact of living in that environment so but i guess if you 're asking us to balance up you know expenditure on permanent repairs and then temporary repairs is there something a little bit more like cost-effective that we could do in the temporary space so that it 's not I mean I 'm totally hearing what you 're saying but can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contractors that have been having to be pulled away from you know major infrastructure repair work or building work in order to address a temporary solution for an environmental impact you know what I mean yet should we be looking at you know periodic detention workers should be we be looking at maybe community organizations would like to do some fundraising maybe rotary or I mean could we you know call upon the combined resources of the of not just the volunteer sector but those that that perhaps have a contribution to make in another way to get the East looking as good as it could while we then prepare for the big big repair job that has to go on there so there 's two things I could just comment back on that one would be that the the volunteer sector seems to keep coming against read tape as far as traffic management plans and and things seems to be something that just stops a lot of there 's a lot of communities out there that would like to be involved in cleanup days and things but there seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing is that I used to own a concrete curbing business so I 'm fairly familiar with roads and concrete and then and I think that there is a lot more that the city could do as far as temporary fixes for example we curbs have popped up by the earthquakes you see it all over the place they 've popped up by foot Leah the big trip hazard just a matter of concrete saw cut cut and put a bit of a she felt down that can be done for probably a couple hundred dollars it take would take an hour for two guys so rather than leaving it like that to wait for another three years until the entire stretch of road is recurved I think there 's a lot more that they can do Revelin potholes it doesn 't have to be tarsi element RCL is obviously a bit of permanent solution but just having a guy driving especially after it rains and just fill in the potholes with gravel I mean I 've seen potholes lately that you know they 'd this D and there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you square of quite significant you know how there hasn 't been more fatalities I don 't know it really is something that that a little bit of gravel would would just make a huge difference in depth at a greater impact on the cost of getting cars repaired in there yeah to them as well I 've got Tim think Glenn in Andrew let 's follow up looking their budget and cost savings etc you mentioned that the onset was it south shore where the the houses being removed that also removing the retaining walls yes so the retaining walls are on the estuary frontage disease so I mean it seems kind of moronic in the sense that you would because we 're talking about something that 's going to have to come back and be fixed so they actually removing a house and removing a retaining wall on a beachfront technically a two totally different thing yeah and I think it 's this history be I think that people when they built the houses nothing was provided so they built their own direction so therefore it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it 's here that is doing it reads own property so syrupy actors RS you remove a meeting I think it 's kind of a not really put the freer contract managers to get on to being just really have a look at it because it cost us a fortune well they basically will go on there i think that hole they gave probably knows a wee bit better than i do but i think most of it South Shore sputters head there will its protection removed we will follow up on there because I mean there 's also links with the residential red sign but yeah we wish to come to our storm water and flood management that 's very very much quickly as possible Glenn thank you if I may ask a question of stuff from this addicting well no we 're not going to already asked if we could do that but it 's going to hold up we 've got we 've got the community board here they 've got one minute 56 left can you please just directly question all right but but make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff yeah I 've got other on several sofa yeah okay from a diligent Scouts and a local church group which we 've don 't clean up days before wanting to clean up now can we get them cleaning up the Dudley Creek portion of the bill with Pegasus waters that what would retake would we run into that 's why I wanted to know where does that work no no we can 't ask questions of staff now about work done them but we will pick up the questions here Andrew Thank You Andrea for your submission I just wanted to pick up on one thing in your 3.4 in the submission the neighborhood walking circuits and I 'm interested in whether there 's some quick wins here because clearly your ward is one where recreational opportunities have been lost and it seems that there could easily be some quick wins here and other areas that you 've got in mind where we could achieve a neighborhood walking recreational opportunity through maybe just placing some signs or are there areas where you think there 's work that community groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much involvement from council other than just in an enabling role yeah I think um I don 't really get out walking my phone under Stuart does does a lot of work she hears a route that she 's worked out that she could probably provide to you guys around an option for an area of patents and looking trick that could be fairly easily reinstated I think partly leave before the quakes but it 's been part somewhat damaged and unusable there 's also a group in in the East who are looking at sponsoring rubbish bins to put around the stop banks to improve the air use is transitional walkways for pet owners and runners and and things but the aggie and they do need a little bit of maintenance I don 't think they need it 's not construction it 's just a bit of maintenance to get them usable it 's great look thank you very much i really appreciate your time i know everyone does so you 've brought some really good positive ideas about what we could do that aren 't going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but actually might build a better community spirit back out there at the same time

Martin 's in a long Centaurus wrote that are affected by by flooding and it 's not just flopped in and although we know that there 's a lot more severe that it is very stressful for residents particularly on places like why me and terrace that have been affected by flooding and the level of off stress is probable thank you thats the full with submission yeah so i 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for lateness I 've just been opening a new zealand waters stormwater conference so very timely that took me away from the beginning of the meeting so my apologies i 've got Jamie then gleam Jimmy and Phil David cool thanks Paul and Karen I 'm really articulate submission so thank you for that I 've got to two quick questions for you if you could help me out with that one I know when you speak about the town hall and delaying the projects you say that your support of the town hall project being delayed but excluding the James hey theatre and auditorium now is there whenever we just the auditorium that 's two in the James a theater and the auditorium and 3.4 SI ohno week change yeah we 've with dial it back I ok nice ovation scrap James hey just go ahead with the auditorium baby essence yeah starting tour now we would prioritize now we looked at the budget we looked at what we had originally submitted we looked at what was happening in the east we rethought what was the most important thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city at the town hall we would save the auditorium and we 'd make that a priority but we certainly don 't think in the light of the east and in the light of flooding and then the light of other priorities that we should be saving that building at that cost okay all right thank you for the clarity around there and the only only other one that 's slightly broader one I guess you know you 've summarized the points and you 've got 13 points which it which some of the main points of the submission and I counted through each one of them and at least 11 out of the 13 increased costs there 's two there potentially delaying us some of the anchor projects and reprioritization of Eddington there around the anchor projects one though the other suggestion was the Metro sports instead of having a metro hub you could have a pullin in each one I don 't know if they 're necessarily reduces capex there arguably it could be more expensive but and you mean like a golf if you if you take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the counselor up all the costs and what we 've submitted so I guess you know and as you started the submission useful i 'm interested in is where do you see us being able to pay for all of these things you know we 're here to try and find solutions we want to work with you but we can these funds come from if we were to prioritize the weather the 12 of the 13 the you suggest it is this what the five priorities that we had in our original submission the Vulcan lighter polymer memorial gates retention at least of the strength and community fund and current levels the restoration of the old stone house adaptation on colombo street distribution center for use by community organizations in the development of a barrington plus interchange those are the priorities okay but we accept that given the quarter mental report results that even some of those and in that is empty and on top of priority that the Wolfen lotto polymer will get is our number one priority and a strengthen communities phone is pretty close behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them yes realization funds okay cool clean do thank you and thank you for your submission my question is about the about housing are you able to quantify in any way numbers from our flight no shelter through to living garages compromised conditions overcrowding and you can our link in your ward i know very difficult quite problematic but unable to arrive at a number i I couldn 't tell you in our ward and I have do another hat I have awareness of the sort of young people living across the city you know i would say conservatively you 'd expect about you 'd say about three thousand young people living in that kind of situation and we we have we get reports from alternative sources like the police for instance told us about young people and more from living in a very precarious and dangerous situation that and with there are the kinds of things that we know but do we have a list of how many people in our war we 've got the highest number of social housing in our ward and we continue to support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above isn 't like to congratulate the council one on the recent their their housing a cord and the and they 're all I can 't remember the name of it now but what you pass the other day good Jimmy one question based on the other summation you mentioned earlier kind of opposition to the Sun ankle project are you after the young nation again you know for consideration of the budget restriction then to reprioritize and delay some of the capital projects scheduled so regarding to the stadium convention center in the Metro sports also your point of view would like to delay delays how many years or just take out well let 's say how many years and timeframes that that 's really for your consideration but I mean just as an example of things that would mean like we have a a whole bunch of projects in our ward that needs stonemasons there 's a very limited supply of stonemasons and there appear of those things inevitably is going is not going to take the form that it takes in a three-year plan because it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm aware that there 's not like that we 're continually getting reports of delayed projects around our ward because they don 't have that the right skills for projects and so they 're having to move cruise around two projects that have been scheduled and having to go back to projects that they haven 't finished you know and it just it seems even from just from an operational perspective that it 's that you need to delay capital projects because we we don 't have enough housing to support the labor that we need in order to finish those projects and the time frames that were mapped out in the three year plan we understand we understand the importance of a convention center and a sports center to the profile of Christchurch we understand that neither of them are going to make a profit and that both of them are going to cost the city council running costs money and establishment money we know that we 're not saying that we shouldn 't have them every big cities apparently must have them and that it 's for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all about that but we would delay them indefinitely those projects because we haven 't got the money and if we want to look at what 's important to our people it is the reestablishment of facilities in the east and swimming pools for all of our young people and children Phil I 'm not thank you for your submission to this is excellent i 'm not just being propria about this it 's a very good submission look just um your point about Grange street as an example where the capital program hasn 't happened I we do need to hear discussion as a council about how the skirt where it needs to be aligned with streets like like grain street so your point is taken I just want to ask you about and look I think you 've been really clear about the your priorities and turns the amount of funding that council has available and that you what your your top priority is I think it you also in your longer list you had some opposed the outsourcing of pioneering childhood center services so I 'm assuming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cost that the staff tell us for maintaining that the current service is one hundred thousand dollars each year you said is but I want to emphasize that the importance of community based early childhood care for women on low incomes is it cannot be overstated it is really important I should work for an organization that does provide similar service and it provides young women who would otherwise be trapped inside a house opportunity to go out and do something else whether that 's work or whether that 's involved in the community or whether it 's just to go and spend time with friends it is really important and to to contract it out to a commercial organisation would come at quite a significant social costs to those families would I think you 're not I 'm sorry but we 've really just come to the end of the 15 minutes so like thank you both very much for your passionate p i can tell you I 've put a big note around Green Street so I know that the council 's and their area we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case to our attention so thank you both very very much and I 'd now like to invite andrea comments,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

1,RmEKAKL-TTE,20140513,741.91,"Christchurch, New Zealand",2148,"who 's an apology right okay fine I think you did yeah yeah thank you Sarah we 're in your hands thank you and good morning thank you for the opportunity to present on the headway theory me community boards submission to your 2014-2015 draft and your plan I would like to highlight some of the key points and welcome questions on any matters that need clarification since our board submitted on the annual plan on April the 17th we have had two more floods and the mural task force has been established we would like to thank the council for the progress made on supporting the most vulnerable and for the community engagement in this process today we would like to see this community engagement continue and for increased levels of communication over the management of the stormwater and flooding issues in those areas outside the scope of the initial task force it is important not only for the work to be done but for communities to share their local knowledge and to have confidence that the stormwater drainage work is being progressed in the right way giving residents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as that planned leads no void to be filled by thoughts of neglect or worries of mismanagement those tasked with planning and carrying out the work are very busy and the communication of the work plan needs to be resourced appropriately the Headlee pyramid community board recently submitted on the civil defense Emergency Management Group draft plan for 2014 with research showing a decrease in the levels of civil defense preparedness and Christchurch households since the earthquakes the board submits in support of an increase or realignment of funds to an enable an increase in the level of community programs and support to help communities in their own planning I know that several other boards have also submitted in support of an increased relationship between civil defense and community boards the Headlee pyramid community board also supports this the Hagley theory meet community board has also long advocated for an indoor aquatic facility in the limo door woolston area once the Metro sports facility is built there will be four Christchurch City Council indoor aquatic facilities with both recreational and learn to school and all west of Colombo street with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still be a lack of access for those residents in the southeast of the city in post-quake Christchurch there has been an understandable focus on the loss of facilities and in doing our best to repair or to replace them however we must not forget those who had another to start with the recent staff aquatic facilities reviews suggested that a private swim school could cater for the southeast but this is not true while located in lynnwood the private provider does not cater well for recreational swimmers and lessen costs are prohibitive to low-income families at 126 dollars per child for an eight week term families with a Community Services card could get a 25 percent discount for lessons and recreational swimming at councils polls but only if they can get there we would like to impress upon the council the need for an aquatic facility in this area and submission support of the community boards involvement in the investigation process currently community boards have annual budgets for training travel and conferences however community board conferences are held biannually and a reallocation of the annual funding could enable a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at conferences this will be invaluable for professional development and when it comes to the openness of governance process it is important that the community can hear board members views and debate during meetings and see any graphics and this is not always possible in our boardroom community members often SAT watching a meeting only to ask what has happened afterwards we would like more technological support within our boardroom to enable this to improve community boards also need enough resourcing to fulfill their duties in representing and advocating for the communities and current resourcing does not allow this with the changes and governance and civic services we would like some clarity staff resourcing as well as resourcing to support communication with residents this is a core function of a community board and should not have to come out of funding sources designated for community groups while there is talk around extending the delegations of community boards we need enough resourcing now to meet our current delegations and more again should they increase since our written submission we have been approached to support a landscape plan for McCormick 's may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verbal submission we would like the funding to be allocated from the parks and open spaces activities and services budget other points in a submission include and ongoing concern over alignment of skirt work we support the development of cycle ways in our communities and have a desire for communities to have an input into painting their roots we support a review of the council 's of Vince policy and program and submit that any money from the capital diamond fund be used for projects related to participatory democracy resilient and environmental sustainability not major Council of ins our board thanks the council for the opportunities we have had to be involved in facilities rebuild project so far and submits and support of this continuing they have also been many wonderful projects come out of the current 50,000 funding for the transitional city projects funded suburban centres and the board submits that further funding be made available for the 2014-2015 year we are going to be a transitional city for a while yet finally we would like to see funding allocated to the ongoing development of the east edge master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such an important environmental environmental entity in its own right we need to make sure that the estuary has its own plan which can complement and inform work on it searches communities are the heart of our city and we need to fight what they need thank you for your time and consideration about submission thank you sir hey I 'm just two quick questions one with regards to the your comment about that the staff made about their aquatic facility in your area being able to cater for your community yes I mean your community is quite stretched as yes and I 'm presuming the facility that was mentioned iono from layer to it I 'm presuming it 's equal gem yes so the difference between say equi germ which does a fantastic job of what it does yeah and a community facility are chalk and cheese complete the equation does not provide for recreational something for families there have some lanes open during school hours for the swimmers who are competent so it 's because it 's quite a deep pool but you can 't just have fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's no space for children and it 's also quite expensive for families yeah I 'm just surprised about the statement from staff when you 're talking about a community that looking at it so I be good to see say something behind that if you 've got something I 'd like to see that because if they 're making statements like that then I generally aquatic facilities review because i can 't yeah read that thank you there 's the second quick one with regards to events and festivals you mentioned i Donna kind of lead a question but are you seeing are you kind of saying that you know we 've got a number of big ticket ticket items which this organization as investing in I use are you kind of thinking more community or local based major tops and motivation more summer time to talk things rather than ticketing is it what you 're thinking of an eye we were looking at some of the we 're supporting a review of the major events okay yeah thank you does it make sense you have a does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent submission and just some things certainly took note of your comments about the flooding task force and the you 're really referring to sort of ongoing community information like is going to resonance it 's part of what needs to be done and we make we want to make sure that become as part of the plan so your point at that point is noted it 's very important and and also they will be the community engagement meetings and there 'll be a timeline fought for those and can i just add that the i 'm getting quite a few emails at the moment from residents and sumner for example who because they don 't know what work is being cleaned and any of the emergency work and the people and the staff that they currently have communications with our the planning staff and they 're so busy they 're not getting communication back and so they really really worried and they keep emailing me and there 's just this lack of information coming back it needs specific resourcing for communication not relying on the planners to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well thank you in a note of it and just like a comment on the psycho ways to get that your your border involved in key not supporting that and and the whole program should come to each community board so so we clarify yeah just the parts that relate to hug you for it it 's great thank you I just wanted to make the point on the aquatic facilities review that is very much a draft the reason we 've seen it around community boards is to get that those exact concerns that have been raised responded to at a local level there are many private swing facilities in our city and it does seem bizarre de ecuador gets treated as a public facility but in other areas where there are private facilities they too are not treated in the same way so the idea of putting that aquatic facility strategy out to local community boards was to get that feedback back so that before it comes to counsel to be finalized we know what what what the reality is on the ground so just to make it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes i 'm not actually they haven 't seen much work on is that to date is that actually scheduled for completion in the 1415 year or as a problem and we get a briefing a while back and as far as I 'm aware a lot of works been put on hold on it because of lack of funding because in your ward it 's really only the beachfl road section i think that 's ain 't talked about being talked about where is good way yeah whereas in the boo and Pegasus would that 's quite a stretch of of the ester imagine that some under consideration so you look I support that entirely and I just would probably seek some clarification as to where the plan is at the moment because it is becoming quite an issue not only with the history itself but with with flooding issues and particularly in the south shore south new brighton area so thanks anyway for bringing it up on the edge we also have the coastal pathway as well on the edge of those guys yes yep she 's regarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how the 10.4 million dollars has been deferred from the council to the future the financial years so whether this figure come from because I check the page 45 and the 94 I didn 't see the 10.4 million dollars how did you calculate alright so once we put this end I think the key point really is that we don 't want wait to food yes I 'm not quite sure with it like I came from yeah because I check the 45 no no nice figure yes sir weather how did you accumulate this vegan so is the wall stands up to the figures on the air I say even if it bigger isn 't right it 's the deferral of work that we are that is the key point and that paragraph okay thank you no I think that 's particularly thank you very much","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

2,iWme0qyfZqo,20140512,1766.399,"Christchurch, New Zealand",5272,uh once again um just more graphics on explaining that uh better maintenance or more increased vigilant maintenance around clearing of sumps clearing of streets looking to activate more surface storage off-site and better traffic management so there 's in the report for each individual area these opportunities have been identified and reported on in detail but i think for for me as an engineer and leading this task force one of the um i think most satisfying and um well the most satisfying aspect was probably understanding the social impacts and the concerns of residents the health and wellbeing issues this is a community under what 's considerable stress a community that is suffering physical health issues an increased reporting of respiratory illnesses increased reports of their mental well-being and also these reports from schools that some of the behaviours some of some of this is affecting the classroom with the stress coming from home into the class financial impacts this affects people in the pocket they 're worried about their equity they 're worried about having to continually rehabilitate their homes every time they get flooded they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the brief asked us to look at relocation options we 've we are looking at relocation options for the community in terms of temporary relocation and buyback there 's four options that have been looked at in some detail the details not included in the report because there 's quite a lot of commercial sensitivity around that but there 's a lot of work that we 've done around finding suitable rental accommodation uh investigating whether financial support and community grants are going to be viable uh temporary buyouts where we might look for look to a purchase a property purchase someone 's property and sell it to them back to them once it 's been fixed and building a temporary village similar to what was achieved at linwood village they are on the table there 's a lot of policy issues to be travised around that a lot of money issues to be travised the detail is yet to be worked through but we 've done some work in that space in terms of the at a property at an individual property level or a local area scheme level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temporary pumps option for the flockton area like raising stock banks for the lower heath kit and introducing temporary pumping and low heat kit or doing some of the immediate work that we need to do in heathcote valley for our level 1 homes it 's 13.7 million dollars the providing relief from regular flooding for the 500 most vulnerable comes with a price tag of 20.1 million so that 's the scale of the problem in terms of the money the money issue i 'll leave that presentation there so the summary we 've identified identified immediate needs and quantified the magnitude of the regular flooding problems for homes and we identified a range of options short-term and temporary to meet the needs of our most vulnerable residents and that 's the presentation sorry i 'll start off with um question um you re you mentioned um dredging and and kind of we picked that up as one of the one of the action points that we would rather uh focus our attention on as a matter of urgency we 've got the temporary pumping and and flopped in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the resolution so that if there is a part of the river that requires um something that would actually provide some immediate benefit that that would be worthwhile to get on with definitely um yeah the answer that 's definitely so we know that within the wilston cut i think there 's around 30 odd thousand cubit meters we 've started a project already i mean we 've been uh over the last eight or nine days where we 've seen opportunities to to do work we 've actually instigated works already so we 've started a project to look at the lower heathcote dredging wilston cut and above to a power road we 're looking at some of the ecological issues but also the bank stability issues looking for the quick wins around understanding the way sediment is transported and deposited down that river what it might take to get the bid of the river to a stable level so it stops accumulating silt once we commit to a dredging program you know you 're committing to a lot of money as a way of managing a river so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that so that project so it 's worth keeping in there to understand in the meantime yeah okay um tim um i know the mayor and ourselves have already thanked your team i just wanted to commend you also for the cross teamwork between units and organizations i know some time ago we were talking about siloing etc and this is a fantastic example of breaking that down working together and getting into it so thank you for that thank you one one thing that um i brought up this morning which was probably out of the scope is the cleanup following a flood um situation and you mentioned you know stressed to communities etc that is as much as stresses as the rest of it and i think it 's really important that we are seen to have a really professional and clear plan to get in there really quickly before the mud and effluent dries and becomes an extra health hazard so i just thought i 'd mention that and please we can 't lose sight of that and what we can do to work with the communities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing as a standard ourselves yeah and i 'll work with my colleagues to to address that issue thanks to yes just just on there i really should be paying tribute to as you say to those other um organizations that have helped us a fantastic effort from uh sarah particularly from environment canterbury who offered a huge amount of support and mb eqc and our own consultants it 's a great effort well it 's from our side of things for personally i think it 's absolutely wonderful it 's great to see thank you and it was cross party within the organisation as well so we had the strengthening communities working alongside the operation or working alongside the planning and that to me was just great i 've got ally pauline phil andrew yani jimmy right lots of questions i 've got you you 're straight after ellie yeah i wanted to ask about the sewage and what happens when there 's an event and the sewage comes up into the streets it 's been requested by some residents that there be filters or some sort of mesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the solid stuff from coming up is that something that can be done maybe does that that that 's and that 's travis in the report and needs to be one of the things we need to look at very closely yeah so one of the things that we we we covered off in this report is the wastewater overflow issues as well because it 's not just stormwater so that 's part of the technical report that we 've looked at but could that be something that could be done asap or does it need to be looked at before it needs to be just further investigated to make sure we come up with the right solutions because if if you if you you cannot see all parts of the system but then the wastewater will find another way to come out and you might actually just move the problem out this is the water still gets out this is to stop the solids from coming out yeah and there are proprietary products that will allow you to do that right so we will look at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pumping you showed in a slide um a property that had a blue pump on the property would that the if that was a method was adopted would that be a pump on every property every property that um had a barrier around it would need to deal with the stormwater that falls behind the barrier and you 've got to get it out uh out to the street or into the water nearest waterway they 'll be just those properties that had those right and is that it 's just the one type of pumping option or is there two well there 's individual property type pumps and we keep part of the task force was we had actually a pumping project within the task force whose job was to look at all the you know where are all these pumps within christchurch where are they within new zealand do we actually have to source some from overseas they also looked at the range and type of pumps that you might deploy in these sort of sort of situations so that 's that 's in there as well and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the city uh people protect their own basements in some cases by having these type of pumping arrangements so yeah thank you phil thank you um i just want to ask you a little bit more about that because you 've got and i understand your comments in relation to needs to be careful with that regarding the ecology of the river including the bank 's stability and the there 's to be a pilot study though um as part of part of the report which is referred to i 'm just wondering is there any like and clearly the lower he 's going to be a good place perhaps to undertake that so it what i 'm concerned about is that that is the potential for that to start as soon as possible given that you know potentially there might there may be another major event a flooding event in the near future yes there is potential so the potential lies probably uh if we make a decision to dredge uh probably lies best within the wallstone cut and creating capacity there but also we 're looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street bridge and that 's part of the project that we 've started to look at you know will there be benefits to that it 's an early win in terms of creating a little bit of capacity but it also helps us understand uh sedimentation you know transportation and deposition and the way it all gets mobilized um so the answer to that is yes thanks mike and i 've just got one other follow-up question it 's in like clearly this this has been fast work and it 's a lot of the measures are uh temporary as you 've referred to and and they 're the ones that need to be done as soon as possible just in terms of future context for the longer term um like and you 've you 've referred to very clearly to the good work that 's been done with the other agencies like sarah and andy i 'm just wondering around the the wider flood prevention measures that are contained in the in the that natural urban recovery plan can some of these measures lead in to that wider longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complement but undoubtedly we were charged with the focus in terms of the immediacy that the temporary issues the the longer term issues we we 've got that work underway with these other agencies as we said we 're dovetailing both these things together to ensure that they are synchronized and coordinated one of the amendments that is proposed is that we request the chief planning office to ensure the alignment of the land drainage recovery program with the natural environment recovery program and i think that 's that was the point that phil was making that it 's are the temporary measures compatible with that and i think you 're saying that they 're either aligned or they 're complementary too yeah that 's great thank you andrew thank you um you mentioned littleton as a place that has a peculiar set of circumstances and further work that needs to be done um are you able to just give a short overview of what the next steps there are in any indicative timelines yeah so the reason for that comment uh was that the the vulnerability criteria that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ christchurch didn 't really apply that easily to littleton which is a steep hillside catchment with um some critical uh strategic assets below major roads and a strategic port uh the mechanism for flooding is generated off of a very steep hillside potentially subject to landslips which cause blockages and then high velocity water flowing down streets and then taking out infrastructure so we really need to look at uh littleton a little differently and i think that that 's the work that needs to be done that we 've had a first close look first look at it but more work to be done again just i mean slotting in here is one of the recommendations we 'll go through all of the recommendations before staff finish but urgently review the criteria for assessing flood risk and land movement in littleton to improve the analysis of vulnerability and strategic infrastructure so that 's picking up on that point uh yani um thank you and first off again just repeat thank you for the work that you 've done in the short time frame um i know i know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure all the elect other elected members do as well so thank you um just wanted to check in on the process going forward in regards to the central city i know that sarah 's kind of got some control over anchor projects like the avon river some red zone and the avon loop there 's also a kind of a catchment in there that that does get badly affected is there a discrete piece of work that you guys have or as part of stage two of the task force that you can look at that area um what i you know last week i had actually scheduled a community meeting uh in that that area to talk to those residents that had experienced flooding and that was put on hold i just couldn 't get out there um i would they are vulnerable to clearly vulnerable because they 've been flooded but are they the most vulnerable within the the terms of reference that i was given and uh i i want to go and talk to them that 'll happen over the next couple of weeks as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program so in terms of sarah though i guess one of my concerns is we 're spending 100 millions on a hundred million dollars they 're spending 100 million on the ava river precinct and yet we had really bad flooding and anyone on the sixth floor in march that looked out the window saw that the central city was quite badly affected yes so how are we aligning or how are we working with them to ensure that we 're not spending a lot of money that 's just going to create be wasted because of the flooding yeah i can answer some of that counsellor in fact you know undoubtedly there was some uh quite widespread road flooding but not no property in the actual central city here there i need to check on whether the avon loop had anything there particularly but so mike 's point around we concentrate on the most vulnerable but in terms of the avon river precinct work that 's going on i do know for a fact that they 've done a review of the the works that they proposed from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in actually looking at that work and i believe that i think the 26th of may i think sarah are coming to council and given an update around the admin rep precinct as well um just wanted to touch on in terms of the point that tim made so i 've written a briefing paper around the flood response because i appreciate you guys have done the technical stuff there 's still a piece of work that needs to happen around flooding and storm response so what i need to get from the organization though is a copy of our flood response plan is is there a kind of a document that sums up what we currently do when we 've got bad weather coming and expect flooding now we 're working on that actually it 's one of the key projects within the land range recovery plan it was flocked and centric but the um the the sorts of things we would do and in fact have put in place um we 've put in place a met connect forecasting uh which we 're looking to get available on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forecast we 're also developing better spatial models that would allow us to look at the forecast and say well we think it 's going to be very bad over here or anywhere else but the type of work you 're looking at is at the moment is embedded in our maintenance contracts as a response uh in terms of so we will have some information that we could give you it kind of crosses the line into the civil defense territory but it but it kind of just needs to be i think sort of like local response plans in each catchment when we know a major event is coming here 's what we do and also what we tell residents in terms of cleaning up so i mean happy to work through with tim and others on that piece of work um and then just there is in the technical report under education awareness and response measures there 's quite a a short chapter on that and i think that it 's really been picked up as a major area of work is that there is a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also the advanced warning um knowing you know that that a storm event is on its way uh can enable us to get a lot of the um work done but i think some of the maintenance work and we 've picked that up in one of the recommendations we really need to up the ante on some of the maintenance contracts and that 's come through very clearly in the technical report it 's also things like um people ringing a call center follow-up of requests for service making sure that when people contact us things get followed up quickly it 's been very apparent in reading the technical report that there hasn 't been a close connection between the information rich you know intelligence as i call it that comes through the call center uh translating into uh maintenance um contracts you know like that so it 's the ongoing maintenance so there might be specific jobs that come in but nobody sort of seems to be taking that overarching view of what that means for our maintenance on an ongoing basis and that is what has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the value of this task force should not be underestimated it has enabled us to see right across the whole um picture and seen where there has to be a much stronger connection between what 's coming through the call center and what then gets reflected in the ongoing maintenance work it 's not just responding to the single complaint it 's actually seeing the overarching connection between that and and the ongoing flood risk but there is a wider piece of work around our civil defense preparedness our organisational preparedness and then what is the response and that 's you know things like um some of the community were actually self-report and in the first flood and summer they actually went on to google maps identified areas and could feed that through to the organization to say these are the problem areas here 's where we need help cleaning up or provide us with passes to the dump and we 'll actually clean up for you but all those things need to be looked at and we will do that um that 's urgent you know we need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communities are absolutely in charge of what 's what 's going to happen um and then just the final question from me is um i know in sumner for example hasn 't come through particularly around wakefield ave so um just maybe if you just talk a little bit more about sumner i know that you 've only identified one kind of vulnerable property there but certainly feedback on the ground from local people is that there has been an issue with the containers and the lack of access or maintenance and wakefield that was an area that seemed to get a bit affected but it doesn 't come through in the report so maybe you could just comment a little bit more about what we 're doing in sumner and what we 're looking at going forward so just about sumner i mean i think that 's one of the um key things we need to go back out to the communities hold this up and reflect back to them and say is this this is how we 've seen it that 's what you 're seeing as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were at that public meeting the other night i think the six hands went up around who had who 's had their house flooded whether they met the criteria around vulnerability more than twice since the earthquakes i don 't know and i would really like to go back to that community and tease that out because i think that 's absolutely vital um you know i 'm very aware of the shortcomings in the data yeah so that 's really important jimmy one question regarding to the uh the main concerns of the resistance i just want to know the investigation was undertaken by the council only or councils have engaged with some other government agencies yes we have um so we we engaged with with the canterbury district health board particularly in the area of wastewater overflow contamination and the effects of that and that 's something we need to probably do more work on around education awareness testing so that 's that that 's that 's absolutely important we did we worked with mb ministry building innovation and employment around the temporary village relocation and how that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boundaries in that area also eqc environment canterbury uh so it 's this is a real multi-agency approach that 's one of my following questions because the residents of that particular concern the health well-being financial impact and stress issue for instance like if someone kids students you know because due to the flood flooding they are forced to move to some other location or some other school whether we have engaged with the moe and also whether have a student you know give them popular kind of motivation etc no we haven 't engaged with the ministry of education at a ministry level i understand from the community feedback sessions that uh the information revealed that at a school level there were issues in the classroom but not we haven 't explored it from a ministry point of view david thank you just uh returning to the dredging issues um i grew up as a kid on the um on kers reach and the river there was regularly dredged yeah and i 've noticed since the earthquakes um sort of come down from the fitzgerald air bridge every lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's quite a bank out there and the potential the capacity of the rivers decreased and the flows perhaps similarly decreased is there any um any proposal to actually remove those excess sediments that have resulted from the earthquakes that 's the first point and then i suppose carrying on for that from that um dudley creek really from its confluence with the shirley stream downstream uh has there 's quite a bit of sedimentation in that as well are we contemplating putting a mini excavator or whatever through the lower reaches of the dudley creek yeah we are doing i 'm sorry that 's that 's the first part of it yeah yeah yeah so we have actually that 's um that was deployed last week so we had three very extensive walk-overs with contractors and engineering staff uh contractors engineering and our maintenance staff to look at in that particular reach where we might deploy first and just get get that channel clear it is going to cause some stress in the community because there are private property boundaries that go up to the center line of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they would in terms of their private property but that could well be impeding the flow so we need to talk to those people to understand you know what that 's what dredging what i might use the word dredging what uh improving the channel capacity will mean for them but i think that you know we are going to have to look very closely at the channel we are looking at it i 've got crews out there now so there 's going to be a you know a lot more work done in the lower dudley and i said before you know we are chasing millimeters here we are looking at removing as many obstructions be they private property bridges tree stumps the vegetation that 's in the way just to keep people 's homes safe um evan sorry i might probably correct me if i 'm wrong but um we 've already taken out quite a lot of uh silt and liquefaction material out of some of the streams in that area so considerable remains have already been taken out we are going to look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaches the investigation shows because of the the title extent that you are in fact just deepening the channel and making more room for the tide so you just really you know allowing more of the pacific ocean into the waterway so i 'm not hesitant i 'm i have yet to see or have it confirmed that the benefits of dredging in the la it reaches that you 're talking about will actually work okay sorry as part of the avon river precinct i understand that the whole 3.2 kilometer stretch of that anchor project was going to be treated for some silk removal stone cleansing so there 's still quite a lot planned through the rest of the extent of the avon river presence yeah that finishes predominantly i believe that the fitzgerald air bridges correct but the stretch from fitzgerald occurs rich there 's a lot of meandering bends there that are badly so the second question if i may i 'm just referring to report i missed the briefing earlier with another meeting but and it may have come up there but i 'm just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how when you are combining figures there for the vulnerability level one and two dwellings that the flocked and dudley creek area comes up with a figure of 92 000. i know it 's 9.2 million you 've got an old version sorry it was a typing error there were three zeros missing as i said i qualified that with the early meeting on this thank you very much very good um paul we know the immediate effects on you know this raw sewage being on people 's properties and affecting the land have we done any soil tests to see how long these effects last i mean obviously the coming summer and the growing season people planting vegetables and kids be playing on the lawn is there a ongoing impact uh that was there was some early work done as part of uh the resource concern that we 've applied for for our wastewater overflows and that 's been brought into this report um that 's one of the key things i want to bottom out with i think we need to bottom out with the canterbury district health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same question i don 't think that i don 't think there 's a conclusion on that in the report but we are going to look at it tim again i guess um over the decades from the old drainage board ecology has really taken the fall with resource consents etc so i guess it 'd be very interesting to see the historic data from the old drainage board with regards to where the dredging was taken when it was undertaken and the results that it achieved and also perhaps there are maintenance schedules and programs compared to what we 've been doing the last say five years um and that would probably be quite interesting to see if it 's available to us um one other thing that probably sorry can i throw in my one cents worth which is it was pre-rma and so the i realize that yeah yeah and that 's why i said that you know ecology has taken the fourth month um one thing that um i 'll throw is a bit of a curveball is would there be any point in looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down would that kind of area be holding anything up no no it wouldn 't so we 've um we 've looked we did a bathymetric survey immediately after the earthquakes and the uh the thalwick the the invert of the channel uh within the the estuary has reestablished itself it 's a very dynamic um environment within the history so the natural processes have sort of taken care of the capacity,"(-43.5320214,

Part 2,9ZvJ7onJyAM,20140512,558.88,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1499,madam chair we were also you know what we 're looking the the key role of an accessible city is to support the recovery plan itself so the reprioritization that we 've recommended you today to you today we believe is the transport program that best fits those earlier anchor projects and best supports them there will be consultation of course over the details of those projects just as I outlined earlier as far as Salisbury streets concerned in terms of the detail of how that is delivered but also I think our understanding around the transport network and the shape of it is that the business and development community are also looking for clarity around what we are doing and when and we believe the the other benefit of this program is to give the business community absolute clarity about what we do intend to deliver and when so if you are looking at a development off of chew and Street for instance we can give businesses and developers there a much better line at sight as to when that conversion will happen yep Phil and the 15 excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included in the decennial was using that we have no funding it supposed to wear that 's why we 're proposing they not get done in this first place in full form its funding in the first priority chapter of the accessible transfer plan for kill more syrup how much is it that that that was scheduled at around six point two million better do a full conversion of it so as I said earlier the bulk of the costs for that subby some of us are included and in some you are viewing I 'll check it out just yes so to reallocate it though children 's version darme tu madres yeah let 's field straight to manchester to oxford and colombo straight he referred to sunita yeah the question i had around consultation with prabhas not clear enough but so normally we do a draft three-year plan or an annual plan and we would have a series of capital projects and we agree to the community these are the projects we 're doing give us feedback and they do so you might have cambridge terrace in one case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another street Mackenzie F that 's also put on the five-year program and it 's going to be done at a later stage and the community can say actually bring Mackenzie Ford cuz got flooding we don 't think came for just the priority right now what we 're doing with us is effectively making changes to a program without any public consultation to be consult on the first phase on what went into the first phase they were in the three-year program but they may have been done as up the cost year wasn 't the cost year was signed through three or four days before the council agreed to its three-year plan and any amendments to the three-year plan based on the cost year we 're all out of order by the mere so despite the fact of public made submissions they had no opportunity to make comment on the cost you and in fact any amendments to deal with the concerns that were raised we 're not allowed to said the answer is no so the answer this was not consulted on no and neither are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it wasn 't consulted on because it was out of water then how can i roll anything other than their here I mean that 's just seems to me I mean look I think this would come to a point where is a where there 's a disagreement I 'm anything it 's that probably had to get some clarity I really I 'm really glad to hear that we were going to have this briefing on the nineteenth and I really do want to defer this report until after we 've had the briefing on the 19th network elements is going to deal with the parking plan the retail precinct and and picking up on the meters point any other party which is stuff that we know about these are the fundamental first phase project to support the delivery of the recovery plan and those tienta pro I think it 's a sorry from my perspective it 's as simple as that this is simply being pragmatic about getting the best mix of works for the 72 million dollars that was there so you want to lie on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the briefing on the 19th of May well now with the next council meeting would be mixed us that 's what you want does anyone want to sequin there Phil but um I 'm just hey don 't clear that 's for both of these rupee yeah I want to know whether there is any time sensitivity around resolving this I mean does it have to be resolved today or can it wait till next week but certainly time sensitive madam chair and the fact that we 're looking to go out and consult us as soon as possible because we 've got the the interchange open in a year 's time and to be honest we 're going to be struggling to get the work done by the time that 's open so it would it seriously delay things if it was the council meeting next week that made the decision on this is it the next meet in the twenties 22nd this night next week wake up don 't yet naturally yeah this next week and see this this year is going much more quickly than we realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information that might gave us in relation to what that briefing will have in relation things like you might mention things like parking for example but it 's in terms of I just wonder if we could still have some overview of this accessible transport plane these are things like parking that obviously impacts on traffic flow and all that kind of thing so I don 't know if staff would be able to bring some key concepts of where the accessible city is air and to to their briefing would it be timed so that for the next council meeting we can be more fully informed through unity through you madam chair the intention for the briefing on the 19th was too show council exactly how the parking plan interleaves with the accessible City lip plan and how the two things tie together but I would just say over the consultation over this the the accessible city was consulted by syra with the community between november a 20 i don 't think we 'll go there there there there are many of us who have a view about that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so yes if we should he is the material we can sort of provide so yes we if we can get a bit more time on monday for providing the 19th does happen yet we will present you an overall picture we won 't probably won 't have time to debate there and each other client give you that overview and probably yeah timely to do that and the light of how this program of transport works has evolved and then we 'll draw down into the retail precinct and the passion play yeah okay well then I don 't need to put the amendment I 'll just rule that this can lie on the table until the council meeting next week I thought we were actually meeting with Sarah on a range of other things on the 19th 19th for memory has and this is all dependent on the council not having it 's that they not beat a millennial fan hearings love it we were going to discuss the minister health hospitals the darkness we 're going to discuss yes we can precinct and I think it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I understood it at the last presentation on the metro sports facility Council has asked for a two-and-a-half-hour briefing on metro sports Performing Arts and various other things and that was what we asked for 19th will go away what I 'm also hearing is changeful to prior to the nineteen to the moment might be very long day all right yep so that 's okay good come all right okay so so i 'll i 'll do there and we 'll let that report on the table I think we need to now move the resolution to exclude,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Part 1,p4el3peUj7k,20140512,1632.72,"Christchurch, New Zealand",4469,so we 'll go back to item number six and accessible City revised first phase transport projects consideration of kilmore and salisbury street enhancements staff could come to the table when this was last in front of us we ask staff to go away and do some more work particularly around the kill more and salisbury street area or particularly around salisbury street given the skirt works that are occurring there at the moment so if i could just ask staff to lead us yeah sorry i probably should see this earlier it 's it 's no biggie but I should probably declare that I 'm renting a place at least for another month that song salisbury street you live and sauce pastry currently but i 'm actually yeah no I saw the gallery notice to quit here but I don 't own it and I are moving no I mean Debbie road and listen I don 't I don 't regard that as a combo I don 't dress a conflict I so I should lead everyone no it 's all right nice to know where you love it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could peps hand over to Richard and you could take us through the report yes my name is Richard Osborne unit manager transported research to my left is Terry Hales who I 'm sure needs no introduction and to my right is Tim cheese bruh who 's a senior transport planner and then city environment group afternoon so if I just introduced the report briefly we had an initial report to the earthquake recovery committee of the whole when essentially what that sought to do was to change slightly the first phase transport projects which were outlined in an accessible City in the cost year agreement and the main reason for those recommended changes was to support the early anchor projects predominantly the bus interchange which was scheduled to open an April 2015 and really what we want to do is ensure particularly tomb street that are as opened is a one-way eastbound road all the way to the interchange the buses can use that to access that also change Litchfield street from a one way to a two-way minor distributor street and do some work surround the particularly around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because obviously there 's going to be a lot of people coming in and out need to ask the question is that one lane one way only to the bus interchange going west to east because I may have a conflict of interest if it goes through there it would be why would it become sorry I 'm because my my brother has a business insurance tree no don 't this is I 'm ruling out you know businesses and homes are very big objector tellin it right hey be a bigger poser of it in a consultation it 's all it 's not going out for consultation it 's it 's the it 's the accessible City chapter of the central city recovery planets already in place yep so council will tried to call yeah yeah sorry just jumped on me the resolution was the council was supported the changes but wanted essentially staff to provide some further options for keeping kilmore street and the first phase transport projects and we 've basically recommended that the bulk of the works for Kilmore be deferred to the second phase as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the first base transport projects so essentially we were asked to go away and look at that so that we 've prepared a supplementary report which is before you at the moment the report has four options in it one is one of the options and peps if you turn to page four and five of the supplementary report that they are outlined in there the first option is to to pay for essentially to pay for bringing salisbury street into the first phase transport projects and retain kilmore street as they fear space transport project as well as to defer Manchester Street defer cambridge terrace works essentially to find a whole lot of new money 15 million odd dollars or option for which is the the preferred staff or recommended option from staff which is to do some initial works on salisbury street to ensure that the work currently been done by skirt does not have to be replaced so that 's the option recommended by staff we think if you look to page six of the supplementary report table 1 what we 've done has assists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and and certainly the option that we came up with which was preferable was add some enabling works on salisbury street not to defer any of the other works which were currently within the first phase such as cambridge terrace or manchester street and not to retain those but basically increase the overall scope of the first base transport projects which would be around circa 15 million dollars to do soon all right so yani oh I 'm sort of having a lot of concern that initially when we asked about salisbury street we were told that i think those are nailing works were already happening now we 're being told we need another hundred thousand and we 've got skirt going in there so it seems to me one of the critical issues is how can we align skirt work to the accessible transport city work what 's you know is can we get a report back over where the opportunity is I 'm just really concerned that you know we 've got a huge financial problem we can 't afford to be doing things twice and yet in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on so it you know short of bringing sales very straight forward which you 've terrible cost 15 million is there any other way in which we can align the skirt repair to the road reconstruction so that we don 't spend the same amount of money twice through you madam chair that 's what we 're proposing and the key thing what we want to do is a skirt you 're right scooter already in the end doing some work and to ensure that doesn 't need to be reworked we 're getting them to to put my tongue can probably explain better than me because it 's closer to it but to put some of the lane markings in and also put some of the duct in under four when it does change from one way tattoo way so you don 't need to go in and rehash all that work that they 're doing at the moment so kind of puzzles me why that wasn 't happening already like yeah through you madam chair um the objective of aligning to skirt working exactly as councillor Johansson has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of getting on well they 're making good progress and as members will no doubt be aware the carriageway reconstruction works on salisbury street are already well advanced what we 're ensuring is the the additional costs primarily when you convert to weigh on salisbury street we will need to alter the in sections so the signals that are for one-way traffic at the moment will need to be two-way and salisbury street carries a separated cycleway within it so it 's a fairly fundamental change to the overall look and operational nature of salisbury street one of the reasons we can 't simply accommodate all of the salisbury street works in the current skirt repair works is that in order to put the separated cycleways in there we need to consult the community and the board over necessary removal of parking from one side of the street or the other so that 's a fairly significant change which will affect the utility of the street so that is an option in terms of how we deliver the improvement works on salisbury street in order to put a fully separated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key cycle route through the center of the city so the works there are a somewhat simpler for us to minimize those abortive works but the bulk of the cost on both streets and perhaps need to clarify the 15 million dollars is for doing both of those streets to two-way operation the bulk of the costs is at the intersections along those streets which could cost up to half a million per intersection to treat there are a seven on on kilns on Salisbury and six on kill more and of course then the extra work to introduce the separated cycleway on salisbury street plus the landscaping works along there I think yannis point was there you have to dig up this street twice you know which isn 't terrible and convenience further for the residence we would seek to minimize the yes it inevitably there will be some further work needed on salisbury onkyo more streets that 's inescapable in order for the skirt work to carry on moving ahead on its current time table what we are seeking to do however is to minimize the disruption and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their work now if that this other works going to be done wouldn 't it be better to do it at the same time well I think problem we have we 've got a road service that 's been damaged and if we want to put it back in this short skirt is the way to do that at the moment the kill more on the Salisbury projects will be part of further discussions between the council and the crowds away we don 't know what the time frames for that exactly going to be yet okay i guess if we do nothing we potentially could be waiting 20 years to two-way salisbury street there 's no funding in the budget we 've got huge financial issues is this another kind of negotiation with government like the skirt infrastructure house like what was the process for determining when salsbury street would be done before this report came so in terms of salisbury street was nearing the first phase transport projects so so what we 're doing is what we call a program business case for the whole the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first phase we 're doing a business case and that 's what NZTA and the government basically asked us to do so we 're putting that together at the moment and if you look at the last recommendation 6.5 it reads basically what we 're seeking to do is a promote kilmore and salisbury street to the top of that list to ensure that they are the ones and we think there 's good justification for doing that from from a transport another perspective we saw the other one way streets in there without them noticing I think my describing all night oh you 're good try try to take utrecht changes maybe yeah so i can 't give you a time frame for that because ultimately that will be a decision of council we 're going to have unfit you basically do the program business case now then we 'll come back and have to be considered as part of the long-term plan the point i was really tryna understand is there 's no money in the current budget and there 's no money being agreed government so given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlikely that this is going to happen so you know I think you see additional funding from central government to assist with these projects that 's part of the business case process that 's going through and that will be part of the discussions probably in a couple of months time around how how that gets funded and said it wasn 't finalized on the girl sherry ground I think I don 't think was fine only the first phase projects I identified it just seems to me and um you know we 've got two reports we should ask the government for all the money for it well well it just it just seems bizarre that or not bizarre but you know I think with in terms of what 's happening with anchor projects is there 's not a certainty about the anchor projects you know schedules have been behind the Metro sports as a year a year as extended for a year we 've got issues around the proposed stadium we 've got other issues in terms of private development happening in the central city i I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a lot of confidence at the old accessible transport plan even the first phase matches the new reality of that what 's happening in the central city both publicly and privately so you know I almost wonder whether we actually need to have a meeting in a workshop and try and work through what we 've got in terms of skirt what we 've got in terms of accessible transport what we 've got in regard okay approaching parking and marking yeah and then work out one of the priorities with what we know with our financial situation in the new dynamic in terms of that that shared governance structure I think that 's a very good idea so but I mean that doesn 't need to hold us up with us today but it does it does I actually agree with yanni I think part of part of the problem is that I mean it 's maybe me being a little but newer to the role than yani but I kind of don 't feel like there 's a helicopter view on on this issue you know like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projects but not engaged so clearly on others and yeah I think the problem is that the way the cost share separated out purely the first phase hmm unless the rest for further further discussions and further work and expect to become disjointed yeah I what we 're trying to pick it up country houses point that we do know that the anchor project rode the bus interchange is progressing and the time frame that so we 've tried to align this first base to support that as best we can hence our recommendations to do that but it does mean there 's another conversation to be had but that second thing and third phase and fourth wave projects but what 's missing a scoot you know it 's almost like we 've contracted out everything you know like it 's the decision-making as well as the priorities as well as you know and I mean I understand that the prioritisation exercise will come back to us but it 's all of this workers is carrying on it pace and it doesn 't feel joined up to these other things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about allowing for building consents to be assured while the government was still doing the Central City recovery plan while it was still doing that plan I mean that 's how you end up with the first building being rebuilt after the after the earthquakes being the first one to come down you know it 's sort of because of the accessible City widening of Manchester Street you know the Western building you know that I mean that sort of thing is avoidable if you 've got a holistic helicopter view but I don 't feel like I 've got that and the CBD yeah probably might be supposed to do with ourselves but also because we 've got a number of players in that area trying to juggle things but we I can assure that skirt are totally interlinked with the work we 're doing around accessible City chat we actually talked to them week in week act so for instance they 've done all the work around the sewer repairs into straight so all the roads that we want to do they 've already been in or are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those roads to then be finished off in terms of salisbury street it wasn 't in the first phase projects therefore we make a decision do we not do anything with cells B Street and leave it very pretty wrecked because I 'm wait at some point in the future for a project to come we made the call well we 've got to do something timing back up because we have no certainty of when that dates going to be so we I can show we are working very I 'm sure you 've got the umbrella very clearly we 're not portraying up very well no but I think having a workshop to actually work through that you know all of these issues and up I don 't know why but I kind of like a map and I like to see what 's happening we are we here and why yeah only happens yeah have you got a met with private development as well because it just seems to me that the other risk is that you 've got a retail precinct which seems to be evolving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's happening or what 's not happening and it just you know I think the private development is equally as important up because I have you read I totally agree with you i mean the the i spoke to that was a richard david who 's done all the development down victoria street so there 's a big apartment complex going under the old EK inside I know that car parking is part of that I 've spoken to others who 've got private car parking solutions that they want to put on on on the table and if that 's the case and and we think of this in the context of our parking obligations with an accessible City chapter and the planning that we 're doing there it might be a good idea to try and join all of this up I mean for our sake if you if you could work together to put together a presentation that draws all of those threads together including the private sector because Oh mr. Taylor would you like to contribute coming well questioning is coming back to you next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sector development yeah I mean well building consents I mean I 'm sure applications early meetings might be a good source of intelligence that the pre-application meetings yeah if it 's the case and I think it 's great we get that on the 19th then why not just wait for this report until after we 've had that briefing presentation so we can see how the dots are joined up is quite critical we know that government do have and are working up their business case for the year two and year three or phase two and three proposal so that 's that is a work and train and we 're happy to give you some information on that as well as we can but you have let that is opening to the program but we don 't know and and so you 're adding 15 million dollars well we know I don 't miss Janet I know that I 'm sorry and on page 21 you 're adding 4.5 3.93 point eight point nine point four and I preserve another 4 million for super stops so it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program now these things going on that we can 't obviously talked about in here that are happening in those areas so it just seems ludicrous that we would yeah this is 72 million 72 million be existing the funding these things exactly but this is about prioritizing which projects go ahead first but that it 's so within that 72 they 're already in the cost share agreement except for the ones that were changed exactly the ones that have been edit so there might be other projects that we wish to add on the information that we know well there might be different outcomes that we desire based on the information that we know since the cost share was agreed to that changed the priority but until we in that presentation we didn 't know anything else yes but is there anything else that would change that any of these no I think I think what we 've tried to change is is as the proposal in the first phase to it so that it supports the interchange facility that hold of turn Street one way was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it always as part of this first phase project yet I mean that 's exactly one of the streets that worries me and then I 'm in which one choom straight because actually based on some developments you might actually want to keep it to way it could be a major you know exes way from the a 's but for some of the other things that are going on if you have a stay in its current location or if you 're not going to do it for a number of years then it might not be critical to do it straight away that 's the sort of thing the big picture stuff we need to consider and if we 're agreeing to just do it one way now ahead of that just for the bus interchange which is one project one project when we 've got other projects happening all around that have changed since this was done I 'm really concerned the final question I just wanted to ask even if we agree to these and we bring these forward what sort of public engagement consultation will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example our local businesses that are affected do they have an opportunity to submit whether they want it to wait or one weight or you know people and sales record straight what chance do they have to say actually we think you should keep calm or street in the first phase or you should take it all out and do it in 20 years these have already been decided oh they 're only accessible City chapter that land use recovery plan we need to change our plan to we can 't have a plan that 's uncontained amendments to the first phase so it 's part of the cost share that we 're changing yeah that 's also known as well that 's good ya know but we 're not changing that we 're not changing the plane the the central city recovery plane is a legal plane under the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act in at his status which requires that we have nothing that that is uncontestable it our plane cannot be inconsistent with the Whitley central city recovery plan we wouldn 't consult on the tombs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was concluded all we 're doing is changing the order that we do things normally you are quite correct because the accessible City and that the covering plan has already stipulated that tone street becomes a one-way streets right in replace of litchfield haven 't said that madam chair we still need to go through a full public process for that and accordance with the local government act provisions and and the intention of this if you look at 6.3 as to get approval from councillors to go out to full public and stakeholder engagement over the design concepts for these first phase projects and that will probably be about a period of a month where we seek feedback on a variety of these projects which are in here they may need to be something which is akin to a special consultative procedure so it 'll be a will be a full consultation exercise with people we have the opportunity to have their say at the end of the day we 're we 're hamstrung by the decision of the the consultation oh really hang on are we I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing and then consultation isn 't fundamentally about whether we do them or not it is about how now we do them and how they look and feel when I look down this list I mean I think you hit the nail on the head we 're not changing I suppose the cost share we 're not changing the accessible City check that what we are doing is pragmatically say what is the best mix of projects because the 72 million dollars was a little bit of a it wasn 't it wasn 't a sort of I wish list but it took the knowledge ahead at the time we 're now trying to feast I suppose with Coursera to say how do we be spending it 72 million dollars to support what the government said the first phase without which was supporting the key enter project and then those and their context the key anger projects that we 're really trying to support other bus exchange which is the hub of our transport network and I suppose that the hospital redevelopment which is also an nailing removed so it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that 's what we 're doing I think in a practical way we 're just trying to drug juggle there as best we can to deliver the best outcome with the money that has been approved knowing that we are also working with Blyleven and his people in the back there to actually put together their business case to government for their next two phases of of funding,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"
NZ,NZ,Christchurch City Council,Christchurch City Council,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZETwErnCvvgbvBbnnHfyxA,12.05.14 - Item 7 - Proposed Re-structuring of the Council's Social Housing Portfolio - Part 3,60s1CzqTH8c,20140512,976.88,"Christchurch, New Zealand",2622,thank you I I do was to speak to the amendment and speak against it I do not support the amendment I think we do need to be really clear about the reason why we 're consulting without community and I think it 's really important that we 've seen two clear signal now as to what their objective us and I certainly think we should be maintaining the capacity to provide the current number of social housing units in our counselors portfolio and to act as a catalyst for the provision of at least one thousand additional units in the city selling things off and leaving it to the market will not address this problem in fact I do take exception to some of the comments that are made about being of Governors good governance is not about giving away a hundred and thirteen units to the government for no cost that wasn 't a sensible decision that 's actually cost us so I think it 's hard to listen to people that make comments about us being good governors when we know that some of the track record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return in terms of our housing but I really welcome the fact that government is working with us on housing we need their support we need the community support and we do need in some cases I think the private sector support to look at how we address the serious issue so I welcome us being really clear about what our objective is it 's really important I think that we consider this in light of the other things we do as a council why is it ok to use rates to subsidize professional sports and build huge stadiums for professional sports people and professional sports teams why is it ok to use rates to subsidize car parking buildings there 's other questions that we can ask around how we spend our money and we 'll go through and do that as part of a long-term plan but I think we have put some options forward in terms of dealing with our social housing issues going forward there are different views as to what 's wrong with the model but the one thing we know in the city the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market at a time when we needed housing the most the market has been a complete and utter failure it has ripped people off it has acted with greed and it has made the people who are the most vulnerable for the earthquake even worse off after the earthquake housing is one of the key priorities at this council in this city face and we have to start addressing the fact that leaving it to the market is no longer good enough this is long over during my opinion I wish the previous council had agreed to put money into fixing the social housing sooner it didn 't but this is a new council and it is sending a clear signal that we are committed to doing something about it so I strongly support their route the amended objective that we have to maintain our social housing stop in the city I strongly and against the proposed amendment I do not believe that this will be to our advantage ki David thank you I 'm going to vote in favor of the amendment at our last meeting we did put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firmly of the belief that we 've been given our statement of proposal that does vary that direction from from that meeting and I 'm very keen to see the all the options are considered and that this particular statement of proposal i believe does actually i agree with counsel of golf that does steer people in a particular direction so i will be voting against the amendment I i am very supportive or you 'll be voting for the amendment for generating Fourth Amendment but I am supportive of the notion that as a city we need to be doing something about housing for the affordable housing and affordable rentals but not through the mechanism i think that 's being proposed there are a number of options that i believe that the when it goes had consulted the public gets the opportunity to consult and using the whole 20 we may come up with some a lot of opportunities that gives council a positive way to go forward so I 'll be voting for the amendment Andrew yeah i 'll be voting against the amendment any changes small changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ensure that the document more accurate reflects the the work that the deputy mayor has been doing since februari or earlier and ensures that the document in fact reflects the conversation that we 're wanting to have with our community in line with that work so I 'd I believe that the the amended statement the one that was first put up prior to the amendment that we 're covering it when considering a moment more accurate and molecular it reflects the the conversation that we 're intending having in line with the work that the deputy mayor and the staff of darling I certainly commend the deputy mayor in coming up with what I consider to be some some interesting and innovative solutions to a problem that we know we 've got which is the financial sustainability of our existing social housing model I absolutely agree with agree with councillor Johansson that the private model has failed to deliver suitable housing solutions at a time of need when there have probably been more vulnerable people in terms of housing than any other time we look at a situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a situation where the housing quality in the private market has been allowed to deteriorate because people will live in houses that they would normally not consider living in and we 're looking at a situation where in fact there isn 't enough private rental property to go round we 've got people essentially bidding on the doorstep for rental properties in that private market so clearly there 's a need for us to continue to provide social housing what we 're doing here is going out with a number of options to have a conversation with the community on the way that we can continue to do that and the result will be a conversation with the community that allows us to make some good sound decisions on options which are financially and socially viable financially and socially sustainable really I 'm going to support the amendment I haven 't seen the financials around the slight change I think it is leading and I think it 's unnecessary to have this addition the addition is a distraction from the proposal as councillor East has said we all agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we discuss this I just like to say that the market hasn 't failed actually it 's done exactly what it should do but there isn 't a reason why we need to put in something as leading as the addition the late addition to to this proposal we 've got to have faith in our constituents to contribute to this consultation without the lead that has been provided so I will be supporting him in Pauline and booking thank you I 'll not be supporting the amendment that was not the original intent the intent was to address a recognized problem in our housing portfolio the model worked for many many years i think it was around 1934 that we counsel zachary many years at worked but something happened before our time I don 't want to get into that something happened but we can make it work again housing is actually regarded as a sound investment we are a council that can make things work so the intent is about making things work the intent is not about selling our social housing stock and i think that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're trying to do Thank You Vicki I just want to point out to quite significant features I can 't imagine why people would want to have taken out of the proposal that something is financially viable and sustainable I 'm struggling to understand that at any level the other point that 's in the other one talks about what we 've actually looking to sign up with with the government in terms of the housing accord and you 'll be aware there at the bottom of the housing Accord its it says that that it 's a subject to a consultative process with the council with switch community etc if it 's not ratified the parties agree that this Accord will be at an end and that puts activity there 's 75 million dollars that the government is currently looking to spend in Wales street and colombo street so let 's actually be quite clear what we are trying to achieve with us we are trying to achieve the use of government money to build two major communities and possibly more wells colombo possibly more we are working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and that 's quite a unique situation and we are allowed because of are allowed to look at leasing housing units into that that is not a usual situation for local government so we are coming a long way along their housing accord and the point of that is to join up all of the dots the point of that is to join up all of the dots such that we are providing more housing there is in the draft housing Accord that the need to provide at least a thousand additional housing within the unit not owned by us but affordable or social housing that 's owned by anyone the point of that community housing provider is also that it acts as a catalyst because the demand for housing as well and above well in excess of the 2649 units that we may end up owning so we absolutely have to drive not only additional housing through catalyzing the private sector we need the government 's money and cooperation to do this and we need to work with community groups who are community housing providers so the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to address the housing crisis that is in Christchurch that 's why those points are in the air because they 're in the draft hasn 't so i will i 'm going to say a couple of words just to conclude the debate and first of all to just say how gratifying it is to be a mere of a council where there can be different points of view but express respectfully and intelligently around the council table not everyone has to agree with each other here but actually how we 've conducted this debate has been admirable so I just want to really congratulate everyone for their I want to particularly acknowledge the deputy mayor for the passion and if it that she has put into this into this project is more than a project I 've told her she now has to lead the delivery of it and through the public consultation she 's not to go off on to another big idea immediately but I think that it just shows how you know providing that level of energy is really important to getting things moving its extraordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short space of time and under data acknowledged also the chair and the dicta chair Glen Livingston and Pauline cotta and the members of the Housing Committee for for their involvement and they 're in the staff I you know I 'm sure that ian had you know dark here at the beginning of this crisis at least here hasn 't actually pulled any out but I 'm just reflecting on I know how much the financial the legal end the community housing have really come together to make this happen in a way again it 's another example of working across the different components of the council drawing them together to really focus on on a solution I 'm not going to support the amendment I agree with the philosophy that lies behind thee that the changes that were introduced I do believe that there there has been I agree with Ali that the market is behaving exactly the way markets behave unfortunately markets don 't care about vulnerability we do and I think that I 'm worried about allowing social housing to fall into the into into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what happened in Auckland you cannot get social housing anywhere near this Center anymore all of us was sold to the private sector and of course they use the inflated land values in those areas in order to you know create you know apartment living near the center of the city and so and I also don 't agree that councils have been excluded from the encumber lated rent subsidy and the way that they have given that we meet the objective that the government said that it wanted to secure by way of exclusion so you know but maybe one day they might revisit that and see see what a good job that we 've done I think this provides an opportunity for the people of Christchurch to say whether we want to be in this area I believe the people of Christchurch will say that we we should be and I believe that they will find that we 've got a unique combination of opportunities here that enable our portfolio to be financially viable and sustainable it won 't be just to our portfolio in the future of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sits there at the moment but inviting other partners to join with us I totally agree that with councillor Barkin that is is that it gives us the chance to really enter into a public-private partnership and also work with the community sector with night ahoo in a way that I think we haven 't really had the opportunity to consider before but none of those things are on the table unless we do this consultation so I for one am very very pleased that we are at this point so i will put the amendment all those in favor of the amendment say aye those opposed say no all right so we 're going to have to have a vote so I think we 'll just we all set up for a vote yes all right so if you 're a vote yes or no now so the motion the amendment is lost and will now move on to the vote on the on the motion which as-as-as displayed so i 'll put that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no till we have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you very much thank you and we 'll move on to the next item on the agenda thank you very much,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

- Part 2,M9YYfcLUo9U,20140512,1382.56,"Christchurch, New Zealand",3451,so can we can we put and will end under the tombs of can we just change the wording of it so it goes 113 social housing units at five complexes are in the and then put quote marks around residential red zone and then will be and under the terms of the cost share agreement or cost-sharing agreement and it 's called will be transferred to the crown at no cost secret what 's that note no still wish to come up every one of those sorts yes I know it does but I actually I actually think that that this is an amount and I raised this before that doesn 't show up and the in the whole of the financial situation of thus of the social housing portfolio as the fact that a whole stack of properties that were within that portfolio generating a return to the council have suddenly been sold for no no return to the council at all we know the actual value of those are I think we 're going to get that at the moment it 's sort of estimated between 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an asset value and we obviously don 't get the rental return as well but from an asset value of the book value of assets at 15 million so what report are we giving details on that for there 's a piece of work being done around the impact of some of the crown decision Sierra decisions on council and great this is one of those meddlesome thank you and I 've got David next Thank You Mia look I 'm just a little concerned that we get into gender paper we have an extraordinary meeting put upon us and then during a tea break we get another variation of the statement of proposal put upon from in front of us only the first page well gee okay well even even if it was just no no it was a result of this morning 's meeting the first page had a couple of minor amendments made to it yeah I mean it 's not the staffs fault it 's um an enthusiastic council contribution to the collective effort would that be fair enough no to be fear does change the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additions point they 're important to a completely new direction so it 's quite substantial oh it 's all good let me clear on well literally that when I will it sort that out let 's sort that out after we 've finished asking questions around because people have got questions and we 'll just get the Christians sorted and then we can have a discussion about how we deal with that because obviously there are a couple of different views around there Jimmy questions first one you will review original document page 31 a new document on page 69 points a word so the current council social housing portfolio is 3 43 million dollars in my right eye appoint a seventh and can try to value the current okay it 's correct yes okay then if we are the can you please confirm with the cancerous whether the 14 9 percentage here is equal to the current council the letter for value 3 43 million dollars 49 percentage here one hundred percent is 340 million dollars says painting what we transfer them to the entity whether it be land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be different so you mean the 3 43 million dollars times 49 plus entity Dec 14 I 'd not share is one hundred percent of the council 's asset and social housing yeah yeah how about a 49-percent ET chief if we had 49-percent investment and a company then our shares would be forty-nine percent of the 343 million so here is an investment yet it 's a go create the hot if we transferred a whole of the essay yes but there is no decision made about transferring the whole of the essay yet so that 's one of the things we 're consulting on us how much we were trained to their second questions that are the attachment why it will review option one in the option are free in here can you confirm with us if council is the social house in them and the building to the distal CHP it means counselor shear is a little am i right but the evil revealed option three if a council saw out all the beauty annette tool is a new entity chp then council on last year is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know all the options are forty nights in ownership by counsel under option 1 which is leasing the land and buildings we would listen it a land value cost so council would be receiving about 8.6 million dollars a year and lethal lease rental here under option one and a similar amount from memory so so option three is around selling yeah and so we would have an investment as opposed to an income stream from option bar okay thank you okay and pull have they been any thought prior going to us here have been any fault about perhaps approaching housing New Zealand to purchase our housing stock you continue that service so no not serious consideration if I may wouldn 't it be covered in tiny pay if we sold everything to a housing provided housing new zealanders a housing together isn 't so fit degree that 's dead as an option yes there 's still an option it 's that 's on the table breath yeah I mean if I was doing this the first question I would have asked is to housing New Zealand can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since they actually provide this on behalf of the taxpayer anyway I think the issue is clearly this proposal is being changed since this morning and I 'd like to go back to the original one but really the simple question is that the current social housing model doesn 't work anymore and the question is what should we do with it staff have identified 20 options they 've been working on this for the last 18 months we 're just going out to ratepayers and saying what do you think we should do it 's as simple as that so why we why we 're making it so difficult yeah anyway the issue is as is the change to the language of the objective clause so do we want to have a discussion around there so perhaps Vicki if you could lead off on that and then there will be others who want to contribute so there is somewhat more to it than just the simple issue of housing and and what we do with it although that is fundamental within the housing accord the first part of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wales in colombo street this is the second part and it 's about improving the supplying quality of social or affordable housing because if we go down the current track then we are not what we have is completely unsustainable at the moment housing assets the land and the buildings are listed as you can see me 3.16 as strategic assets so in order to do any about that we are required to consult we can 't for example even rebuild on our existing land by way of public-private partnership where we get the same number of houses back but perhaps transfer some of the land under our current rules so we have without going through without going on consultation we can 't do anything without going through a public consultation and the situation that we have is that our housing account which has always been ring-fenced from rating has an annual operating shortfall of about 3 million we have at the moment about 1.8 million left in it so there is a short term horizon that we are required to focus on in order to do anything we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole point of the housing accord and all of the discussions since februari of this year about that was actually to try to do something about the housing crisis that we have in Christchurch it wasn 't about getting rid of social housing and getting out of it that is totally contrary to both the spirit of the housing Accord which we have yet to sign and to the entire debate that has been around this from februari this year and so this is actually about making sure that people in Christchurch have a good warm dry house to live in and since the Christchurch City Council is the second largest landlord in the country we absolutely have to be socially responsible about the way in which we deal with that these are people 's lives that we 're talking about just in the same way as when we were dealing with flooding those people were vulnerable these people are equally vulnerable if not more so actually so we have to be very clear about what we are going out to do and it is not repeat not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our social housing portfolio to the private sector and I am absolutely clear about that and that 's why we wanted the objectives made clear in that we have been offered an opportunity I agree that the government policy is kind of unusual but we have been offered a way in which we can actually keep offering social housing to those who need it but do so such that the government subsidizes their rent by making up to a market rent and that 's really really important because that 's potentially 10 12 14 15 million a year that we will receive through this mechanism that we will not receive under any other mechanism hence the preference for the council becoming part of a community housing provider the other thing that we 've been offered that is quite different than any other local authority is the ability to lease our social housing into that entity such that we receive the market rent not from the tenant but from the government but that we still own that asset in order to speed up the delivery of our rebuild on our social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if we get everything we 've asked for from the insurance we do not have enough money to do that so hence the need for some creative and innovative solutions probably public-private partnerships in terms of allowing people to build the amount of the houses that we need on our land and in return they might get some of the land or to even possibly swap land because we have some in areas that will be incredibly expensive to rebuild on given the damage that is on those sites so this allows us to go forward in a way which actually houses people in crash stimulates the private sector because we 're going to have to work very very closely with them in order to achieve these outcomes it enables us to actually meet the objectives of the housing accord and it enables us to get on and do something do some things both and the entity and with the crash at City Council itself when we want to rebuild whether it 's berm street or Enders prison or whatever if we 're doing that on a partnership basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type things we cannot currently do it so we are stuck at the moment with a rapidly diminishing fund in this situation where social housing possibly because we 've given away huge amounts no rinsing does not pay its way we have to change the way in which we 're doing I am not in the slightest suggesting that the council gets rid of its obligation to house the most vulnerable in the community that is a no way shape or form the objective of this exercise and while I appreciate that we are open for every possible consideration and that 's the nature of local democracy that is not the objective that we 're going out here with the objective is that we actually have a sustainable social housing program and that we can actually have people in the community through doing it smarter or differently than the way that we are currently doing it because we 've simply run out of time and money in the current way of doing it clean thank you I 'll be quicker than last time and punch here look I just want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going out with the presumption that we are still in the provision of social housing this is our current status quo position and as with a draft Daniel pen we go out with a certain position as we did for instance over the retention of community grants I 'm quite relaxed about that we are also with that putting out 19 other options the way I see it this is an opportunity for social housing which I think it is important for us to take the preferred option will ensure our provision of social housing is viable that the fund that supports it as sustainable well we must look at all options the preferred option will ensure that ownership has retained by lease and this is very important this is a value actually that the city holds dear that it owns at social housing this goes back decades and I would be very intrigued that a council would seek to get out of social housing in the decade following earthquakes what we offer our tenants is something that is a point of difference to many other landlords in the sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to consider we must remember our tenants in this at the end of it all it 's about the provision of warm and dry housing as vicki was saying restructuring it like this will enable us to attract the income related rent subsidy as an entity reached it as a community housing provider I think it 's a good housing plan also think it 's a sound financial plan I 've said this before a measure of society is its priority for the poor we 've been in the provision of social housing for decades said last week also that the Crown 's as a signatory to the human rights charter on housing this is a basic fundamental right and my view anyway is that we must make good on this fundamental right I 'm happy for this to go out consultation as it is very good I 'm Paul look obvious here as we 've seen a report this is not a viable option as it currently stands going forward and I 'm really comfortable to go to the public and are seeing what they feel they want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring-fence the moment it 's not going to say that way for very long so i think that 's importantly do soon you 'll quickly find out what the public think and will act on that right so sorry I was just adding the word amended statement of proposal because we have amended it now with them reference to 5.4 in the residential red zone so all right i 'll put the motion oh sorry Jamie ref Phil so would I board then you have to sorry you have to move an amendment that ok so you replace replace so ref mangie Jamie Gulf have moved and seconded that the objective clause and the draft statement of proposal be be returned to the one that was on the original and the original original agenda and the yeah and the original agenda sorry there 's a few other people that would so do either a you want to speak to their already done here you can yep and then I 've got fell so okay um obviously we 've got movement seconded that we stick with the original objectives that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning there are a couple of additions in there in my view is why I 'm supporting the amendment is simply because I believe it fundamentally changes the the intent or the ability to have an intelligent conversation with the community the points read ensure the pool fault this is the additions and the one that we then had it on our desk this morning ensure the portfolio has a financially viable and sustainable future and maintain the capacity to provide the current number of social housing units dadadada da at for the provision of at least a thousand additional units and in the city you know I think what what was said earlier is actually right now I endorse it we have got a broken our social housing model is broken and we would like to remedy that I want to go out and have an intelligent conversation with the community on it what I see these two points that have been added doing is not proposing intelligent conversation with the community but proposes a leading conversation with the community or at worsen my opinion a predetermined conversation with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lens of saying that this is about providing you know cleaned houses for people and everything like that but I think there 's a more important lens which I think needs to be put over absolutely everything that comes in front of us as a council if we 're to be good governors of a city and that 's the fact that what may be more important than having a you know warm dry house to love them is that we have a city to live in that doesn 't bankrupt so I think well it 's dangerous when we start changing the meanings of the objectives here because I think option 20 which is the sale of social housing is a valid question to ask to community we 're cognizant that that could potentially provide 343 million dollars close to 350 million dollars hey news flash guys that 's still 200 million short of what we need even if we did that so I think that it needs to be considered and that 's why I 'm supporting the amendment here and I 've got Phil within Yanni look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little own major change that I can see between with what is on a disk now could be with this morning in end and like it 's there 's no way this is predetermined the options for people to give feedback are absolutely clear within the statement of proposal and and it like I 'm sure that perfectly ordinary intelligent people will be able to see it that way I want to say to that I actually really applaud the statement of proposal that we 've come up with and I applaud the work that Vicky buck and the staff of dumb it does leave the options open it actually is a way about how we can do our social housing rather than we can 't do and we 'll sell it and it 's someone else do it all better the whole the whole approach of being able to lease our land to an entity and for us to retain a stake in it i think is commendable given that the financial situation of a via social housing as council livingston has referred to as social housing is actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Auckland we can in fact fix our whole social how not to social at affordable housing problem which is huge and I 'd like to I 'd like to make sure that in fact we all support this as being away it forward to start to do then thank you Yanni,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"
NZ,NZ,Christchurch City Council,Christchurch City Council,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZETwErnCvvgbvBbnnHfyxA,12.05.14 - Item 7 - Proposed Re-structuring of the Council's Social Housing Portfolio - Part 1,IRmy3q-tKSw,20140512,1074.61,"Christchurch, New Zealand",2573,I 've I 've received a request from the gym jamir that we now turn to item number seven on the agenda which I agree that we shall do which is the well I should ask is there any objection to dealing with the restructuring of the council social housing portfolio proposal and the reason that we 're doing that is that she has another meeting to go to an weird that counselor at East has another meeting is does counsel at Lonsdale so we will we 'll move on i mean this might not take very long so we 'll just all see how we go so item item number seven and we have a recommendation up here and i 'm assuming that 's the staff recommendation as what you 'd like to move Vicki back Vicki back moves and seconded by Glenn Livingston so if i could peps is that the right one don 't know keep going is that all right is that the agreed resolution was there anything else it 's it oh I see bright approves the for distribution and consultation the amended statement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take out take out the phrase attached to the staff report that solves that problem yeah ok so would you like staff to go through the report or do you want to start just open up for questions would you like to take us through the report thank you and just as a measure of course introducing one at the table just Sydney good afternoon Carolyn gallaher Community Support Manager and on my left Ian Thompson senior counsel legal services and on my right Jason rivet financial manager for community support excellent good so you had before you hear the proposed restructuring on the council social housing report and so actual actual meeting of the first of May you instructed us to develop a statement proposal for consultation so that the council can have a move more flexibility in the future ownership management and development of our social housing portfolio and also to enable this council to address more effectively social housing issues in the study through all the options identified in our staff report and you 'll see an attachment a there 's a description of the 20 options @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial analysis of those 20 options so also attached we have a whirl an updated statement of proposal today to to consider and so suppose in summary I just like to say the key points of what we 're presenting here today as we 're asking you to consider whether or not to change the way we provide social housing but before we do that we consult with the community and a special consultative procedure before making final decisions on this matter and so we have before us today a draft statement of proposal you 've received an updated one just before that covers issues you may you may want to wish to include in the consultation process so the proposals that we 're wanting to consider today are to establish a limited liability company as an entity that will be eligible mmm so I 'll just go through before I do this the objective of what we 're trying to achieve so what we 're trying to achieve today is to have more flexibility in the future ownership management and development of the council 's own social housing portfolio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viable and sustainable future for our tenants and Christchurch we want to maintain the capacity to provide the current number of social housing units and the council 's portfolio and to act as a catalyst for the provision of at least a thousand additional units and the city and we also want to better address the shortage of social housing and the implementation of the government social housing reform program so in summary our preferred option that we 're recommending today is that the council establishes a limited liability company and entity in which the council will have an interest of up to forty nine percent and that will be eligible for registration as a community housing provider under the provisions of the housing restructuring and tenancy matters community housing provider regulations 2014 we 're also encouraging you to initially subscribe for all shares and the new company and appoint first board of directors their preferred option is to lease the entity an appropriate mix of social housing assets gift or selling to the entity certain assets from the council 's social housing portfolio we 're also suggesting transferring the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housing assets either to an NT in which the council has an interest of up to forty nine percent or to a third party that the council enters into arrangements itself with the council City Housing partners and others for the redevelopment of some of the land currently used for social housing and that we take the appropriate steps to comply with all relevant statutory and regulatory obligations and obtaining all the necessary approvals and authorities which may be required before the council can undertake the activities and transactions above and we note that this includes the requirements under the local government act 2002 Public Works Act 1981 and reserves Act 1977 so we 've outlined for you the background to what we 're proposing here with as ice it stated before we 've attached analysis of all 20 options including models and financial analysis and then we have the proposal outlined here viewing city housing as an asset and then we have recommendation as above thank you sorry should turn on my microphone I just had a question around why councils local authorities are not eligible to receive the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access that subsidy is I think I think it is but clearly the government and its recent legislation has thrown its support behind community groups established to provide community housing as opposed to local government providing met but in themselves so so government provision plus community providers or why not us we don 't know but I mean I 'm not I 'm not asking you to offer an opinion what was their explanation for excluding councils from the subsidy I I have no particular knowledge or experience of that but I do understand anecdotally that the government was concerned that local authorities that did have social housing portfolios we 're using that income for other purposes and not with income from the portfolio for other purposes and not housing so I think they were wanting to rein in some of the local authorities and encourage community housing providers that were that were going to focus solely on providing community we have always operated with a ring fence haven 't we so so so we wouldn 't be you know if that were the criteria that that had all part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't have been excluded on that basis as the criteria had been different is yes because we absolutely bring fence the money we receive and we do not put rates money into the and to the portfolio yeah I got to take it personally great Pauline Oh Phil one thing one of the options i guess that you refer to you don 't recommend this is it in fact as different ways effect council with just dispose of their social housing all together now what I want to ask you about is as a comparison with orkin I 'm probably asking you Carolyn on your professional opinion because it just seems to me I know historically Auckland sold all their social housing and it just seems to me that in terms of their the availability of support to the most vulnerable people who would normally avail social housing that an autumn they 've been no we 're soft and in fact a far worse off but I just like wonder if you could comment comment on it whether I 'm creaked about and that you can say is so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housing stock and so you know the provision of housing out there is different from the Christchurch scene and when you say different as your understanding and in fact it 's it 's far more far more difficult for people to obtain housing well I think doesn 't there has been lots of commentary about the housing market in Auckland and it is a difficult market but they didn 't sell their social housing 22 a community housing provider that 's why they sold it to the private market and as a result that the social housing virtually disappeared especially in the central city I remember one of the MPS bought a substantial amount of it and south or sorry yonni thank you just just just so the we 're clear and the community is really clear we go out for consultation with us people can make submissions basically council after hearing those submissions could go with any option out of the 22 they 've enlisted effort chose to if it tasted so council after hearing submissions could choose to sell off call of a social housing stock you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will be required to go through or would we have to go through another you have to approach the consultative process with an open mind and if the advice or the the words you 're getting from the community they want the whole thing sold then you have to consider that take that on board is there any other process we would then go through around the disposal of it or would it just be that 's that we 've made the decision to sell off that Sh and that 's that I I think you would have to get further advice as to how that would be affected and they may well be a further consultative process I don 't know but you would have to seek the right advice from staff before you made a final decision yeah yeah that the objective that is set out here is to maintain the capacity to provide the current number of social housing units and the capsules to portfolio and to act as a catalyst for more so selling off social housing would not make the objective that we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's I guess it 's um the question as and then wires and an option in terms of addressing those objectives in this report so why are we consulting on something that doesn 't address the objectives Oh what 's the idea is the the objective is being changed so the objective from the original report we got up until this morning was the council 's objective is to have more flexibility in the future ownership management and development of its social housing portfolio and obviously that 's being changed in between this morning and now yeah so I would go back to that original start proposal no as in I 'm not allowed to that 's really you can move a no decision isn 't you can move those but but but I 've got a speaking last year so um Paul your necks yannis question hasn 't actually been answered what was the quick the question was as is it were then with an order to ask for well as it as it appropriate to ask that question given the change to the objective I don 't I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the objective but we 're obliged under the Act to consider all reasonably practicable options so that is what we 've we 've done we 've covered 20 options yes it may be preferred to enter into an arrangement where we least some of our housing stock to a new CHP but that doesn 't that doesn 't prevent you from considering other options and that 's the whole point of the consultative process to get community get the views and preferences of the community and with regard to the preferred option but they may say we want you to sell the whole lot or we want you to do it another way any one of the 20 options is still on the table in terms of the consultative process so I just think we need to be really clear about this is the opportunity people have it to tell us whether they want us to stay in social hours and years yeah or get out of it or do it in a different model and I just think people need to be aware of the very real significance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a fair to say reading a report the social housing ring-fence is about to boost in other words the money is about to run out and it 's going to start impacting the right pair if we don 't change them on we had some really significant financial challenges learning the social housing portfolio as us and you 'll see in the attachment option eight do nothing and the consequences are spelled out there so really we have no choice but to go find a new model cuz this one 's guys it 's our advice if we want to maintain the non rating contribution yes that 's right yep Phil you hit a question I 'm just wanting to clarify and choose those three kind of major options whether we continue as as per usual or as a different model get out in term of help socializing in terms of say a different model would one of it seems to me that one of the options should be that in fact we may lease council might Lisa some of its social housing to the new entity but retain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included in effect on the statement proposal well I think years that 's right some because we have other initiatives such as the injuries present development for example so here 's some of the housing assets can go into the hunter in terms of the options available es thinks you can I do ask a question on five point four of the statement of proposal there 's 113 social housing units of five complexes are in the red zone and will be transferred to the crown at 2007 valuations is that right i thought the cost sharing agreements is that we got nothing for them yes that 's true we didn 't get anything for it so we 've got a separate paper with the financial implications of that which will come through to you at some stage outlining some of the background costs associated with that not occurring so so but but why does 5.4 say there 's will be transferred up 2007 valuations so that should come out you 're right,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

3,sYdTFqicgnI,20140512,1218.88,"Christchurch, New Zealand",3500,uh yanni one final question um in terms of the recommendations that are going forward there 's nothing here that kind of talks about eqc i i 've added one that i was going to tell you about when we got to it right so we 're going to go through the individual recommendations so i 've got requests that the mayor the chair of the environmental committee and the acting chief executive meet with eqc and the insurance council to understand the progress they 're making on land and repair strategies and their potential contribution to resolving these issues because um the contribution is not crystal clear it 's not clear-cut eqc is entirely governed by legislation uh and and yeah and there 's obviously some issues around uh their their categorization of land is increased vulnerability to flood risk and there are so many issues in there it 's probably better that we just meet with them get an update and and feed that into the into the whole process so what i 'm concerned about is the people that are in flood risk zones at the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ district plan and we 've also got eqc repairs happening that don 't need consent and so in wallston houses are actually being lowered into an area of elevated risk so in the consenting part of the technical report that 's not really picked up but it does seem to me there 's an urgent meeting required with eqc and there is and we 're probably our building consents people to talk through consent requirements or expectations in these areas with what we know we can 't have people 's houses in my view being lowered into a area that 's got an increased risk of flooding well i think i 've also made the point on more than one occasion that it 's just it 's just wrong to require somebody to fix their house in an area that continues to expose them to an under 50 year you know under the 50 year um which is the building act level you know and um and there are areas um and honestly that are in that category if staff have any comment on what we may be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repairs done at the moment as we speak so we do quite need an you know i think an urgent response to this issue i can 't actually comment on that because it 's a part of that regulatory consenting side of the business that i in the task force i wasn 't asked to go and look at it but i do acknowledge that there is that that issue has been happening yeah and building control were engaged in the task force to look at some of those building act compliance requirements as part of it of course if it 's just a minor repair that doesn 't trigger a building consent there 's an issue but there was one conversation i had with a registered surveyor who 's done a lot of work on measuring floor levels within this area but not only have we experienced the uh the settlement of land of up to half a meter the floor levels of the houses due to the seismic shaking have also sunk as well so you 've got the combination of the land sinking and the house sinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's and sometimes to reinstate that to its previous level you 'd have to put it back to the vertical height it was before which means virtually a house raise or a rebuild so these are the sorts of conversations that need to happen but it 's i mean it 's really time critical because people are incredibly stressed out that it seems to be that they don 't need consents so i would have thought one of the options should be and the sooner we can do it the better is that anyone that 's getting work to their foundations in a flood risk zone flood management area needs to have a building consent at the moment my understanding is there 's just guidelines and it 's really discretionary as to whether the builder chooses to go with it or not based on their assessment yeah it 's i mean you can 't change a regulatory framework uh just by passing a resolution so but i think that by putting down this requirement that we meet with the insurance council and with the eqc it i mean i 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um i mean i am well over well not well over but i 'm well aware of the importance of the issue and i know that john mackie has been meeting with an individual who 's been communicating with a number of us and the concerns that are raised are serious and they require a serious response but they also require us to do it within the legal framework so and it is when we get into legal regulatory matters that we have to be ultra cautious um and get it right so but i agree that it is urgent glenn thank you just in relation mike to uh some of the the the joined up approach across the council we 've already been doing a bit of work on the possibility of relocating houses so do you imagine that you you know could consider using that work we 've got an rfp out at the moment i can look at you know is it is a possible option i 'm i wouldn 't be able to answer that because i 'm not aware of the work that 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the housing committee you know a trial run of relocating 10 hours it would make sense to see if there 's opportunities and line them up it 'll be great uh ally i just wanted to reiterate to the points that yani made and just say so that people don 't think that we 're ignoring it this is a major issue in flockton as well and not only is it people who are getting repairs done uh presently these are people who have had repairs completed yep yep no question about that all right well let 's go through the individual um recommendations we 'll just go through them one by one if because um staff didn 't have a lot of input into them have you got an update on the 600 000 there 's a there 's a large number in there about funding the task force force work to date so i just asked the um acting uh chief executive to explain the 600 000 thank you and i asked michael d who 's the finance manager to bring along the information and talk to michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up of consultants being involved you 've heard earlier about there 's been quite a number of consultants involved in both the investigation walkthroughs consultation etc that makes up probably about 80 of those costs there are a few staff costs involved in that they are only they are the costs directly of right across council associated to this project some of those will already be funded within existing budgets but we need to be clear have clarity across where the um costs are spent so that 's the predominant makeup of that um there 's other incidentals like flights etc but that 's not a significant nature um the cost of any temporary work that 's been done to date has actually gone through our operational budgets or through the earthquake side right so so largely it 's uh the consultancy work to bring on within a relatively short short time frame and so the the um we 're being asked to retrospectively approve that being brought forward and to seek the support of the two clients um in the horizontal infrastructure rebuild to agree to that um noting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report for temporary flood defence measures was completed only on friday needs to be reviewed by senior council engineers policy and legal staff prior to being finalised we 've agreed to the release of the draft technical report i think everyone has to agree to that because we 've already released it and with financial and commercially sensitive information being removed there is some some parts of the report that have been removed and all of the appendices aren 't there at the moment but again delegate to the mayor the chair of the environmental committee and the acting chief executive to approve the release of the final report we 're going to work very hard to get that done as quickly as possible it 's got a lot of rich information for individual areas about the extent of the um the the different approaches that can be adopted particularly around maintenance and i found that incredibly helpful um there 's 325 pages when you take the whole lot into account i read it yesterday it really is um incredibly um and really an incredibly important document and i think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremely well note the time constraints on the task force and commend all of those involved for producing such a comprehensive analysis on the specific causes of flooding in each of the priority areas noting the commitment to find solutions for vulnerable property owners so we really do appreciate that and it 's certainly heartfelt from all of us requesting the acting chief executive to establish a second phase task force one to get that confirmation of the level one properties to provide a recommended program of actions and costs to implement urgent solutions in each catchment and that should include a temporary pumping solution and flocked and i think that 's something that 's a lot of advanced work has been done on that and that could be got up and running very quickly the repair of flat gates and the avon and heathcote rivers the dredging of the hefcat river the removal of debris and improved maintenance regime if that means renegotiating some of the contracts and just getting that work on a constant constant improvement basis i think that it really will give people a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to agree the program and implementation time frame um noting that some of this work may be authorised to commence immediately ensure that the skirt work program is fully aligned with the land drainage recovery program i think that came up in a number of comments that we had back not only from staff but from from people out in the community um and and from councillors obviously meet with the um with the sarah well the ccc sierra flood steering group to ensure that all of the work streams are aligned i think that 's uh pretty critical they 're doing some good work i think they 've been set up about eight weeks ago and to really align and make sure that there aren 't any gaps and and no double up happening that would be great um identify any other areas that have been impacted by flooding on the proposed levels one to three vulnerability and report on those and that picks up yani 's point you know parts of the central city i think there might be parts of south brighton uh close to the estuary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um there might be the odd area close to streams and in the pendleton area i 'm not sure i urgently review criteria for assessing flood risk and land movement in littleton to improve the analysis as i said before assess upstream developments for their contribution to flooding and where the mitigation requirements are being fully implemented so a lot of upstream developments were subject to them putting in place mitigation has that been done effectively is that operational is there more that we could be doing in that area and also talk to the ministry of education education regarding a comprehensive response to flooding affecting schools requests that staff produce a program of community information meetings and other priority areas by the 16th of may so by the end of the week we 'll know when we 'll be out in all of those communities again reinforce our view that the use of the residential red zone is a major component of long-term flood management and land drainage solutions for the city and request that the chief planning officer is a matter of urgency prepare a master plan which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required for this purpose i took great comfort from the prime minister 's speech a couple of weeks ago where he made it clear that this needed to be resolved before we could get out and consult with the public about the future use of the residential red zone and i know that that will be an enormous relief to the city as a whole it 's a it 's a major asset in terms of resolving some of these long-term issues in our city request the chief planning officer to ensure the alignment as i 've said with the nerp note that section 16 3 of the canterbury earthquake recovery act enables us to request the minister to direct us to develop a recovery plan it seems to me that this is a time where we should have a conversation with the minister about whether the land drainage recovery plan should be uh programmed should become a statutory plan um under the act and that that i 'm not i 'm not i 'm not necessarily persuaded that that should be the case but i think we should open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the legislation is that it could give us access to the statutory powers that could be incredibly effective in making sure that those long-term solutions are able to be implemented in a shorter time frame as is possible request that the mayor and well the three of us meet with the eqc we 've already discussed that and request that a progress report comes to the earthquake recovery committee of the hole on the 5th of june which has delegated the power to act on any recommendations and the reason i 've chosen that date is because that is the date that the flockton report will come back to the earthquake recovery committee of the whole and i intend to have that with power to act as well so um so that will enable us to wrap things up into a into a neat package of of work um and and and i think that it 's um yeah that really puts us on a on a good pathway so so those are the recommendations so i 'll now open it up to debate yani just wanted to signal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in the 11.9 just to include mb because i think ministry for building innovation and employment or economic development i think they actually have a role around things like guidance notes around consenting around repair strategies so i just think they 're an important player in that in that conversation yeah i agree um okay well and i think we need to include sarah on that basis as well so meet with sarah comma mb we 'll just call them nb comma that 's right and i think you should probably include our own building i don 't know who you 're from we will we will i mean the acting chief executive includes the organisation okay great and the second point was just in regards to um the uh skirt alignment and we 're just trying to find it on the sheet that we would be given oh ensure that the skirt work program is fully aligned with the land drainage recovery program yeah whether that 's where the natural environmental recovery program should be put in as well because it seems to me um it 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both of those programs that 's critical um i know we 've already asked a report on how we can actually get that done i did also wonder whether we need to be communicating to our client governance group our concerns over the skirt so that we 're actually talking to someone about that being done rather than just just passing the note here i 've got that on the and the the task force to get the skirt work program and there but i wanted the chief planning officer to do the alignment work around the land drainage recovery program in the newp the concern is that the natural environment recovery program talks a lot about stormwater uh talks a lot about flooding and landing yeah yeah yeah but it 's not currently aligned to the skirt work no i know it seems like you should i wouldn 't get the flooding task force to do that that 's the point so it needs to go somewhere else i 've got the skirt work program fully aligned with the land drainage recovery program because it makes sense for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alignment but what you 're talking about is a bigger question um well why don 't why don 't we get why don 't we get the same group of three to go and meet with the with skirt or with the horizontal infrastructure governance group or to ensure alignment between these things yeah well yeah i can understand i can understand the council is concerned so um it 's a separate issue so underneath request that the chief planning officer to ensure the alignment i mean it isn 't ensuring that it 's aligned i 'm just not quite sure the mechanism but but you 're that they 're two separate issues i i know what you 're talking about but they 're two separate issues so um it 's a separate piece of wood it 's a separate issue but we 've already got a request for a report to come back on how that can happen so we 'll just follow it up through that process a request for how the net house skirt parameters can be changed to take into account the natural environmental recovery program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to the minister about having a statutory land uh drainage recovery plan actually you might want to think about some of the stuff that 's in the natural environmental recovery program yes i 'm being included i agree um which was actually at the back of my mind with that conversation too yeah um it 's not to do with that it 's separate is it necessary for this resolution yeah i know exactly what you want to do and i i agree with it and we 'll we 'll find a way of doing it i don 't think we need a resolution on that is that so should we debate the yeah yeah i mean i 'm happy just very briefly to say again just commence staff for the work that they 've done on this there are a number of issues we need to work through i think it 's really good that the task will continue to its second phase and i think there 's still a lot of community engagement that needs to happen but this is a fantastic start and i think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flooding issues in our city as post earthquake is incredibly important and we need to continue down this path um phil i think this has been a great piece of work too i think the interdisciplinary way of working both internally externally has worked fantastically and all of these recommendations really add to in my view sort of like adding to key parts of the engine to drive you know flood protection and prevention inertity so i think they all add up and really um we 've achieved a lot of progress and there 's a lot more to do,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

1,MZ3laWD1QmA,20140512,977.48,"Christchurch, New Zealand",2437,item 5 which is the mural Task Force on flooding and I have asked that a set of recommendations such counsel a clear water and as capacity as the chair of the Environment Committee has agreed to second a set of recommendations they 're so they 've been moved and seconded and so if I could invite staff to come to the table I understand that you 've prepared a briefing for the council so please pass on the thanks of the count sort of a whole team for for the work that 's been done and pets if you could introduce the team for a measure of formality for the for the council meeting and then we 'll open it up to you to make the presentation I 'll just introduce Michael de fome finance John Mackey transport green space manager Mike Gillooly land drainage operations manager but also added up the task force Terry house acting GM for city infrastructure thank you happy to you okay would you like to go through the presentation or would you yeah I think just quickly through the presentation and then we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we get into me okay thank you so much vtg hopefully that 's going to be bright enough ah not too bright for people to see okay I think you 'll see that some of our recommendations probably make what hopefully we 're going to discuss today a little bit more action-oriented but I don 't think that will reflect on the report so thank you okay thank you so we 'll go through the very quick presentation on the findings of the task force will look at the purpose talk about a bit of context around what we 've experienced in recent recent times in terms of the rainfall so we get a historical perspective the vulnerable vulnerable ax t levels or something we need to discuss the vulnerability levels as our our way of understanding the effects of what 's happening in this community at a community level when I say community I mean the community of christ church it 's more than flockton basin it is hid kit it is south shore at a summer it is the lower a line so we need to talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand that this is a task force it was looking at the most vulnerable members of our community we live in a flat city with subject as we know to some fairly intense periodic rainfall we 're all vulnerable in a way but this is about the most vulnerable we 've got some information on the areas that we assist in the findings for each individual area we 'll talk about the things we can do in terms of that the brief that we were given to look at the temporary measures and also at relocation options and opportunities and some some of the costs that we 've managed to develop so the purpose was to assist the most vulnerable homes to cope with a frequent flooding made worse by the earthquakes so this is about the earthquakes and it is about the most vulnerable in terms of the weather if we have a conversation about the weather this is an oh my goodness me moment for Christchurch we 've seen sex fairly significant rainfall events four of which have been in the last eight to nine weeks but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a moment like that in Christchurch would have been around 1986 and you can see here on this slide the 1986 you had a cluster of three and one year three storms similar to what we had here over the last month or two in the intervening period between 1986 in 2012 a couple of things have happened one is we had we had an earthquake or a series of earthquakes and the other thing is that the rich it wasn 't the same sort of intense extreme rainfall events they were about three 1992 1994 in 1999 which would have caused some flooding in the city for sure we 're not we don 't really know how that affected floor levels but these are that the recent flooding we 've had has certainly been made worse by the earthquakes you can see there you know 1974 2 1980 another very very wet period but immediately prior to that nineteen sixty eight to nineteen seventy-four virtually nothing so that 's the 1968 Wahine storm weather weather is variable it tells us that we need to be vigilant we covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heathkit a per heathkit heathcott valley south shore some little river and littleton we included the upper heathkit as a late addition to scope because in the March storm that was a catchment that was badly affected the other areas that are are of extreme interest are little river in littleton which have particularly littleton has a peculiar set of circumstances that we need to look at further and it 's included in the report as well this report really tries to introduce layers of vulnerability at at a human scale we looked at those members of our community that have sustained regular flooding above the floor level as the most of the most vulnerable more than twice since the earthquakes begin the reason why it 's more than twice is because of it had just been once we would head skewed results as a result of the match storm the match storms are very significant about extreme event and we needed to take into account those who had been flooded regularly so it does the most vulnerable level one flooded floor levels more than twice but the second most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular flooding below the floor level and we hear in some very successful community engagement workshops to get some feedback on the impacts of flooding bad floor and blow floor and flooding net restricted access and those people who sustained regular and the floor flooding a severely impacted and would come to the category of the most vulnerable within the task force rement but there are also those who told us that they are vulnerable as a result of not having access to their homes not having access to their homes by waking up in the morning and not being able to get to work or by coming home in the afternoon and not being able to get home so those people are also part of our most vulnerable we 've managed to capture the number of homes that were flooded there 's always going to be uncertainties around the data so this is what we understand to be the situation at the moment we understand that the number of households who are the most vulnerable in terms of regular above floor level flooding that there are 56 homes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Dudley Creek so we talked about Doug decree can we talk about flockton quite a lot but it is an area that has the greatest risk and it 's also the area that we understand the most about and it is one that we are most advanced in their understanding of we can see that this 28 flooded homes regularly and lovely Creek 260 homes within badly Creek and plot the flock canaria who have regular sustained flooding under the floor floorboards family floors and 291 who have some sort of compromised access to the homes so that 's the size of our problem and a hue at a human scale for that the creek but also we 've got problems as you can see in the lower heathkit 13 homes and families regularly flooded above the floor 159 household flooded underneath the home 109 who have trouble accessing the their homes during a major flood event so the multiple floods under the home across the city 451 that 's how many people how many families are affected by this within the report there is a map associated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the point about this members are I don 't want people to think that if you 're not something to be plated more than twice we 've forgotten you that 's far from the case the most vulnerable are the ones that are flooding more than once but we do know you 've got good information about those at a flood advanced and we are looking very closely at those homes as well so edit that informations is contained in their graphic a lot of things we can do at an individual property level so that property the project brief was very clear what can you do as a temporary temporary or permanent measure at an individual section level and there 's a number of things we can do there from raising their houses on piles to keep them above the water we can wrap houses with an impermeable membrane also in the port that 's called tanking we can regrade somebody a bit of positive drainage away from the homes send begging and also relocation those blue boxes they 're all about the things that we can do in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've identified opportunities to look at the way we maintain some of these areas maintain them better particularly before this before storm but also after a storm and on the green icons they 're all the things that we can look at in local areas and they are elaborated on war and the technical report I will just talk about a couple of those one of which is dredging you know dredging there is an opportunity to revisit the notion and the concept of dredging we looked at that very closely over the last eight days it is not going to come a toolbox as a as a temporary measure in terms of something you do in the next three to six months I would anticipate that that is something that we 're going to want to take a long hard look at there 's about 130 thousand cubic meters of salt accumulated in that river in order to remove that that 's quite a significant amount of money this isn 't probably a council that 's looking for more you know needs to look very carefully at how we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of managing it river but also increase stop banks and increase pump stations so there 's a lot to look at in the dredging space it 's not a temporary get in there quickly into it exercise we 're also looking at temporary bridges and we know that in particularly in the lower Avon a lard ugly we 've got a number of bridges which actors restraints within a waterway over the last eight days we 've done a lot of work not just and not just in deadly but also the lower heathkit terms of G ting out all our outfalls making sure things are working making sure the channel is I 'm unobstructed in particularly in davie Creek we 've been looking at the issue of temporary bridges and the constrictions that they caused as well as vegetation tree stumps people 's plantings and what have you we 're aggressively going into those areas looking at removing those constrictions the point of making be a debtor 's we 're chasing millimeters here to reduce your pencil flooding that may mean that we will as a network operator have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what 's happening on the channel and that temporary bridges project which we 've identified in the report is something that we need to look at very very carefully as a way of in place but it 's one of those things that we need a bit more time to look it but there is an opportunity of the m22 there 's graphics explaining what some of these temperatures look like so that 's a graphic of of house raising and Sam banging at the front also impermeable barriers at the front near with a small blue pump on the inside of the fence getting the water on the outside that would also involve check valves to stop the wastewater network can happen to their houses similarly there 's Ock 's in the report there 's explanations around how you manage setbacks that 's a graphic that explains wrapping you see that blue membrane around the house set that 's an impermeable membrane that gets painted to the same color of the original house this is technology that 's been deployed overseas in the northern hemisphere and we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sure that the concept works and the local context but also that it 's socially acceptable to to the community who would be staying in once more flood defences this is just another graphic it explains it is prepping opportunities funding opportunities local area schemes in terms of raising stop banks so there 's an opportunity and I think that 's something we 're looking at in the lower heathkit as a temporary measure that we could get in there and do quickly they will require topping up stop banks will require temporary pump stations yeah that 's all aligned on the report also other local area pumping schemes we 're very close to understanding the benefits of be healing part of the deadly creek flopped and basin catchment so around taste street no and that would at that indicates significant benefit from reducing the kind of storm we got last June to the kind of storm that you might might have gotten August 2012 so that 's a significant amount of homes it could be predicted by a temporary pumping scheme it 's expensive you need to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed and the benefit but that 's definitely opportunity to look at and something that could be done relatively quickly I mean within the next three months to see the full benefits of a scheme like that,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Reports,WhI3oswfdjM,20140508,618.54,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1663,um filme and in yani just brief your finger on emotes the same thing I just think was insufficient time for us to toe really goes to consider this sensibly it came just yesterday I 'm not I 'm not criticizing staff I 'm just saying it seems to me this should be an blade it 's 26 we 're dealing not here yeah yes I just support that yeah it 's not actually just for us as well it 's actually for people in the community and actually what we heard was that the local community board hadn 't even been praised of that report at all so I think we need to recognize that as people in the community that have an interest in this matter they would have had no chance to make their views known consider the information and provide feedback so I think it 's really we should not accept it as a supplementary and give some more consideration to enabling others and ourselves to consider it in terms of timing could it could I ask a question sorry I 'm HD can 't ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this pointer of supplementary it seems to be really happening now that on the eve of a meeting or the day of a meeting or receiving a supplementary report and unless there 's some absolute urgency for it I would rather say we can 't accept supplementary within a couple of days of a meeting but to get things basically on the day of a meeting is really not they 're great no yeah it 's it 's I mean it was asked for very late so the question I wanted to ask is that is it time sensitive so madam chair we believe it is the this would commit her counsel and Sierra staff to commits consultation with the community and with the keyboard over the details of the agreed first phase program so until such time as the first phase program is agreed between counsel and sarah ccd you are we as officers would not be in a position to commence consultation over the details of those of individual seems I think the concern that was raised though earlier was the the chair of the community board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community board itself hasn 't even heard about this and they discussed at one of their community board meetings that was in the report today the fact that skirt was starting on a process around salisbury street and here was a what and what they were saying was that they didn 't want the community disrupted twice once with the skirt work underground and then then the subsequent work that needs to be done and even though a sum of money can be made available you know for the you know for the project it just it just worried me a little bit you know in terms of timing would two weeks make all the difference in the world i know i think it 's just the thought process of mechanism when a year we had a cost share agreement with a first phase projects listed between the crime and the council this report was actually just requesting that those first paid projects be changed a little in order to ensure that we we actually deliver the projects that support the bus interchange so there wasn 't a process around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one that when the council and the crowd have agreed the first phase projects we then go out to the community and talk to them yeah but in the first phase projects you know I mean we 're getting into a debate about the issue but when when the council agreed the first phase projects with was central government that included salisbury street no no no sorry will have included including potentially to weigh and kill to add killed not but it didn 't did not feel so gentle okay but but it lines up with another issue which is this question of whether we really want communities disrupted twice I 'm just wondering is there special or extraordinary council meeting on monday the twelfth could we include it at that meat is so much on the agenda of the twelfth meeting ah i guess we could if you don 't want any extra information i don 't but if we need extra it would just be time to read it that 's all I mean I personally would have preferred between a sick I would have preferred the twenty-second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the community board and had a discussion with them I mean it 's it 's probably not going to change anything it 's just that it 's it 's it 's just a question of process you know that that 's all but a Yanni so so really I mean there is a kind of issue here with the whole I think we 're adding 12.5 million dollars to our budget and so we 're actually adding 12.5 million dollars of new projects next week we 're hearing from our community about how we should spend our money and you 've got community at a community board that said no chance to consider it so it does seem kind of rather bizarre that we can just make these big decisions without that opportunity for the public or the community to have input so you know if it 's not going to be deferred foot until the 22nd then let 's do it on monday 12th of that meeting but it does raise a question to me about how we 're spending money in in terms of the central city and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new information that just came out yesterday around the scale of the financial problem that we have and we 're actually you know spending more money without a chance to reflect on whether that investment that spenders is right I 've previously asked for information around what 's happening around the high streets upper lips field and also the avon river precinct plans I haven 't even had that information from from staff don 't slide tray canto I 'm sorry I 'm just going to order because we can 't side trick on to these other issues all this paper does is transfer the timing of the different phases that work within a face so I mean yeah but what it does verification from staff is this an extra 12 and there 's no as mastram uh d I recommend it in this report madam chair just specifically and not recommended increase to the budget of the fair sized program it sits within the agreed 72 million dollar that 's not important I mean work I think we all know but we 're going to have to either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know i want to ask a different question which is probably no no but we 're not debating the pay but we 're not asking questions about the paper we 're asking whether the report should be received and considered at the meeting today so we 're not on to the subject so if we want to deal with it today then people will vote for it vote YES that the item be received and considered and if they don 't want if they don 't want to deal with that then I 'm sure that somebody will move a resolution that it be deferred until next week or two the 22nd am a well if somebody wants to move that as an amendment then at least we can we can move on which one the 12 may okay does anyone sick of it okay Jimmy chin seconded can I ask and it is actually the point I was trying to make is that councillors have asked for information relevant to this report that we still have not been provided with can I ask on the twelfth of May can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timing of other the open River Avon River precinct design plan and what 's happening in high street south of Litchfield because these are the purpose of this paper I 'm sorry but the purpose of the paper is to enable all of the excess ways to the bus interchange to a clear that requires some of the timing of the pre of the work to be altered between phase 1 to phase 2 or year ones what are the bus interchange it 's also about the open River precinct you know okay no a bull but the thing is is that I 'm not I 'm not ruling that that information is relevant to the decision that we make on Monday if we decide to I mean if we deal with it today we deal with it today if we deal with it next Monday but perhaps I 'll just put the resolution and see how the council 's feeling and so I put the amendment that it that the report be considered on that well it 's the amendment is to change the eighth of mater the to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the amendment the amendment is to change the eighth of mate of a 12th of may so i 'll put the amendment all those in favor of the amendment say aye those opposed say no that 's carried

Part 4,gOQU8TelhpU,20140508,968.61,"Christchurch, New Zealand",2261,too and these are my reasons it with regard to cost the costs are unknown and all three options land is problematic throughout the whole city this site offers the greatest or the highest yield in terms of actual numbers of people and we have received a good kicking in the past from ministers for not getting on with and hazard people with relation to noise attenuation both the natural and built form we know now that there is ability to provide for this I think of Martians wrote in the relatively new fairway park subdivision where we rented before our permanent shift that has a good kind of green noise attenuation there so that when you 're living right next to a main arterial road the noise is substantially reduced we also know a lot of us the other day sitting in the skirt building how good the glass was there to keep out the noise from the southern motorway and that you know double glazing any kind of attenuation technology exists and in residences as well the lip criteria provides for that lack of sameness which has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past and given rise to those descriptions of ghettos which none of us want if you look at a housing New Zealand house actually it was relocated corner of Coos NY nourn erode you 're not able to tell from other houses surrounding it that it 's a you know that it 's a social housing for instance and I 'm confident under the lib that more that greater subtlety is provided for there was one email which I received about noise attenuation from someone I don 't know who they are I don 't know what qualifications they have are they rather though concerned at the noise they quote data but they don 't actually provide the data I can 't make a decision without any actual meaty data over noise and that respect so I still support this in I hope it goes ahead our pool i voted against this last time and I 'll just repeat the reasons i voted against it land is an issue we want speed around a project if we get in there we find the land is unsuitable then we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I voted against us here and we all want to see warm dry houses for people and that 's what the example of projects all about in fact I think that 's just what our building practice should be from here on rather than be an example this should has been at normal and we want to see the speed we don 't want to be held up by issues around land quality noise pollution I just don 't think it 's a very good area for and she building high density and the inner city so obvi budding yesterday you Tim thank you i voted for it last time but i have changed my mind the reason for it is we talked about numbers of units on the site we 've talked about sound mitigation as soon as you walk out of those buildings you are the distance of a small garden in the footpath away from probably one of the busiest four-lane highways in this city certainly one of the main truck routes I just do not we talked about future kiddos and quality of life I don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we 're wanting to attach to an exemplar program so I will be voting against us and I strongly recommend my colleagues to Yanni thank you um I think it 's really important that in this debate we focus on what we can do as a council I think part of the problem has been that we 've got the land use recovery plan we 've got a whole bunch of stuff that we feel like we 're under pressure to do that we have to do but actually i think the exemplar project should be able to be really open around getting the best possible use of this land to achieve the issue of housing but also to look at some development in a local community and if you think about the previous exemplars that we 've endorsed think of middle ends that 's actually a shopping more it 's a residential neighborhood it 's got community facilities it 's got commercial retail business housing so there 's no reason why we should feel constrained I think because of the loop to not actually look at the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it but it doesn 't exclude us in my view from doing any of the up considering any of those other options that that that are possible and so from my point of view I support this because I want us to get on and start doing some planning around the future of this major site just leaving it there with nothing happening in my view is not not what I want it 's not a solution and all the debates about the numbers of houses around the design around the noise around the dust around the land anything outside that can be taken into account as this progresses so don 't constrain ourselves now by thinking we 've got a very tight definition of an exemplar and we can 't do anything out of the box actually the whole purpose of an exemplar was to look at out-of-the-box development to look at creative solutions to the problems that we have so I 'm really supportive of doing this I do think that you know we 're spending so much time having these debates an issue what we need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sooner we get to a phase where we can start doing the work the better in my view and it doesn 't preclude us from looking at the other sites that have been identified that are in areas for development mechanism so they actually have a step up anyway this site doesn 't have any special planning provisions at the moment so the point of having it as an exemplar is that you could put special pleading provisions around it if when the works done that that is the best opportunity there are many people that live along railway corridors highways major arterials in our city and there 's some very nice development alongside those that do mitigate the effects I have I do appreciate the email that we got from Bruce Alexander I know he is really well qualified and in terms of many of the things that he raised with us but I have confidence with a new development we can address those concerns then I would like to say a few words on it myself and I 've got mr. Alexander 's email here because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my concern because I don 't remember the report having a detailed analysis of both noise and traffic emotions and the point that he makes is that he draws attention to a recognized philosophy that it is bad town planning practice to place residential units on busy intersections and close to high-density traffic volume roads and motorways with the residents are polluted by traffic fumes and noise noise pollution from traffickers now universally recognized as a world health hazard I know you can protect against that inside the house of course you can you can 't protect it outside the house apart from the kind of sound barriers that that are constructed using trees Hills those sorts of things fences of particular natures but that 's not creating a community I mean in terms of creating a community environment I actually think that we can do better than brown street I thought that then I thought but my main reason for not supporting it last time was because of the challenge that the land face so we could go down right down the track and then find out that because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues involved that we 're going to put up the price per unit exponentially and not have any mechanism for going back and reviewing what the particular exemplar project would be which is why in many respects I 'd rather choose another exemplary but continue to work on this site for other purposes and because I mean there are challenges until we get the result to the resolution which enables us to bring in other partners and to the rebuild process which is something that we absolutely need to do the point that he made about noise level readings were was it was from a report that identified that the noise level readings in 1979 they already exceeded World Health Organization 's in 1979 so I wonder what their position is now so I don 't think that we have a current measure of them and I would like to know what they are but it 's the emissions that probably worried me more than the noise because you cannot protect against that again inside yes outside know and we know that the damage that is done to people 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residential and a site that actually has so many compromises of something that I I strongly feel that cannot beat the exemplars status that we 're trying to achieve I also feel that there is another option that we could look at for the site which might give us an even better site for which we can develop brand new housing on a on a whole site that would be dedicated to creating a real exemplar and in an excellent community so that being the case I will put the motion all those in favor of the motion say aye those opposed say no so now we 'll have a vote we 're up for having a yummy vote I didn 't realize the last time that we had a vote that the machines don 't operate for committee meetings they 're only I only okay so we 've got hey I don 't know where David is he coming back hey you know that you can vote are you not showing up as okay so can we can we reset it can we reset up please David no are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the no no because if you are think we have to reset the machine yeah reset the machine so what we 're voting on now as the the projects at Andrews crescent and brawn village and Phil Clearwater and I have moved to will foreshadowed a motion to be passed afterwards if this is lost but if this is carried then our foreshadowed motion comes off the table yeah so do it you want to flick up flick up flick up the shown the other resolution which is that the report be referred to the May twenty second meeting with additional information provided on the broom street site and the previous options and egg she also requires some wording I thought was going to be added in there about reversing the previous decision well not reversing up that over tuning rescinding the previous decision yeah so so can we go back to the resolution ok so at vote yes or no or abstain whatever so that the motion is lost and we will now move to be to the foreshadowed motion and we need that the previous resolution beer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the no no no put that right up the front that the previous resolution relating to this matter relating to the selection of the brine street site should we be specific relating to the Bron Bron village it 's called as not I just say I just wonder if we need that because in fact people may are now support in fact obtain more information they may not want to support the but we have to rescind the resolution an order to because we 've got a resolution of council so empty oh so we can do it at the next meeting ok alright so we don 't need to resend the resolution and thus motion no ok right thinking I 've got told that I with it 's what I was supposed to do so so that the previous resolution the rooms it okay so yeah so that the report be referred to the twenty-second of May meeting with additional information provided on the brown street site and the previous options well no it doesn 't matter because it will have to include that if we 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient isn 't it okay all right I shall put the motion all those in favor well actually you press the button will do it this way if you 're in favor of the poor shadowed motion but yes otherwise vote no right okay so that 's been carried and so now we will move on thank you very much what,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"
NZ,NZ,Christchurch City Council,Christchurch City Council,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZETwErnCvvgbvBbnnHfyxA,08.05.14 - Item 17 - Report of the Chairperson of the Earthquake Recovery Committee - Part 3,JD1flcE4PFM,20140508,1981.86,"Christchurch, New Zealand",4818,awesome now we 've got the land use recovery plan that 's again the committee of the whole and it 's the exemplar housing projects now I 'm not sure whether we 've got to a point where where people want to I think people does anyone want to move the recommendation that 's in front of us because I know that colleagues want to move amendments so you 'll move it pauline kata moving anyone want to second the motion as it stands Glenn Livingston so let 's open it up for questions I know that Phil Clearwater has an amendment that he 'd like to move I wonder whether you want to put the amendment on the table before we have questions yep the previous matter that we actually got the through report yes we don 't I just did it in the wrong order yeah we adopted the report before we voted on the recommendation that was the key part of the report that was my fault Phil did you want to put that on the table now look I do and it 's it 's basically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is written in this report and look at the possibility of land swap in the future that 's something perhaps so that we should discuss and public excluding crime but but basically I think there is pissed and there is potential to look at this whole exemplar process differently and that we shouldn 't be okay there is a timeline for us it may be though that instead it and can cheat with staff the day you date for there but it may be that we can still support some of the options that have been presented to us previously in previous records as part of the exemplar a end though with for example the sites like braun village in fact we look at the possibility of that being part of a land swap arrangement you 're bad but about that let me just ask what is the deadline date for nominating the two sites for the exemplar projects jurina six well fine just read from the live madam chair is his decision on whether the proposal is approved as an exemplar within six months of gazeta the recovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ December so there for six months falls on the sixth of June so a month a month away basically less than a month so can I ask that you your staff the into it would f in fact a land swap is a possible a distinct possibility which we 'd have to discuss later can some of the previous options like for example I think it 's cold straight but certainly kiri place could they be considered today or should we consider the middle a today the loop action talks about to cancel social housing easy class and clearly with the time frame on the action ideally we 'd have a decision about which two will be the council social housing exemplars in time for that time frame to be meat or does it well I mean it 's what i 'm hearing because i wasn 't sure of the deadline date and I wonder whether we could refer the this paper or let it lie on the table with what you do or whatever or refer it to the the June is quite recovery committee of the whole which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notify for a final decision on the on the exemplar project that the reason is is that there 's been correspondence that 's come on which has indicated noise and and vehicle emissions is a problematic with that site and although we can certainly address both of those issues in terms of the structure of the buildings you can 't for the amenity outside so I think that we need to we need to have a little bit more of a think about about the site and whether there are other options whether we could do some land swap as the counselor suggested and which which may mean that will choose one of the other sites as the exemplar project so that we can at least comply with our obligation to get the two sites notified by the sixth of June if you see what I mean so that that 's what we 're exploring at the moment so it 's probably helpful for me just to explain the process to get here so the Housing Committee you might recall identified in selected the two the two exemplars in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then subsequently Council and you end assessing those two sites against the exemplar criteria so this the earthquake recovery committee of the whole was not asked to necessarily select the site it was asked to I guess acknowledge one of the resolutions to endorse the projects and note that there are further reports to come to provide information in assists that I guess the missing components from the exemplar processes from the housing committee decision for this now there I know that sounds complicated but that 's how we had to manage it in terms of the Housing Committee making the recommendation end in the exemplar assessment so that so but we chose to and there 's one of them that some of us are having second thoughts about that 's right but is is his in perhaps the earthquake recovery committee has the delegated authority to change one of those sites yes I 'm just questioning what the process would be no no that 's what I 'm asking because will that be sufficient time for the notification because I mean a number of us one are concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we didn 't have factored done to our original decision and the second is the is the question of other options that might arise from an alternative use of the site itself so the housing I guess to follow the process that has occurred already the housing policy would need to make a recommendation around an alternative know that this wing to the Canterbury thus went to the earthquake recovery committee of the whole that 's right and we chose the two sites yes we had another option on the table and we chose two of them that we had a very close vote on it you know in a debate for an hour and a half i deciphered verification my clear recollection is that the Housing Committee weren 't able to make a decision let 's right into the commander and we really make a decision Thank You counseling which some of us will actually I made the right decision then but I voted against Brown Street but the there are people who think that we should proceed with brown street there are people who now think that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we deal with that and the time frame that we 've got because it may well be that it would be better to endorse the other site correct as the exemplar but it 's not here in the paper which is why I 'm trying to find a way of resolving or should we just refer it to the next council meeting finney 's next I think makes council meetings on the twenty-second took no no not the next one the one the the non extraordinary one the next ordinary council meeting the 22nd of May yep because i 'm not sure if you refer it to the earthquake recovery committee it 's too late it 's too late yep okay so how do we we can we can we just we need to move a resolution to let it lie on the table or do we just agree to if you want to amend in the earlier decision which you 've already made about choosing the second yep then they 'll need to be a rescinding or an amending report on the twenty-second mainly okay so but that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a decision of the earthquake recovery committee of the whole we hit yeah it 's here now and we haven 't made a decision so we can reverse it so it does actually mean that the paper the paper needs to well okay so what we need to do is we need to say that that we that we want the paper to come back to Council on the twenty-second of may with all of the original options included within the paper so we want to go back to where we were with the that when it came to the earthquake recovery committee of the whole so we want that back on the tables and we also want to deal with noise and their core emotions that 's your view me if it 's not mine no no what okay I mean we have a motion on the table so so perhaps I 'll foreshadow emotion or end councillor Clearwater yep no I 'll second I 'll second to you so will foreshadow emotion which is that the report the report on this so help me with some wedding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting with additional information provided on the Brian streets I end with the end with the other options included and the report yep I 'm just um thinking about the needing to have a um an assessment around the site and then an assessment around the exemplar so I think that there may be it may be one report but they may have to be two components to it in John may need to may need to do an assessment from an exemplar perspective on all of the sites so that you can make that decision on the twenty-second of May yep yeah and we 've selected yeah skip or suggestion please yeah I 've just foreshadowed emotion so we will now deal with your motion okay if i may just ask a process because it seems to me this actually it wouldn 't be an amendment no it 's not an amendment sorry it 's a foreshadowed motion okay and it 's moved by Councillor clearwater seconded by me sorry perhaps you can help us out on the sequence of events it doesnt sit I mean it seems as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side it was my recollection because it came from the Housing Committee to counsel as I have to say is no Rican so why is it quick recovery committee of the whole report because this please two is two from Council has two hats and this and the some process winners council as social housing provider and then the other is council as loop action decision maker end and an enabler so the first process was around the site in came through the Housing Committee end the decision before you today is the second head around loop action decision maker and enabler okay so so the debate that I 'm thinking back to was a debate that occurred at council okay so so that means that the foreshadowed motion will also have to deal with with sun during the previous decision but but but that 's okay we 'll deal with that when we get to it so let 's go back up and deal with the original motion and we 've got that move by Councillor kaatre account to Livingston there any questions of staff on there Yanni I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're getting it really confused about what exemplar projects are or aren 't and so my understanding and I just let staff to comment if this is the correct interpretation or not is that an exemplar project can be quite wide ranging there 's a wide range of things that we could do so it 's not just about putting back social housing which social housing currently is it 's actually about looking at what is the mixed-use opportunities what is looking at sustainable design Environmental Design best practice urban design I presume that that would include things like mitigating noise direction or orientation of development possibly looking at some community space etc etc so i think i just want to kind of understand if we approve brown village as an exemplar are we just putting that social housing which social housing is or are we open to doing creative things with the land that these think Bob will enable us to do to some degree I mean the criteria I set out be a high quality safe accessible well-built yes section 6 and 2.4 sets out thus the seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your hits an hour all I would judge within those seven criteria in bed for example we concerns that people have had as we 're putting too much social housing into this area along brownstone and and so if it came back could it say well actually you would only use this much land for housing and you might do this much for some sort of community facility or I don 't know retail or commercial I mean as that sort of does it have the work to be able to kind of make those sorts of course and not probably not the comments that you made around facilities in retail or other activities no the one in the one component that we have is in relation to to innovation within the housing market in thinking about that kind of mixed-use or that mixed tenure just to confirm mg that and the loop it under the loop exemplar talks about this being to promote affordable housing so that 's the overall philosophy of what this is trying to achieve if the if there was a proposal put to council that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for for land and on the other side of town well on the others on Billy Avenue for example just plucking up straight out of the year would there I mean could it be possible to undertake the development and in that area an area that doesn 't have a lot of our social housing and in fact quite close to where we 've just lost some community housing actually social housing and you know I mean would it be possible to think of an opportunity like that as as being you know potentially preferential to developing the site for house and given some of the constraints without our specifics that 's quite a difficult question to ask to answer but assuming that the site to meet the Krait to meet the criteria then that to some degree that decision in choice is yours hmm given that we have to create two exemplars in the loop do we absolutely have to name where the second one is yes because it makes it very had to undertake the assessment and end in terms of the action report and indicate that progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieving those criteria it just as a minor problem don 't we have an issue in that our social housing land at the moment is listed as a strategic asset which without public consultation we can 't do any development that involves the private sector owning some of that land so prior to us going out to consultation on that issue which we will hopefully start after next Monday we can 't actually with what 's left in the housing account knowing what 's currently there do any of these things anyway though in a slightly economically theoretical without that having been passed by the public in wind John has undertaken the assessment he 's noted that there are some areas where there isn 't sufficient information to make a full assessment and that that diversity in affordability you 'll note further information on design and competition further information on makes of affordability so he 's acknowledged that there is insufficient information to make that assessment as firmly as required which is why he 's noted the second recommendation it through the reports are needed any more questions yep Powell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really saying before that if Brown Street was an exemplar project that in fact a land swap could be part of their or you 're not no I wasn 't okay I wasn 't saying it what I was saying I 'm just a little bit to make the assessment two sites are needed what what what I 'm concerned about is in this recommendation rum and I don 't think I 'm counselors with any problem with Andrews quiz and being an exemplar project but with brown village a strong candidate for example of status when the original report which the housing committee received covered issues like poor ground conditions time delay cost implications and we haven 't got a TI no we haven 't got any for Android screws and either also the the high density already a representation of Social and affordable housing and on one Street and the adverse effects on the state highway and and the pollution the air pollution and noise pollution had been referred to so can you sort of help me understand how in fact given those disadvantages how in fact it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council made the decision on on the site in this assessment has been made on the basis of applying the exemplar criteria to to brown street but acknowledging that there is still through the information required to make a full assessment this report is not a full assessment and but on on the criteria that John has been able to assess he has identified vetted as a strong candidate in if I recall back to the Housing Committee debate because I I was there for that debate you the Housing Committee was um was pretty evenly divided tied really on what actually was the best second exemplar Apple don 't do it oh if my my ads work of one of the we 're looking at both the outcome at the end of the exempt I 'll process what the actual product is that that this is available for future tenants or owners or what have you but one on one of the aims of the exemplars is innovation and then includes technical innovation and may look at new designs and techniques to overcome some of the technical issues that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development who would pay for that do we know well that would be part of the the process of developing the design for the site were able a potential builder or partner thanks John yes though fun night yep I 'm sorry so Andrews present which I think we 've all much greater Ponder 's doesn 't sink mean just in hope that one currently has 36 feet set units how many others proposing to intensified it go I up to how many just rough ballpark I don 't enjoy prison doesn 't quite orders and is Crescent yes it will depend on the final design but it 's um over 100 new residential units attention right and the proposed funding of there so that 's within the social housing and I 'm afraid we don 't have any of our social health and colleagues here so you 're asking us Christians that come right lease it for granted that partners are coming back with funding options it 's part of the whole love I referring course ok so my through the question is does that same process apply to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come back with proposals which will include funding of the project again we we 're not close enough to those projects we 're not there are the project leaders or the drivers of those one assumes that we are following consistent process but i would like to say that that is the firm answer on it well we want to come back to you it doesn 't if it comes up quite often the prompt fellow councillors that the council will be bearing the cost of the bryan development and we can 't afford it but whereas I and you can help me clean arms of the beliefs that we won 't be paying for this that we 've had partners that we 're putting it out for request for proposals well with the different options and whether that involves us what I mean okay very nice of you to have a little chat amongst yourselves I 'm sorry for yourself I sorry I don 't make sure you just because the stuff unable to clarify that and I think it 's quite a key point here because the funding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I went for the point of this been made though is in order to engage you know sort of wider partners and anything that might include the land that 's has got an issue but anyway I 'm Glenn thank you if I could just ask a question about one of the criteria with the loop over these exempt our projects is diversity and what I want to ask is that a question that kind of reflects a bit of a concern on picking up which i think is over the previous built form a kind of typology of social housing we 've had in the city and throughout well any part of the world actually that that really serves to stand out and it becomes kind of characterized by the local community so my understanding you know you can correct me if I 'm wrong is that this kind of serves to introduce a more subtle approach which reflects a change in thinking we 're actually you cannot necessarily tell or differentiate between those who are socially housing tenants or otherwise in any given neighborhood whether it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diversity says it 's a listening you know it 's more heterogeneous Peter Roger and I OT rather than the whole sort of sameness that is no matter use bleeds like that I 'm just out of order just say sameness but I know are you doing a very good job so so perhaps it was just at this point just to outline the steps for the two exemplars beyond beyond this one of those steps involves the design being critiqued and analyzed by the urban design panel or one of those steps is again at the same process but for the ER partners and finally also the country stained loans working party as well I think you 're your particular point probably sits with the urban design panel to thoroughly assess that particular aspect and that is one of the matters which they would consider in their analysis of the schemes and I fell and then Vicky and look this is part of a possible future process for example if Evan and the future the council does look at a land swap we need to do a whole consultation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in fact council make land exchanges with other property owners as part of the consultation just wanting to make sure we get that part right yes yep can I just raise it on that sorry I want to you can start that could be part of the consultation all right I will I will say potentially i feel like i 've only got part of the information so you 're juggling to actually give you really sound advice ya know and we wouldn 't expect you to advise on that but but the point is is that i think that there is a consultation due to commence a certain paper goes through next week and if that occurs then I think the census is that it could actually include reference tool and swapping as part of the that the whole proceeds and lent being used in public-private partnerships as well can I just raise a really basic point about these exemplars if you assume a hundred extra houses or hundred houses I think it 130 at Andrews Chris and actually was it up to okay let 's assume 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build cost of 250 thousand per unit I 'm just making that figure up but it was similar to some of the ones that were mentioned in the housing report we 're looking at around 25 minute if we 're looking at say 200 on the brown street site we 're looking at say 50 million we actually don 't have their money housing budget so that creates a serious problem in terms of committing to something that other parties may see as a total commitment ahead of a public consultation process which allows us to do this by way of public-private partnership so it 's not our money that 's building those houses simply because we don 't have that money in the housing reserve fund commit to something that as yet we don 't have public approval to do I don 't know that that 's part of the brief that that council staff got here at the sonoma are really nicely designed for i think that the issue is is that we have an obligation to go back to to actually provide advice as to to exempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the decision that was already made others want to review the brown village so let 's just deal with it on that light and did you have another question okay well it 's just open the resolution up for debate felt well i think through the questions i 've made the points that I want to make but look I just want to see the best outcome that we can get for both social and affordable housing and and it has to work it has to be and it also has to be affordable I think we should take that factor and the and the other factors into account and so it just seems to me that two to go wider and yeah we need to go wider and so I 'm actually not going to support the current recommendations calling thank you look I know it 's contentious but an actual fact it 's not a bad location in my view and it 's challenged that we do mitigate the floor was good that we can create a buffer zone all sorts of things we can do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says the site is zoned residential allows for medium high density development and of examples an area you 're no constraints on the development it 's close to a pocket park it 's 550 meters from Sydney impart wealth and park colombo street shops there are bus routes along there 's a school close by here 's a lot of advantages was so close to politic you can walk into town so I would like to see this progress because mainly the time factor we 've got it here and now we have a housing crisis this is a big site we can get a lot of dwellings on here and if as a result of the consultation we may be able to partner still within their site it has options once we get that consultation through so i 'm still in support of this because it means we can get cracking and i think we do have a housing crisis we have to do something and because of the size of the site we have an opportunity to get some roofs over people 's heads in some good ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a challenge and an opportunity so I 'll be supporting it Glenn and then Paul Thank You Austin,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Part 2,-CaeeEouEQY,20140508,1814.93,"Christchurch, New Zealand",4517,for and I find you exactly what it was I 'd move it myself but ok now dis given given that the cheer didn 't didn 't support the resolution would some of the other members of the regulation and consents committee like to move and second the motion lean lovingston mu seconded by up a lee jones so so i 'll open it up for questions and perhaps if i could start i was a little concerned at the view that this doesn 't move some of the well I was a bit surprised to see a reference to the intensification of gaming machines sites in the eddington area is relating to the eddington raceway because the eddington raceway is a place where gambling takes place as a matter of course but only when it 's being used as a Raceway that 's not there not available generally at the site people don 't go there so to use the you know the other hotels and that and the eddington area I would have thought that this was a great opportunity to move nine machines out of the shirley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved them to an area where gambling only takes place a few times a year this is vivian and my understanding has sets the new facility that the New Zealand Racing Board are going to sit up will actually be open every day it won 't just be open when Raceway as open pattern and and the triggers did but people I mean it 's a destination it 's not I mean to compare it to the all the hotels down lincoln road that have gaming machines to me that doesn 't that doesn 't feel like it 's an intensification that area it actually is a gambling location I 'm a nun well I had missed the point that it was going to be open every day but I still don 't think that it it really is relevant that there are other machines and lincoln road that this is not part of the Lincoln Road environment it 's in proximity but it 's not close and what what did come out of the regulation and consents committee meeting was this and what and this was from the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machines are getting ready to jet pop people do go from you mr. premise that I appreciate that this one maybe but will remove from some of the other premises is those locations surely but that did come up is a comment marriage for moving the machines okay um le Glenn Dave um notwithstanding what are the mirrors were strict about could you also just explain the issue the guards or the issue around the council policy the sinking lid policy which not only relates to the number of machines but also talks about the number of venues as far as whether it 's reduced in the X it 's my understanding was that it was open you know more often to order than the knees did you think but the increase in the number of locations is as important sorry I 'm answer your own question sorry could you please explain it and so the policy currently provides this the council will not grants consent under section 98 of gambling it to allow any increase in class for gaming the news or class for machine numbers except in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a net circumstance what so at least two SB it 's one is the number of machines and one is the number of venues and it did come out of the heat of the committee meeting that he was a concern that it 's not just the number of machines it is the number of venues because of the availability of venues not just a number of machines roaming surely has got O 'Shea sure ETA b stock exchange there are 18 machines at the surely ta be a part of a high intensity gaming strip I mean it does seem to me that that 's more problematic than to have machines eddington raceway anyway Glenn Dave I voted against this resolution for a number of reasons sorry just a quiet point of order again I ask this last time is this question or debate I just need clarification because I don 't know we debate if it becomes questioning I don 't know it 's a question what 's business it 's question time okay well I suppose I 'm gonna be more debate in the issue then right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple terms they want to take a venue where they 've got 18 machines split and toe and move nine to the to the raceway so if if we were of a mind to grant consent on what basis could we we say to any other operator you can 't split your machines down the middle take three and put them at a cafe in another neighborhood is there any risk around a precedent that this would create and I 'm just trying to understand given that we have had previous requests what this would do to our existing policy if we were ever mind to grant it I think any decision that you decide to make that is contrary to the existing policy has the potential to dilute that policy subsequently and that 's obviously a matter that you would have to take into account when you were making a decision I guess I was going to understand that effort got challenged I from a legal point of view and you know say another group came up and see what we want to move nine from here back into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we in a weaker position to say no if we 've approved this today well I mean every decision to grant consent that is inconsistent with the policy is you know its case by case decision but in at the moment when you look there you 've got you 've granted consent in two cases and then took it in the most recent case two recent cases you haven 't granted consent so I mean the answer that question is yes and no you know people will argue that he studied if you do grant can see people will argue that it does create a precedent the policy doesn 't actually make provision there 's no nothing in the policy that actually refers specifically to this sort of application the policy it 's policy is silent on moving machines but the policy does you know doesn 't permit any increase in the number of venues or machines the policy will be up for review next year because it has to be reviewed every three years and you will need to take a new provision in the gambling act into account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't refuge that in this report because it doesn 't cover the situation here at all but you will need to take that into account next year but so what but you keep referring to this as a new venue even though on that site there are preexisting machines neither snow is no gambling machines at Eddington Raceway there 's no gaming machines no I gave up their license some time ago so they used to have machines they didn 't whatever reason renew that as I understand it is that true yes my I 'm sitting was the Metropolitan trotting Club it eddington raceway does have a number of machines here and they took them out they did apply it was one of the cases where they did apply to get consent for the machines it 's a paragraph four point three of the report but that consent wasn 't granted so when did the legislation come on between them was it between the two so the gambling act came into force in 2003 they decided not to renew their license because they weren 't operating the machine yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canceled in october two thousand four and 2010 they subsequently approached the council to gain a new territorial authority can seem to locate gaming machines at addington raceway this application was declined but if they had maintained the the machines that they had there in the past they would have had 18 machines at that location that 's right yep just two quick questions it so the only other venue and New Zealand erasing capacity that his gaming machines it 's Alexandra Park and an Auckland so those machines open seven days were those opened or used just on ray stage DNA I 'm not aware of of the days the week that there was a particularly you towards thank you fell um can I just ask you about to clarify the policy from my moat so for my information so in fact along lincoln road by the way the name of the street is let 's check hint and drive to not help them it 's nothing you 're the hilton Henton so um there 's 30 looks like this 46 gaming machines along lincoln road ready in Headington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly sixty four within the you know within this half kilometer radius just--all beyond so is that is there anything any a policy was regard to restricting like the number of gaming some outlets in one area given that in fact the intensification of them is more likely to lead to more more more social problems no there is no density provision in the policy so in fact they could all be in one little gaming area and Eddington and there 's nothing in their policy that precludes it thank you Tim did she know you already here George I 'm Jimmy one question and because of based on current game in policy no sinking policies not allowed to relocate to summit venue I 'm you know the assumption if for today a council you know voila against staff or committee the recommendation is there any other legal liability or not well the only legal risk really is you know judicial review proceedings it but the Council of the council 's decision to grant the consent can I ask a question about why it is that we can 't permanently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go down this path my understanding is is no statutory provision that allows us to take that territorial Authority consent away once it 's been grantors and this that license for that venue is surrendered so so if its surrender then that venue no longer his consent auravie new license so if a new operator took over those that property then they could install 18 gaming machines I could I just make one other clarification met the applicant made at the committee meeting am it relates to paragraph 4.9 the report in they did note on the deed of undertaking that if the number of if they did vacate the premises at the shul ETA be and another operator took over their premises and they increase the number of gaming machines back up to 18 then under the deed of undertaking which has seeped out on the attachments the report the New Zealand racing board would withdraw the nine machines from Eddington so there would be no increase and the number of machines so are you saying that that if we were to grant this consent that we would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point five point one two and three which is we have to identify the inconsistency the reasons for that own consistency and then any intention well I don 't think that it 's some an intention to actually amend the policy but it is to find be yes so your advice is is that it doesn 't and our existing policy does not allow us to make this proposal but that we would have to explain why this decision was unconcerned with our policy that 's right so you need to follow the process and section 80 of the local government it to make a decision that significantly sister and you need to need to address those three meters and 4.5 okay so and would would in terms of the inconsistency it 's increasing venue end numbers but in terms of the numbers the deed of undertaking would be enforceable as between us and the eddington raceway so that they would have to well yes I mean it would be enforceable as any deed of undertaking would be enforceable I 'm not quite sure how we would enforce it but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's agreement I suppose but or nineteen of undertaking has either got a legal status or a happened well are you saying that a deed of understanding would not be legally enforceable as between the council and the eddington Raceway or the Metropolitan Racing Board whatever it 's called it 's between the New Zealand Racing Board yeah how the purpose is to note is that would be enforced it would be yeah sorry term and then alley um we toggle three heroes regards to dating the raceway so what you 're saying that the machines would be open to the public for seven 7 days a week so technically we 're talking about a bar are we and the and the complex that 's actually going to be open rather than the raceway which we kind of so my understanding of them NZ Darby and mr. true when he spoke was that they would be seeking to put those machines in a room which will be forming part of the the triggers flange type area and that they would be accessible to the public on days which didn 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the policy doesn 't address would it be fair to say that the part of the policy that talks about not creating new venues and even moving on creating new venues is one way to control density even though there isn 't a specific component of the policy that refers to density so if you were moving for example in this exact exact ace you are moving them from Shirley into an area where there are already a lot you could be stopped from doing that because you want a new venue and data isn 't allowed for in the policy yes it was around about that skin user I mean the policies quite short so I mean it 's the silent on did stupid it just control yeah right any more questions right so we 've got a mover in a second or so we 'll have the debate now and I 'll take Dave first because I missed him out before thing that sorry in reducing the density of machines in the Shirley area we are talking a strip there of less than 150 meters that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atoms in the area we are talking about putting 9 machines into an area where gaming machines are probably spread over a two or three kilometre stripper of lincoln road so I supported the the the notion the policy at the moment does not provide any reason particularly why we can 't do this we obviously have to make justify our decision under section 94 was a hankie but equally importantly I look at the the issue of community funding in in the city and as a council we are continually reducing our level of support to community groups and our direct funding and whether we like it or not the bulk of funding for community groups does actually come out of out of the gaming machine industry I don 't see this as increasing the number of machines in fact we 're not we are just transferring to their different part of town and in fact I think we are doing the community quite as a service in the Shirley area for reducing the intensification and that very concentrated area as I said I do have quite a concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our community organizations our sports groups which now predominantly funded by the gaming industry so on that respect I 'm not hugely well on torn between two worlds I suppose I have a strong connection with at sight of our community and I recognize the difficulties that a lot of these groups now are facing with funding particularly there 's more and more activities coming on stream and the competition for funding is great so personally I I want to see the availability of funding for these groups not be affected in any material way so I don 't personally have a great support for a sinking lid policy much below what we 've got now so for those reasons I oppose the resolution as it stood and would be quite happy to make an amendment that this proposal be allowed yeah I think I think what we 'll do is we 'll do 6.2 separately and if there I think that through the work would have to be done given the advice that we 've had on section 80 if the council was of a mind to grant the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get a further report so if people are of a mind to to grant the consent then it does actually require another report to come back with how we comply with section 80 that 's my view of it so i would say vote against that if you 're if you want to have the next step of granting the consent Glenn thank you me I urge you all to uphold this policy if there 's one good thing the previous council did it was actually to uphold this it had a very strong position on it the consistency is needed with the policy and policies actual integrity needs to be maintained relocation actually would serve to shift the problem you might hear some arguments about any purported financial benefits to the community through this spreyton Heathcott board deputation and through other research that 's been given we know that the financial multiplier effect of addictive gambling outstrips any financial gain from pokie machines is hard data that will support that on page 70 the proposal to grant the consent which the staff don 't advise would contradict the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be that when it does come time to review the policy that we infect make explicit relocation this would set a precedent people refer to this surely verse Eddington case or whatever I don 't think it would be a wise move so those are my my main points on this why would you do poking me to a poorer community how does that actually advance community building in our city at this time thanks umm Ali thank you I endorse of what what 's she like me please just eat me Thanks that 's a joke this is about creating a new venue actually and the advice we were receiving this is very similar to conversations we had during the committee meeting but the advice we 've received in the estimation from problem gambling and the chair of the local community board made it clear that creating a new venue goes against the thinking that policy the strong sink England policy we also advised that it makes it will make no difference very little if any difference to the Shirley area that with the large number there already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the jackpots and that will continue but if the machines are moved from there we will have another venue we 're sending a bad message by opening another venue this is a way of creating more places for people to gamble and that 's not what the sinking lid policy is all about and I 'm all for revisiting policy if there 's a reason to revisit policy there 's no point in enforcing up to the sake of I 'm forcing it but the time to look at this is coming and it 's coming soon so I strongly urge you to endorse the committee decision and vote that way and let 's wait to have the bigger discussion around this when the time is right soon Jamie um I 'll king the short and sharp like i endeavor to be look ultimately i I don 't buy the community don 't buy the community good argument look at the end of the day it 's robbing Peter to pay Peter secondly around this we have a signal that policy I endorsed the sinking that policy so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sinking that policy pretty simple Greek that shortened chatter um Paul I actually hear what debut same with regard to community running but you know I 've sporting events because obviously a lot of these these funders they should do support sports events but I liken it to the tobacco industry I like it to the liquor industry that have now been banned from sponsoring sports events they you know you 're supporting something that actually has a massive issue in our community and I struggled to actually go against some of the things that actually you restrict us from doing it and like just to move from one lock one side of town to the other I think it 's a real problem so I won 't be supporting us here today and I think we need to send a clear message with us you 're not going to tolerate we 're going to do what we see and do and have the sinking lid and Lisa single it Jonnie thank you I just want to make several points to this as well without preparing everything that 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that actually what we know is that this is a redistribution of money it comes in from the poorest people in our society and generally ends up with those who are the most affluent so those who can least afford it generally pay more for those that actually could afford it and that has been proven through the research that has been done as well and I know in my ward in lynnwood which has one of the highest number of machines and also the highest amount of revenue very little of that money is going back into that local community it goes to the other subs it goes to that the mere avails and the Fendall turns and other you just lost Janey understand the dynamics of how the pokie machine business works and what it does to lower socio-economic communities the second point I want to make is that the problem I have with this request for relocation is that if we approve this today I cannot in future say to anyone else has got these gaming machines sorry you can 't move three over here you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widespread I think dispersion of the or a widespread issue of these machines moving all around the city which becomes incredibly hard to control which I don 't think does ask any favors at all so I think we have to stay true to the policy I totally concur that there is a review coming up that is the time to pet these major conversations about the principles at the moment the principle that policy is a sinking blood this does anything but create a sinking blood and I think we should stand firm with where rare though thank you I want to support the view of our community board and I 'm air commutable cheer present of this to the committee and so I 'm supporting the company the staff recommendation and the committee recommendation and it 's basically look please don 't load Eddington with a whole lot more of social problems and we 've already got we 're just managing to get rid of the synthetic drugs industry off off lincoln road and if this guys are here will be 64 machines within Eddington it is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no point in just shifting the problem from one subject to another there was reference to this is like the gaming industry I take exception of the term industry industries usually be up doing something productive this sort is incredibly destructive so I 'm just urging counselors all to vote for to support the staff and committee recommendation Andrew yeah i 'll also be supporting the staff and committee recommendation we have a good policy here which is there for good reasons the result of this would be to increase the number of venues which is clearly totally against the policy in the context of community funding i certainly don 't buy the argument that we should be supporting gambling in order to support a funding stream to the community and in fact i 'm aware of a number of community groups that as a matter of conscience will not apply to go to gambling trusts and gaming trusts for money even though they need that money because they 're very aware and cognizant of the damage that gambling does in our communities additionally I 'm mindful of the view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly won 't be supporting the increase in the number of venues today any other Jimmy chin thank you I also support a stock in the committee recommendation the reason very simple because of this policy can bring the policy you know was established by the council hello mayor and the council may be pues Council Councillor Zito so we should take a leave you know to comply with studies policy otherwise how do we to be a good role model to be a good of Peyton for the community for the residence so that 's where we will be the important not any excuse so this main reason I support staff and the committee the accommodation,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

just briefly actually it 's it 's something that has happened around the meeting times and it 's just the flood the flood issues like several other awards and it 's not actually on our agenda was discussed at the previous meeting in devine floods during that time really looking forward to the task force report and its really good to see quite a lot of work happening and some areas already in our ward which is good lots of cleaning out of culverts and drains and he 's good especially which has been really good residence there really appreciate that what would be really good those there are lot of times that the community not aware that works going on had several people say to me are you know we hit our big flood meeting after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again and where it happened in some areas some the immediate stuff that had been raised at their meeting had been done but people weren 't aware of it and so they like you know that some council aren 't doing anything for us but they had been works and worked on our port hills road it was effective in stopping the flooding down that street that did carve out a big hole there been some work down by Cox lane they 'd been some in in a couple of places and I 'm thinking that while the staff themselves so we can the tasks for so extremely busy it would be really nice to have someone from comms Ted to that not just that the the official report but for communications with communities over to the ongoing work there so for example the Duggar turned up to one of the box culverts and started clearing it out but no one was quite sure what was happening what was going to head them with it how far they were going that kind of stuff would be readies with communities to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operates with with notices you know there it doesn 't have to be there flume 11 okay but it doesn 't have to be that formal because it takes more time and planning and a lot of these works are happening at short notice as people you know especially with the floods hit me but some sort of way of either essentially community boards to forward to their communities or something like that it would be really useful yeah okay no that 's good I Paul within glenn i just wanted to actually make an acknowledgment to staff around some of the work they 've been doing as and thinking like lily we yawning I 'm meet up with Mike sebago and yet he came down the hill at contractors they were walking around the streets looking at the issues in particular and discussing historical information with the residents and I think and what the work we 've actually seen heaven and activates since he 's been down there has been quite significant of this will make a knowledge meant to our staff on that I mean can I acknowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feedback that I had in terms of you know literally door knocking some of the residents getting them to come out and listen to you know the guys while they were the I mean it 's just it 's great it 's great community communication and it 's yeah I mean we 're going to improve as we go but it 's just such a tremendous if it of everyone involved I 've got who is next Glen and then Yanni thank you just questioned forward Jaina mermaid just bought a point one page 56 Jane over the the scoop project in relation to the sea wall is that still on do people just to know in the next summer we 'll proceed I guess we had a briefing last night from mast and staff on that that 's regardless he will they have butter and I had worked quite closely with the people who are against the seawall there has been some resolution and something i 'm probably coming back to this council would have a look at yes that 's as i understand that there 's some good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to do so right it sort of comes down to the the changes of main st addresses the number of their concerns the issue for me last night sir raises it but i 'm looking at putting a wall back which will create some resilience or can and future create some resilience from sea level rise now whether that 's actually and there was a wall there before and my view some of that costs that is an increasing cost to this new design may well be an actual fact putting back what was there before so i think they need some discussion with our alliance partners on that to see if we can get him to rather reviewing that all as betterment I don 't believe it is all betterment I believe someone is actually replacing back what was there so but it work to be done there Johnny oh d it was just a concern of there and hit you he 's free eat I trust that the hydrological modeling hadn 't been carried out so that research you know part of that trust is accessing some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can close I don 't know about that I just aware of what Paul 's just told us yeah no um that work has not been carried out and it does raise an interesting question about how people can get consent to do works and waterways without understanding the hydrological effects so that is something that really we should be raising with a cane because the community are quite concerned that you know um there doesn 't appear to be any modeling but just wanted to pick up on Paul 's point so there 's a client 's governance group skirt is we 're one partner there 's two others so they obviously can outvote us on things and this really is I think a bit of an issue around putting back what was there and as we understand it you know the two other clients don 't want to pay for that the compromise solution they want us to pick up the extra cost what what we heard at community board and which I I think we 've asked a little bit more information is that we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back like-for-like it seems really simple to us that basically the depth of the of the channel before the earthquake was like this the skirt had initially proposed to reduce it you know like that and the community said no that doesn 't give us enough clearance for what we used to do so we 've come up with a compromise to lower so they 're still getting less and what that depth than they had before at a compromise solution but we 're being told that we have to come on bitumen so you know I think there 's some issues here we just need to work through yeah can I just touch on it does that come back to Council for a decision well okay well it probably will I 'm getting an odds which is a shame that they can 't just get on and get it done because that delays it for another few months but because there 's two other clients won 't agree but I 'd rather have a report in front of me with all of the detail in it before before I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be asking it will come back to community board and then come to counsel it 's full for what well for approval of design and probably are equipped with a request for extra funding em but but will we will we know whether that we can go back to scoot and dispute the the fundings blood at that really to us know what will come here will be a recommender to correct tea after it 's been through a process of agreeing what as what component and there will be a component we 're in back what was there and what 's the extra but that 'll be in front of you when you get us to make the decision but if you in the meantime could see what somebody pest here he could find out whether there was there is a way that we could I mean I don 't know if there 's a dispute resolution mechanism with unscared where we can challenge the you know the decision about about the cost split because it 's it would be NZTA wouldn 't it on that case well okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flooding just again just to put it you know acknowledge the work that staff are doing I think we need to be really mindful that I 'm we 've had meetings and sumner in an woolston in and Heath got people are really stressed and you know this is really quite a hard time for many people in our community including our staff who have been working around the clock weekends after hours and evenings to understand the scale of the problem I think we need to accept that this is a huge problem the flooding and storm issues that we 're facing and you know I think you runs really eager to get the first lot of information from the task force but but there will be an ongoing need I think to resource the work to keep continuing so one of the things that we 're really keen to do at a local level is to go back after we 've got that initial information re-engage with our communities to chicken about some of the solutions some of the timeframes and then look at you know are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information right so this will be an ongoing process but certainly the task force is a really good initiative and I think it 's giving people of hope that we are taking these issues seriously there will be a lot of learnings that come out of perhaps a little bit of looking back at what has or hasn 't happened and how we Pro going forward as well which we just need to be prepared for yep so I assume yani Johanson and Paul lonsdale are moving and seconding the report I 'll Pauline it 's really important to note that the see the Washington waste gate park opening in your minutes and I think that I think we should Lord Jonnie go yet hey if it wasn 't for Washington Post gateway anything you wouldn 't have yani on the council but actually it 's the community board the community would over 20 years ago and they seek to count so we see an opportunity for a skate room I think in this place and it obviously there 's been a lot of skateboarders people are ending wiley people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have contributed to getting this project done so you know I think it 's really important to acknowledge that without the local community board seeing the opportunity this this wouldn 't have happened so the community was really the one that deserves the important said you know people that did unfortunately but sadly people that live him across to have passed away actually he was a sitting member when she passed away but who really focused on providing more green space more recreational opportunities for young people in our ward who were really conscious of the fact that we needed to do more so it 's great to see that that that has come to fruition yep I shared a picture of a skateboard skateboard pack that Jim d has put on as website on facebook so with you so I hope you 've seen it the other thing that we 've already heard is that very soon after a something open that already people are coming internationally to come and see it so actually quite high profile people you know have come it 's a real attraction for yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just mindful the fact that a few years ago an area of delegation was taken away from the Hebrew fury community board and I think it 's really important in terms of our workload as a council to that we look at how in fact delegations can be reentered in fairview fearing me but also other committee boards and thats perhaps an example might that might not be the bit might be other examples though Sarah which as a board you can discuss and think through and let us know about so I think we have to be very mindful of how in fact we extend delegations to community boards as soon as possible so yep thank you right I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no carried thank you and we 'll go back to item number seven the,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Board,8f4kbFC5j0Y,20140508,814.54,"Christchurch, New Zealand",2396,I welcome Andrea Cummings and again no parte I 'm assuming that Davey stand in Livingston are moving and seconding the report of the community board is that a fair assumption thank you right I 'll hand over to you and really good morning everyone thank you just want to put your teaching to page 40 parts even the background for this is that Lynn was contacted by a facebook from a concerned resident regarding the state of pages road as it comes into New Brighton and we went out one very very cold bberry morning and met with her on site and we 've even had photos of us standing on the berm worth with weeds up over our head height and so Leanne and myself and the resident we created a bit of a plan of attack and Leanne carebear connection to her part which was cleaning up the TC three part of the road ways and some of the properties that have been abandoned we my part was to go the Sarah and ask them to action improving the red zone part of the pages road bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pages redbridge button operation sorry auntie drive in the papers bridge that 's been saying yes that 's a that 's reads own so it 's hunters here of control and honestly it looks appalling it 's sort of the gateway into New Brighton and we had all these fantastic event over summer the quiet day the sand castle day the fireworks all these other things but driving in pages round it just looks utterly disgusting so we actually asked Sarah to come to our board and we put our concerns to they gave us a briefing which was just the standard PR briefing of these areas we 're doing forest these are the areas of doing second third pages road was I think seeking to last so it could be two years before they get to it they appeared not to have any movement on that even though with the board did request that they look I mean we 're only looking at probably what does 150 meters long in the only two sections deep just to tidy it up make it look a bit more respectable but these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me it 's not a small ask but to the community to that feel good whatever you 're driving into New Brighton would be enormous I believe I mean to have a meeting with Ivan either Omega yes yeah and I was sort of just hold it off until I came to you guys and wondering wondering I mean I can just go and meet with him and say hey please but I 'm guessing the answer is likely to be no but but is there something we can put a bit more weight into going back to them well again I think I think we could probably expand the resolution that the reports as a whole be received and that the council support the community board and it 's seeking a higher priority for the pages road residential red zone maintenance most of associate is dead vegetation you know yeah that 's right it actually isn 't a book Joel Joel and I mean week we could offer to work with them collaboratively to this resolved so they took away all the dead vegetation yep and just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wife incident but but can we can we sort of say after maintenance like a comma put for well ok maintenance is the right word of it ok I 'm maintenance well improvement in maintenance because it 's the improvement and their amenity there 's what what we want yeah so just put improvement in maintenance but I want to say recognizing that it is the gateway to new brighton because this is not an area of land a street it 's not a road that 's going to disappear it 's a major arterial road and it will access you know residential land as well as the you know all the you know the joys of New Brighton as well and and the surrounding areas but that 's not so with all parts of New Brighton Road so in terms of priority I think we 've got a good case to go to them and say this is a higher priority so I 'm green you think you 're just depending on the time frame to over the pages rope bridge replacement that 's going to be realigned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infants in so what if we could ever joined up approach I 'm just trying to find them a skirt site when there 's juice to be think it 's still away where were you yeah yeah that 's what roundabout we 'll go be more of them you know yeah it betters along that this is a temporary measure this is just to get a place looking better here 's a gateway in the meantime yani thank you I 'm just question how what 's the sort of cost the idea I wouldn 't think it would be much I mean it 's taking a waste indeed vegetation it 's mowing the lawns and it 's putting a post and wire fence up over maybe I don 't know maybe 300 meters of wire fencing oh not much okay a few thousand dollars I would thank goodness i hate later the other question it kind of I don 't know if your board has any clarity about the ongoing future of the red zone and how you work with Sarah I do not as part of the cost share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a joint up approach to the residential red zone and what 's happening there because it 's yeah I 'm really supportive with us but there 's other areas in the city and other areas and neighborhoods you heard the announcement sort of Prime Minister a couple day sorry this to me that 's not enough no no no but there is a process now about to begun so there 's no point asking the chair of the board Pegasus community board about a subject that is not yet on the table butchers we are going to be engaged with central government over developing a community engagement around the future of the residential red zone after we have resolved issues around our flooding and storm water and row realignment needs which are critical to the city the city as a whole not just to one area what this roses for me though is that there needs to be some transitional for a transitional plane in their immediate for how we 're dealing with the red zone because United side drive for example we 've got signs up saying road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four weeks so this there 's a whole kind of mismanagement of that I really don 't want to turn a discussion around the board pegasuses community board for pages road to be a priority and to a discussion about other areas of the residential red zone could we please deal with this matter that 's on the table now rather than use this as an opportunity to raise other issues in relation to the residential roads are we will be talking about the residential red zone a lot and the very near future date I think you look I think it 's support the emotion thoroughly it 's really a case of Sarah prioritizing their clean out of residential housing in the red zone area and and how they 're going to treat the follow up and and really at the moment the bexley section either side of pages road is quite low in their priority so I think all we 're not asking them to elevate that the entire bexley area another priority hate is really just the stress to them that we really would just like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nicely and it won 't be a big job and there 's not a lot for them the cost involved would be a bit of equipment for a day and taking away a lot of rubbish don 't be about it the other item that I did our staff to look at was the was the footpath because there was a desire to have at least one operational footpath on either side you know one side of a residential red zone area western place half is not too bad and it wouldn 't take a lot of work exactly so but one one was definitely worse than the other but both of them very challenging for a you know a parent with a pram somebody on a scooter mobility scooter you know so and and there are a lot of people in their area who rely on both you know one or the other about the foot part at the same time it does extend two pages wrote over over the antec thrive as well yes but that 's our area which is where we have talked to staff and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come back to you I 'll just be really good to meet with Ivan to maybe that series are putting also that quite a lot into the communities to realize perhaps that these gateways in the communities like Brighton other areas are actually a priority for these communities and probably more significantly important than some other areas which sarah are simply concentrating on which perhaps they should change their focus yes absolutely obviously hit council support to this when you make the offer you mentioned before about perhaps even going to sarah with a collaborative content since it 's such a bit will be a minimal cost them but it but the benefit will be quite great to our residents do you have a suggestion about maybe if i went to meet with ivan on site and took a staff member with me to beat that up or to have that discussion away or I think you can work that out with your community board advisor and get some help and hope her best to approach it yeah all right i 'll put the motion at all hours yeah pauline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i didn 't realize they were protected on private property and would this be something for the tree policy working party to gain would probably just I 'm sure the three policy working party I 'd love to take a look at this well the difference with this one was would the computer the one that was like a fiend all turn or somewhere similar was that that was on public land next to a property this is actually on private land so this jesting it to go through as part of the district plan with you yeah the right place no I don 't I don 't think that 's the right process but um I assume that the community board will receive that advice from staff if that 's what they 've requested but it might be as Pauline 's identified it might be better to lift it out of that and actually refer it as a to that to the work of a body yeah before you pass the motion I just got a couple of other things I wanted to raise as it 's okay the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been meeting now for the last month well underway they 're due to sort of final up finalized their report on the fifteenth of May it 's been going to move into the advisory group along with residents associations for their legacy project we would appreciate I think the feeling at the moment is that we 're very little direction around the legacy project costs go scale location it 's just hey create a legacy project that the little guidance might be useful for that group when it commences and about a week and a half we haven 't set aside as sum of money but we 've said that there will be money made available I mean that this with our staff to report back to us with a proposal on on what could be made available but that was working with the community so I just think just work together but I 'm there has to be you know a sort of a you know a degree of realism about it but we do want to have a statement made about the importance of New Brighton in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant amount of loss of residential you know homes around that around the area there 's a lot of red zoning directly affecting New Brighton and this is the IP leave a perfect opportunity to really you know stake our claim on on on the need to to leave a legacy for for their area and it 's perfect timing with it with them with the launch of serif as well your communities sweeping up the business owners are stepping up doing their part of us is our stepping up to give up so good news and different last thing we were meant to have a briefing regarding the estuary frontage of the red zone area where when the houses have been removed they 've also taken the floodwalls away that 's been delayed by the storm troopers so just hope that that can be organised begin shortly they aren 't really the storm trainers that was my little trailer sorry I was just leaving they choked yep it was it here alright so i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no Kerry thank you thank you very much,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

March 2014,LdzyhQYNIak,20140508,699.75,"Christchurch, New Zealand",2185,so there are there aren 't any abe reports on here so Andrew you 're moving this who would like to second that Thomas Kendra would like to second I wanted to just say a few things and just even though as a result of what you 've actually said to us or set to a previous few previous four chairs we have actually had a briefing on the cycleways and that we 're lucky to be part of the part first 13 maybe we might be under a cloud now under if we 're many of you looking for funds but we 're certainly delighted so we 've had a briefing on that and we 've had a briefing on that with our community already so that was that 's a good start of great stuff the texts texts reminding you that something might have come out text don 't always work and exponentially so no not one rule for all yep and it 's really important about strengthen our own communities and over this last storm event what a superb job the team has done and keeping us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice making perfect but it 's certainly been overarching organizations having state highway involved also in those news releases or those briefs to us we 've got we 've had them early in the morning and we certain your bank 's furniture have got a number of trees that we can actually get that information out so we really did appreciate that and greatly improved there was one report that came out it talked about having sand bags at little river I did follow up but didn 't follow it up well enough and somebody apparently asked for seeing bags and they weren 't available but the ball our board has asked on these minutes we do talk about it we 'd like some sandbags at little river and some signage there to assist with the closing off of the road and things but if floods continue to be the major part of our focus at the moment although as a landowner I 'm actually starting to think about El Nino and thinking about the drought in the spring so we 're never happy but you can see that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was about flooding and this was pre Task Force Times and we were organizing a meeting pre that task force group so we 're now just waiting to pull it all together and hopefully we will have our meetings teed up shortly to have with our community with staff involved if we go down to page at the bottom of the next page page 34 or we start talking about state highway wish issues state highway 75 runs through the middle of a Koran goes to or just before you come into a car are and there are a number of issues that would actually got the state highway including the general conditions of flooding on the state highway we 've had some major flooding trees and a number of issues so we have got a meeting with them and we do in the minutes here we talk about arrows on roads and we have got some arrows on roads indicating which side of the road camp events should be traveling on just on our normal Ecker our roads we disposal of supra stock rips property on page 36 our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us and particularly when it 's council land hopefully that that land has been retained by the council but it 's flat land is very important to us and disposal of supras property so we were delighted that we were involved in that process and presume that that some going to remain with the council and be taken on by council operations on page 37 the Anzac Day Services we have a we the community board and I think we 're probably the only one and the City Council area that hosts the own there the community Anzac Day Services so they do involve quite a bit of organizing our council staff saw our support staff support us with it and we 're beginning the next journey of next year 's celebrations so it 's um quite an exercise an undertaking for us but we do appreciate the support of the staff that we have through so but just finally and closing and a few comments that I 've got I just really want to acknowledge our local staff and the difficulty that our local staff the likes of lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are involved it is difficult and challenging important when it is wet when there 's flooding and dealing with I 'm dealing with us as a community and I just acknowledge the work that they do with us they do a tremendous job and support us as well through the process so there were just a few things that I wanted to highlight through the throughout our papers this time can I just sit on the back of that suggests an amendment to the reservation enough counselors tuner and scandrett agree that the reporters a whole be received and that staff work with the local community board to determine how many sandbags need to be made available and where they will be stored locally because I mean it just it you know you 're expressing a degree of frustration about something that could be easily fixed yes so so but if we put a resolution on our books it 's in I 'm gonna say it will get done Andrew and importing and the other aspects as well as the sandbags was the road signage not it well we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with state highway 75 at little river where when there 's a significant amount of water there and then you get four wheel drive vehicles driving through that causes wash that potentially causes water to go into businesses and homes so if we could mention the word cyanea and and where would be great sandy eggs and what signage made would be good heaven work within said ta yeah you see see see James just flipped on there and and work with NZTA to determine appropriate signage for flooded flood events yeah that 's great so the combination of the sandbags and sinus should go a long way to solving the problem and just to pick up what Pam was saying about flooding we I 've been talking to staff this more and we 're hoping to get a meeting in place for week commencing the 19th of May well supported by council staff of doing we 've been doing heaps of good work recently but also offices from ECAM who would be able to talk about the implications of lake wiry where issues and their relationship to Little River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your comments about the Anzac Day Services as a person attending both Anzac services in the river the first time I thoroughly enjoyed them both and was actually really blown away by first of all work done by community board members and community members in putting them together but also the number of people attending those services and certainly the cup of tea and sandwich function after each was a really good opportunity to be catching up with people so yeah well done in organizing those is great well thank you for coming I was I was overcome when you walked up with the wreath along with the other board members I was very proud of the team that was there with us on the day many thanks Pauline he was the scene big thing I was picking up on too but there is an urgency about that because we don 't want to wait for an event to get the hex and eggs we need them before but also just on page 34 we 'd it was noted and moved to introduce of racing district to cover stream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elbow nation no it 's been been ongoing sort of i think it may have been just before amalgamation but 2010 there was another guy at getting a rating district in the area it 's an environment canterbury rating district it 's not a city council rating district its environment canterbury vers a number of steps that need to be worked through but at it you can have a catchment management plan that would cover that whole area dealing with you know the willows the management of the stream maybe it may include some River works and it there may be a lot of things but there is a number of people would have to vote and you have to have voting numbers to get it over the line there 's a male male photo meeting oh yes yes no this it 's easily done it 's been done before so it 's what works around the wimax the require all of those big rivers they all have rating districts around them the Landers landowners all pay you know towards it rated towards it they have meetings on an annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be that we need to have a catchment rating for every district we 're looking at pets a Corral might have one to deal with it because people can 't manage their rivers that becomes too difficult it 's the boulders come down the rubble comes down the trees the branches and you know not an aging community people don 't know what to do so that 's the idea of it so the river will be actually managed and as you probably don 't know whether you heard but I 've been insisting was hulp assisting this whole flooding process I 've talked about a doctor cut adopter culvert and that for Tacoma to residents association they have actually adopted a call what they 've cleared one that was hugely full with rubbish and rubble and cleaned it out they 've TPS it or whatever you g is mapped it and they 're going to be doing furthers a number of those in that particular community and then at some stage I think we 'll probably make sure what we 've got with them was what council well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a good thing we haven 't got enough staff there 's not enough capabilities to do it not enough funding so we 're actually going to have to do a little bit more to make the system work and if we can be there and and look after those culverts that are the other ones that we know a problem ones no will will all benefit in the end because a lot of our problems are from Paul sort storm water systems pipes that come out in the wrong place and the pressure of intense water though tints rain plus the water and that pipe causes huge problems yeah like that we could replicate that citywide and heather calvert hotline and the store strongly beans because seriously they block up straight away was debris and if we hit a hot line and people could get out there and clear them we could actually ease we just have that we 'll see yeah she did Papa know you 've got one he 's been on about it for a kind of now but quite a long time and staff finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tucked-away one that you wouldn 't really know so to get community involvement and meeting us know I think it 's really good yes put themselves to ya know I quite like that you know that the shared model that 's good Paul just picking up on the road silence we have exact the same problem yelling I out riding around on the last flood in the water and talking to some residents and as we were there they were foil drives piling through creating huge waves but also just the SU road closures though in there are some roads are just definitely needed to be closed and some of them are closed until later the evening yet so I think there needs to be a whole a lot of full put round to actually that street management yep totally agree all right i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much Pam things and we appreciate the fact that you come such a long way but it 's always worth while,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Board,jP9GaCjLutk,20140508,469.99,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1196,onto the sprayed and healthcare community balls oh sorry I thought that was the next time your next book your needs right again again I 'm assuming that Phil Clearwater term scandrett are moving in seconding and there aren 't any part a metas on the agenda so welcome Thank You Man men and I just want to draw your attention to the deputation 1.1 just talking about the potential risks downstream risks of intensification and just think that the community and spreading heathkit is concerned about the downstream effects of intensification and also a new developments you know it 's all it 's very well to say well if the flooding will be mitigated storm one will be mitigated I 'm on the site but where is that water going to go to and particularly if this development and retention basins and I also wanted to point to our draft dental plan submission that that calls for a and a long-term plan a development of a a permanent off road bus exchange at barrington I think that 's important for the viability for the community and input bus users @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point eight point two point three we 're looking forward to a resourcing proposal for community boards around communications and and and note that the community board is going to be hosting a a seminar around the heathkit river with experts and community identified community group leaders and interest groups to talk about well a broader approach to the heathkit but there 's also a need for a specific briefing for our community of communities around heathkit flooding issues there 's been a lot of focus on other area areas and justifiably so the hit the flooding around in beckenham in lower Kashmir is very stressful and the beacon of neighborhood association in the log Kashmir reasons association in the summer field Business Association are in the process of running a survey and that 's been fed to the flood task force now which is really good we really need to be sure that we we know everyone whose house has been affected by flooding them I felt I just in relation to those in meetings poor I can assure you that today staff are obtaining some dates when technical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meetings so there 'll be some dates staff are working on there today excellent and you know we fail it 's really important that we had clear information about the way forward and in some answers about what is actually the cause of this flooding I mean it I know that it 's its fifth quakes and movement and and any lots of rain but they 're there needs to be more answers in there it is not that 's not a description of every area so yeah each area is being identified for the specific challenges that that 's confronted with ya Pauline ok so regarding your concern about the meadowlands development and we the water was going to go hmm i guess that information will come out when the detailed design comes out but i think it 's a really pertinent question at the moment I wonder if we can get some information now about their this your community yeah I mean it does mean I won 't say that it does look like a wonderful development but the concern in the community and my concerns as year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like more information about it and you know I I have had a presentation regarding that development but I I haven 't had any information about the downstream effects we would told the other day for my internet and the last rain event one of the swales out at Wigram was dry and set up here that not working in we 've also been told that it 's actually not just a case of having them and neva they have to be operated correctly before that people operating them need to have skills and have them the fishermen they 've got the holding tanks and pumps and in gates that open there sometimes they need to be closed sometimes partially opened over I wonder if there 's any way we can look into his seeing if they are being operated correctly and if they are working they 're not working the water goes straight into the river which is not supposed to do I wonder if this is an issue that fills committee could could pick up yep Jimmy face no I see your one question on pages 31 de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eddington parking deck of disabled parking etc how is your action taking the they should have been some specific points that were specifically requested by by board member caralyn Potter and it has been followed up by traffic engineers and I 'm confident that they 'll be there I yani just just that that white a piece of work around subdivision consenting in terms of flood and impact and stormwater retention I thought the task force was going to look at that is it it 's not looking at any of their no I think that comes into the whole land drainage recovery plan is a stream of work in there but I 'll look into it thank you should I refer to it as a stream of work so we need like we need I mean I know I 've fed the Sun on a number of occasions so there 's two really critical things one is existing subdivision consents whether what 's been consented is actually sufficient whether the things that are sub-divided I said they were going to do as part of the development have actually happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know is there any learning about what we do in terms of the task forces reporting next Monday so you know it there may be in factum an ongoing role for the task force that 's something that will obviously have to consider as a council but certainly in terms of that whether any of the upstream developments are causing flooding further down that absolutely has to be part of our consideration okay clin so just looking through the pumpkin and taylor report either later last UV of the co i found some information on flooding pertaining to the hiccup as well as even if you wanted to accessorize human our starfighters its online yep yep yeah it fits the sea level rise one yes here 's another edit report me too let 's not open up another debate so I 'm gonna put the motion I 'm going to put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know that 's carried thank you very much we now can i 'm thinking i 'm going to leave the partay item Vicky until I 've gone through the Part B reports here,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

April 2014,IB9lJNOJr2I,20140507,553.26,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1658,and call mike davidson to the table and there are no parte reports and i 'm assuming that counselor Ellie Jones and pulling Cotter are moving and seconding thank you I 'll hand over to you much thank you and the meeting minutes are pretty straightforward we did get their correspondence back in from eq c in regards to our litter that we sent out to different organizations in terms of the flooding issues that are happening to our board which I believable had email synth for that correspondence and all the other correspondence we 've also received from those organizations is there any questions and we still haven 't got one from the D H B and so obviously there 's quite a big health risks in those areas with the nurse illa coming up during the flood so we 're still playing for their response yeah it 's um I mean I completely want to commend your community board I mean it 's really i mean the counselors in and yourself and yet the wider team you know been really good in terms of fronting up with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and difficult time and we 're all looking forward to the report that will be coming to council next Monday it 's been a very challenging time frame we put on the the task force there 's a rumor going around that they 've called themselves the storm troopers but but it is a challenging time frame and I really respect how the community board has worked really closely with with staff and and the wider community it is an incredibly difficult time so early did you have yeah I just wanted to add to that that the that is on um there 's been some really good feedback from the community directly as well I mean I know from having dealt with insurance and eqc stuff that you can be in situations like this we there are really angry people and it becomes really emotional but what we found particularly in the sessions at the weekend that there was a real desire to actually really engage in an ass positive questions and offer constructive criticism we required but constructive options and and I don 't know we them that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly Joe Byrne I think deserves you know a huge amount of well she needs to be acknowledged and was by the group in the afternoon and I think in some ways we 're fortunate because of the work that she does we can engage with that network that she 's already worked so hard to establish and it makes it a lot easier to engage but we 're already getting emails back from people who have seen council staff working on the on the drains and the strings maintenance on the street so we 're getting that immediate engagement back from from the resonance which is fantastic yeah and phil was just going to discuss with your relation to item 7 where the cycleways project there was a you request the update and certainly I was happy to go along when that was provided with the staff what I it 's on page 27 do what I just wanted to ask you about is it just and I felt that the meeting was useful in terms of I guess basically clarifying some of the myths that had arisen around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it might be helpful though if community board members already receive for example the council press releases on those things do you know if can be board members do because as councils we do because I mean it 's been a number of release you know media our comms information it 's gone out to some early to members I 'm just wondering if if they 're also went to community board members and if that would assist debunking some of the myths we 're definitely get some of the Roosters don 't have to actually see which ones you 're getting texting okay compare wheat yeah I think that the I mean I yeah I think you 're probably going to a particular member of the community board who 's taken a particular position but may not have been so well informed about what the what the what the workers what work is being undertaken so would it be useful for your community board if we arranged a specific briefing on on cycleway we had the Murray feel it was very informative obviously we do have board members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he 's an answer the questions for the board for the for the board I mean we 're very keen to make sure that there is really close engagement with the community boards on on matters like this I mean there 's a subject around the cycleways which is not and in your area that was brought to my attention yesterday and that is that people often don 't think of the tech parks as places where people want to get to on cycles but actually it is it 's an ideal in point for a cycleway and and I don 't know that that 's been affected unto the routes as well so it 's certainly something that I 've undertaken to to raise with your committee Phil so it so that 's yeah sorry I think so couple of things thats of caramel ever was a time time for us officer we accept it 's going to be a longer duration bustle and the stage is when things are going to happen so we sort of know when except epidemic parallels going to have it also in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor of slow street and was more in favor of a mixed-use street for those areas right alerted that the briefings are great but i think what needs to precede the briefings is that the community board members are part of that communication loop and unless I 'm missing something there 's no reason why they shouldn 't be yes so I think there 's a bigger issue here too and pulling all those streets together and also looking at texting for immediacy not everyone is as tied to their emails every five minutes like we are community board members might be you know in that group so there 's a bigger issue around an effective comms with community board members and I think we should look at that yeah now a bit that 's a really positive solution to errything key and also if an that with with the meetings we head on Saturday thanks to members of the community board did not get those emails because they didn 't read the email so they had no knowledge of the Saturday discussion so it takes saying look at your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's a really simple but effective solutions so so thank you that I me not because I kind of wanted to go back to the to the flooding because there 's been the focus on the flop done area and obviously a lot of the learnings out of debt will be applicable across other areas as well what I think I 've really liked about the task force approach is that it 's multidisciplinary and I think that that may be what has been missing before in terms of our overarching solution or approach to solutions across the city I think that it 's really given us a model that that will be very powerful i think for future future issues that arise yep on then p and i 'm just looking back at the last weekend and this thing to be and i don 't want us to be negative but an expectation that everybody in a very wide area gets one of those leaflets dropped in the boxes and there 's got to be a demarcation point somewhere and that was all done in just one day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to other counselors and other wards where this is going to be replicated to give their communities to strengthen their own communication lines and get the information out either online or somehow to people because the council staff it can 't just can 't eat to every body and that 's the only kind of weak point I can see in there is the community expectation for feedback but generally that the numbers on in the afternoon were huge compete in the morning we 're there because word got out that people just love to bring able to tell their own story and the number of stories was just incredible and obviously with still haven 't heard all of them but there 's a lot of economic impact to which was quite eye-opening as well so it was really successful and I want to commend the staff for giving up the time on the weekend especies there today which was glorious and sitting inside that it was well well wizard yeah um Tim I 'm just so it 's great for us to replicate what you 've done in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hi etc I was becoming desperate with regards to they said as a really big issues we 're fully aware so thank you for the work you guys done n to the staff as well ok i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye as opposed they know that 's Carrie thank you very much,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Tsikata califican bakery and then later under item 13 we made a decision about Norwich key but one of the things that 's clear is that Norwich key is constantly changing and we might need long-term parking decisions to be made and I learned yesterday that Christchurch City Council staff have been working with other stakeholders considering the future of Norwich key and given the significance of that road to our community we would really like it if the community board could be involved in that conversation certainly I think we should make a note of that if we could ensure that staff were engaging directly with the community board on that matter and the only other thing is I 'm referring to another report item three in the environment because you committee report on page 63 about the banks peninsula well I think it was a report about all the marine structures in the city and i attended that and it was great and I 'm what did I just asked at that meeting whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the briefing be opened up to other members of the community who have an interest in this which subject sorry but wolves and duties and we 'll talk about page 63 item three because I think it 's really hairy yeah there 's lots of people with an interest in these assets that 's really helpful that for them to be able to see the wider context and also have the conversation about how they could help and certainly in the case of one or two that 's already happening yep yep so as being essentially given a keynote about there as well so that in staffer and I 'm thinking particularly about governors bay GT in the daughter marina which both in pretty poor appear in this you know got to be somehow discussion about what happens about the in the future right okay isiliye support that all I end like I think that because I at the time the Environment Committee I kind of assumed that Wolf 's and jetties will be like parking places so it will be paying certainly part of community board um delegation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important that it will be included well I can see an opportunity we have received management committees where who manage reserve assets for the council and maybe we could have for example a church bay management church by GT management committee there that could also do that sort of thing was that poor lame to June yeah oh okay I 'm Pauline hi Paula I 'm just on page five you 're probably about Stoddard cottage trust and you 've you 've mentioned that you 'd like to see more functional relationship with council can you expend all there is the problem there that you will see no not really the cottage has been closed for since youth quakes obviously and and while it 's been the case that trust is sort of fallen unto you know there hasn 't been much going on and so the trust is now kind of up and running again and they 're interested in engaging in a conversation and I think that 's going to happen under the facilities rebuild I mean nothing certain but when the cottage is at the stage where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work and I think when that 's done the idea was to have a conversation between the trust and the council in their consultant about what the what the needs of the community were for that as well as all the other factors this is something for the future right now yeah and we have also had the facilities manager for that attend one of the trust meetings too so that 's been good relationship building thank you ok so we have a resolution I 'll put the resolution all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much you,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

3,660p5wezxks,20140507,684.11,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1828,that 's just being you know super cautious yep yani we also need to look at the areas that were identified that we 're cost-effective if you could use Carl and yeah I would quite like to know that too so if you had been allowed to take into account both the protection and the benefits gained from using land owned by the crown which areas would have become cost effective and that 's actually two peps I mean if you look at it from the work we 've done and expand that that 's actually that 's not a piece of work that 's actually something we can do very quickly because what we have to do presumably is we have to say if you expand this piece of work at what point does the BCR go over 1 which how many properties do you need to add so that 's actually quite a piece of work because it may also impact on the design of the solutions that have been off as well I understood that there were some of that work had been done that work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and saying which of the larger areas were cost-effective but I 'm saying we 'd be looking at from a different viewpoint that says given what we 've got today if you grew that structure and you could take properties on the side that where would that where 's the tipping point to make it cost-effective that 's actually that 's not a it 's a Peter work that can be done but it 's not something we can do in a week or two no what about doing a desktop exercise take the 2012 report and kind of factor unto it what we know from our own analysis because I think there 's a I mean we don 't want a we don 't need an exact science thing but but just a flavor of what areas might have reached their tipping point I think I think we could we know that from even the BCR number that we 've got we 've got some which are closer to one right as the tipping point that 's so we might be able to do a little bit of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are close to it what what 's the order of magnitude of work to do to expand to get the embedded equation the other thing was but fence RB plus I mean given that people have made deputations to us around it around and savvy price all right so we do actually need a response to that area and actually i think the s12 for determination is a really critical one so if you think that there 's possibly houses that are could have the s12 for removed and if people living in them given our housing situation given that we 're about to swing you know looking at spending millions as always building new houses it seems like we should actually be looking at if we 've removed an s12 for because of an envy determination the adjacent properties in that area are they still at the same level for isn 't it can we just add 23 so so after analysis put a bracket and say including expanding to cover crown own property and that you you know what we mean by that is it yeah okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperately not want their 12 fours revisited yeah the 12 fours are actually quite critical to their decision-making process so what else would be careful what you I know I was going to say and taking that on board a new for the basis for removal of section 124 notices and end the retention of 124 notice is that what would I want to understand is what is the what are the criteria against which in be operating as against the criteria that we operate and under life for us so yeah so that 's that 's that 's useful and I think I mean the reality will be that mb 's determination is very very site-specific and obviously very very individualized there are principal differences there are not principal differences between the way that the study 's applied the 124 and the way the mb interpretive what we should come back to you and say and we can certainly come back and say actually here are the 12 falls that were overturned by mb here is the reasons why they 've done in those instances okay so change that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notices yeah and then that covers both ways yes is there anything else yani fence RB place so you know I just think from the people that made it a chance to have some information come back about the work that they are presented to us new five specific information on the savvy place yeah it said I see we understand what you may be done yes and I would like um in it though we shouldn 't happen is I 'm sorry spell crew if Finn sabe then if I Indian and just wanted to get a thousand years now I think that would be good to get information as per the original govt and make make a fury proposition to chem net when I country including Lisa from the local MP maybe it maybe if you go back up to that including response to letter to letter from the local MP and the cabinet advice to what she refers but I 'd also want to see that the new information that we 're getting in this report that it 's been peer-reviewed or possibly with sort of written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of so we 're not sorry we 're not giving peer review to support a particular provider of solute that I think that 's what you 're asking no as a possible to get advice back to from someone outside of the work that we 've done around just you know whether the coaster you want to further peer review of l we 're not some crazy oh just a highly of all kind of response around the assumptions yep that 's I can 't say that 's fine we can happy to do that I don 't think that whereas this list is growing the 12th of june is a feasible time frame for us to meet i 'm afraid do we have to meet that time frame though I mean no sir no we don 't need to meet anyway okay the residents might the residence because the 31st of almost yeah well with this companies that have already done a lot of work around some of these assumptions so just checking them with them in getting the view sorry I don 't I look I 'm actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done the life costs so and we have to cost in the life costs because we haven 't there 's an ongoing liability that has to be factored up so i don 't i don 't recall that the original resolution said that we would just absorb some hair and the system the ongoing life costs of us this must have been an assumption that was to be included on the fifty percent you 're right the issue i 'm raising though is that what we have is we have people making deputations and contact you 're not saying they 've got these cost effective solutions for this amount from these companies I just think would be really good for us to understand the basis for those assumptions versus what we 're being presented with so obviously there 's a huge extraordinary discrepancy sorry I just think having some understanding of their gear every day we really have to compare apples with apples so and I 'm really really strong about that it 's really important so but I wonder whether it would be possible and the report for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular example and to identify we 're the difference in the things come from in the report so that we when we 're looking at the report next time we can see what was submitted and what the analysis was and if you could find and you know a point of an agreement that would even be even be better but but if there is a disagreement we want to understand what it is is there right the final thing was I do think we need clarification over the cost year agreement 3.3 which we 're not going to have that by the jun 12 meeting well it 's it 's pretty black and white and the cost year that we can work together with the crown I don 't I don 't pretty black and white and the cost year agreement that they have to agree and what we 've heard from the minister as he doesn 't agree no the parties agreed though already agreed that if there 's a cost-effective engineering course giving a thick to the agreed solution it is no agreed solution it has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed that it will reduce the light for us so everybody knows it has to be in a greed solution the government has said they 're not interested in area wide mitigation full stop in the store across Europe assigned I know but they have a grit they not agreeing to the solution and given that they 're not agreeing to the solution there you know the point is is that that is not going to stop this work being done and it is something that we can raise with central government we have raised it with them there is no movement on this matter we can raise it in the context of the through the work that we continue to do with the government but on this particular meter it will hold us up if we decide that we want to go back and find out why the specifics where we r you know will not not not not picked up by the government so does somebody would like to second the resolution that we 've got here Paul Paul lonsdale so i will put the resolution all those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried thank you very much thank you and I think Paul now stop for morning tea and say well we 'll be back

2,YChzjxvIV5c,20140507,1848.549,"Christchurch, New Zealand",4899,um Dave can comment on the work that was done on that space at your life and so initially we will give a technical input so what form RPS or mitigation structure and where it could be cited how long it was so big it was and then I cost that I 'm that 's doctor had to be capable of reducing the risk to 10 to the minus 4 yeah we had some confidence that it could and then gets the fence because requires a replacement maintenance or its lifetime and have to be in the whole of life course also gnite models together will be rock fall over the news to lose our minds for damage over that period and access yeah it 's a large structure on structure that can take multiple impacts on it 's an engineered structure and the costs that this based on based on like a Mac furry orgy over costs for ruffball protection pencils I mean you say that it 's based on the G of it and make a fairy cost so because we all got a letter from the local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from them is saying the rock full protection and the port hills was both realistic and achievable and she suggested that the scenario was quite quite different in terms of the geotech and mechanical engineering solution Farley 's challenging from in terms of the one that stinks that proposed and costed in this paper with where do broken study on a vaca valley but it was a sector way studied and it was technically capable and there they did examine up we 're not saying it 's not technically possible but in this small area of the short legged pants large a large pants and under borders this is what it would cost based on variables so it really is because of the few properties that are now protected because the vast bulk of them around by sarah that 's a spicy element yeah quick sell all right could I just interrupt forgetting quickly I think the other thing to remember with infill case and it would apply asli is the difference between individual property protection versus area wipe so you 're looking at a completely different issue areas designing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with similar time and again days point about the scale it 's changed from whole suburb down to smell mulberry houses and that definitely affects their the overall costs yeah so the economics were affected by their that is but on on an individual basis we already have policy and placed and fell thank you and so just from what we 've been discussing it 's becoming pretty clear that the decision by the crown to not allow the serial end to or the reeds only to be used for excess that 's impacted on that on the recommendations in your report and the decisions the excess isn 't is a isn 't an issue I mean I think the minister 's remains open to excess but certainly that the key one is not allowing serial properties to not not contemplating sarah own land being reoccupied or put back to the market if these things are put in place is probably the key and the second is certainly an unwillingness it would seem from the crown to say we are not prepared to accept the inherent liability of having these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two so it might be useful to table the letter from sarah i think so i will email but i think clear yes sir it was emailed last night yeah we used to have to know but i think that that 's quite a helpful leisure to understand the Crown 's position on that so in terms of access sarah has a process in place around interim use of residential red zone land and the council was able to apply for temporary access across crown own land via this existing process Sarah 's unable to guarantee their ongoing access will be available after decisions about the future use and ownership of the residential red zone and are made so so it 's actually a bit of a double whammy really because yes you might be you might get permission for excess but that may not be an ongoing Brian right yeah it 's a critical oh yeah sorry I thought that my apologies clearly yeah then um I was also yet another things end like oh you do there are some assumptions and the report which you stated assumptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratios were only applied if there was more than one I understood more than one property but there 's no cuz there 's no costings it specifically in the report that actually helped us understand the the actual cost benefit and especially to individual properties so can you pitch this now you know why they not included well they 're available they won 't be down to individual properties because again this was a this was around area-wide mitigation so we won 't we won 't be a so you 're looking at the group of properties that are potentially protected by a piece of work and what 's the benefit cost ratios for them but we can supply the tables that summarize that to you I think they 'd be used I think that was able to and the other thing was going to ask you to is that in terms of we refer before to 20 feet and McPhee rien in in their views and you 've indicated that they they tested another part was a difficulty they looked in but what I 'm wondering is that um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so you know in the report there 's no reference really to other other sort of peer-reviewed articles to back up and there 's not to take away from your combined considerable experience in expertise but the report doesn 't actually give us confirmation about the views that you 've come to well perhaps perhaps I get dawn to talk about that because obviously we have our own geotech experts we have urs and Don who who led the analysis but that involved the wider maybe you call yourselves portals point so perhaps Tom could explain the sort of the consensus an approach that was adopted maybe I could start by saying that what we are doing was and we back up a little bit it is no there 's no doubt that this technically viable solutions out there I mean we 're not disputing Makka fury or geo boots few that you can do it what we are the problem that we have is can you do it now because of the land ownership issues and access issues and all the other things that go with it so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I don 't think there 's really an issue we 're not disagreeing at all that the methodologies are there it 's just that if you can 't get at the land you 're not allowed to use the land you see your owns the properties that you say you 're not going to protect them those are really the issues that make the difference yeah we were not charged that a rigorous analysis of anything we were is it viable to do this and then the question was the answer was yes technically it 's viable but the property is actually not available to dirty so that 's really the bottom line of that hole was this enters the cost benefit as well yeah and if it doesn 't stack up so few properties and if there are more properties that might have been much might have made a difference well I think well until we see the numbers I can 't go the next step because it sounds to me based on the evidence that we here before is that it would make a difference if all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I would like to pass it again maybe this is a personal comment but be aware that when G over and make a theory of putting up these ideas they are commercial entities you have a pieces interest in the update you know I 'm mindful of it no I understand that but but there are figures that essentially that we 're relying on and if all of the properties were available to be protected there hadn 't been read zoned for example I mean say say they they were all privately owned then it would stack up on that cost benefit analysis know what the night went on the head some areas with the suburbs right on across Gotham ours when we looked up at all four pillars yeah not all some some some weren 't technically capable of being protected some more analysis all right yes there were more errors that were technically arms okay it might actually be useful to have a list of those those areas as well so it fell drastically Tommyknockers germany in it 's just only the last page of report which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit one of the notes refers to that the ownership this was for the future maintenance okies ownership model was unclear for the protection structures on other property who would only in the structure and who would maintain it was what I want to know is was there actually discussed with the owners and taken to account in terms of the costumes for example could that could that could the costings not have included an agreement a legal agreement with the owners and in fact they might be responsible for maintaining that the the mitigation so let 's attack thing we ever-- an individual 's property our community is this pain that was the issue whether the president will be accessing cancer management in their software on the types of property well I mean we discussed it with the primary owner who is largely is the crown because most of most of where this as either has to be one of the things we see we had to locate it in the location that was most viable offered the best protection that 's either largely on the individual who 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power not i 'm not sure that there are a large number of third-party owners who are part of that discussion so just kind of comment on that on you as quickly earlier about the area that the sort of earlier macro look at the whole of the port hills cause that that was done in 2012 by council working with the crown and and the minister and in that instance decided not to pursue area-wide mitigation for some of the medes of dave outlined that there were there were some beneficiaries but there were lot large numbers where it still wouldn 't stack up century because some i wonder whether some of the differences and the costs have come unto not not costing and the life cycle you know they did you know so that i wonder if people have locked it you know one side just the cost of erecting the structure but not actually taken into account the fact that it 's got an ongoing life that needs to be maintained yeah absolutely when you talk to the consultants need come with free apps their costs come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get the structure they invariably they don 't consider that you know the maintenance ongoing costs third-party land ownership etc and these are probably the the cost that starts spiraling up in the maintenance is a big issue cost wise and obviously liabilities on on who takes those on and that will obviously have a big driver in the costs that the consultants don 't in the construction mcafee ruiz don 't necessarily see who i understand so in you see my in your presentation before that there were some properties that were not with or there was some failure of fences because they hadn 't been properly maintained I think well again Pepsi g8 its can talk to at better than I can but yes my understanding is some evidence in the earthquakes that fences did hadn 't been maintained or weren 't designed to a level certainly weren 't designed was able to cope with the earthquakes we experience that pending on a comment really we saw quite a number of fences that fail but almost invariably the design was not what we would consider an adequate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too rigid so the Rockville offense is designed to absorb in a desert deforms quite a lot from the rocks that most of the fences that were out there we 're not designed to deform so basically the rocks at them and either went straight through them or like them over right okay think of that and cool is next a lot of my questions and a thin answer but it 's going back to the G avert and mcafee reconsidering the recession a difference of opinion have we spoken them have our staff actually spoken to these two groups and if not why not maybe it was about the history that time Madea group is doing the report was a lot of interaction and discussion Makka fury we 've talked to many many times about this I think the point that Ian Rosa the key is that they didn 't think of the long-term loss I give you the build fast as i can tell you that really cost-effective to build it but there 's a lot of other factors that they would not have taken into account give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high level and they 've been quoted as gospel when really they that are very viable system if that that considered did you guys get together talk extra with your books of things through but remember that in the end of the sarah who made the decision say they commissioned the work they made the final decisions we all talked about it we all raised that the sorts of factors that come up as long-term costs and so on but what sarah chose to do with the g of f report was what sarah chose to do with it I thought we might have recommend it I think the Impi raised the son who did heard that it was included in one of the cabinet papers it says an invitation it was a suggestion that we invite geovision mcphee recited on the cabinet papers as having done the required work in this area to make a presentation to council but i don 't know that that 's going to help us although it much it might assist us and actually teasing out this wider issue of whether the life cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their supplies yep yep people everything else so we have got their costs built the life cycle model on with Scotts me at maturity and experience then I don 't think there 's any real last group between the work we have done and what they 've said in the past right hmmm yani just but it seems to meet it is the area wide mitigation then there 's the more localized mitigation the vacant sections are one of the outstanding issues in the portholes red zone don 't think I 've had offers people obviously if the government does what they 've done on the flat lose a lot of their equity so have you looked at vacant sections in terms of you know more localized mitigation solutions no you know then well firstly they 're not available to have a red zone offer so we don 't have council has no potential liability and respect of those because our liability is respect of those that have had red zone offers and I suppose there is a fundamental and a difficult question that actually says should we from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas where there 's high levels of risk and should we be actually is it sensible and this goes right to the heart I think of section 7 of the report is it sensible for council where there has been no development ie vacant sections to actually introduce people into higher levels of risk higher risk areas and then try and mitigate that risk by building inexpensive structures above them or should we be actively discouraging new development from occurring in there and I think that 's a broader policy question that the council needs to grapple and yes it 's difficult for those people who may have bacon sections but that 's the real policy issue that you 're needing to address we 've got adjacent residential have you looked at if these vacant sections on either side around it whether or not the mitigation would be cost effective no because there 's no with no we haven 't we did not include bacon section um and I think one thing that 's hard to kind of comprehend us how the gondola can cost effectively reduce the rest to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the port hills with quite extensive you know landscaping and all sorts of stuff so how how can someone like the gondola cost effectively mitigate the risk that people which I presume is you know similar to what some of these properties are going through so I 've and I don 't know the gondola in detail but the gondola all the pylons but the Gonda and the like any individual property and we do offer and enable people to develop individual solutions and individual solutions for an individual making that choice may be cost effective for them and then it that opportunity is not withdrawn and any sense by not doing area-wide mitigation there 's nothing to stop any of the landowners who have been covered here actually accessing the individual rock for protection structure we enable them to use our land to do that I 'm not quite sure what our policy I 'd have to check that sorry counselor we are open to a Peter said yeah and and so in terms of the conversation though Sarah they 're really clear none of the lien @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for mitigation and see advice so even though it 's going to transfer it to us at some stage we have no no power to do anything at the moment well I mean I think that that 's correct and I think the key thing becomes again if it 's transferred to that council does the council want that land is it the right thing to have that it is is it and we don 't know what land the crown would be prepared to transfer to us but I think we need to come back to the issue that says would we be transferring land to us to enable new development to go into high-risk areas or mitigation to our liability or so mitigating mitigation for our life well that 's you 've science our liability I think that 's a question that either needs to be looked at for has been looked at as I understand and need some advice to you on look I think that 's been incredibly useful I 've got the the relevant section of the cost share agreement and with me now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agrees to transfer up to fifty percent of the gross land area adjoining CCC 's reserves as identified by ccc to ccc at no cost and I think the phrases at no cost so it doesn 't say that there wouldn 't be more land available to be transferred to the council but it may be at a cost so I don 't know that there 's a complete final picture and the kashi areas it 's as its defined there but I think there are a couple of other things that we need before we make a decision on this one is the is the legal advice I think that would be incredibly useful and i think i think it probably does preexist this council and but but if it doesn 't we can get legal advice aren 't prepared because it would be good to understand what our liability is especially in this uncertain environment which the residential red zone does create so because it because and i think it 's the difficulty that we have is that it 's called a residential red zone but it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not it 's not a zone it 's not a zone that we 've created it 's not a zone recognized in our district plan and in fact one of our challenges is going to be how do we deal with the red zone and and the district planning processes given that it doesn 't are currently identified as such and that 's just as true on the flatland as it as in the port hills the challengers obviously even greater given the fact of the announcement the Supreme Court will hear the appeal of the quake outcast case and July so again there will be a period of uncertainty but it would be useful to have that additional report so I mean I 'm just wondering whether we could have a resolution rather than accept the resolution that some proposed by staff at this stage could we let it lie on the table till the 12th of June meeting and then in the meantime had the additional advice to counsel to enable us to make a decision on it would that be useful yani wealth of june or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly deal with it at the 12th man that 's okay I 'll just give them given everything that is on the agenda for the 12th of May yeah I think we just need to be really clear about what we ask what additional information were asking staff to provide so that we don 't then get a report come back when we have a whole bunch of other question so yeah so we call that it really identify what those are first of all it 's the legal liability particularly in relation to properties which have not been purchased by the crown but are identified and there and the red zone and quote marks yep I think I 'd like to see some more specific information and relations that cost benefit threshold yep yeah the UM the sub areas that were talked about that we 're cost effective for mitigation yeah dad use it really is there 's a summary at the back yeah that 's yeah the year page 21 which which but i have to say that when i when i read that i couldn 't quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not clear to me what that what that means are we able to get that if we can provide the more detail worksheets that actually explain how what what what inputs we in turn on what calculations were undertaken to get those to those figures let 's we can provide that that would be useful and then in the in the report back also perhaps could you you know undertake to include all of the additional information you provided yesterday in response to counseling those nice i provided me so i think it right nose up it would be useful to include those short yeah and the perhaps the local impies litre and perhaps any response that 's required to Tibet it just gets all of the issues together in one place yep although the report is about an area area wide mitigation yeah in fact the original request was in relation to communities and and it just seems to me that this is some submitters today we 're in fact that they 've been excluded from from all of us and I think if we could have some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like those and figure I think that would be really useful for us as a council into the community it doesn 't seem to be fair or reasonable that in fact they 'd be excluded on just a general basis that infect with the assumption of the be that the be you know applied the area wide thing only be applied to more than one property yet and the staff we 're asked to put together a paper on area-wide lean medication so that I 'm not surprised that that 's the case but is there and the work that you 've done the identification that potentially an individual property could meet their own protection needs and then would you have a conversation with that landowner about about pursuing a nun dividual solution well I mean we already have a process around individual solutions yeah and that 's been established by count there have been you know discussions with some landowners around that certainly my understanding is at least one of the one of the people you 're talking about is looking at area individual Rock Port protection structures but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do I need to do to protect my property is quite a different conversation than actually the conversation that says if you aggregate properties together for a while I think we talking about the same issue but the solutions could be quite different when you 're just talking about individual so no we haven 't gone down to individuals and we do have a process which allows individuals to put up cases and we have work with individuals who have put up cases around how they might do individual rock for protection structure for their properties and we 're available to continue to do that if I would just hope that that process can continue because that clearly is the concern that was expressed to us today well that 's a it 's an established policy of council so that continues absolutely I 'm looking at so mr. Dorman just advised me there 's a you want to pump yeah the process exists we 're talking with people on a regular basis the there is a time limit approaching on it and that the red zone offers have to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so if people want to avail themselves of the individual rock for protection structure funding and stay in a property they need to get their placate they need to get into a conversation with counsel quickly to get them through the process and the decision by the 31st of August and we are talking to people on that basis or literally all the time and there 's an increasing number of inquiries coming in as that date gets closer our people exploring the possibility of staying in a property with a rock for protection structure that 's part funded or funded by the council existing policy of December 2012 but what we haven 't done is gone around and Matt Brown the court put identifying individual properties that could be protected and contacting the property owners and the same you can come in here and and get some funding if you want to see there so we 've responded to inquiries coming in so um the I 'm just thinking of that legal advice at the top and it must be the lawyer coming out of me but I wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should rock full protection systems fail in the future because i haven 't the back of my mind you know a rock full protection measure that that did fail but it failed in the light of cliff claps which was not what it was designed to protect against yeah but but creating you know a I mean it worries me that we create a perception of safety that may not subsequently proved to hold true given you know the experience that we 've been through so i just wonder whether we could have that and there as well yep,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

1,V_AuKTNF1ro,20140507,1650.05,"Christchurch, New Zealand",4243,could we have the stuff for item 24 into the table please so a chief planning officer mike taylor and who else have we got mmm yes yeah no that 's fine if we will bring out some enough cheers right senior senior junior senior expert quantity surveyor we 've got a goal McFarland from urs who led a lot of the review work he 's currently trying to get here the small at this age so that 's who 's here think you would you like to take us through the report before we open it up for questions so this was a this was a report on as an outcome of councils request the in the last year before staff to look at the feasibility of area wide mitigation being applied to the portals and it was a piece of work that has been undertaken so at the outset as has been explained to counsel in the workshop we established a number of parameters to look at that so at the high level they look largely at things such as we need to have more than two privately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because obviously if we were only dealing with a single property we were looking at there 's already individual rock for protection available to those people following the council 's resolution in December 2012 we also looked at also some working M for that analysis so the at a macro level the work had to be technically feasible we looked at applying the solution to that as being in the working with a location that was the best for the properties do be protected that may not necessarily be the most convenient but it had to be the best location but and fundamentally one of the key ones was that we only we looked at a number of models around how you could deal with the fact that large portions of the land were increasingly being owned by the crown and over eighty percent of the properties that were red zone now owned by Sarah one of the one of the I suppose the fundamental parameters we started with was we we just we looked at those properties where and I suppose in some respects it 's shown on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because we were looking on the basis of the council 's making use of its otherwise fifty percent contribution to a red zone by out as the basis for the analysis we did not look at undeveloped land solemnly there was no housing on it we also does not look at land that was owned by the crown because the council was already liable for its fifty percent contribution to the crown for that purchase that has been made what we did not what what however what we did include were those properties that may have already been owned by the crown but were incidentally benefit could incidentally benefit from rockport protection structure so if you look at the little map on page three you 'll see that there were there 's two groups of eligible properties of the little property in between that may be owned by the crown but if that was incidentally protected by a potential rock for mitigation structure that was incorporated in our analysis we also then fundament so having defined the areas we were looking at no from the report that there were five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properties that fit that criteria we then look at what what was the most feasible method of protection and that fundamentally is either in this case a band or a fence and Ian Wright can talk to that if required and then we looked at the cost of providing those in the cost as you were well via where is around the cost of construction the cost of maintenance the cost of giving the land to actually cite those developments on that was a piece of work that was undertaken and there were a range of costings develop and obviously I know it 's been contentious before when we look particularly at rock fences we looked at not only what was the cost of establishing them but because they require regular maintenance at the cost of maintaining those particularly over there 50 year lifespan and as we know that from some of the failures that happened on the port hills some of the fences that have failed historically have been because either they were improbably specified or they were not maintained in a manner that meant that they can make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work that was undertaken of the five nodes that we looked at none of the nose had a BC are better than one so none of the nose actually the cost that council the the benefit of establishing that not outweigh the cost of actually contributing fifty percent that the council was working as its basis one of the key elements that we identified early on is that one way to perhaps address the the VCR was too in broad terms extend the range of properties that could be protected and invariably that leads you to a conversation with the minister and the crown about what was the Crown 's attitude to incorporating its properties into any form of area wide mitigation the minister and the mayor subsequently met in a number of questions were put to the minister and they largely formed in hi broadly they were would the crown be would be interested in making its land available to benefit from area-wide protection so would it reintroduce potentially development up there the second question is would have allow if it was not going to participate with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for protection structures to be sited on it and the third question was if neither of those applied would the crown be interested in allowing its land to be used for access for the purpose of building some area wide mitigation and the advice that we 've had back and the letters been circulated last night to you from sarah is that the minister has previously made his decision on not supporting urea why mitigation and is not interested in allowing the crown land to be used for that purpose will not hello Don will not allow saraland to be used for area-wide mitigation structures and I think remains open to using it for access should that be an outcome that can be a team on that basis the staff recommendation to you is that we do not consider that area wide mitigation basically fundamentally meets the criteria that were established and that fundamentally the council should continue to offer individual rock fall protection structure outcomes and that 's been available for some time a number of landowners are working through that process but their area wide mitigation not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were some questions do you want to yeah I know that you can eat abled some questions yesterday what Chum you 've provided a written response to quit quite late in the day so we might well I think everyone got a copy of those I think so yeah so MIT but kick it off honey okay thank you um so several questions and thinking for the way that you 've done to date whose christian really is a really cost share agreement my reading of the costco agreement that sees 3.3 the parties agree that of a cost-effective engineering solution can be identified and agreed by the parties which will reduce the life force from rock for rock roll so that the portholes RZ is no longer applicable to that area the cost of doing a feat to the greed solution for we should equally between them so what that tells me in terms of the agreement we 've got with the crown it 's not a case of them saying no it 's actually a case of us working at a cost effective solution I don 't quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he going against the cross year agreement what what I don 't understand how he can just unilaterally decide not to give effect to what we 've agreed to in the costume well I I can 't answer and I haven 't got the cost year in front of me and I 'm not I don 't have that material I don 't know that I mean my understanding is that the minister basically has been consistent in an approach that concept area-wide mitigation was rejected by him early on and that 's the red zone was the result of that and he 's participating and pursuing his policy of buying out land and the red zone or making it offer to individuals who who want to take advantage of them so I think that 's his policy framework for solving what he believes are the issues of high risk and the portholes yeah I know the reports is that is that port health counselors meet with the minister but we didn 't I think it was just the mere may have been it might have been others but soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song a group of counters that year so I knowledge that reflects incorrect so you know I don 't know if anyone at that meeting was aware of what was in the cost year but it seems to be one of the unresolved issues is the cost year agreement the report that went to council is vastly different to the cost share agreement the report that went to counsel that council agreed to sign up to in terms of the cost share see that all land adjacent to council reserves would be vested in Council well the cost the sign cost share agreement says up fifty percent have you had any explanation or being able to understand who changed it why they changed it without any men DET from council and what the government 's view is on there yeah i don 't think that that 's a question that our chief planning officer can answer I mean it 's not I mean no and I can 't I can and thank you for sending it material to me last night but I mean oh well that the pets 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directly out there one is I suppose in a the council 's contributing fifty percent of the cost of the red zone by out so there may be a reason why account the Crown has come back and said well actually you can have your potentially up to fifty percent of the of the of the land because we 're not one hundred percent purchaser of their land but I think I 'll also come back to the comment i also made that i think certainly from the work that we 've done technically i think there would be some real questions about whether it would actually be sensible or reasonable for the council to want to have all that one hundred percent of all that land because i think we would be interested in that land and we 've traditionally been internet land where it provides better access to our reserves as opposed to simply taking on additional land now that 's not quite direct answer but it 's a it 's a it 's a view that I think technically we we hold right so but I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief executive does anyone and I mean does anyone know how I mean because it kind of concerns we were the car share that you had a report that went to council the council agreed to and then these changes have been made after we 'd already agreed with government so I think at some stage it would be worth trying to get better information from the previous chief executive or the government over why that was changed to what we 'd already agreed with government so that we at least can understand why that 's happened because I still don 't have any sense of it that 's fine just I think there 's also an issue around a Zionist and we 've paid nothing for the rock full cost to the crown so we I don 't quite know what the process is so you know we 're spending money on the properties acquisition or mitigation which was what we agreed as council what is the property what is the price is for us either getting half the land or all the land and paying I think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future so we 're where we have agreed to contribute to individual rock fall protection structures the presumption there is that those people obviously are staying there so will not be accessing the government 's redzone buyout offer so that 's the end of our liability to to those property owners and the Crown 's presumably because the crown won 't need to pay anything for those i think as i pointed out in the in the notes i gave back to councillors last night the process for buying out and for us paying and then ultimately agreeing what land gets transferred to counsel or something that I think the Crown has indicated they will only look at once they 've once the buyout offers have expired they have resolved the residual issues they have with insurances on the perch on the properties they 've purchased and have finalized their future land use policy for the port hills so I think at that point we will be in a position to understand a what financial contribution we need to make because we don 't know the total sum of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to identify what land the council actually does want and how that might be transferred to us i think that 's still a process that 's likely to take place in two thousand late 2014-2015 we 've just heard that one of the east 12 force has been over tuned so that person has been able to return these properties below that that that we could even though it 's owned by sarah that possibly could have an s12 for removed could be houses that people could be living in so what work have you done on the basis of do we do any work as a council when s124 is overturned to reassess other s13 falls in that area recognizing that you know we 've got a housing issue in the city that we 've got if we 've had something challenged over tuned maybe some of our other assumptions aren 't quite as correct as they should be so what process have we put them face following that the overturning of these 124 to look at that debt area I know that at one point we did go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have an ongoing program of reviewing each one of them as a as an individual gets turned over or or confirmed I mean we 've had two that have been overturned I don 't know how many have been confirmed there 's only a handful in that process in this 15 all together so by far the majority of them are simply remaining there and I either have been evaporate because they 've transferred and as a contestable issue because they 've transferred into the crown ownership so now we have we don 't go through and then say okay on the base of the determination what are the other 12 fours and then the final question was the issue of liability just help me understand if someone 's but hasn 't taken up the volunteer offer in the red zone and they 're saying there then what is the liability situation with counsel if we don 't do rock for mitigation do we are we basically having an increased liability because we know there 's a hazard and we 've done nothing to address it I 'm probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a position about it because there was some legal work done by mr. Gilbert on that issue of liability to from mr. Mitchell can 't answer that yeah I think I mean the kid I suppose the key that we have is so I mean yeah I mean look at the key that we have going forward I suppose is to ensure that our districts plan provisions are adequate to manage future development on those cool hills now and that 's why I suppose the work that the council has been doing has been saying we need to take a more per quarter having had the change events and knowing what we know now we need to take a more precautionary event going forward we can 't undermine people 's existing use rights but we can manage development in the future on the port hills and so the work that we 're doing on the district plan will actually essentially make it more difficult for future development to occur in high-risk areas and i think i think that the point that council johansson raises is a good one I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what our obligations are two people because I mean at the moment the residential red zone is just is just a measure to enable people to accept her what a voluntary offer from central government so it 's not a zoning no there is no certainly the that 's correct the really don 't certainly isn 't so what is our legal obligation is actually a really good question to have answered so I think if we could just make a note of that it may form part of the resolution that we finally do something so maybe only thing we do need to distinguish that they Bend as a the count the council basically undertook and made decisions on the basis of the knowledge that it had round risk at the time and made reasonable decisions based on that that was profile obviously that 's change and so anything it 's the new rest that 's right yeah that 's right I 'm Vicki and then clean though could we just go back to good questions sorry in the submissions I think by Andrew and that was the section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sarah properties below him and potentially some of the ones around him would does that mean that the danger for them is not now as high as previously assists and it 's probably a duty question in vomit look our opinion is that there is an increase has a danger to those areas the section 16 cool notice was put on it at a very high level saying that that there were certain very strict criteria in other words a bowl that come close to a pastor dwelling but other areas the work of portholes geotech groups it wisely advised us that these areas have the same components so that were there for at very high risk so we would our approaches to keep those on until that has a risk can be mitigated so if the risk has been is not now they 're on the Andrews property alright sorry I I disagree that the risk is not there there is a risk there it 's whether it 's an acceptable amount of risk and that was the the debate on the one to four but that 's but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah so they 've said that the life risk is not over our threshold I might have to check with Donald actually commented on the outlook on the Mount of lifeless done is the most important one spot pastor back I 'd can 't recall the exact wording I know that phone knows in the exact wording cuz he 's sitting behind going ask me ask me no the answer what was Willie come forward fella the orders in council which changed the building aunt was if there is a risk then the East one foot 24 should remain a risk in me determined there was not a risk no risk at all right okay hi I thought I disagree with it you cannot say that there 's no risk at all no no no but but but the thing is is that I mean again this is another question that perhaps we should get an answer to which is the because it 's about tolerable life risk and it 's about that what 's something that I can never say 1 to the power of 10 to the minus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we need to find out whether the section 124 notices were lifted because that threshold wasn 't me could just clarify yes but please be aware that a non logitech engineer but what we do know is that individually in the same way that there are properties and I 'll explain this to counselor for you because when you look at it in the detail there are properties which can certainly extort of each other and quite have quite different levels of risk yes so simply removing one because there are unique circumstances that mb have looked that doesn 't necessarily mean that i definitely applies but the question remains have weary looked at the ones that Sarah owns on the lower area no it was IV place not as a complete review are we intending to do that we 'll sit 0 of the owner of those that 's something they would do if they wish to yeah Glen thank you my questions over the basis of the report obviously you see before you 've arrived at your recommendation and it didn 't fit certain criteria so that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be carried out at all you 're saying in terms of what the report what you 're asked to do for the report which is area-wide mitigation that in your view it doesn 't stack up that 's correct I mean and that 's the reality the council could choose to change whatever parameters that shows is it wish to fund more than fifty percent that would change the parameters if if as we we tried to test with the minister if Sarah properties were to be included that may change the the financial equations but working on the parameters that we adopted that 's the art so that we came to yep it is it both I mean is it it 's not just that you include the syrah properties but make the Sarah properties available for the macys yes yes they would have to be they would have to be come into being a though that the benefit would accrue from them being reoccupy available to be reoccupied be rebuilt on Korea yeah yeah so it 's a bigger it 's just bigger than just being of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that parameters could be changed such as five point total to over the cost-benefit ratio in terms of costs till only talked about 105 for four or five remember you correctly filled for rock protection you talk about a hundred thousand and then sip Vickers here are in the millions I 'm just curious as to how their secondary excuse me sorry we can 't have I did I did allow you to respond to a particular issue but and two words extraordinary discrepancy have just come to mind so how you here we can explain it discrepancy between a hundred thousand end I think two million well we I mean you use the word discrepancy there 's a difference in figures and we need we don 't I mean I 'm not sure how phil has constructed it because I 'm very confident about how we 've constructed hours and Dave and speak to that as you on but as we 've outlined for us it 's around the the type of engineering work to be undertaken and as I 've pointed out looking not only at the construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs and and I think if there 's one lesson that we learned from the earthquake is that actually the reality of maintaining a high level of protection up there is addressing whole of life costs not simply the cost of a river,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Appointment,pk_j8T7-M8c,20140507,1114.73,"Christchurch, New Zealand",2969,"to Andrew and Phil are you joined or other are they separate deputations okay for free you know guys the usual rule is 10 minutes but if you want to it if you want questions at the end or anything that 's included in the 10 minutes I 'll be reasonably liberal but just that 's a general I understanding from these cylinders look he was that they had made a deputation request separately okay I 'll be incredibly liberal right okay okay we 're in your hands the first two deputations we made regarding the feasibility of area-wide mitigation not just in our area as an example but Phil and I were talking to a broader context as well too it 's just coming back to the report that 's coming through from the council staff and all been privy to and to say we 're a bit disappointed this is putting it mildly and again just a quick recap just within our area to we were you know again we were quite surprised just looking at a presentation we made need the geotechnical advice we had that area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the slide the houses are below the yellow line is Captain Thomas track that 's one council reserved the bluffs are circled in blue a lot of you will have already seen us before I 'm again just from the vantage point from the sides the yellow lines and the dotted lines demark survey the area we 're referring to about 20 houses our house is outlined in red and it 's quite straightforward for us we 've had our s124 lefted so then we 're back it up house now so that 's good news and and again though what comes into context is that when we originally made this presentation this is why it 's a similar slide is that we made it on the basis that we were the only house within that side of the road about already houses who actually were still seeking to return back to her house and seeking Rock protection for our house and which were perfectly happy to move forward we just think that there 's a missed opportunity and again it seemed to have to keep coming back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mandate went out to the council staff to review the feasibility of area wide mitigation what we were very surprised about was the fact that our area was completely missed and as far as we read in the report one of the key criteria was that we were the only private homeowner and because Rock protection funding provided by the council was available therefore there was no purpose in meeting in looking area whereas our argument from the very beginning was simply put if there is a mandate if it is feasible regardless who owns the houses to protect that area then there is the opportunity for the council and Sarah to recoup costs and because of that we are extremely disappointed because the remit they went out ended up showing that we were completely bypass and other areas were shown to be not meeting the cost benefit threshold I 'm just briefly before moving to the bigger context here you know again the area wide mitigation review we need to be put in context relating to our area and there has comments been from the professionals here council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant drainage and ongoing maintenance issues which you may have heard about in sumner including leading to flooding and that 's relating to our neighbors who are currently owned by sarah and i 'm having to do a favor to work to clean their drains i 'll talk about the s12 for status in just a moment relating to our neighbors this is a quick snapshot of our houses around these are our neighbors and this is relating to how tired the area looks I know a lot of areas around christchurch may look tired but these houses yeah they need some tidying up but there that actually in good Nick I was I there so you know it comes down to sort of putting perspective the original request and how it 's been interpreted by council staff and we one of the things we 'd ask the counselors to put back to the staff is to either revisit their the original request and in a more open mind in what manner and second of all just in the context of FRS 124 was reverse maybe some simpler options available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up for the houses below us I 'm not saying that they actually have them you know emotions or anything I need to be stood out for but simply that you know if RS 124 is lifted and there 's immediately five houses below us that in shouldn 't theory have their s124 lifted which in theory would mean that they are viable to be put back on the market in Christchurch City Council and maybe Sarah to can start looking to reclaim some costs from those possibly without even having to you know put an extensive outlay into putting area-wide mitigation so I guess there 's maybe some possible solutions to think about some simpler ones in the early phase prior to maybe looking at spending more money there and yes probably that 's what we were looking at putting back to use either to consider rejecting the report and asking Council staff to revisit with a in a broader perspective and which is a bit frustrating and or for example referring on to perhaps G overt who was involved initially pull you back when for a process of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this point ask Phil to comment as well to would would anyone like to have some questions about what Andrews presented or would you like me to just ok I just wanted to go back to the s12 Ford there has been removed from your project right so the previous slide said if the s12 for has been removed from your property your argument is that quite logically then the properties below yes good can you go back to that slide before just so they look at the wording of that because I 'm no engineer and don 't know the area very well so do you know what the logical argument is to lift the houses sorry if I want to fall has been review Association right yeah so what 's the issue with that what are they saying is the problem with the houses but also there 's this thing left because of our house has the s124 lifted right and that in order to go through that process you need to apply to mbie for that process determination so it needs to be done in a house-by-house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess reacquired required by the crown or at least the property then I guess our perspective is that you 're sitting on an asset crisis city council and Sarah sitting on an asset that simply needs someone to step up and and represent them both its 124 still remain on those house Tyrell oh you and your argument as if yours has been removed it 's quite logical but that one because they 're not being lived and no one is requesting for this one to four to be lifted yes H can be determined that the Andrews help houses below him obviously will be in the same yeah Sarah Sarah happy the overall and you actually i 'll go to bets and maybe bad one yeah what do you think that one there linear yeah so our house is in red and and so the line this this of you could argue this to tears ours is the uppermost along this four or five houses along that line and then below em there 's until lower summon avail you 've got I believe it 's 34 32 28 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so you 've got number one on the very corner that 's green that 's neelam Bev 's house then you 've got three a B and five so argued with in that lower threshold you 've got one two three four five six seven houses in theory that should have their s124 lifted nuts to consider all that on a technical basis all of those houses within that yellow precinct they 're subject to the same risk and have the same slope go characteristics did Andrew 's house and indicates that all of those houses are actually at no risk from an awful yeah and I guess I guess I put in context that you know technically a determination would need to be done for the hills that the house is adjacent to us to really get an honest I guess review about the threat to each individual house so I didn 't really want to extend it to the house scientist but I guess logically you could say it 's reasonable that they would they would have an equal chance to have their s 124 over so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting on a simple asset prior to investing getting a lot of money investing a lot of money and that 's crudely with it that red line which was put forward to us and on Captain Thomas by geoscience New Zealand that 's the length of the Bund they proposed for about four less than a million dollars and unjust in context I think you still share the amount to for demolition and those costs arguably you know if it 's I think the tenders are about 25,000 it 's reasonable to assume that be more expensive on the hillside so you 're probably looking for about 20 houses you know over five hundred thousand dollars for demolition so argument again is if you 're going to spend the money why don 't you spend it recouping those costs can I just ask you into a wee bit more get the costume so like I understand from the report and for what you 've said that the reason that your your home has not been included in the cost benefit information we have from council staff is that it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an assumption was that it would need to be more than one house before it was actually included that 's what i read from the project so what I 'm wondering is do you do you have heat have you obtained or any estimated costs to actually provide mitigation by way of a band or a fence for your property individually yes you can you tell us what they want that 's 150 thousand dollar zero night so we have we have site access challenges thing on the slope so that 500 cars yeah so is it balance it up because we could go for a fence option which would allow easier transfer and placement of of the protection but it would it would require more frequent ongoing and costly maintenance over time as opposed to putting abundantly we 're actually looking at a two-tier bun system because there 's a couple of banks already cut in above our house and we 've had advice that if those are sort of reinforced then they you know the their profile is lower and but more than sufficient to absorb the energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dig her up behind the house in order to achieve that and your house is it 's ours right up to count on Thomas I see and Captain Thomas we assume is owned by by council it would be the obvious place to put protection yeah and again thats may be part of the context as well too is that there is as far as understanding agreement where land adjacent to council reserve is returned to the council and i guess maybe if it 's off not off the top to suggest that the land is returned and with the housing intact the housing stock intact without it being demolished leaving it to the council to make a decision on what to do with that kicks in any other questions my apologies for being late this morning too and so it 'll be good to hear from Phil L me as well because Phil also recruited a separate reputation so no and getting who 'd Phil Phil 's case ships I just wonder if we yes so I 've hadn 't quite caught up with we we 've got food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes thanks I 'm I 'm here to say to this council please reject this report it 's not what was asked for by the mirror and the port hills counselors in the first place it lacks any sort of technical rigor at lacks the next completeness and please go back and get this reviewed by by such people as G overt and McAfee who are world experts in this region that they have indicated they 're willing to do so secondly I 'd like to say about the cost sharing agreement between the government and council Sarah saying that they 're not going to make land available for rock fall protection and that they will not enter into any rock full protection agreements which which safe houses to me it 's it 's it 's it 's renege on that on the cost sharing agreement that they made clause 3.3 clearly clearly says that that if solutions can be found in then it will be revisited clause 3.2 is inconsistent with what the what the council resolved last year the resolution that the council made was the council would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what was actually agreed was that the council is only going to get fifty percent of the land that was adjacent to its reserves and that 's this is a wrong we need to revisit this with agency anyone got any questions for Phil Phil the costs are estimated costumes of any any any further mitigation behind your own property okay well I can speak about my property with some certainty but my estimates for putting in rock fall protection from my property are in the order of a hundred thousand dollars that includes land acquisition and in compliance costs you your council your staffs report came up with 2.7 million or 2.9 million I 'm sorry I don 't get it but what has been proposed and the reporters as a slope remediation above our house and then offense with ongoing life costs the obvious solution for our house is in fact abundant and there is no point in doing any slope remediation which they have included the cost of 800,000 for it just lacks any technical rigor at all that 's a you know at that a hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's going on it 's wrong Danny thank you what what other concerns seems to be from some people prob possibly the minister that there 's a liability issue so the red zone in the fort Hills address is the liability issue can just tell us from your point of view you know as I understand it actually there 's this rocks on council-owned property that affect some of the properties in the red zone so can you just help me understand maybe comment on you know in terms of liability regardless of whether people take the volunteer offer or not where does that sit and who 's responsible the council will not absorb itself of us for a lot better liability and in this issue that council clearly had liability for their rocks so the lack of rock fall protection means that although some properties have been bought out by sarah and and therefore the problem has gone away in that regard there are still many many properties that are subject to rock roll from council owned land which are not going to be protected and and could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rock fall protection is an ongoing problem for the council with regard to our property we still contend that although we are we are very willing to to cooperate with the council in getting rock fall protection in place we contend that it is an issue that the council needs to address we 're not going away we 're not taking the red zone offer just so I 'm clear so basically as I understand what you 're saying is if we do nothing to mitigate the rock for us then we actually increase our liability well yes that 's right because you 're you know clearly well well aware of the issue way more so than before the earthquakes is there any other questions thank you very much what I 'm going to propose that we do is that we move to item 24 on the agenda so that we can deal with this matter straight away while you all still here thank you thanks very much","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

New Zealand",3622,"um it just seems to me that that additional sort of hazard in relation to the soils on the port hills is some of the mess of gum trees in the aleko suitability for those soils so have we got using in the plane regarding those I guess they 're there now or does it have to come under Andrea trees policy can you recognize only an example is that for example on Kashmir whole a good number of the hugely high in graceful Australian gum trees okay here collapsed and there 's been some soil movement with them and that 's been in here in times of heavy rainfall for and when one throw and destabilizing there 's a very mixed at feeding about vegetation because on the one side especially gum trees are often planted because they reduce the water table they lower the pick it up they make up the so that they supposed to help trees also supposed to help is a rock Bob area as well so we there 's no clear indication either way as far as I 'm aware we don 't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be interesting to examine further because when that for example the branches lean right over an effect like a cliff you could call it okay it end I saw it was some movement just in the last two weeks which has impacted on on some some of the residents though including movement of retaining walls and you 've got it you 've got a question their value well the rescue ially of of of them being in this location I agree they can be a hazard there is nothing in the plan at the moment to remove trees gum trees or any other kind of true she talked about talking about trees it was if you look in the other book no not necessarily not necessarily I mean a lot of these trees they may not be owned by council they might be privately owned hmm you can imagine a situation where resource consent application was put in through this process and in an assessment measure or an assessment of that resource consent application might say something about the trees and that 's the that you could probably look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are mitigating or whether they are accelerating the erosion so I can imagine it a site by site assessment of a resource consent that you could bring in some guidelines about you know which trees are helpful which ones aren 't this agree with Bridget there 's nothing at the moment suggested mmm yeah I have to say though being raised in the North Island poo toccoa trees are just the same it 's not just gum trees that this relates to so they have you know depending on the time of their life and whatever you know they can be useful and then all of a sudden they they took over into I guess getting older and losing grip on the next agree point again dunbar by lab there was a whole plantation of pine trees with a heavy rain event and a major wind event they will blow over yeah int y la pluie over and ms due to the swirl I would imagine this really shallow routing anyway finally is it to be shallow roofing but it 's not necessarily a reason not to plant trees though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refer consoles to to map 46 because there 's quite a few areas of mass movement identified the air including the massive movement two and three so you 'll as you look you can find either hillsboro dear borough terrace or bow and Vale Avenue both have the mouse movement two or three and it 's of the mass movement to as the wide spaced diagonal O notation green colored and then that the three is sort of vertical purple closer together notation so you can see defectively along the sides of the valleys there with the hillsborough terrace and Barone bell avenue running along the bottom the valley in terms of the issues we 've had not a lot of feedback and I think that might reflect the fact that people living in the fort Hills have been supplied with a lot of information through the the polls geotech group and you know the fact that they 've been red zone so they 've had a lot of informations many of them not all of them of course from the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority and the council and saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good attendance at meeting that we had at Red Cliffs during the consultation fees and as a result of the consultation we have looked at the boundaries of the cliff hazard and rock for one in two areas and with using the expert advice from the scarer geotech officer as well as our in-house advisor here in right we 've worked through and managed to amend mapping on approximately 55 of the sites and the cliff hazard management area and just over 60 in the rock for hazard management one areas so what I need to explain here too is that the modeling is very good at an area wide basic basis but when it comes to the site specific basis it needs that ground truth and although we have had some ground truthing again at an area wide basis it wasn 't necessarily done at a site specific basis to then inform anything so we 've effectively done that we 've responded to some individual property owners feedback but we 've done it on on their own initiative as well and that 's largely meant that a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed entirely from those those mapping areas or only a part of the site now remains and so that was a very useful exercise also it 's part of the feedback and both from private owners and from from the council staff themselves and other larger larger owners we 've identified that prohibited activity status as a bit too black and white and stating the obvious but you know there 's always exceptions and we 've found that in combination with the way that the modeling can be implied it can be misinterpret site specific features like for example and a several times a steep slope has been interpreted by the model as a cliff collapse area when the actual review identified that anomaly had made that sort of thing and also we 're rockfall had been identified and in fact mitigation had been applied with in recent times over the last couple of years and so that hazard mapping for the rock field didn 't apply so in combination of those sort of things made us realize that prohibited activity status as to owner us for cliff collapse and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back a little bit and I apologize in advance now that the the table at Phi rule 5 10 should highlight the activities not sure which numbers there is in ce9 and NC 11 as part of the rule table 5 11 1 should be highlighted in red and the the rules that proposing will go from prohibited activity status to non-complying to enable that and those unique and reasonably discreet situations where we may need to consider the resort through a resource consent process some development proposal whether it 's for example somebody wanting to develop a a driveway or some other aspect of their site to give them some further protection or rebuild something that 's been damaged to the earthquakes it 's page 28 okay looking for it I 'm clear I you say this basically no prohibited activities and any of these areas now I 'm sorry I can 't do this part of you there 's no prohibited activities any of these areas so how do we align that with a whole red zone with people if being told it 's too risky and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave and we 've got s124 as well I think like I said there are exceptions and we 're not anticipating that this rule would be taken up it 's a non-complying activity status where we 're confident that our policies are strong enough to give that sort of direction they can general development in these areas will be avoided but if there are unique circumstances where some sort of development could be acceptable then we 've got that opportunity to consider it it 's from my point of view I 'd rather see us have a process by which those in a prohibited area could get an exemption or an exception rather than just like at the moment everyone 's really focused on the risk and you know and we 've been we 've had a Royal Commission and nothing quite critical of he can and council in terms of how we how we our our land use planning and how we allowed activity to occur but over time people kind of you know as we move forward into the future people get a little bit more relaxed they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was with a higher level of risk because it 's not as real so I guess I just want to really you know I think it just seems to me that there needs to be some areas where you just I mean you just couldn 't imagine people ever building a house just an answer to your question counselor and I said we provided you with us again just as a reminder or acrylic sheet about the different types of consent activity status that you can have an in fact you can 't have a prohibited status and then provide for exemptions to it you can 't accept any kind of consent if it 's a preferred prohibited activity and that 's why as Fiona said we can never crystal ball gays and know that there isn 't some situation and all of that area where there can be a particular site because of its geology that it 's sitting on it may be protected by certain things if it 's a prohibited activity that they can never get a consent for it but if it 's non-complying and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how all the effects can be can be avoided remedied or mitigated etc and it 's also subject to all the objectives and policies of the plan if they can show all of that then they can get that consent but that 's that 's the highest bar and planning terms that you can I guess you know we 've had three years of work find the earthquake to understand the geotech risks I cannot accept that there are no areas that we 've identified that are not ever suitable for develop I mean there must be areas with identified that are just simply not acceptable for development that you just I mean this class that you 've just you just need to look at some of the stuff going up driving to summer we look up and you go there is no way anyone we should ever be allowed to build on that cliff edge so you know as it is there other other as there are another group of a separate group of areas that you could basically go they definitely should be prohibited and then there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which could be more you know looked at going cool yeah I 'm just before in does and I 'm quite happy to defer to Ian because he 's the specialist and GA tech issues but of course that 's the way this this council can choose whether it wants to do exactly that prohibit certain areas are not allow for any exceptions in any case or it can go the non-complying way the way that we 've proposed at the moment is non-complying but I think it 's a good idea to defer to their geotech here who can tell you whether or not they 're over one hundred percent sure that an area is safe or not until each side has looked at on its on the basis of that site not so much interested in without their sites that you can look at that you can say it was unsafe and now it 's safe I guess what I 'm really interested in is one of the areas you 've looked at that there 's just there would never be acceptable level of development allowed because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too far too much so the decision was prohibited for I think any risk greater than 1 10000 annual individual fertility us for cliff collapse now that 's probably we 've now gone the other way as it will it and we know with the model there 's issues and there especially on the margins of the model where that the clips reduced down to the side so we 've gone we don 't you can 't put a hand over heart and say we you know for every property in this region that it 's a good call so we hedge our bets will go non-compliant and then we 'll look at each individual when it comes up and consent if we want to stack it a bit further then I would recommend we go to the gns model and you take the 10 to the minus 2 or the 10 2-3 line which is one in ten chance or one and a hundred chance etc of dying and you look where those are and you literally are standing under a cliff in that and I from a technical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that that higher bar because those are factors of 10 worst risk every time those to me would be the cases where you just go well you won 't even get a GA tech person to walk to under in there and look at it because you 'll decide no place like it 's too scary so I think within the gns model information we have that ability you if we wanted to go to that level so it doesn 't that seem sensible I mean if you couldn 't get a DNS person to walk on that space how would you ever allow somebody to build on that space isn 't what you said just like in line with what yannis suggesting we 're so so we had gone to the 10 to the minor one in 10,000 risk line and said everything above that is non-compliant so you would have to convince council again I 'm not a concert a resource but it 's a high bar that you have to jump over to get Commission what I 'm saying technically we have information that grades the level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we could actually put it as prohibited be in the current and what we 're suggesting here actually allowed people if they can get resource consent to build on those very high levels of risk now its non-compliant but there are a number of criteria that has to be assessed there 's no prohibited activity as Fiona said at the moment but one would suggest that it be highly unlikely that somebody would want to go and build and these areas that are known to be extremely risky it 's probably the ones slightly further away and on the edges ian has seed now you have to be careful because council has a rock rejection structure guideline that shows people how if they want to live in the red zone which is typically great and then 10 to the minus will risk can go about doing so by mitigating the risk so we do have a so I I can 't see why we would allow people to build in an area that is incredibly dangerous and that high risk areas that you 're talking about going up so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canna system and just clarifying the way the RMA provisions help us here the the current proposal here is that an activity in particular locations it 's deemed to be a non-complying activity and you 've got proposed objectives and policies in the plan that say we don 't want people building in places where the risk is intolerable and so whilst the plan would enable someone to apply for that non-complying activity chances are the councillors consent authority under the RMA is going to decline that application if the assessment is that the risk is too high now that 's that 's option one for plan provisions and that 's what we 've got here option two for plan provisions which was quite properly raised as as an option for consideration as that you break that category down into two categories or three categories so it is possible to break that category down further so yeah ring-fence some of those locations and say well no the council doesn 't want to even allow someone to apply for a resource consent in that area will deem it to be prohibited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I cannot see that we can even begin to put people 's put such risk around such developments and I am not willing to entrust that to a future turn planning committee of any sort it just seems to me if the scientific explanation is that this is incredibly risky then don 't for God 's sake build Rhea it just seems really clear and the other question I have about it is or the question I have about it is whose liability is it when that building collapses onto other people down on the road or wherever they are councils if the council has exercised its decision-making role appropriately under the RMA there isn 't liability under the RMA for a planning decision click on that now because part of our decision-making process at the moment is are we exercising our decision-making process properly we 're being told that some of these spaces have extreme risk and then we 're being suggested that we allow subject to resource consent for building to go on them I can 't get those things no I don 't think that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm saying these are not prohibited activities and saying the only responsible decision is that that 's a prohibited activity on spaces which are clearly not safe and if I 'm told by an expert that they 're clearly not safe I 'm willing to listen to that and not take that chance it would be part of the space because as in said it 's a one and ten thousand risk that these non-complying activities relate to so it might be the one and one in two or three thousand areas so it 's it 's an area weather net that might then come become prohibited which which can be done which we have the information for and then the remainder of it remains non-complying it makes a lot of sense so you know you might have 10 to the minus 4 to 10 to the minus 3 that you have a non-compliant and because it 's in one of those kind of gray areas I think there 's been a science applied to the zoning into some of the gns stuff I think the point that was made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had that work some areas haven 't so there will be things that come up that are anomalies because there 's just the scale of doing that work will take time but there will be areas that we know that are really really risky that actually if engineers won 't walk under then no one should be able to get a consent to build so whether it 's ten to the minus three or ten to the minus two that 's probably that you know we need to think about what would be the areas and it would be interesting to get a map and see what are the areas that would really be prohibited yes absolutely um so it would be for cliff and mass movement area one that we would be looking at that for so those are the highest risk areas all the same risk to life but rock fall would be the big Russell Yin aerial extent okay the greatest groan okay so um can I just get agreement you would like us to map what might be considered prohibited as part of their those areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minus 2 up to 10 to the minus 2 factor I would start at ten to the minus 3 and above okay","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

New Zealand",5571,ok Audrey dead it 'll come back to you what is part of the revisions big time in terms of the red zone but so again I 'm not quite sure how far everything that goes but I look at these maps and I look at the red zone I go well it 's a voluntary offer but it 's not actually a district plan zoning so it 's quite confusing to see the red zone on here because red zone actually means nothing it just means that you know up until August the government will give you a volunteer offer but but how do we going forward a part of this chapter actually fill in the those areas with the planning mechanisms but why do we have them in here should we actually be taking them out we could do it 's under information only those red zones so the general public can can relate the notations that we have for natural hazards to that area that 's been Reds owned by Sarah but you 're quite right it is information only they don 't need to be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that and communicating with the public that they have found it useful because as I see it there 's a little bit difficult to read these maps and to zoom into them and they have found that useful but in terms of context in time identify their property so i presume the status of the red zone land as as what we explain to people that that has been developed by the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority under a separate process but in terms of like planning it but if they 're planning we it doesn 't have any of these know so whatever so information only in its work we put over like it 's not ask we move the rock wall hazard one for example to represent the red zone essentially so that rock for hazard one covers the red zone with issues of with one 's to a cadet or boundary and the others but they have been reconciled so will the red zone so where I 've got like red zone it has no cross hatch hatch over what is what does that actually mean it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be Earthquake Recovery Authority has different criteria for developing its red zone and we 're made aware of that I think you know the general sense while they haven 't necessarily acknowledged that themselves it 's fairly obvious that they have and you know that 's a wide breadth of things not just about the hazard but also about social and economic issues we 're both authorities of use the council and that authority have used the same information to inform their mapping but we 've got different criteria that are applied so they 've got wider coach of other criteria that they apply we 've got the criteria under the Resource Management Act and the various sexy documents that have been developed under their act as well as aesthetic documents prepared by the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority in concluding its recovery strategy and its land use recovery maybe to try a different way if I 'm a landowner in the red zone at the moment and I don 't accept the volunteer offer from the crown I 'm living in my house yes and i see i can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this map what what does this actually tell me well they make you see their africa some of those lanes of landowners have a twitter feed this is very helpful to us because we understand although it 's not really what we want to hear that gives us an understanding of what the council proposes doing with the saline that 's what I 've been saying I think that 's a question us know if there 's no cross hatching or any kind of zoning which map is it come on 47 they look at Martindale 's road reads own dear that 's basically got um as far as I can tell ya know sort of zoning over X I presume it just reminds us living hills well of course we haven 't dealt with it living Hill zoning yet that 's phase two but there is something there there is both the liquefaction line so that purple puse line it 's red zone yes so so we effectively got some a liquefaction i hazard identified there and we 've also got the green to syria which catches anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement we 've got that concern for those sloping areas so we 're also at the time of subdivision would require a geotechnical see some of those areas that that man is probably liquefiable is flat that piece that you 're looking at so the information from gns for the port hills is on sloping land that piece that you 're looking at at home getting it right has been categorized worse than tc3 basically so it 's viable lambs instead and we haven 't come to that hazard yet yes yes their truth notation if you go back to the legend and look for that liquefaction notation and the remainder of port hills remainder foothills and beings peninsula notation so that 's about the liquefaction zat the top well approximate the legs affection line proximately goes up to the nineteen meter contour so there 's a little bit of arbitrariness there but we 're fixie and it 's also bit difficult to show the the notation clearly so that 's why the fictive leave is a gap there between the liquefaction and the remainder of the port hills controlled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did interpret them as one adjoining the other and so one one side of the line and I mean it 's always a little bit arbitrary with these any sort of mething especially if we 're trying to met that the hazard and the risk per se rather than are as it falls rather than trying to bring it to the cadastral boundary we 're trying to be fair here so we 're just identifying whether hazard lies we don 't I don 't know you 'd have to ask the apsara about that the organization Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority and a bigger context if you are late if you haven 't sold your land on any red zone say for example in the east and you 've kept it and you can now subdivide it 22 because of the residential one changes are you able to do that do the current plan provisions apply if you are in the red zone say the whole word zone we are coming to their and the presentation but you 'll be aware also that Sarah shortly to go out on for consultation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our jurisdiction those areas that are red zoned and our district there must be subject to some sort of planet and they will be there will be as I 've series about to go out on no I 'm not worried about Sarah if I want to do that now and I 'm a red zone owner in avondale can I go and do what I want to do by just coming to the city council no no I can 't do is read zoned that now that area is now under the jurisdiction of Sarah no i haven 't sold it sorry off i haven 't sold let 's just say yes the city plane still applies to it but thank you okay right excellent I think we need to get some really clear communication around if I 'm redsound here 's what it actually means we know that the revaluation has basically said Elaine 's worthless but actually you can apply for a consent if you get geotech support you can build so if it just needs to be something that 's really clear about we haven 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in stage two of the chapters yeah I think it needs to be brought forward that 's that 's my dear can 't we haven 't done that work yet counselor because we haven 't seen also what 's being proposed by Sarah but that is a part of stage 2 it doesn 't matter what Sarah do yeah well and possibly because the offers expired and the flat actually it 's more relevant to the people in the Hills who urgently need to know who based on if we 're going to resign them from being able to do anything because they 're in the red zone or if we just need because they still have a few months before the final it 's correct that 's what people are wanting to have this chapter out there and notified so that they can understand and have some certainty about what the council 's wanted to do in these areas before they make the decision on their red zone offers and so that is why we 've listed at the top of the slide relationship with sierra red zone and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not by a lot of people but one or two have raised that and they 've said well this is recklessly we know it 's not the information that i want to know that I 'm in a cliff collect area but it is useful to us to help us make a decision some of those people are very advanced they 've got geotechnical advice they 're talking to the Sarah advisor as well as their in-house advisors and they 've got the engaged their own other people in this terrible sort of no-man 's land between eqc and the insurance company and you know having trouble told to by the insurance company that they possibly can they can rebuild their house whereas their technical advices is telling them something different there 's or every scenario you can think of and so some of these people we 've referred them to the community support side of the council we 've had these issues raised we 've come back we 've talked with Aaron house people like Ian and Peter doolan and we 've worked through the processes and so overall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very positive and I think we haven 't had the degree of feedback that we 've had for the flooding of areas but I think that 's largely because there is very a lot of communication going towards these people and they are you know a little bit more proactive generally than some people on the plan one last hazard for us to cover before we finish this chapter that 's select perfection she 's speaking us very quickly it 's only a couple of slides on this one can hook it onto the next yeah and so there 's nothing my eyesight 's not particularly good but what we 've done here is showing you the line that Jonnie was talking about council yani was 20 work before a line going down christchurch dividing in the liquefaction areas we 've got this line here you see there the series liquefaction assessment area too and most of the christchurch city flat area is liquefaction assessment uriel one and I suspect the bit that Jonnie was talking about was in this little button here which was liquefaction assessment area 1 so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said one means it needs more assessment and into is probably an area that liquefaction still needs to be assessed but it 's unlikely to be as troubled couple semester we want to be into one being towed you want to be up to the web maids you don 't want liquefaction problems won 't be on the way unless you you might want to be in one if you can find a piece of tc3 land that 's actually TC true when you do your detailer court report because then that could be quite economically viable to build on so yeah either way the point being that we 've divided the city into two assessment areas for liquefaction but one of the changes that we 've got in terms of them from the previous version of the chapter that we gave you was that we originally proposed it in a two we continue with control subdivision activity status because well it 's an area that 's less affected but in LA a1 it would be restricted discretionary activity to enable that application to be declined since that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be treated in the city so that both areas are now restricted discretionary activity anyway so that 's one issue that has changed as a result of the way the plan has gone through Alan did you want to comment on why restricted discretionary is now throughout the whole city so the distinction between the lines in terms of subdivision is of no real merit at the moment except that when it comes to assessing those subdivision restricted discretionary subdivision applications there 's a little bit more onus in the laa one to get you dear technical assessment done possibly more thoroughly and more more boreholes and more work done to actually assess that my perfection if it was if you 're in LA too and it 's found to be very similar to some of the areas on La a 1 well then you 'll still have to do the same level of liquefaction assessment to get your subdivision consent so it 's about the amount of information that is required between those two areas in terms of your subdivision consent but in both cases they can be declined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussions that we had with mb we 've done some tweaking to the information requirements right at the very end of the chapter we 've got information requirements for areas prone to lip perfection and we 've amended that to be more consistent for subdivision because it 's they 're both in the same area now for subdivision but also to make it clearer in terms of their intention to create some further intensification around the key activity centers what does this do it presumably makes it much harder to subdivide restrictive discretionary activity means that the council can decline it but I 'm in some of those intensification areas there 's there 's a non notification closed cause for the social housing and for the what 's the other one called the CHD oh yeah okay it 's a house to develop interior yeah that those two areas what we 've got if you look at the very roles we 've actually identified some intensive areas where we think that more assessment is needed in those areas i 'll just get the actual rule for you it 's some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basically says that when you 're on the larger sites like 1500 square meters or more and you qualify as a restricted discretionary activity for intensification under any of these roles that are listed then these additional assessment matters on the right hand side will need to be taken into consideration so in terms of their Hut enhanced development mechanism in the community housing redevelopment mechanism there 's also a clause on the left hand side that says they won 't require written approvals and shall not be publicly notified on limited notified but VIN it for any other intensification caught by that role there 's a potential for it to be notified yep so it 's an assessment measure it 's not changing the status it 's saying that if the residential section says that you can be able to discretionary activity to do these intensification projects well then that 's the same status but we 've added in this assessment matter just to make sure that look affection doesn 't fall off the radar in terms of assessing unrestricted discretion activity which you might recall the council has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its discretion over and if we don 't list liquefaction then for these intensification areas the council won 't have any this in 10 Fitzwilliam 0 we 've actually reported up to Sarah and I think they 've accepted up this is an alignment with envy requirements anyway to have to do these kinds of assessments geotech assessments this has been to the Christchurch drawing officials committee which includes Sarah and they haven 't raised an issue with us at this stage let 's you understanding Ella that 's right yeah but they haven 't they haven 't said they 're concerned about it now it 's just an assessment matter it doesn 't change the status of the activity ask so the areas that got really badly a figure by liquefaction I presume most of them the worst worst ones will have been red zoned so when i look at your matter if you get to swept back to the map of the city what you what you 're telling me is basically there 's the West which is generally l2 so that 's you know not as not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city is in the same category so why wouldn 't in the red zones we 've had bad liquefaction you have a third category that requires a much greater level of care or mitigation or whatever remediation when we 've had discussions with Indy they have been very very strong that we don 't use their technical categories so all the land and crushes has been technical categorized 1 2 3 plus the red zone basically take it easy for I suppose if you 're going to going to add that sort of philosophy to the red zone so they 've been quite strong and saying not to use those technical categories in the district plan and there 's a good reason for that because you know this plane could go through challenge yeah but I guess I 'm trying to understand you 've got really bad areas of the city in the red zone that don 't seem to have any greater requirement then areas that are not reached owned that a you know that so I don 't from a logical point of view I don 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I 'm saying that that 's part of the stage 2 when we 're looking at the red zone flat land areas we need to do the planning for that and in that training has been kicked off by sarah and this consultation phase that they 're soon to undergo that planning hasn 't been completed yet it 's part of power i understanding this actually has nothing to do with sarah this is our district plan this is our hazard assessment this is actually about the city 's natural hazards yeah so the fact that sarah are going to do a community engagement process if I live in the red zone where I 've had a voluntary offer not accepted I have just as much right to do something with my land as anyone else surely the information we 've got there 's a reason why those properties have been red zoned which I presume is because it 's worse quality than the ones that are not read zoned what I can 't understand is why we as a council in terms of the city are saying actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the east we 're not actually saying that you we haven 't done our planning yet just as we haven 't done 13 other chapters for the district plan review we haven 't done that area of Clemence but so can I explain how can we bring that forward because it seems pretty fundamental that if people can get concedes and in the red zone they don 't have to take into account natural hazards that seems an anomaly no no I think the way it works the I 'm not sure about the status of the red zone in terms of the Straus chapter but if the land was the quality or red zone the geotechnical assessment would show that and the council would be able to decline it in the operative plane at the moment is a controlled activity and the council can 't turn it down so what we 've done here is say well actually if we look at the professional assessment that the geo takes have given us and it says look this lens just not suitable for subdividing previously the council would have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it suitable because then the controlled activity that 's all you can do but with a restricted discretion activity the council can actually turn it down and that 's where we 've moved forward from I understand that but what I 'm saying is you 've got you 've got a whole area in the east which you 've basically classified in this man as being the same we know it 's not the same because this whole communities like geek see that have been wiped out because of the earthquake that have had to motive because the risk the hazard the liquefaction has been too great so how come there 's nothing in our plan that shows that it is actually a separate there is a higher area of natural hazard in certain areas okay interesting that there be like it 's about the planning response you could say what some of those areas are so bad if you knew they were so bad that they shouldn 't ever be developed on again and then you into your cliff claps so we say that big ceeze a really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget Sarah forget the government just from a silly point of view if a subdivision came and consent for Bixley would you actually want to process it well you want to process it it sounds too bad and we well how do you know until you 've done this that all this does is say this is the assessment we want so it 's dividing the city into two levels of assessment in this area we want to be very clear that what the genes technical assessment is saying about the land that what I kind of sent YZ no greater requirement for someone who wants to subdivide in bexley as there is for Wolfson well this is only saying this is only about the assessment and the status so it 's not saying that any of the lens any good at all it 's saying we want the assessment appropriate to the site so if you 're on good land the assessment will indicate that it 's very suitable if you 're on badland the assessment will indicate that the council shouldn 't grant conceived why not just have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two and one saying you have to pay it 's to do with how much you pay for your geo technical assessment on one side of the line you might get away with doing a little bit less because you 're in that area where liquefaction is unlikely on the other side you 're going to have to do a reasonable amount of assessment to show that it 's actually suitable for development whether you 're in a you 're close to bexley or close to the airport on that line you 're going to have to show you your land suitable so all this is doing is it 's not identifying areas of the city there are more prone to to liquefaction than others it 's actually just showing what their assessment the council will want when it comes to assessing resource can see in applications so it doesn 't do it doesn 't say this is a liquefaction hazard area that 's not what it 's doing it 's saying for resource consents this is a level assessment that we want we do nobody Clint okay just just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a little section of TC three lanes of cgt TC 2 and you know it 's going to be more economical to build honor that suture technically just a we could actually find a few were lucky enough to find the section and the red zone at the moment under the SAT which happened to be just a little island of firmly and you could actually get sent yes the supply the disease family I mean the geotechnical assessments that we 're having done for some of these areas on the periphery that looking at new zoning will be included and potentially in the future band development areas are saying the thing that 's typical across the whole city is variability and some of these GA tix that have worked all over the world they said they 've never seen anything like it so that 's reinforcing what you say that what we need here as a process but we don 't want to ring-fence syria 's you know because there is that level of variability I guess it 's for the confusion is because the government 's ring-fence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range of purposes it 's not just about the liquefaction issued counselors to motor sister or just as me anyway if I just take this back a little bit to to the legal framework for both the red zone and what we 're doing here the red zone is a line that shows where the government has offered to buy land now the reason the government often to buy that land is partly to do with the extent of geotechnical risk and there 's a number of other criteria that central government used and deciding whether to make that offer so that 's what the red zone is the there 's been no change there 's been no moratorium on processing of resource consent applications there 's been no change to the district plan provisions about how someone has a permitted activity to do whatever activity is permitted in the plan at the moment in the red zone there has been some tinkering with the plan provisions to do with things like earthworks repair of land and that sort of thing but there 's been no change to the underlying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was owned residential and it 's been reassigned it 's still zoned residential now that 's what the current plans is what we 're looking at here is the future plan an dat moment we 're looking at the hazards chapter in the future plan so we 've gotten here what is being proposed by officers for the natural hazard provisions in the future plan but not the underlying zoning so this is just about those natural hazard provisions for the future plan what brigitte has highlighted is that at phase two of the district plan review the idea is that the council will decide what it wants to go into the plan in terms of zoning for the red zone areas so that 's not that there 's been no proposal put up by officers at the stage for zoning in those red zone areas now we all know that Sarah 's going through you know that we all know that Sarah 's going through this consultation process so that central government and its agents can decide what it would like to see happen for the zoning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this council 's decision on what it puts in the plan at phase two for the zoning for those areas and it 's up to you how you deal with that or that sorted out that uh but in terms of helping landowners identify what the zoning of the red zone land will be in the future we haven 't got to that point yet I 'm not sure whether thats answered your question counselor I guess I 'm worried about the message that to say to the people on the red zone or the people on the flat next to the red zone actually your property you just need to do the same level assessment as if you and the return or the red zone needs to the same level assessment is you and I kind of like the pinkest the geotechnical report is what determines how much assessment needs to be done because as soon as they start doing their work and realize what the quality of the land does then that assessment has to become more thorough and mb 's got some quite strong guidelines about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the plan and we 've drilled on by all these properties they had drilling done so we must have a huge database of knowledge about land conditions in certain areas do a variability but I 'm sorry site remains yeah okay the other thing is I think the difference between this particular hazard and the other heads is that we 've been looking at as what can be done what technology is available and that you know in terms of our section 32 that 's going to have to come into it why would we prohibit for example tc3 lane from being developed when we know that there 's foundations and ground improvements that are currently being devised they can actually make them able to be used and that might even be in the future when the red signs decided might be the same case I don 't that 's right in it no no no I think yeah and that 's and that 's my point so we so really just to to throw something else into this discussion unless there 's something that I 've missed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Matt 47 there seems to be an anomaly in the mapping because on map 26 we 've got red zone areas which haven 't got the minimum floor level overlaying big presumably because they 're Reds owned whereas on the rockfall map on page 47 we do show the rock fall one and rock fall to over the red zone blend so it certainly looks as though we 're saying that red zoned land on the flat is excluded from our considerations in this chapter whereas the red zoned land on the hills is not excluded from our considerations and what if you actually read the map exactly the way it is quite literally you would say well the red zone land on the flat is capable have been developed without any reference to the minimum floor level overlay whereas land which isn 't red zoned must have the minimum floor level overlay where is on the hills you need to have regard to the rock fall risk because that shown on the map so there seems to be no only their that I think people would find quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have to address which way we 're going to show it but my understanding was that because these rules didn 't apply to the red zone that it didn 't it didn 't have to be shine but I see what you 're saying that we 've got information only if you look at the legend instead of information only that 's the red zone is shown as information only and the legend but here if that 's the case there should be the ponding year issued we switched on yeah under the red zone if that 's the case I I agree with you yeah now that makes perfect sense because if it is technically possible to build on red zone land you would expect that building to be subject to in the paper map 26 example the minimum floor level over like mmm absolutely yeah I agree that it 's a matter of switching it on or switching it off and it 's gotta be consistent insistence yeah,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

New Zealand",2684,last time on the impacts that large-scale development has on community infrastructure and with a undertaking an exhaustive review of other district plans around the country and have been unable to find examples and it raises the question of whether what if we introduce a rule that requires an assessment of potential effects any assessment is going to be limited to the effects of that specific development or the cumulative effects of that development in conjunction with other developments and I think a lot of in large part the issue of impacts on public transport provision on open space at my own opinion is that it should be dealt with through a different method rather than the district plan being sorry that the concern was using record and only as an example they concern was a large-scale development having an impact on public transport services or facilities open space and the provision of open space to serve future shoppers for instance as well as impacts on community community facilities such as libraries so in a sense and it was particularly raised by councilor Johansson for trying to seek some kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go towards either transport or parks or whatever whatever other community infrastructure might be considered appropriate in a fail but I that that 's that 's my opinion I I believe it it should be looked at in the broader context of the long-term plan and development contributions and all and all it 's in relation to their shopping centers was that there needed to be a public transport sort of a hub type thing for some of them bought but at least a safe bus stop for others can we require that and any future expansion that the difficulty is that front from an RMA perspective linking that with the environmental effects of that development is difficult the I mean if you 've got a large shopping center then you are attractive to lots of people and lots of people will get off the bus at that stop can we will require them to have safe the provision for safe and easy bus stops within their development madam chair it 's not to say that we can 't do it and I believe we are in fact looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that 's being done through the CTP through the Christchurch transport plan not through the district plan yeah yeah yeah that 's correct and and and that is one of the things that we are looking at for new subdivisions when we look at ODP for instance outlined development plans for those new areas riccarton was the the center at issue here when if they want an expansion of them or whether we can achieve some kind of contribution towards that interchange we may expand there 's going to be obviously development contributions they can attitude can we say can we direct the development contributions to be a portion of land that can be used for us to develop a bus interchange on land it 's donated as part of the development contributions as opposed to a case some there is a process under the local government act whereby the council can enter a private developers agreement or as this under our development contribution policy made under the local government act that instead of paying the fixed fee for the development contributions the council and the developer enters a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shopping centers because they as we as we know do caused major traffic issues and under an accessible in a safer City I would actually propose that actually most of these shopping centers are for cyclists and pedestrians far danger it more dangerous than the centricity so you 've got reckon there 's a major hub a lot of traffic a lot of traffic movements skinny roads and buses have we have difficulty finding even a spot to put a bus at the park up on on that road so in the future it is there a way we can actually direct development contributions for shopping centres to n specific give land for these type of as I say in the new for the new centers for example holes or sparks road we can deal with that through the outline development plan and and on subdivision consent for example but when we have extensions to existing mall that 's we would come into some difficulty if we 're duplicating a financial contribution where it can and should be done dove a development contribution a different act councillor perhaps what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change to its development contributions policy under the local government act that would in some way expressly provide for the for that private developers agreement or or something different than development contribute contributions and for the public transport like you know we we often hear no we can 't do this we can 't do that but you know the cost to the community of having these things that are just mammoth in their backyard as a means and as they keep expanding and expanding and expanding there has to be something coming back to the community to deal with the effects so I I guess I feel really strongly about this I know in Queenstown they 've got some affordable housing models where X amount of the development goes back into an affordable you know housing or or a poll to be able to buy affordable housing I think there needs to be a mechanism because it 's just the impact it 's having on communities it 's just like it 's just costing our city and we don 't seem to have any control over you know once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know they restrict our ability to provide key services that people need so cancel we 're not denying the impacts that they may have the issue here is which mechanism to use whatever and as we have in place a development contributions policy now we have to be very careful not to doubled up and then require financial contributions under the Resource Management Act where development contribution policy was developed teach me for that purpose where their effects of growth well that 's but like um so just the pot opener makers that outline development plans do not work I 've seen so many outline development plans noble subdivision you cannot rely on outline development plans that they have no teeth they are very easy to get around and they you know fear ahmed 's another one where we just get it we 're getting horrendous outcomes in our city so there has to be another way so you know even if no other councils and New Zealand have done this I 'm really keen that we do something and maybe it 's a small or medium stick but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it such that because we don 't know what other shopping centers are going to happen obviously you 've covered all the two new ones two new ones one new one you are not but as as shopping centers expand as for example say halls will no doubt well can we require that there is a public strong just making it very specific a strong public transport axis within their their land or something that actually makes it safe for people to get off the bus at their shopping center that 's simple I 'm not so worried about large shopping centers impacting I thought I don 't have a problem with that but I am acutely aware that we 're providing the infrastructure for their benefit in these instances and it would be much safer if we were able to put the bus somewhere safer then we currently can can we be that specific about it and just apply it I appreciate that Rekha tins the horse horse that 's bolted but we don 't know what else is going to be could we possibly look at least they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of even a small scale we 've got as we 've talked about the design trigger essentially a resource consent needs to be applied for ad is the urban design of that proposal but in doing so the assessment matters do extend to consider how much the development connects has connectivity and integration with the surrounding development but it does make specific reference to public transports the connectivity with public transport facilities so that 's wrapped up even for the small for the small-scale developments yeah came from your design workshop then where you had the supermarket you had the countdown supermarket that was actually reasonably attractive is there is there any way of incorporating any of those aspects into this chapter yeah the example in question in Auckland that it 's highlighted is a good example because of the glazing it doesn 't have large blank walls and it 's built reasonably close if not up to the road front on the main road that it bothers the capex to the side rather than at the front of that site and we threw the rules on the proposed commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's where that frontages key pedestrian frontage and we 've defined those on the planning maps and this minimum requirements for glazing to ensure that this relationship between the building in the street so the rules are very much intended to achieve that outcome that the countdown example shows so I 'm comfortable with that we have introduced an exception to recognize that a supermarket on a site that has two or more road frontages it 's on it 's not appropriate to require build-up and blazing on all those road fronts because there 's a need for some car packing and loading space so it 's about ensuring that there 's at least build-up and glazing on what is considered the key frontage in three Madame chair if I could just respond to councillor you 're handsome too we are bringing to you what we call the future band development areas chapter and stage two which hopefully you might find will give stronger teeth to outline development plans that has various other rules in there that deals with some of the issues we 've had in the past I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to set clips at the workshop we have on the industrial chapter brief paper outlining get the different options in terms of requirements for green buildings and commercial zones has been explored but i 'd rather have some material to supplement that so it was more just an update for you that there are options that i 'd like to circulate based on the direction from the last workshop we had that there was a view expressed that we should have have some requirements or standards in the plan and just briefly the the base tool which was in the draft central city plan that was put forward to the minister included what was called a base tool and that base tool is proposed as is recommended as the tool that we incorporated into the commercial chapter but as I said I 'd rather you had a brief paper outlining what that means in the context of the industrial chapter this no sir tall as such however there is a rating system in the same way that when you go to a Harvey Norman there 's a washing machine has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rating system that 's just been introduced from Australia called neighbors and that 's that rating tool would in the same way as the energy rating on a washing machine enable a potential tenant of an office building 20 sorry over industrial or an office building to determine how how how green is this building before they decide to but I think we were wanting to go a bit further than that like we were compelling residential people to go up to a home star sex or whatever it was and so we were actually specifying that as a requirement sorry I should have said and the base tool which I 'll come back to you with more information on will include standards for commercial buildings and commercial zones but in it that that have to meet but in industrial zones there 's not a requirement that 's fit for purpose for industrial buildings so well II if we 're doing it for residential and commercial industrial actually should not be exempt a lot of them are doing it through EK loans and through our own grants and loans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't if that 's what you 're instructing us to do a happy to do that what do you reckon Pauline I do want to agree with silver key and because sometimes there 's not a huge difference between an industrial activity in the commercial one you know that may require some further work that we can come back to you with the principle that that 's right yeah it will depend on time frames and that kind of thing as as they decided but the thing I was wanting to mention was stormwater retention tanks and the possibility of making them compulsory for industrial and commercial because they may well be able to afford them more than the residential we 've got a huge storm water problem in our city we need to address that by creating these holding tanks whether they want to leave the water go later that 's up to them but it 's about collecting it as a first flush type scenario it 's interesting that you raise that because in my tecate City Council before it was amalgamated into Auckland City they tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tanks and hardly anyone took them up I think you knowing that was there that was it maybe about 10 years ago maybe least I know people 's awareness has grown and also why Tucker we 've got a different attitude to water but we 've got a different problem because we 've got too much of it falling too fast and we can well that 's only this year as we saw before they 've been better Drive we all give the feeling that this may be a pattern that 's that 's here to stay and whether it is or not is actually better to be prepared for their and it not happen they 're not prepared than it does we can look at something like that if you 'd like us to however I would continue to raise the the comments that we received from see jog about making things harder for businesses rather than easier but I mean we can look at some options for their that the options and there it 's just a case of completing a paper that for your benefit to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ options are okay so through you madam cheer we have we all need to get at least two more days and your diaries if not three depending on how long the discussions take which have been very useful and very constructive and then of course it will depend on the time frames that are determined through discussions between the minister and the mere regarding notification or not yeah I 'll just have to work with clear Sullivan and Rosie in the team thank you,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

New Zealand",3909,"we 're about to move into the slope and stability part of our presentation on natural hazards today and we 've been joined by ian wright who 's a council geotech engineer with capital program and group and he 's given us a lot of them put until this part of the natural hazards chapter okay thank you just begin this part of the presentation by clearing to the the life risk model that was developed by gns science we 're very fortunate to have that research to help us with their mapping of hazzard slopes and stability hazards on the heli areas of the district particularly the port hills this information has been used by Sarah to assist with its red zoning and it 's also been used for the counts by the council particularly that the red zones correlate with the cliff hazard mapping and the the rock for one and two mapping areas may recall that the risk threshold has been adopted in these models of the one in 10,000 year event which is annually that 's equivalent to the risk that we take when we get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per year there 's a differing appetites for risks that something that 's been considered a number of times we 've made these presentations to the community as well some people for example are very comfortable jumping out of airplanes and going for rides and and hot air balloons whereas some of us that wouldn 't anticipate or don 't have an appetite for that sort of thing and don 't plan to ever do that so we 're trying to manage that sort of thing and that 's the sort of thing that 's coming out in our presentations to the community people are saying well we know I 'm prepared to live with a sort of risk but really as a council we 've got a look at the wider community interests and plan accordingly sleeping with your pardon I just forgot my able assistant here is moving the slides along this is a caption that we 've used also before you 'll be familiar with this one for cliff hazard management showing the mechanism involved with cliff hazard events in cliff collapse if you refer to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the page just inside the first the front cover shows you the legend and shows you some of the notation they 're used for mapping cliff hazard so if you haven 't we look at that and familiarize yourself with that and then if you go to the adjust show that 's the legend and on this side here are all the different notations that we use for natural hazards chapter so if you do now to map 48 you can see this cliff hazard mapping represented the big area to the south there is to the right is the the summer community and you can see wrapped around that community there are areas mapped in terms of rock for cliff collapse in mass movement but at the moment we 're looking at the cliff hazard areas you 'll be able to pick up some of those areas kind of on the west side of the community along wait Wakefield avenue of the notation is a little bit hard to count but spare in mind that when this information goes live and we use a different type of mapping system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site and see how the various hazards apply to their particular site in terms of processing inquiries we 're having a few like that some people are able to navigate themselves three birds met quite well and also refer to the gns reports for extra information but we 've also had people that you know need their assistance so we 've been able to help them by looking at the current mapping and the city plan and the banks peninsula plan and then giving them snapshots of these plans as well to help them understand so just running through cliff has it again you know this is the potential for catastrophic failure very difficult to predict when this might happen and also difficult to mitigate can affect both the top of the cliff there and in the diagram you can see the cracking and the potential crumbling of the cliff face and the debris avalanche at the base which can also engulf buildings in the case of richmond hwy you 've got a obviously a red zone in a that 's a landslide and cliff claps issue right around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of that whole area and I 'm just wondering there 's any work being done for lifeline routes to ensure these people are able to access with war leave the area I know there 's say 10 free road that connects up through to Mount Pleasant robot and these instances it would be important to sort of think about the future and look I don 't have that knowledge with me but we will bring that back to you do you in sorry think about it we 've got a project lifeline in few routes but those differently concentrate on the main so it 's from some cross too little to that we get a lot of secondary roads like richmond hill clifton terrace that that all small roads that feed up into the Assize communities and the sum of those are one in and out so we 're aware of it I guess the good news is that they not got those smaller ones aren 't on the a sort of high-risk areas they may be very close proximity but they haven 't had cuttings part of in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a little bit catastrophic but in terms of looking at what 's happened recently in Washington State and in Afghanistan what kind of whole hillsides just disappear is that a risk in this particular piece those from Miami ill-informed position I think they might be equivalent to what we call a mass movement one year is which are similar type of character in might like to speak to that again yeah certainly hope you 're not the size of Afghanistan but those of the gns class one mass moving areas we 've had identified for us their ability to run after and evacuate so we do have potentially vulnerable community that we 're we 're even managed we 're coming to that with just moving through the types of hazards first so just to recap again on rock fall we 've got two areas identified one worthy the rockfall management one area closer to the source further upslope more restrictive controls proposed there because these areas there 's also other and potentially a an intolerable life safety risk those areas approximately relate to the cat 's ear red zone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ footprints and residential sites where as we 're looking at mapping a little bit wider than that so that we are ensuring that people are well aware of the risk in these areas further down slope there is some residual risk where it may be tolerable to establish or we establish development again if you look at matt 48 you can see some of these areas identified the the purple area with the the purple horizontal dashing is the rock for management one or that tends to be upslope and then if you know you have orientation roughly the contour you may see some ground dashing of the rock for management management area to downslope of these areas 4848 big pardon so we 're a section has got some rock fall zone 1 and Rock Falls own to presumably if the building platform was in the zone to the zone to regulations would apply despite part of the section has actually got rock fall one zoning is yep great thank you the fun thing about having these controls is to enable the consideration of hazards beyond the site as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the building Act we 'd only be assessing in terms of the actual site and of course with a lot of these hazards they 've beyond the sites that it 's like to make that clarification can I just ask you why the some of the lower slopes are deemed to be a tolerable risk when I would have thought that if rocks were falling from the top and they 're on a full roll that in fact they were just as dangerous near the bottom is halfway bill I I wanted to say and I hoped I said potentially tolerable again we 've stalled proposing controls on these areas but ELISA status of role so discretionary activity status for most activities there with all these areas just as Jenna said earlier they 've got existing use right so that 's something that people ask us initially you know can I rebuild and we will say well you do you can enjoy existing route use rights but you we want to make you aware that that has it exists in a few proposed building beyond your current footprint or changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect they would capture that activity well we can go into the month so you get a little bit further on if you like but if you want to look at the table it 's table 5 point 10 and they 're all listed there on the table so you can work through the activities listed down on the left-hand column along the top the Civil each of the X the Hazzard net areas with claps rock for one and two mess movement one two and three and then the residual areas hilly areas the district a call from the last column so that 's page 33 onwards I think just the whiskers the slope the list is slow release energy under gravity the boulders decided yes so basely start with a cliff rocks will fall off pick up kinetic energy reach terminal velocity then as they go down the slide because of friction and sort of gravity left of gravity they will slow down the risks gets less than the nothing I because of the the energies of the boulder and amount of boulders as less so this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less chance or less risk or people getting up it kills but it 's not to say a boulder moving down at the bottom if it hurts you it 's going to have the same effect it 's just the chances of it happening unless that 's the risks I yeah and that 's the model takes that into account so that 's where your most slopes do have a a sort of a concave convex sort of flattening out of the base and you know that 's when the the risk lines will will push out and the low very low risk will go out into the valleys and they 'll sort of retract quickly up the hill to the same devil this it was an example of that and outfield driving gallon barn owl and there 's a car-sized boulder coming over the hill just bounced around the house to top developments it didn 't go any further now they 've redzone those two ones bellowing but an actual fact you 're quite right the slope of the hill is in the same all the way down yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the next level now wouldn 't it take it much of that rock just depending it bounced to pop down into the next next tier of houses yes again it 's all to do it the energy as the slope enough for the bold effort did it may have been carrying at residual kinetic energy so had the momentum to carry on or if the slope wasn 't steep enough it would have doesn 't have a enough energy to actually if it does start moving to carry on sir I mean one of the important factors with the the gns modeling is that it was ground verified by the portals geo group we ran around counting all the boulders the size and how far they 've got to calibrate those models so it 's a we have a you know high degree of confidence and the in the data can I just respond to that to counselor by saying that the the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority had had different sort of criteria for the Reds owning than what we are applying to we 've got wider controls and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the various state key documents including some produced by the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority but also further by the Regional Council in its regional policy statement and they 'd certainly and become a bit more stringent since the earthquakes and there was a filmed up a bit at the end of 2013 so we haven 't to interpret those as well yeah so as a result some of their these hazard mapping areas actually extend beyond the red zone also now recap on the mass movement heads of management areas and as counselor mangi was mentioning before and asking if there is any comparison between those events and afghanistan and washington state recently and as in was saying to they 'll roughly compared to that example on the right-hand side there which has got some of the characteristics of cliff collapse and that it 's very unpredictable and but the potential for life safety risk catastrophic failure and you can see there with those buildings were an undated in its yes it 's a terrible that we 've got those examples but it does help you know to for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the the area the example to the left there potentially that represents the mess movement 2 in 3 area where there 's risk more to property less likely to life but more but he end to infrastructure and you can imagine if somebody 's and got a property at the top there and that extension zone and we 've certainly had an inquiry about that recently about the the implications for that so there is a lot of information available to people rebuilding and building both from this council and through the Ministry of business innovation and employment but that 's messed movement one and there are the other sort of blue like a turquoise blue there a little bit hard to see if you see and met 548 sort of about the middle of the map where it says sumner beach there 's a big area there that 's approximately the eastern end of peacocks gallop ended extends there so these are the areas that have been the subject of further genius research that 's going to be reported on anytime soon was a turquoise ones yes so there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diagonal hatching yeah so you 'll see it where it says on the beach there 's it 's like two eyes is the 11 circle to the right when it says Kinsey terrace and then there 's another blue circle to the left that 's right three well there 's a number around if you follow the cliff face around there 's a number of them I 'm if you look at Redcliff school where you can see that along that cliff face the others three well as I see there 's this reporters as pending and there is going to potentially I understand in might like to speak to it in a fairly brief way but there are implications and for the council potentially that the council be informed about the the implications that in that reporter and what actions could potentially be undertaken I guess the good news is that a lot of the class one mass moving areas are associated with the existing cliff collapse areas that have been red zone already for example at record school you can see it sits in a red zone so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there was a failure and it acts as a landslide a mass movement the area below that it 's going to inundate is probably already been taken up by the the cliff collapse model so it 's not additional ground in that area so it 's not all bad news so I 'm assuming that we 've used that information when it comes to say subdivision consents on the other part em here yep and and and we can take you through that in more detail shrinking been saying it though you eat through those models if a she went no amount of foundation we 're so gonna hold that house in place so there 's really no way to mitigate a house moving with either of those two models that 's why there are different rule and activity standards applied to various areas just a cofee if there 's an existing RC and it failed either under what we call the source area before it runs down or that 's below in there nun dae shin area the probabilities of somebody walking away are very low that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we 're looking at is potentially there 's an nearing mitigation solution that we can we can do to help later so it 's that 's one of the things we 're working through at the moment so we don 't necessarily have to abandon the areas and the run-out areas we can bearing on you know certain assumptions we can actually get in and remedio so there are no mass leg movement areas identified on the banks peninsula side of the hill so littleton for example hasn 't got any identified areas is that because there aren 't any or is it because the work hasn 't been done yet Oh carmakers reappear d middleton side was this is post-earthquake and there were no massiveness defined now that 's not to say that there were no errors of land damage and II respect potentially may fire the slope stability but what 's really important I understand is they are to the clearness mass movements we 're identifying large areas of brown I was damaged in bizrate 's that may react as a landslide throughout the whole of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call our business as usual it 's not necessarily related to earthquake damage so we do have what we took the purchase slips you know again lilten the loss rainfall events we 've had a lot of slips there but those aren 't identified as these larger mass movement areas so that only identified this work only identified earthquake-related maximum last land movement areas not so much mass land movement that could be caused by rainfall and so on because of course as you say we have seen quite a bit of that in littleton in particular and other areas and there are residents who might possibly be expecting to see on these maps that those things would have been identified yeah can I just respond to that that the the mass movement areas that have been identified we 're identified by the scientists when they 're out doing work and respect of the cliff collapse and rock hazard areas they started finding cracks on the ground and so they 've fictive lee met those areas and then done through the study and classified them but as you say you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that 's what we 've got that other all on the table for remaining areas heli areas so effectively taking a precautionary approach particularly at the moment we 're targeting subdivision so that we can require that assessment now I just come back to your earlier question too about the littleton side there there is Matt 52 and she met quite a bit of the Littleton Township it 's showing primarily a mix of rock for one and two hazard mapping yeah that 's that 's entirely right I mean that would be accurate would be correct but I was surprised not to see any land movement areas on the Littleton side let 's move that yeah right just the emphasize throughout the Cordell 's slope stability there 's an issue we try to separate massive all these terms mass movement slope instability landslides they all generically me the same thing that the ground can removal somewhere that the mass movements that we talk about are what gns reported on from earthquake damage they 're not saying that is not other hand and stability of small slip cetera that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you 've now got registered on the port holes all over the place that you know so well do you know the impact of putting water down those fundamentally yes not very good it 's can only reduce the strength of the rock mess so it will create some sort of instability whether it creates a failure or not my-my not always manifest itself and I am in a slump or something but it 's certainly not going to help the situation we 'll always invariably make the situation worse so having measured all those cracks that you 've got all over the port hills are the ways of measuring the impact of water on them over time or is that just unknown all the cracks some will do especially in the mass movement class one areas where we 've drove bore holes and we call it we put a clinometer down which measures the weather the the land mass is moving so that the angle of the borehole over time and some of them have got piezometers which measure the amount of water infiltrating so we do get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's it 's not our black and white science you know there 's a lot of gray and some we don 't you know we just can 't measure every every crack that there 's going to be a lot of gray in any rock and science but is there any sort of indication of what 's happening in the past one areas to date by closed feet which is one that is ongoing has an ongoing movement associated with it today under normal or rainfall conditions we haven 't seen any movements including the last three events we 've had now there 's all the outside behaving","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

New Zealand",5090,here so so for the purposes of the City Council 's flood planning we do not assume flooding from the Waimakariri you 're on it because obviously that 's a large chunk of the city just gone including most of my wood most of your ward all of the airport and pretty much everybody else and how are we are we actually confident or are we just living on like we 're confident are we even though the secondary stop bank hasn 't been completed yes we caught me well I 'm not so I want actual verification that this is not a real thing and are we relying on II can to do this well you got it 's their own right that 's really really well it does seem really significant doesn 't it I mean it 's here we have been spending all the time on flooding this is the biggest threat actually to the city well given we 've just had 2 or 3 100 year events and these been no issues with the stock banks and I guess we haven 't had anything greater than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to flood quite different to the ones that it causes across you see the flood events the cause of why maca root of flood rainfall in the Alps will snow melt and the ups and so you often see you often see that Waimakariri in extreme flood and will be bright sunny day here okay I understand he can have a sip a whole separate committee dedicated to this it 's the waimakariri ear cusp mutti and dedicated to the stop banks they 're really on to it maintaining them all the time and as you say they built the secondary one which it sits inside I don 't absolutely complete but another do a long way we could get back to you on that with that kind of detail but we have to start somewhere you know it can has a certain level of responsibility and then district plan falls under that and we take up our responsibilities after after the stop being as a first line of protection you may say so that 's where we 're starting from so to move on ok so the term X @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already seen we 've provided these maps to give you a clear picture of the extent of the increase in the flood management areas there is a result of this district plan review the first map we 've given you so that you can see the difference between a one meter sea level rise and a half of me to sea level rise so if you look at the one that says question operative and draft flood many good areas and it has that 's the only title it has have a look there it 's an older met we we have actually updated some of the work and much more recently and in terms of the mod line but this met it shows the most easy XM comparison between the 0 point five and the one so this is one of the questions that came up and in submissions not not many public submissions on this issue it but see job which is the crashed shirt chairman joint officials grope came out very much in support of done for the 1-meter even though the moment we don 't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basically supporting the 1-meter but apart from that we haven 't had any other public cry for one meter and if you look at the milk you can see that there are areas that are different so if you 're down right it 's that spikes site-specific it would make a difference to individual property owners whether they were we adopted us one if you look at some of the area 's say why Mary beach for example there 's summat Oh pick it up the airs on this map yes the area here by the coast it 's quite being by the coast it 's actually quite heavily affected by one meter increase and so there 's a lot more properties in that subdivision that would be affected by a decision to put one meter on to the flood modeling but if you further away you go from the coast of course the less impact that that one meter has the big area that you 're identifying at my weary beach is actually in the bottle Lake plantation a big book that I 'm talk about that is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boots below that the substantive but is actually in the plantation no I agree absolutely the area that is in that large piece is in the plantation what I was talking about is the but just down below if I was going to go down to a site specific level there 's a few more and why Mary beach that have been identified at other areas where there 's more identified of courses around here an actual fact most of its in the y Mari golf club and a little bit and north shore but it 's probably the scale that we 've got here that you can 't see just that I 'm not asking you to take my word for I think you should see it but why muri beach is one of the areas where there 's a few more houses that would be affected by the 1-meter sea level rise there are other areas if you look here um and over here so in through here this areas where you hear heathkit that 's at some walleston and here at Walston that would be heading towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's what you mean this button here yeah I know it 's not it 's eastgate actually notice it 's not it 's eastgate it 's lynwood the Serie here 's a lil would just buy the Easter eh I can 't from here can actually see it are any of those areas and what yep are any of those areas that are affected by one meter sea level rise in our intensification residential zones family then with Casey would be in here that in itself that 's where the rules deal with what the high floor levels would be so that that in itself is not an issue it 's just what you need to decide upon when before these drafts actually go over to the ministers is whether or not when we 're sitting out the formulas for these rules to be based upon whether you want just half early level half a meter sea level rise included within that formula or a full meter and of course the full meter is very precautionary however my understanding is from the International Committee for climate changes that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise being predicted with and i 'm not sure what the time frame is but a shorter time frame that it was say five ten years ago difficulty at all and with it being one meter it seems incredibly sensible I know tables but nobody else will yet so I think you can I just ask you just in relation to Heath cut and the public feedback comment about spikes row and I think your comment reply is that the need to be filling of the area to above one and two one or two hundred you leave or flood levels and that 's in that area but this is really a wider question than it because you see the events of the last fortnight perhaps indicate some real concern that if as a council we follow that green fields develop the developments in terms what of what the plan is that in fact that that part of that area might be fine but the concern is further down the hit cut and where that water goes and the impact on the lot on the middle and lower parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of that of what is allowed at this in the sparks rodeo you 're quite right though these rules that we 're coming up with today citywide they 're not based on small catchments they 're not based on just particular areas of the city and that 's what you need to keep in the back of your mind so yes that that comment for sparks road needs to be kept in relationship to all of the rules that we 're putting to you today which we 've yet to go through so if we can come back to that one that would be useful can you just go through the other map and then we 'll go on to the ok space I just need to go so just keep the comments very brief and run out the door to my meeting and hope forget back in time for some of the other stuff but um really cane really interested in when people need a building consent or a resource consent to do again that issue with houses being lowered and flooded flood areas so we need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with EQC land filling and cleaning up of contamination and dealing with the flooding issue so I think one of the rest of us is we have three different processes going on at the moment actually its land is land and actually having a joint up process around at post-earthquake makes a lot of sense so we need to give some thought to that support the concerns about the intensification and just a question would really like to see some really clear rules around infrastructure going back so that infrastructure that goes back in these flood areas has to be done to a certain level so oh absolutely I mean I yeah no doubt in my mind it 's it is there general saints of committing Oh look I think that it 's not just the jury being out on climate change and and like I could ask the staff for their comment about it but besides like the scientific the articles which we read thus us no clue with recent evidence I I think it 's a no-brainer and I don 't think I need to our staff perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote now whether it be half a meter or a meter thanks for relevant my understanding is yes once on the entire thing is actually melting whilst that 's melting the opposite side is that she gaining i SPECT ice mass so it seems to me that the poll were kept is shifting and replacing itself as far as the the ice quantity is concerned so I want to get some some comment around that for you madam chair no one here is a climate change specialist or it said I think the officer recommendation to the council would be that at a global consensus of scientific opinion is that is going to be 1 meter higher sea levels on this coast in a hundred years then it 's make seems to plan for it I don 't think officers would be able to take it much better than that this correct I mean we can provide you with information from the recent World Summit we can provide you all all of this but ultimately it comes down to your decision about how precautionary this council wants to be or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it sees its planning time frame when it comes to things like flooding for example if we were going to move weather 1 meter it would suggest that we should look longer to him more quickly and when you have a look at your natural hazards strategy planning and potential for a retreat or what have you that we start putting that in place not through this district plan but in the future so I mean feedback from general populace has been go for a precautionary approach so that we can plan ahead for that but ultimately it will be a political decision based on the knowledge of science that you have tonight at a comment from a stormwater planning point of view we are sort of saying to ourselves well okay the infrastructure and housing and things like that that we 're putting in today it is likely the last 100 years that 's a sort of reasonable likelihood and if we 're talking about having sea level rise of that sort of level within that period of the lifetime of that of the infrastructure in housing that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be plenty for so it 's a sort of logic behind it if you are what you will understand when we go through this for example the next met that Janice we 've got to start shifting the houses in there if you 're anticipating something happening we 're planning for storm surges of one and two hundred years and and and actually not anticipating that there 's some other natural hazardous grief was planning it 's yes it is it does happen I don 't disagree with a she planning I think planning is very good but if you 're planning for a meter we will be on the east side of the city at all and that 's not necessarily correct what it does mean is it will have implications for floor levels and what Janice will go through as the implications with you and the rules as we work through them and it 's in your plans and as to what the floor level heights would be because we have to work off a formula that includes an estimate of sea level rise and what we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half a meter so it does have implications for our rules can we see it I mean you over yep done the flood risk modeling can we see if a sea level modeling of a meter half meter will how that impacts the coastline visits the map that you 've got in front of you it basically shows you the difference between what i said earlier on her they 're safe here almost the new coastline about this isn 't it here what we have is the light blue is 0 point 5 the added bits that are in dark blue is how much more land in Christchurch would be taken up by a map showing a one meter increase in sea level rise because the net reflects the amount of water that we keep going on especially there that says she almost the new coastline well well not this one this one unfortunately i 'm using this one to show you the difference in extent between 0 point five and one since then we 've actually done some more modeling which is more accurate which is in the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i wouldn 't want you to say that this mare because is exactly what we 're going to do in terms of the flood management areas because it 's slightly different to admit that we 've just recently updated which is the second map that you 've got and it 's mainly to do with the assumptions we make in the modeling and this one actually shows the one meter right so if we were to head out so you 've had about this one actually shows what it would look like if it 's one meter so the one that 's got updated from the 15th of the third 2014 and it shows the the one litre sea level rise this adds it adds the dark blue areas in the previous map it with all due respects to the staff and comments I 've already heard today and a word that keeps being trotted out with regular monotony now is retreat and and I just feel that you know we 're accepting one meter which in my mind is extreme we are sending a signal to our coastal residents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town basically and we 've talked a bit before about a lot about all these blue areas in town and I hear story as well that 's just run off and it 's not not affected by by its title it 's all sorts of other things what I 'm very nervous about is that we are adopting a sea level rise in my mind as way past the extreme and we 're sending a signal to people that are in our in these areas that ultimately we 're going to bail out and the city doesn 't want to know anything about this and you know we look at and I can see areas in fend Alton that are in the flood management area in there and some are we going to be bailing out of these areas are we going to be protecting these areas or are we going to send a signal to our to a city saying year we expect a sea level rise but we 're going to put in measures of protection so that you can stay in these areas there is no suggestion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 've heard it from the mayor on occasion as well just get my response there is no rules for a treat in this district plan and this proposed district plan but you 're quite right it does give a message about what could happen in the future now what will come to you my understanding and that 's being discussed these a working group that 's being set up between Sarah and CCC that is talking about the long talk to him strategic way forward for natural hazards such as flooding now that will come through another policy process to come to you the district plan as we 've said before generally lasts about ten years but you 're quite right it does send a message about how this council is considering sea level rise even though this district plan hasn 't at no rules for retreat initial fact if you look at global property crisis coastal regions have already slipped back about twenty percent but just in New Zealand right across the globe so obviously that signal has gone out and is actually affecting those zeroes right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from what projects and about there being no rules in the plan what this plan does is it says well you know you can raise your floor levels and to deal with this you don 't have to stop development you can actually put in an application and raise your floor levels so an in a new development going along here because the zones that we have that a new neighborhood zones but provided they have got their houses at the right level well then there 's nothing in this plan thing you can 't do it it 's saying make the right mitigation measures to deal with the hazard at the right level and the hazard we 've got here as a you know we use the word that you don 't like the one in 200 euro beam what we 're saying is that 's a big event it 's not supposed to happen too often so you wouldn 't want to say you can 't develop here because it doesn 't actually happen that often but when it does happen you need to be prepared and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doesn 't get into the house then you 've mitigated that hazard so the water seeks away again and the house isn 't as damaged so all this plane is doing is recognizing that size of a bend and saying this is appropriate response to it it 's not like when we get to the port hills and Fiona we 'll deal with that if we get to it and we were saying actually there 's some here is that you shouldn 't go to a troll the rules in this plan are actually more responsive to development than that and saying yes you can have development but this is a top of development we thinks appropriate given the hazard yeah just to clarify this I mean look at these two maps one is a half image from one is a meter that correct to make sure hadn 't one of them is half a meter and one of them is a mean one of them shows both a half a meter and a meter that 's that one the one on the board the one that 's on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the actual areas well it 's the purple areas on that one that 's up there that would be included into the rules so the flood management areas for certain levels of events would be extended over those people areas the the light blue a gray color which is most of it is the half-liter but it would be fair to say wouldn 't appreciate that given that this is planning for one and two hundred year storm surge that actually the impact of half a meter or a meter of sea level rise is not as dramatic as it would otherwise have been because much of that is already catered for in that existing floodplain well if we actually arguing enter a lot of detail now about how we develop the formulas because it hasn 't it and you might like to talk to this it 's about the amount of rainfall it 's about sea level rise it 's about storm surge and then it 's about mixing all of that with our high tide if you look at page rule five point eight point one in your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking that the modelers they add on each of those particular variable so sea level rise actually added on to the results of the surface of the one and two hundred euro V so Graham you might want to explain that that what both points no ads on a certain amount to that surface level and then the one meter ads on till you end up with what is the meeting going to do with it what sea level rise included so if you look at eight point five point eight point one point one on page eight and if you look at the columns as a p1 in the pitot which is a true permitted activities in the flood management areas and what they have to do to be permitted and that 's to be at those minimum floor levels that are indicated on the right-hand side of the page Graham do you want to take us through this one and two hundred rainfall events one is speaking of cuddling and then adding on the sea level rise okay for the purposes of of doing a modeling scenario we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a one in twenty year title of it so a large storm and moderate tide event and then we look at I wanted to energy a title event and modern schools in and we and we try and find the highest level that would occur under which of those scenarios now when there are that that would tend to create some areas when you do that sort of modeling in the sort of midranges of the river which a little bit lower than any mean so we put in as a bottom line here and if it was half of me to sea level rise that we were using we would say okay nothing can be below a liberal 11.8 so that 's the sort of scenarios that we do and then we look at the maximals that result from those scenarios yeah combination of its so usually when you have a major storm event it 's accompanied by a higher tide and that was certainly true in the case of our match the fifth event this year where the tide was about a half a meter higher then we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas that are now below the high-tide mark I just noticed a couple of years we chose we do and so how are we treating them in here well here is below the high-tide marks at the moment usually behind some sort of a stock bank protection and they have and the water coming from those areas that is rainfall in those areas goes out through pipes with a plan failed on in so that it doesn 't allow flow back the louse flow out and likely can flow out when the tides low enough for it to live to leave it out but that 's not sufficient then a pump is put in to take it out yeah just a question of clarification over they cannot remember the body that following international reports has concluded that the international consensus I think on sea level rise is 1.5 ID okay I 'll till it was a bit higher yep so that international bodies pulled in IPCC and we 're basing out we 're gonna see it 's lower than 1.5 you 're saying hmm it 's pointer it 's about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you I can 't even agree amongst themselves they go from 300 millimeters to two meters okay today if there any other questions or should we carry carry on to the issues in it yeah clarification then on page eight does now that you 've accepted that regrettably that you 're going to have a metre sea rise till rise does that Darton level well under point three of the activities specific standards now raised to 12.3 are usable pieces yeah it 's great absolutely crazy okay what I 'm gonna do is just take you to a map to give you an idea of how these fund management areas work I don 't know if the patient numbers on them but if you look at 48 number 48 it 's got a bit of the split tip in a bit of sumner and a bit of the issue so the members are at the bottom of the pages it 's just very quickly before we gone to other issues this one postulate yeah so the five management areas are the areas where they 're going to be affected by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prescribed in the plan like I 've just showed you is some minimum floor levels that they have to comply with in order to do new buildings and additions that particular permitted activity if you look at the map the blue area with the dots on it is the area called the fixed floor level overlay so that 's the area where we 're proposing that it be a permitted activity if you comply with that minimum floor level so you can play with a minimum flow level and you 're permitted activity to develop those activities give another rules in the plane as well but when you look at sumner you 'll see that it hasn 't got any dots on it that area is it 's like a status it 's almost like a status quo situation in terms of how we 've got the rules on the octave clan where everyone has to go through a resource consent to get them in a month floor level and then they build to that level that 's set for them in this area of sumner the modeling is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the history so the modelers are saying that they would rather keep that it restricted discretionary so that there 's more ability to ground truther look at the site and give them a minimum floor level where 's the model is amor more confident not that they 're that happy but they 're more confident to do it as a permitted activity in those other parts where there 's mainly card or influence and you can actually work out a lot easier what that minimum for level should be so just let map itself shows two different areas and how this plan deals with them in terms of cloud management materia that let some that blue or gray it 's supposed to be blue and it 's quite quite faded and that 's the flood management area and summer good one yes yes because there isn 't the amount of information that 's needed from the modeling yet to determine that it can simply go through as a permanent consent so we have to put some kind of things on it so I can come and be assessed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ map i 'm not actually the second map i gave you and compare sumner the existing operative plan extent of the FMA isn 't that much different to what we 're proposing in a new plan and the rule and the operative plan is also restricted discretionary so that 's what 's we have been proposed in the new pen so what I 'm alluding to here is that there 's not a big change in sumner in terms of the proposed plan the draft plan that we 're proposing,"(-43.5320214,

New Zealand",3983,hmm basically saying that any rebuilding sumner would now need to be at 12.8 12 13 me to date and level or what we 're saying is that what I 'm saying here is that there 's not a big difference between what we 've got on the operative plan for Sumner that what we got in the draft plan little proposal now for summer so we 're just looking at different parts of this point oh yeah the same there 's only a few dots that appear in the thrill of extra half a meter if you look at the extra half meter issue if you go back to the mech I gave you with the light blue in the dark blue if you look at the sum of it there is a few dots of that blue for summer so if we adopted one meter there 'll be some additional areas in sumner so if you move on the issues as we 've already talked about sea level rise will move on from that another important issue that came up was intensification in areas if the ear is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in f mas another issue that was considered to people know that if he may is the flood management area let 's have a concave I think that some people their concern about intensification and flood management area is twofold how does the infrastructure cope but also is it sensible to increased it increased development in an area that 's going to flood more so there was quite a lot of issues in the public submissions on net the second points and I 've got there is concerned about the effect of minimum floor level requirements on the recession planes and I think we briefly touched that at the residential chapter on Friday we 've got some rules that provide at the moment in the draft chem annex and exclusion that if you 're raising your floor levels to comply with these minimum floor levels and the FMA that you 'd be exempt from the recession plain rules so you preserve what you could do at the lower level and when you raise yourself up you can still do that envelope of development and but no more you couldn 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the envelope will be preserved at the higher level there is an impact of that on neighbors particularly that neighbor stays at the lower level so that 's an issue that you know obviously we would like from the date on if there is any debate to be here so effectively the envelope of house that you were allowed previously is still allowed but it 's allowed on a higher platform so people her down yeah who are getting their light blocked out are going to be not so thrilled now the thing about that moment the way the draft cam proposes that is it 's for those years that I showed you that were dotted so it 's the areas that it 's already permitted to put up your minimum floor levels so it 's business a Liam you 're allowed to put it up as a permissive activity and we 're not going to look at Lucy champlain issue if you 're in the restricted area like summer that we haven 't yet got an exclusion for people who are in there so when they go for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council gives them the minimum floor level but we 'll also look at the effect it would have on the neighbors but the the reasonable assumption is that we would be looking at that and generously of rather than making it difficult for them to raise the floor levels just a quick question so that 's applies the intrusion values as well so when your house goes up you 're now looking back over and there are setbacks and it worked rusian I maintained so you still have to complain as you sit bit you still have to comply with your maximum heights and so they 're not I think too bad the straw what 's affected as the envelope that you can put you think developers you can 't move your house closer without going through a resistance but you 're quite right there are potentially impacts on the neighbors and how much in general will people actually have to raise their houses from where there are at the moment well um houses will only get raised with you being rebuilt but take something take us to the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then some nah probably is not really hit as much is self tool for example but just give me an example I mean let 's say lid so you automatically the community center levels that either yes okay so that so okay half me to sea level rise British portable 11.8 21 me to sea level rise punish board over twelve point eight so that 's going up a half meter but some that is a little bit higher above the the sea then south shore you 've already got places in south shore which are almost at the high tide level as well as I think I think so and you know you will you would see them going up a metre easily so you so there is a likelihood that you would have a street where houses would be at varying levels and that 's the reality and that 's the only way we can see at this stage to to have an effect on newly built or newly or repaired housing it has only been any consideration because obviously it raising house of a meter as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm putting back a high pitched roof would certainly have an effect on it and there are design always you can design around that impact of the high low is there any been any thought give us that we have thought about that because at the moment that 's exactly what the results in st. cleaners do they look at it on a site-by-site basis they get as a restricted discretion activity they get their minimum floor level and then they also may trigger the recession same rules highly likely and so then they talk to the neighbors and they have a discussion if this if they 're going to put back there pitched roof there might be a discussion as to whether they 're prepared to me it 's lower those debates negotiations at the moment the process works where they might get resource consent for something a bit lower but it 's only it 's not a hard and fast process some people think that ozone and so you know we want to build we build what we what we had and the neighbors don 't get as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more successful and the resources hip planners are able to get a better result or what they call a bit result because the neighbors happier and they 've still got their race for all levels plus their new buildings so at the moment that would that could continue to occur and the areas like somewhere where we haven 't identified if it 's pool area but in areas where we are offering this exemption you 're already giving them permitted activity status for the minimum full level so there 's no resources Cynthia so the idea is that they wouldn 't then have to go for resource to breach the recession planes so they 're going hand in hand at the same time we we read that there is an impact on the neighbors but eventually that neighbor may be able to lift their floor levels as well but there could be they might not be able to if they might well not being a position to that or they might be not be doing a rebuild so they might guess quite a substantial gap in time before that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is another example of where the ministers for example want us to make life easier people are heading to rebuild in wanting to mitigate effects of natural hazards versus community input which is what cancel a handstand wants to see more and more and put on resource consents so these are the balance is that need to be considered all the time q when we 're talking about raising floor levels are we also talking about raising land levels on the section in my point that I 'm trying to get hit and it could be either or as the storm water runoff effect on neighbors who have not built up and we see this already around areas and st. Albans we 've got old properties and new copies have been built up not certainly not 1200 but a little bit n you do get low lying so can you just clarify that it says this is a question a good question more for the subdivision development chapter and fill so can we will bring that we make sure we answer that question when we bring that tttt subdivisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yep of this flag race before Lee was I 'm talking about individual profit they would have to generally depending on how much they want to increase the heart of their property by that they would need to meet certain standards for clean phul certain levels for clean fall and and if it 's over a certain amount then they 'll have to get a consent so that 's why I say it 's in that chapter about how much increase you can make on your land we 've also got rules on filling in the flood management here is as well so there 's Adam a raw allowing permitted activity for your building platform anything more than that you 're into a resource consent so you can fill your land as if it 's part of raising you lane for the minimum floor levels to be complied with in terms of the building consent that would be required that we deal with the storm water and making sure that you didn 't pass storm water on to a neighboring property it 's built into that process but and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly in there and the Confederation and will all show you the rules for that when we get to that chapter okay because we want to look at what they 're filling it with us well thanks thank you what are the notification kind of rules or guidelines around these the raised floor levels I 've got constituents already complaining to me that it seems they 've been on the receiving end I think of mom notified consent so that the new houses avondale for instance they 're pushing through the recession 's fine but they don 't have any grounds on which to get are they pushing through the recession plain as a result of reason floor levels or they 're just doing it is yes there was always warnings so that 's an in the operative pen there must be a rule in the operative planet says it 's a non notification issue if that 's the case because generally reaches of recession plane it must Ellen are you aware there 's a notification issue yeah we 'd have to check the plane but I would 've thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it 's a non notified application and if that 's the case welcome back to the center was that the non notification was something we were proposing in the draft plan yeah I was I 've been pushing myself that it could be noted could be limited notified Terminator it 's that 's what was said in the residential chapter if you recall the yes if it has well if a house was to be lifted for example for any rebuild works to order clean out the liquefaction under the house or what have you then it didn 't require a resource consent and it wouldn 't be notified if it 's if it 's for permanently going through the building envelope then it 's likely it would be restricted discretionary but I thing you do under the opportu plan restricted discretionary can be with or without notification spasm will come back to ya okay so we 'll check it I don 't think you I realizes a crossover with the chapters but just going back to pauline 's point to where and when we come to this chapter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas of crimper mobility of sections as part of flood prevention thank you some of that of course is already in the chapters that have been to you commercial residential all of that kind of those chapters so that so that has been to you perhaps we can come up with a table for you or something like them on a completely unrelated issue the only but that we 've passed so far that 's leaving a worrying feel for me in terms of its lack of conformity with the rest of the plan and it 's nothing to do with this and but just when we look at the whole overlooked overview again is the requirement for two cars to be on the section everything that we 've done is about making walking and and active transport easier and that one seems to meet a jar against the whole philosophy at the plan and I think what you 're talking about is one of the issues that was raised in the transport chapter park and report on so I can rely on the side parking in particular with respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapter and what I said we still need to go through the revisions need to come back to you yeah okay carry on and so we 've what do it in terms of the decision plane discussion have basically covered it optimal with a handful comfortable with exemption that 's where we got to yeah ok next one has some clarification on chills point about the permeability of the land are we coming back to it did you say no well in the chapters that have been to you for particular zones the commercial industrial residential zones they 've been permeability standards in here so hopefully you 've made it known to us where you 're happy you 're not happy with them now all of those three fortunately still have to come back to you for finals sort of sign off of the revisions based on your comments so if you raise that again when they come back to you then we can make sure we take you to them that 'd be good yes that 's right but do recall that those standards are in each of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us that question again and we 'll take you to what it says okay thank you last piece and there 's I just put up there and one of the issues ups come up in the public submissions is the effect of existing use rights and that issue has been a concern of some but a saving grace for others so some people were alone existing use two outs and they 're very happy that we 've got it and in in terms of dealing with your insurance company some some members of the public we 're not happy about the fact that insurance companies would rely on existing you stripes and not do the right thing and raise the four levels up so that came through in the submissions existing user axes are right under their own me so there 's not a lot we can do about that and how the insurance companies interpret that and deal with their customers is not something we can do a lot about so first Janice to put these issues up but these are the significant issues that come through they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ district plan yep well existing youth rights i can ask brent to comment on this is Dennis 's said it is the right under the resource management it 's a legal right that people have and how insurance companies use those rights and interpret them as up to them it 's nothing that we can have an effect on through the district the political side of meats is used because they know full well so they use those rights to get out of Andy I 'm being political but they use it to get out of you know fear and reasonable payment on rebuilt because they know they can do it rather than ensuring homeowners can look the houses but they have no interest in in debt because essentially they 're bookkeepers so that 's the role to minimize the payout not to anyway I 'm getting on it yeah we was raising the issue is but it 's you know it 's a keen issue out there yeah and the other issues I 've raised their edition of support structures for overheat transmission lines to permitted activities and status @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah in terms of issues we we have made them an amendment in the plane and in red in the chapter five point eight point one we 've added a permitted activity status for overhead transmission lines and we 've done that because transpower have requested it and the support structures and something that are going to impede much water and they don 't really need to be built to the minimum floor level so that seems a reasonable request we 've also had discussions and a submission from orion about their smaller structures and utilities whether they should also get some permitted activity status and the f mas we haven 't resolved that with them yet we thought the building definition of building would allow them to do their little kiosks without the flood management rules affecting them but they may have some smaller kiosks that I 'll be on the building definition of building so we need to clarify that with salmon and see if there 's something that we don 't understand from their submission and so that 's the two years in terms of utilities that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them there 's a phase 2 chapter looking at utilities but this is going in at phase one so we eat on with creamer what we 're going to put in the telus chapter and phase 2 to deal with this ocean and the in the natural hazards chapter so we 've got a little bit of quick work to do I met in the last issue that I 've raised there is concern about physical infrastructure where it 's given the capacity of our rivers have actually decreased and that lets a submission issue came up quite a lot to wanting council to do things works to increase the capacity of rivers that again that 's not something that is part of the district plan process and it 's the operational side of them off the council and that 's the sort of work that I believe will come through and the report to come to you shortly from the task force and in the last issue that I 've need can I just clarify that we could look like sit your statement but I know that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say the cash in your stream where people are sections go right to the river and in terms of ownership sometimes that 's debatable and as to who owns a lien and I 'm just wondering it the same thing we can put any a plan to clarify sort of ownership of that sort of is equal to a riparian strip war would leave it isn 't legal two minutes look at the district plan can 't say anything about ownership and ships determined by other law but not by the RMA but the RMA can require for example West Bernard strips and restful night resumes as part of their consent as the RMA decision-making process for subdivisions and I think the land use as well Jenna slightly better idea can require espinho preserve cns Bernard restrict its Bernard strips as part of the resource consent process so if as a council we wanted to build say for example some stop X along the heath code and the might there might be some areas we would have to use the RMA if the council 's looking at putting in mitigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would want to do is act as a as they require an authority and designate private land for that purpose and then pay for it at market value or use the Public Works Act because we are talking about Public Works and those circumstances but I think more the issue was I just wanted to highlight to you a district plan policy issue versus something operationally based which might be dealt with through the through the mayor 's Task Force on flooding and for example dredging of rivers might be one of them it 's not something we were put in the district plan it 's the last issue that is the last issue as insurance issues and sort of already discussed that a little bit but a lot of them the submissions we 're around the implications of raising fuel levels in F mas and the insurance issues around that so some of them there 's not a lot that we can do about that because it 's generally outside the district player but we have to acknowledge that there is a huge effect on people by showing these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informations available and insurance company companies and other people can use that information in terms of the submissions that we 've got some of them mentioned that their insurance costs would be increased if they were identified as being in an FMA and that 's it it 's one more comment I would make before we finish the flooding part of the natural hazards chapter is that there 's been a lot of feedback from the community as these officers have gone out for public meetings and in various smaller meetings and different communities and well well well they don 't like what 's coming in the pan and they don 't like the aspect of possibly being in FMA there 's generally been applause for the level of time and effort given to helping explain these rules and how they will work and into the future and and generally to clapping at the end of these meetings so there is there is a view that they want some certainty around these matters out there as far as the district plan review goes,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

New Zealand",4177,"so the very largest event now the storm events for the spur of us are being classified by if you have a gap of more than 24 hours without any rain then that 's the event ending any new ones starting sort of thing so that sort of separates one event from the other but you can see like that first one in blue april nineteen seventy-eight it dribbled on for a long time nine point four days and we 've got 179 millimeters so that 's the biggest event in that whole time but it was low intensity so we wouldn 't have expected to get an awful lot of ponding or major flooding or things like that similar in over 75 and April 78 those events are also quite long but they do have peaks in them with some reasonable rainfall intensities so there might have been minor flooding in those ones here we come along to our favorite event in March 2014 and we all know that we got a lot of flooding out of that one and that was a relatively short duration in pretty high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which would be the most severe rainstorm that Christchurch his head in this period and it has overall about the same rainfall depth is what happened in this year and match 2014 but it has this absolutely enormous spike in the middle now the interesting thing is that that particular spike occurred not in the very isolated spot like just just on that particular rain gauge but it 's also recorded in sumner and various other gauges around the city at exactly the same time so it was a huge event and unfortunately we don 't have a lot of very good records and tools of our rivers respond to that particular event but it would be a very big a deal not unlike really what we experience this year and then you 've got the range of the other events that you see there right now what I 've done is I 've gone through all the record back to nineteen sixty-two and take pulled out all the rain storms that have a clear and that 's there now see it was far too many there will strip it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you see is some scanner to fix there 's a bit of a bunch in the middle of 70s and then another gap there 's quite a punch in the 80s and there 's a trickle of events being dense forth you know right up to today so then we 're so classifying those in terms of your favorite returning books and so that you 'll see there a few of them are five years and six years nine years in less than two years the 1992 one you can see flag near the center of the picture at the top was the snow event and if you put it into our into the context of rainfall intensity and time and things like that it would be something like a six-year events if you have looked towards the right at the top that 's the hundred year event in march this year and you see a few other events down below that six-year through year nine year eight year three year and one at less than two year and most of those rather other than one listen to year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there which label is three years and 4.5 days and that was a reasonable size of event over port 3 4.5 days and it was Priya 's quake and I guess it didn 't cause that much planning I 'm not aware of any flooding records from so yep as that was that because it was over such a long period of time that it does City 30 I haven 't bothered analyzing that one so would that given that it 's on the same level as 2013 be a hundred year event the one in 73 or well it 's near 73 that would be that that very intense weather I talked about before so would that be a hundred year event I 'll use right okay so two of them within 30 years so far yeah right okay right moving on now what I 'm trying to do particularly focusing around the idea of why we 're getting so much flooding and flopping basin for example and models were saying to us well if you get rainfall intensities more than about 44 millimeters per hour you 're likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to actually convey that so the idea should be well you shall be on edge in terms of potential flooding now clearly if you only get four millimeters in storm that 's not going to be enough to read anything so I 've just scanned the data and looked at 40 millimeters and 10 hours as being lonely and moderately intense storm with some reasonable rainfall depth and a plot of those along the same sort of scale and you can see in green on this one the number of times that that 's sort of a threshold is met and you 'll see a few of them in the last year and a few gaps and so on but they don 't really seem to zero in on the times that we 've had flood events so I started looking for other ways of doing that look forward to then I looked at a rain gauge which was actually closer to flockton Basin civil ok what about that particular rain gauge does that trigger these sorts of things and again it didn 't really 0 and well enough in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater times and was after trying a few different combinations I got onto 75 millimeters in 40 hours and what that seemed to do it seemed to zero in on pretty much of all the events that we 've had and so you 'll see the ones shown in red dots and so we 've had four events in this year we had one event in 20-30 we had one a bit 2012 then we had to go back to nineteen ninety nine before we 've had the same combination of events in nineteen ninety four ninety ninety two three and 1986 and you can see a bunch there and 70s including two in 1975 and then a trickle of them back to nineteen sixty one so I just try to you know people who have been around christchurch and most of the most of us have you I suspect if we probably relate to this in terms of okay yep they seem to be the times when we actually had these flooding events so you know what is what is all this neat and I guess my main elseís @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is about the frequency of the rainfall and it 's not directly related to the earthquake event that we 've had but what has happened with the earthquake is that the impact of a flooding of it might be a bit worse but the frequency is really about the rainfall that we 've had and we 've just had an unusually high number of flood producing storms this year extremely unusual and indeed since the earthquake we 've had several of these at least six right and it relates pretty well to what every block amazing I just because you mentioned about the earthquake and we 've had these and we 've got the lease going right through for the 30 odd years of the longer it has to be effect that the earthquake has significantly changed some of the areas in the city because i mean i can remember y 'all bring brought up around heathkit river all my life and I do remember flood events but it does seem to be more intense now whether it 's my age and fading memory but the fête matter is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to flood as often as possible you know we 've got people have been flooded three times or 61 family 's private six times yeah well there you go political thing yeah we 've had six events since the earthquake where I would have expected flooding under the under the sort of little regime and a big period go right back to nineteen ninety nine till that sort of bent would have occurred before so there 's been either I think some reasonable coincidence here in terms of when the earthquakes appeared in and when we 've actually got these particular flood producing storms now if I can I 'll just take you to a one more slide just for a bit of fun here so here 's here self locked and basin and you get your minds around at 100 usable so flop and basin up here dudley creek cruising around into the avon river channel in this area here and even river channel this area here is titled up to the right we 've got horseshoe lake just so that you understand the geography of the area now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopefully that changes to the post earthquake situation what 's this theory dos what will go back and we 'll do it we 'll do a couple of back and forwards here so there you go pre-earthquake post-earthquake pre-earthquake poster this play well it shows you it shows you the fact that the land has deformed and the thing is that if you look at the amount of blue space if you like and in the flockton basin area you 'll see that in the post earthquake situation it 's quite a lot more than what it was before and the issue there is the land has actually dropped the air but the outflow of dudley creek into the avon river is exactly the same level as it was before because it 's driven by the tide the tide hasn 't changed but the level of flockton basin hairs it 's dropped so the slope on the on the channel to get the water out as not as great as well it was before those two yeah we 've got that green but that goes blue basically yeah is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you so it 's a clear correlation between the drop your ND impact okay thank you yeah well so what I 'm just reiterate what I 'm saying is that the impact is greater but the frequency is driven by the rainfall if we got one of these maps for the estuary and heathcote river basins right up to say around say Princess Margaret up to this that I don 't actually heaven but I mean it 's possible to generate such of them because I mean with regards to say the Easter we 've been told that on the hillsides of the history it 's risen between four and six hundred or whatever in its so the capacity for that Basin the Easter II basin to make water in a flood situation has to have been reduced therefore that would affect whether it 's rain and combined with tide and etc would have to be an impact on to those river basins both the ava and especially the heath get ya know I big to differ on that and reason is that the history itself is quite large and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea the levels within the history match very closely maximum tide levels things like that batch very closely to the levels that we 've got recorded at sumner head which is obviously connected directly to the open sea and and so the flow resistance if you like through the history for many floods which are coming out of either even or the health or the other small channels that go in there are not really restricted by any restrictions within the history itself but you could almost say that if you look say on the hitter get river and you look it so the colombo street bridge that it 's a quite tight bridge and you 've got a wide section up up River and that floods they know there 's an obviously GM point there that could be exactly that well that 's the same principle as the entrance to the Sree from the easter egg so you 've got a wide plain going to a very small hole and so you can relate that back further and further upstream is that I 'm going to be very interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit get basin the lumber street bridge is well above the toilet effects really Tyler pics go up to bounce fires pits jewel of newbridge and clover street squalor Ireland Australia that the first jewelry of birches on the eighth and they sorry the Keith get worse sorry it words it was ok they hit the one backs and terraces about as far as tide goes up in in the Gila River though anything technically above baxton tears on the head get as rain related yep okay thank you you 'll stay with us thinks that grain but I 'm still rethinking that in terms of people 's understanding of us because the incidents per 100 years or over 30 years can be quite different or the and the intent that 's based on the intensity of the rainfall say there can be quite different on the impact of compared with the impact across kosuge of flooding say on people and it 's that that 's it Sally look the impact of the flooding which in fact people notice and a concerned about and so it just seems to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't a useful indicator that people 's understanding uh I think you 're right it 's confusing for people exactly very site-specific and you know if you wanted to do a hundred year return interval on something let 's say at the the gauge at gloucester street you can be very specific about it you 've got all records and you can say this is the highest level that secure than 100 years and so on so you can be very specific about it but then you say okay that particular flooding event at gloucester street was 100 year one bath let 's go up to all this go into the heath care river it didn 't occur there or it didn 't occur in the sticks room but it was the same storm event you know so at one what we change and perhaps that a possibility but no not really and I 'll just explain why in order to have any rules related to flooding we have to have some kind of standard measurement and and the the year reoccurrence periods of what 's used throughout New Zealand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those recurrence periods as dealt with at a national basis and so we can only write rules around something where we have something to hang our hat on an order for it to get down to street level types of recurrence or specificity that Graham is talking about that 's necessary for operational matters pets up to the 20 year flood level but we 're talking about a district plan review where we are required to have certain rules for certain recovery periods not only through the the regional policy statement but also through loop so we are actually bound to use these particular types of standards for reasons that you 'll see once we start to get into the the rules relating to flooding I guess though it could follow as other towns and districts change their plan and are also facing climate change and the the effects and impacts of flooding they 're going to be faced with the same thing so in fact some stage a national level this would need to change that 's correct and that 's why you have district plan reviews regularly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes but at the moment that 's that 's what we use for our standards to to sort of hang out various rules around we could get Graeme to just explain the one in 200 mapping modelling that 's been done to actually reflect the map that we 've ended up with ya and compare it to what you 've been doing site specifically talking about down there that 's a one in 100 how do you do that at the wider district level so we can turn the microphone right yeah I 'm just wondering about the question over here yeah I guess my question would be the problem is i 'm not sure that christ church is comparable any longer given the fact the the seismic twist of the land the uprising of the hills the land dropping nowhere else in New Zealanders had their so how can we still fit into that national framework because the problem is is full saying it 's how I don 't think it 's still having that group with the community that I can understand I can understand the credibility has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we getting back to what we 'll see at a moment ago we have to have some sort of standard to start with and these maps have been generated using a rainfall which is statistically a 200 year event and applied uniformly right across the city which is quite different to a natural event which can be quite variable across the city things like that and a lot more a lot more confusing so it 's so in order to create these maps we have a standardized way of proceeding forward which is to do with rainfall that 's not to say that the effects of that rainfall has have differed in some here is because of the rise and fall of the land but the actual standard is around rainfall therein lies that the floor I think for us because the other part of the equation is the land our land isn 't the same as well it is even if it 's even a lot more complicated than their because you 've got situations where you get a storm coming along and you know the previous month has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as is minimal whereas we are late you know we 've had a storm when the rain has already been soaking so the effect of it is a lot greater you know so it 's a complicated situation however we are required to deal with these natural hazards and the plane through law through the Resource Management Act as well as through those other pieces of planning that I 've just as just discussed so what what what we 'll do now is cause I don 't want to throw something depressing over top of what 's already quite depressing if you issue look at that map the flood management map and you take into consideration what science is telling us about sea level right sea level rise you quit an actual facts say that 's a new coastline not exactly not exactly because in the bottom part of it that would be true if you just simply added on the tidal areas but as you go up the rivers then it 's affected by the by the water flowing off so at that you wouldn 't expect that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up into the city of tide actually the tide of title effects ' abducts and terrace and take the avon river it 's about the same distance which is around Central City now this for the title effects take a feat buttocks those points so it is a fear way in title of foods go right up to the first year or dare ever a trick yeah and boxing terrace yep yeah yeah but within the river not not necessarily on the sides of the room yeah just to comment on the maps everything we 've seen today and everything we 've been given out relates to the city and there are no maps for banks peninsula I 'd be particularly interested to see what these maps look like for little river around flooding and a corolla around sea level rise and i also noticed the banks peninsula maps are missing from the books less as well is quite important i think that we have the context on the peninsula to yeah the flood management areas today to have been met for christchurch city but they haven 't we haven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks peninsula so that 's some sort of historically they 've used historic flood levels to limit building near flood areas but I understand that 's part of the program for Phase two that that we would do the banks peninsula and try and make it at the same consistent way that we 've met to procrastinate but whether that work can be done in time for Stage two is another question but certainly we 've got flood provisions in the operative plan for Bates Peninsula and in this particular phase would we don 't have much other than policies so does that mean that the existing banks peninsula district plan will just translate directly into the new plan with that historic information no I think what what we don 't look at it and phase 2 to try and include the bank a review of the Bates financial information so that we can do something like similar to this perhaps not quite so sophisticated because of the information limitations but trying to bring the flood management near a concept into the bank spinach Japan because it 's it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would look at it being part of the proposed district plan phase two but the objectives and policies of this chapter would stand for banks peninsula okay great thank you I was just going to go over and explain these maps and first one that you put up on the Y mech flood basin which was pretty amazing so you 're one right at the beginning when your head the Y neck flood voice showing the whole of the city and then dated yeah pretty much yeah what actually is the insufficient natural protection or stop bank protection or any form of protection yeah that one to actually stop that happening or what degree of rainfall cords or anything else causes that that 's the one in 500 you can expect to run into you again that what you what you 're seeing here is the natural flood plain of the waimakariri River and the darker areas are where you might conceivably get a deeper water in the lighter areas shallowater but the the protection that Environment Canterbury has put along the river is quite intensive there as the primary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primary stop bank has been nearer or perhaps 40 or 50 years now and it was breached once in the 1950s and hence the additional protection of a secretary stop being behind that again so that the first one gets breached there is water can travel into the intervening space and also exit back out again and it would have to breach the second one before it before it came through that so the level and you 'll love this the level of the stock banks such as to protect against flooding from one in 10,000 year event which in terms of a flooding and just in terms of flooding level but it 's acknowledged that that 's not the only form of failure of stop being a stop being could have failed by virtue of erosion or something like that so you know at the the actual level of protection maybe something less than that it has the secondary stop bank system being completed you nothing is closed till it still gets in progress and progress","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

11,GDoXymdImlg,20140502,1057.129,"Christchurch, New Zealand",2485,"here in the hot seat you can exit line just and just to reiterate that we are dealing with the natural hazards chapter on Tuesday so you will get a lot more detail about this this is really just to show you that we are allowing for certain things to be done in flooding areas and and allowing recession playing changes to allow for houses to be lifted that kind of thing so he 's speaking to this one and I understand that one of the one of the topics that was raised and earlier and earlier workshops was some with questions around how the high precision pain and the heights heights would work in in the flood areas in relation to the in relation to new ground ground levels or required need ground levels the way the rules work at the moment and the definition will the definition for ground level i 'm not sure if you have the definition score glossary and if you don 't mind I 'll read it to you the ground level definition is means the level of ground existing when works associated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for filling or excavation for new buildings on the land is commenced except and in it under a within a flood management area the ground level shall be taken to be as per the minimum floor levels required to require danna flood management area minus a free board of 400 millimeters so essentially and they 'll let up and this is this I think is where our natural hazards the experience needs their jumpin and discuss this it may work sorry what it means is that the the ground level for the purposes of measuring height and heart recession planes will be taken from the minimum ground level the minimum floor levels required in the flood management area and what about 400 millimeters lower than their okay my undersea I can clarify this my understanding from talking with the resource consent planners a lot more recently is that they don 't prefer this definition what they prefer is something less prescriptive in the in the definition of ground level but put it in the exception for minimum floor levels saying that the council is going to calculate what you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow you to go up to your minimum floor level and then keep that envelope that you had at that lower level at that higher level so the idea is to try and move away from having it prescriptive in the definition of ground level but have it as part of the exception so remains absolutely absolutely that 's yeah it 's preserved yeah that 's right so what you 're doing is you 're preserving their rights to have that envelope and not penalizing them for the fact that they have to raise their floor level I do it to accept that what needs to be discussed as the impact on the neighbor at the moment in the natural hazards chapter we 've only given this exception to those within the fixed minimum floor area so that 's people who are able to do their minimum floor levels as a permitted activity we haven 't given this exception to those who are going to be a restricted discretionary in terms of the minimum floor levels anyway so a large part of the city is still in the flood management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by and large the status quo will apply we will discuss the whole issue of recession planes with the restricted discretionary consent that goes with the minimum through levels so we 've got about 30,000 sections affected by flood areas and in terms of the revised district plan so right yeah so in terms of what they 're allowed to do are they all going to be allowed to do that build what you were previously allowed to do in your zone that build it higher the questions that you 're asking are really good Christians and that is what we intend to get into on to them so it 's really difficult to just dive into that at that level it 's because we need to give you the sort of context and show you mix and everything else to answer that question properly so so that the question I really wanted you to just understand today was as Janice explained that if you do have to raise your height according to the floor levels that are needed that you do maintain and you know that look that building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the second one is I think it was counselor your Henson that asked have we allowed for rules that allow for houses to be lifted through the recession plane you know if they have to have something done to their foundations and we do and I just like to Scott to bring that to your attention as to where that is please gone there is a rule that there 's that didn 't each time appears specifically worth was temporary lifting and temporarily relocation of of residential units for construction services sorry it 's in the it 's under permitted activity standards so if we look an example is that we look at page 52 permitted activities 16 and there 's we refuse to the temporary lifting or moving of earthquake damaged buildings where there is non-compliance with a number of a number of standards those being Heights site coverage outdoor living space Dave daylight recession planes and setbacks from internal boundaries now we recognize that there are times when buildings are going to need to be raised or moved or during the repair process and it 's and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to require a resource consent for them for those circumstances so we 've made it a permitted activity for the for the for the temporary relocation because so what 's happening now in flood management areas for address we 've got vadra 's they 're lowering the buildings they 're lifting them up cutting the foundations and lowering them they don 't need to consent I 've got MV guidelines and because there 's a degree of flexibility within a certain level they can get away with that that seems crazy to me that anyone in a flood prone area should be able to have their house lowered as part of the earthquake repairs it just seems nonsensical so can you just just help me understand why people shouldn 't have to have a consent given the kind of she practices we 're hearing about and seeing in areas that you know just defied logic really so is it can we come back to on that as part of the network is a check because I just need to understand a little more information as I understand it really simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundations of a house like an earthquake repair in be have some guidelines and you know what it be in terms of the builders view they can basically use those guidelines to get around the need for any sort of building or resource consent which effectively means they can do what they want in some cases that means they 're lowering houses and flood zones and other areas they might be doing other stuff that you know but we just wouldn 't know so it seems to me that there 's a kind of a principle that if you 're lifting a house off the foundations or changing the height of the house there should be a trigger cyl permanently you 're talking permanently okay and we do need to come back to on that one min as part of metal cases chapter X it 's not something that we 're aware but we will look at it and Austin when people who had survived five people had had that done to them so just like it 's widespread and do the dresses of that patients will Michael Alisa wherever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working with them over it well I just that the only reason I raised it as I 'm really concerned about people even if it 's earthquake repairs not having the requirement of getting it consumed particularly in the flood areas there might be other areas that you might want to have it need for a consent okay we just need to understand a little bit more about the details of those cases so i will contact michael olean and we 'll talk those through we have a response for you on tuesday there would be great cool out of that legal responsibly to do with existing useful which is quite a problematic issue here because yes we can change the provisions requirements in the plan that someone has existing useless and relying on those the question that immediately comes to mind with the situation your jump described clubs lowering lorely management I mean that someone still has existing use rights that are increasing the degree to which their house might be subject to the flood groups yes I best sort of thing we 're going to be looking automatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk with Michael early to understand the details of for don 't mind we will bring that back on Tuesday it 's 5 to 4 i 'm adam cheer is there anything in particular that these were the key issues that were raised through all that all the comments that we got back but obviously we haven 't touched on all of the red areas within the plan we 've done a lot more work to you know review things and consolidate things and clarify a lot of the chapter is there anything else okay thanks are looking for that space where we can talk about the interface between this and the insurers it 's a major issue for those in many parts of the city including burwood Pegasus we know what insurers are like so they won 't pay out to enable people to lift their their houses so where do we have that conversation do is that is it possible on Tuesday or not halt no there 's nothing that 's not really strictly district plan a show nobody fear it is it is a good discussion for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up these workshops on that matter but it is an issue pets through the Housing Committee I 'm not sure what reporting or what mechanisms you have on housing insurance yeah I was going to be but it 's a different issue in respond in relation to the district plan I recognize it technically wasn 't the right place but it 's something that is something you need to raise when you 're next in committee and ask for some a paper perhaps you 'll it 'll be great thank you you mentioned earlier you based on the list discipline the criteria if considered to avoid a flooded mini mother flow in the height is a 400 meters but if a factor the your neighborhood how to mitigate this reverse effect and as I said before would be really helpful if we could not answer those kinds of questions here now with just a few moments left because you 're having a whole workshop on it on Tuesday on the natural hazards chapter and it 's very difficult to answer a question like that quickly without the background very quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think what we wanted to know is just out of any of these that you 've given us are there any significant changes or the scale of changes and the in the proposed plan and the second question was what 's happening with Boston I thought we wanted to kind of discrete planning piece of letting workaround ballston um we nothing is happening with woolston at the moment the has been a response given to you that we can certainly deal with woolston after this process of the district plan but we just don 't have the resourcing to do that now and with respect to the private plan changes and well um the other question that was raised as part of these was it was also some deals done with developers over certain things so the mail site in the more away of rusty road for example so i don 't get before I speak with and Mike feeling about that they weren 't deals done behind closed doors they were negotiations between the utes others with respect to pc one at the time about how much land should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the regional policy statement plane change one proposed change one and the male site was included at that time and so were other business areas along in that area so so they weren 't deal was done with developers they were deals done between the UDS partners and negotiation to try and achieve a settlement out of court on that matter um well yeah because all of that was taken out of court I can 't I would have to go back and check my records whether it was whether actually counter in a consent order in the end I can 't quite recall it may have been and can I just say just I 'm sorry madam chair just to bring it to your attention that the next time we meet is in fact not for Tuesday which is the natural hazards workshop but it is monday if i go back to this chart here fifth of may and we will finish the industrial chapter which we only got halfway through and we 'll do the contaminated land chapter which then leads us with just two chapters left to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then we need to come back to you again with the remaining five chapters for the final review so we do need to find some extra time before the twelfth of may at least another day if not two and i will i 'll work obviously with the Me 's office and to try and do that well that 's well then something needs to happen to to the process and the timeframes it 's fine thank you thank you everyone thank you thank miniature","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

New Zealand",3114,"I think we 're just going to be mindful that we 're trying to create affordable housing and six stars three and a half thousand four hundred fifty-seven squeeze seven star jumps to 27,000 so it 's not like a small step like this goes up and I message sticker so six green rating is think pretty good no it 's not a net chapter at the moment but when we researched and put together the the proposed regulatory changes for the central city area just obviously just after the earthquakes and around 2011 2012 we included a net did a bit of research and with Tony more once again and included in that a standard court or an assessment process called base which is once again an external assessment process we feel that we got that to a workable level and that was included in our recommendations to the to the central city to Sarah but I understand that they were not attract and certainly they weren 't kept but they weren 't carried through by Sarah so in our view it 's possible but zero have been resistant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cafe whatever it is now our assisting with and Iker is putting money into in terms of making them energy-efficient wouldn 't it be better just to say actually guys you 've got to be well that 's a decision for for this council to make whether it wishes to include a type of standard like this and to the industrial commercial chapter as well yep yep I begin well the industrial chapter is coming back to and marks also the author of the commercial chapter so we can discuss that with him when he comes back awesome okay so what are we on now okay retirement village retirement villages yes I think I opened a little earlier with their being addressed a small but vocal feedback on retirement villages these being from retirement village operators and there and there and I guess you call it the governing body and they 're being very supportive of the approach that we 've that has been proposed in terms of nailing retirement villages and all residential zones as a restricted discretionary activity they recognize that it is probably the boat that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the issues of the time of the construction of retirement villages they have however pointed out that there are some of some of the standards that we put out for consultation were problematic to them in terms of they didn 't suit the built form for they didn 't suit the built form for retirement villages so since since then I 've gone through and I 've gone through and over the last few days I 'm tweaked some of those tweet some of those standards and it might be a good idea and just just to direct you to those and talk through them now if we can so if we go to page 31 and it 's at the top it 's under the rule that starts on the preceding page at fourteen point two point three point four I 'm site coverage and we 've added at the bottom of the table at five residential villagers a maximum building site coverage of forty percent originally we headed at just the standard the standard for the zone and the resident this is so this is for the residential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the the feedback from their retirement villages organizations and pointed out that their buildings tend to be built at a higher density yes they don 't requested that it be that we increase it they didn 't specify how far so I 've put it to forty percent at this stage we could put that out for public notification and get coming comfortable at forty this has basically been a really contentious issue in some neighborhoods we 've got special amenity areas and what happens is all the old houses get built up and then they get this huge huge level of development that just totally Dolph 's the local neighborhood so why would we increase her since that well that is dead that is correct it is increasing the number of potentially increasing the number of actual residential units or retirement time at units that could come on to the property but in terms of we recognize that special immunity areas are concerned we 're looking to add a very thorough review as I understand of the special amenity year is in the coming second phase of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it stands at the moment I don 't think that these that this restricted discretion could or should sit out of those same areas as well but at the same time these but these rules will become as I understand it they all become operative together with the same changes know whatever is made operative once the decisions are released and there are no appeals that we will say exactly which parts of the operative plan then fall away and these will replace them come to us I 'm talking about suburban wreckage do you think it 'd be worth like in a residential area limiting the scale of a retirement village no excuse me what do you think based on what we 've seen you know that there 's a case to kind of limit the scale rather than increase that in terms of local neighborhood immunity character residential coherent no this is about site coverage perhaps he can might like to comment but in terms of the ink and the suburban residential zone not the overlay zone and the suburban residential zone it 's an increase from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story so at the moment operative plan in the suburban residential which is currently named l1 our lowest density zone you can build forty percent i saw a 35-percent site coverage but if you 're only single story you can do forty percent site coverage already so if you were doing single story development forty percent is already allowed at the moment and as part of the review we have actually we are actually proposing to not have that bonus for single story because we we think cumulatively there adds to our impervious areas and other other problems so that would be they would not be increasing it from what they can do now in that zone I guess kind of asking is if you look at what we 've allowed do you think of scale in terms of the impact on local neighborhoods is a positive or a negative and is that I mean I just don 't I can visualize some that I 've driven past but is there any kind of you know learning from what we currently have allowed so this is where we kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside they these are not permit well they ask they are standards but the actual the actual consenting of the retirement villages village itself is restricted discretionary for urban design on urban designer and and what else we got in there and scale and scale of activity matters as well so when we so when we assess the resource consent will be or the planners excessive azores consent they 'll be looking for its fit with the existing area and are we looking for urban design features that reduce its um I guess the effects on the area it 's coming into no no I 've asked them to tell you what the assessment criteria are for these do restrict discretionary activities so the as you come in for a restricted and activity restricted discrete discretionary activity and in this case for assignment religious in a low density suburban area the one after things you get assessed by as the urban design assistant letters and the urban design assistant measures look at five key things but they 're actually about three feelings so what we look at as a scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighborhood context the other layer that we look at is is this contributing to the street it 's on so and you 're quite right that something really large in scale amongst every fine grain residential neighborhood would probably not be in keeping with that so we would ask for our evidence of mitigating that perhaps it 's a large so the way to do it might be that perhaps it 's a large development but it has organized as if it was just the pocket off the existing suburban area so there are ways to mitigate this just affect it from one party 's developing it doesn 't mean it needs to be one big building and the other third layer keeley of urban design assessment is site on-site energy so look at the neighborhood fit we look at your contribution to the street and we look at your on-site immunity which includes landscape and injuries and legibility all of those urban design things that we talked about this morning yeah they were sorry and if I can just add as well they even did the retirement villages would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recession planes for the employee for the for the zone in which they 'd be located so if there was a NASA doing residential zone if it was eight meters in height the height limit was eight meters in height but no then the then the height limit for the in the height limit for the resident retirement village would be eight meters if it was in residential medium density where the height limit is 9 plus 29 plus 2 and the net would apply to them to the resonator the retirement villages as well we have half an hour so I 'm hoping that we can finish this time I 'm speaking to cut that set you so late in convenience retail you can turn to page in 25 of the second page 25 the draft standard could you move seats so that we can hear serious so 25 of the draft standards draft residential use page 25 sorry rd teen it says convenience retail activity what we 've proposed is that these they 're restricted discretionary but to be located on the corner of a minor arterial that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarding that is when we looked at all the potential sites if we didn 't limit it to those sort of busier roads and of course away from impacting more local local streets was there potentially around the city we could get over 700 sites that may if it was broadened beyond that at the moment I think you 've got a map in front of you provided where it 's got like three exams as on that along the road so cumulative Lee we thought that by restricting it to mine arterial minor collector those intersections it provides a adequate opportunity for new business retail activity with dairies and little shops anyway I noticed that you just allowed on corners which is why I suppose they 're always on corners and but but the consumer head is in those areas where there are none and aidan field is my favorite hate example of a lake of commercial shops does this actually provide for any of that given that none of those roads will be classified potentially as minor arterial so you 've got whole subdivisions going in without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's my temple all new greenfield development is a slightly different here because all new greenfield development provides for business zones I understand what happened with Aidan field has some history but all new greenfield areas they have plenty mercial areas that provide those local dairies know they are they are require through through the regional policy statement and through an ODP we 've talked about outline development plans they are required to indicate where a number of things that go what what this provides for ism is really the existing urban area some additional ability within the existing urban area to provide some convenience retail so where you might see this being taken up might be within we haven 't overlaid this with the medium density areas but that 's an example of where this may be taken up can you just recap again on the change which has been made that you 're talking about there would have been an ability for 700 of these shots to establish oh no they wouldn 't there was never an ability for 700 of these what we looked at sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you also mentioned I wasn 't he of the previous week shot but it was sort of put forward as been something to provide for we looked at the options of whether we should limit it in terms of you could go a free-for-all I suppose of allowing convenience retail activity anywhere because I 'll just take you down to be which is 40 square meters which limits it to some there 's public floor area so that 's a small dearie or is actually quite conservative 40 square meters you could actually go up to 50 square meters of public for floor area I was just going to speak to that mix but broadly about where to provide these the first issue was should we provide for them everywhere should be limited to certain roads certain intersections and so this was an attempt to suppose confine or limit it to suit and rows that we think would be more appropriate for such activity so that 's why we 've put the first criteria I suppose as the minor arterial intersecting with minor and collectors because if you add major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you know can be too busy for these types of activities if you add local roads in there you get over seven hundred odd potential and there has a cumulative effect in terms of retail distribution end yeah no I agree with the approach i was going to comment on the floor space because i do think that 50 square meters would be far more appropriate than 40 and I mean of course the other thing to bear in mind is there 's a commercial reality behind all of this nobody is going to put one of these shops where it 's not going to be a commercial success and nobody 's going to put one of these shots on a major arterial road where there 's no parking provided for outside the shop anyway so yeah I agree with the approach the only thing I was going to say was the trolley square meters is to potentially days it is absolutely on the conservative side i was going to raise that that we can take it probably 50 years more and this is so this is an activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know this is about having a local shop where people can bump into each other it 's what makes a neighborhood it 's what makes a community and it 's what stops people getting in their car and driving to the shopping mall or another area no public floor area public float year i 'm not talking about behind the counter not talking about the yeah it 's just as if you your local hairdressers is probably about 40 50 you certainly your dearie would be anything bigger than that you could go up to 60 and you 're starting to get quite large floor space then it 's just the public floor space it 's just your local convenience so as you say hairdressers takeaways corner dairies that kind of thing but I was taught in the new subdivision a host word area they 're kind of retail shop around 200 square meters so is that situation on earth that 's not know they they just about tools module it would be a business sign it 's um Oh energy activity center yeah those are you see activity quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oh god neighbor told local neighborhood no it 's not have a question that you 've a convenient shaft because the reason occur in the shopping mall in josue area as you are aware there a supermarket where be the extension expansion you know so that but one of a current that they 're kind of dairy shatter the supermarket food staff management talk to him not allowed continue to run in their business because no place for him but the referral him to the some other area like a key activity center may be either loss north of house were also a junction debt service area but he told me later because no suitable place because what evil a size 2 peter two hundred square meter or no no no other location can give him permission continue along in history shop so why have this kind of situation well this the standard is providing opportunity for that for that activity to occur still as a restricted discretionary activity it 's still important that the council has consideration of matters of urban design scale of activity again the hours of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access and safety by the north the holes were new subdivision I mean key over these TV center they should I have a force t square meter that very sharp am i right not necessarily because it 's considered a key activity center it 's a higher level bigger scale activity center it 's not your local shops while people can walk to it so it might be a local shop it 's actually have a different scale and nature all together no no it has a different rules and those rules are in the commercial chapter we 've been over there chapter with you different hierarchy mmhmm yeah yeah can I just chit","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

New Zealand",3051,yes let us thank you hopefully some of these other ones won 't take quite as long the the next issue it 's all being very good discussion I 'm sorry I don 't mean that any teaching int 'l way but that was probably the most critical issue that was raised through public engagement so the next one is the life mark and home star standards which are being proposed for this chapter and Scott 's going to talk to you about that in general the feedback that we received in the last round the consultation around that these sustainability standards was from the organizations or and well and departments that have had a hand in or and and have helped develop these standards over them over the years feedback on the whole has been compared to the say the intensification issue low but quite but i would say that what we have had is quite supportive the Green Building Council have had made a submission where they talked about the the process or the assessment process for life mark or home star in particular now I 've invited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the week with representative of life mark we went he talked to me about their internal processes and their costs sorry so we 've gotten right these are just different brandings of a kind of sustainability measures in homebuilding this will just take you to the standards and the actual chap just so that you can view them the life mark one is about accessibility I 'm going around inside the house and home someone just briefly is about efficiency energy efficiency and the end other efficiencies so if an example of the standards are on page 36 of the rear of the rules check these um this is a read these are redrafted standards after my discussions with worth the homestar representatives earlier earlier in the week we worked through the implications of and of trying to trying to coordinate the resource consent or building consent process with certification with an outside organization and we talked to Auckland City Council of Auckland unity unitary authority have have a flat life mark sorry homestar standard and the requirements for five four four five or more residential buildings and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can they can undertake these statutory responsibilities and free resource consent and building consent processes but also build in a timely and efficient way the the life mark certification I 'd after the meeting and after discussions with work with other my technical with other technical advisors we felt that it would be much more direct and much more easier process if we took some of the life mark off sorry home star standards and use them as rules directly and directly in the plan that can be checked at building concealed at building consent stage and so if we look at fourteen point two point three point 11 which is on page 36 and it to energy-efficient building standards so we 're not not actually referring to home star but it was the home star to people that um that directed me to these standards we 're looking at increased standards in terms of insulation and increased standards and tunes in terms of extraction of moisture from kitchen and bathrooms and then water if and then increased efficiency in terms of of water use and this is around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a labeling scheme developed by the ministry for the environment and the our installation value as it says they 're just a very well recognized and understood rating for the efficiency events of insulation so when an application when a building consent application comes in i expect that there would need to be a panel on that building consent attached on their building consent discussing how where and how which of these matters have been attended to within the design okay and can 't see it unfortunately I can 't see it very well but yeah these were there is a flowchart that we 've that we 've put together green being actions on behalf of the of the building developer of building design designer and blue obviously actions by the arm Christchurch City Council so the very first step the building designer will keep to see that they have these Heather POC have complied with these with these life mark also shall we so sustainable building standards and make that clear in their applications that they have would come in for building consent application or or a project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our building consent officers or then verify whether the particular standards have been met if they haven 't been achieved the council has to issue the building consent anyway so the building consent would would be issued out the door assuming it done complied with the building out requirements but we 'd have we 'd obligated to put a section city seven certificate on it under the building act with which is essentially a note saying back to the epilayer back to the designer saying that they haven 't complied with certain parts of the district plan and they can 't give effect to the works until they do so has this have you talked us through with the building consent people I 've talked it through with the resource consent guys unfortunately I 've not had a chance that while I 've been trying to make contact with the building consent people there obviously for all these reasons are very busy at the moment there especially today and so then the designer has the odd that has the has the option of redesign or they can apply for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in favor of people building energy efficient water efficient all those things homes but what I don 't want to do is that we approve anything without it having gone through do the actual practicalities of how this will operate in terms of building consents as I said in terms of the checking I 've been through this with the resource consent staff who would be who would be cheap who who would be checking it I understand they are relatively comfortable be its they 're very very simple checklists but and as I said in terms of being able to have face-to-face time with the building consent manager it 's not being possible we will yes we will I guess what we 're looking for from you today is whether or not you 're comfortable with having these two standards and here still there 's been a lot of discussion at previous meetings with you about them and and i think it was even a hot spot that was raised in our first meeting totally comfortable debt what we build has to be energy efficient and water efficient and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem whatsoever what I am totally uncomfortable with is that we do something that in some way doesn 't work for our building consent people so I want them to be all over it and I want Peter Sparrow and Margo llege to be incredibly comfortable with this process and for them to have signed it off before we get it basically but we 'll follow that up um and give you their response yeah now I 'd certainly agree that the standard is something that we should be supporting what we don 't need is a cumbersome process that doesn 't work and it slows things down so really I killing what what Vicki is said the outcomes are great we just need to make sure we have a process that works for everybody and to get us there the issue will be too that there 's a basic standard there that you 're comfortable that that 's the level that we want to push people too some would go for a higher standard some might seek a lower standard but if they meet the standard thats in here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my discussions with the home star the home star people that these particularly the installation values are slightly higher a higher the the the zone days they explained it to me and and and it 's in the written material on the website as well as that the building code standards haven 't really haven 't really kept up with particularly with South Island conditions and that obviously the needs of the needs of houses in the South Island in their insulation particularly our installation needs in neuraxis the sunlight needs probably higher than than those that are mandated and the and the building code they 've also pointed out that we we were looking for we 're looking at a life mark standard and these deliver mostly in my life mark standard of sex that the average New Zealand home built through the building code is delivering something like I 'm three for three or four on these standards very practical terms so the wall installations slightly higher than what we currently allow and ceiling installations slightly higher than her weeks is currently allowed the concrete slab what difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not really sure how conference labs work but expect that the rating value would be hired as well so perhaps in terms of practical outcomes slightly higher costs to the house yes we 're here putting a bit more concrete on we have heard some costings done through a firm called jazz makes the same firm that did they had costings for for for the Auckland unitary authority be and the increasing cost would be this is for a full life max sorry homes does that round about two and a half thousand dollars based on a based on these yeah yeah based on these do meet do i normally require ventilation dedicated in the kitchen and bathroom no you don 't as I understand it from the building code the standard is you have to have work ignoble windows of an area five percent of the floor area of the house hmm it 's a bit different in costs though isn 't it yeah and there was the effect of those water efficiency things are they much more expensive or well all of those costs things are set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ document I 've got um hereís the six star rating is three and a half grand if you want to get 646 dilating and that 's I think quite an important part of wanted to raise it I think that nice fees put out there for a house of 157 squares for another three and a half thousand dollars you had a full six star rating I think we really need to make whatever a lot of noise about there because it 's not a huge increase and the ongoing self-sufficiency and energy efficiency of something that is actually quite significant oh yeah sorry the just also i would also like to add that we 've had some analysis that the payback period on that as in the vicinity of two-and-a-half to three-and-a-half years in terms of energy savings page 73 on section 32 analysis herself a first cell the last two bullet points that summarizes it for you because the building consent people are looking at can we put solar panels on without a building consent and and there is a group who are keen to come and do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and did you look at the possibility of making that in any way easier or encouraging their tournament is that just not a district image that neither the Resource Management Act can 't set rules for the building consents yeah but we have also in terms of our heart procession planes those that control that that controls day light emission done to neighboring properties we have made some allowances or some exceptions for things like photovoltaic cells and the like to be added to a roof without the need to consult the neighbors without that they could be slightly through the recession plane so so in that sense the the district plan has it 's trying to be more enabling no that 's not amongst our retirement villages assessment Metis right please well they 're all made of broke and it 's the same kind of bricks oh yeah and in terms of one of one of the other subjects we wanted to talk about today as one of one of the hot spots and I guess coming out of consultation was retirement villages and the feedback that we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into that though sorry Scott life mark and Home Star every yes we will talk with building consent people and we will come back to you with the responses to whether how workable they consider this is were there any other outstanding issues with it asked on a scale of one to ten if if we were just you know obviously we 're one at the moment we 've got really poor housing stock not built for the conditions unhealthy unsustainable where would you rate what we 're proposing in terms of that scale are we going to like a nine out of ten are we going to five out of ten the derailleur yeah how sort of like just in terms of a city being kind of modern sustainable given the unique opportunity we 've got how much would this take us ahead of you know and be progressive versus just kind of catching up to what 's just currently happening but we 're a little behind the feedback and and in the large any large feedback volumes you 'll you 'll see comment from the likes of green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make the comment that just these small changes will make a significant difference to the health and sustainability of of Christchurch homes as well yeah it 's a great improvement really supportive but but how far does it take us with what 's happening around the rest of the world you know in terms of is it just catching up to what other cities do or is it actually meaning that we 're going to have this amazing I 'm by reticulum lease a notable rebuild terms of New Zealand it 's it 's ahead of the curve definitely and the only other authority I know of who are exploring this as as i said the Auckland unitary authority certainly the but the building industry is becoming more and more interested in these standards these standards as well as they see a i think a point of difference a marketable difference for their homes as well so innate sense of becoming more and more accepted as a generality I suspect or anecdotally I think New Zealand 's probably behind the behind the overseas marks in terms of sustainable buildings perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range from 1 to 10 and this aims at achieving a 64 residential homes and the building code crack building code would achieve for so we are exceeding the building code the national standard but going a little bit in terms of the sustainable home to working party group like have they seen this whatever has Tony more kind of given of you I mean I really support us doing as much as we possibly can with I have but in huge costs under people and Elaine consenting I have been developing and this mechanism these standards through Tony and Tony has been my main point of contact with the external organisations like my like life mark and home star he would probably want it to go he would probably want it to go further and to the full external assessment process but at this stage not saying we the council shouldn 't go into a full external assessment process in the future we just we need to I think we need to see how how the or community unitary authority it 's going to handle then also mindful of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance to maintain between wanting to move forward and have modern buildings and and achieve certain standards versus their comment about having too many standards having too many rules in the plan I 'm quite interesting that external assessment and I guess I 'm a little unhappy wedding for Auckland like we 've got houses being you know rebuilt now so it seems to me some kind of timing thing like we can 't actually you know in 50 years time or 20 years time 30 years time which this plane that 's kind of envisaging I would want us to kind of be moving faster towards that kind of entering to get tonys you around we can 't get Tony 's view but I would say that you know we can 't always do it planned change at any time if there 's a move from the community and the development sector that they want to even raise it even further that 's great but an external assessment assessment would impact on conceits and would impact and be more costly for for a consentir what this is suggesting as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six out of ten that can be permitted if you meet it and your designs and doesn 't require a consent once they move out of that and don 't achieve that then it becomes restricted discretionary and if you add external assessment and to that it compounds things even more,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

New Zealand",3861,"terms of provision of community infrastructure by way of the school and thinking of Andrews question 2 and kind of resources that natural community what is your question whoa my god I just wonder why this density in areas with a school is going to be going and was talking about the some of the social outcomes that can give rise with rentals yeah curious yeah my comments refers to the block below Lynn will part but my social comments my comments on social outcomes for the district would apply to to the area would apply to the whole lot clearly there 's a lot of l3 already outcomes in some of that l3 haven 't been a huge success I would hate to see more of that kind of thing happening in an area which already has some issues that probably could be handled better in different ways and the the l3 that was there in the Opera well it is there currently in the operative plan which has been transferred and to this met for the proposed plan is in relation to proximity to the city the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new ones additional ones are air at the crossroads the yellow areas on the crossroads as you say south of Lynwood park and north and west of the Elvis gate and then yeah those three areas there there is the possibility for taking out that area south of Lynwood park on the basis of what you say but remember that there is a need for intensification beard and a lower socioeconomic area or not and there may be other things that might have to support these areas if it does result in some social issues arising but that 's not necessarily a reason not to intensify in certain areas and and there is a need for intensification in areas where people can afford it more perhaps than they could intensification around mere avail if it 's if I can just add to that as well you mentioned some of the poorer outcomes and that existing living 33 area that is one of the reasons why the council has taken a more proactive stance on urban design issues in the last few years it 's its development within this area that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards our urban further advancing urban design particularly in the higher density areas exam particular Lee plan change plan change 53 that introduced even design assessments particularly for these high density areas around l3 I 'd expect that through this mechanism and I and we were spoken to you were spoken to this morning by all are weird and design friends and who went through the rationale for that so we 're confident that high-density little high or medium density development going the future will be over much higher quality than it is now so um unfortunately that urban design plan change in my view hasn 't very worked entirely well we 've got l3 development happening in Richmond for example which does nothing to add to the immunity of the local neighborhood quite an eyesore quite an ugly building doesn 't has a whole bunch of non-compliances but it still gets consent and it still goes through non notified so there is a real feel that in some of the areas like Linwood in Richmond that we are still imposing a really low quality low cost housing product on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really concerned I 'm I was interested in the comment that this has been a slow growing area because as board counselor I 've seen a lot of l3l three development in this area over the last decade there has been a lot of new small apartments being built so why do you think it 's been slow to develop this is when I reasons at the school wind because people told the government that this was a area that didn 't have intensification it 's one of the reasons in the report that this wasn 't it wasn 't saying it wasn 't an area of growth but as a ward councillor when you know I mean I loved in this area that for a long time we saw these developments coming quite written are quite a regular basis so I just interested to understand the endless and the scale of amount it has been signed comparatively so proportionately can be to some other areas so if you like that because it please slightly is a extensive amount ins so if you looked at like like consenting for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have been built on the last decade have been in this particular area or the Syria is that I can 't make me do those we can come back because it seems to me they must get a point where you saturate an area with l3 land and you get a number of developments and in the corner you know it just doesn 't become kind of feasible and kind of I wonder whether this area is kind of at its breaking point now where it 's had so much l3 bad l3 development that really adding more to it doesn 't really enhancer starts to quite detract from it we 'd have to investigate that further and what what you say may well relate to the existing l3 area but I don 't know that it relates to the proposed medium density extra areas that that we 've put on this map to what if you lift us as um alto if you change it Alto what would be the impact team Cheers idly Maria Santa objectives and policies and the plan with regard to affordable housing really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comment previously to cancel a tuna but this is not what counselor you 're handsome is asking is about saturation and the number of consents that have gone through here and my understanding and I turn to you here Scott is that l1 and our two are roughly becoming the suburban residential zone that 's not what we 're proposing here we 're talking about medium density zoning but LT still provides for what two stories possibly three story what would L to provide for both them both l1 and l2 provide for two stories l the only real difference between l1 and l2 is what you might call is slightly high density development based on side side base don 't yet based on science size maneuver d square meters are loving 1-330 and loving to let still there still quite intense so 330 yes that gives 30 households per game that gives 30 households right there c300 are we always considered loving two zones to be coming towards medium density because yet that 's still quite so you know i I just I mean I wonder where do we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's a whole bunch of planning issues associated with it in terms of where that I mean you look at the wood part half of that as in residential now anyway the excess I don 't support the access from you know it has a canal that goes through it it 's got fences the excess isn 't great going through the area south of Lynwood park and in fact the writing network is quite it 's quite difficult if you think if you look at Matt go straight for example to get to the mall it 's quite you know you have to go quite far around so yeah my view would be to take the stuff out south of leimert park bets in some sort of area already as it enhanced Development Mechanism area or no no i think it 's only the northwest it is so then so which areas got their in-house development yeah John an in-house develop mechanisms applies to the area to the north of the mall that 's North rocha mcclain rohnert I think to the south its living too right so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already gotten hard the mechanism and anywhere I can 't see the nature have to have it if any Intel south of Lynwood park no north um he 's got that the development mechanism so I wouldn 't support it going further down in South ellenwood park and I wouldn 't support it going into the Norwich mcclain rohnert area if you 've already gotten has development mechanism um and at all biriyani because Linwood intermediate was in that area and McClain street and their area is actually amazing in terms of amenity in terms of what 's available because there 's a bus stop right right there there 's more right of the road there 's reserves it 's a very very attractive area of Christchurch and actually I think if it was done well it would be fantastic the difficulty is that but does the enhance Development Mechanism just do it in little clusters doesn 't it how much of this area becomes in development mechanism um sorry can I also add that the enhanced development mechanism has what we call a sunset clause on it it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of 2018 so there would be some there would be some to uptake through the EDM over the next two to three years but we 're looking at a much wider what a planning planning horizon yes so I 'm having heard from the ward councillors I certainly now would suggest moving that area south of Lynwood Park removing it and generally speaking the rest of the map so you could walk down pauline street and pamela street and then down Chelsea into the mall and to go back here I 'm not that ain 't comfortable I 'll miss you more uncomfortable that on the other side of those two main roads to be fitting if I think there 's if you 're right over here there 's a lot for the distance to walk to those amenity and may well by having this intensification in May well actually improve the amenity long term if it does take place no no i don 't i 'm not i 'm not uncomfortable with the stuff around them all to be fit yep yeah i 'd be interested in yawning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there obviously we want more housing but what the Housing Committee has done is pull a report on the possibility of setting up a rental register because if some of the social outcomes that have arisen from the quakes and the kind of s 's whereas approach that 's happening with with houses and there 's no kind of control so I 'm just I am a bit concerned about this can you and exactly look like it 's a lot I mean it 's a lot of one ear you had to say yellow peril if I just made reiterate this area here is existing living three so this area to the west of this line is existing living three what we 're talking about in this particular topic here is this area this area in this area this area remains as is and will transition to medium density residential which is effectively the same as l3 because of its proximity to the city are you suggesting that she 'll be down zoned that area in that proximity to the city center I 'm probably thinking I should never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually yes because actually all the justification that you 've made and many of the other areas could should be applied here you 've got suffolk street percy street nursery road tiny narrow streets that can 't take any more capacity for cars traffic parking and just because it was l3 before doesn 't mean it should be should continue to be l three if we 've seen perverse outcomes which we have so I think there 's areas in here that actually do need to be looked at around you know the capacity again for those same arguments you 've got areas that have lost schools that that so having medium density around a school would seem to make a lot of sense if you don 't have a school then why would you have medium density there you know it just seems to me that again you 've got a really large stretch of an area that there is really hard to justify in terms of having to be dense populations we can look at this in more detail and come back to you and I 'd like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met and also understand special military areas there 's any in this area special immunity is not coming through to the second phase of the chapters we can I 'm not sure we can give you a density map from the Opera operative plan and what 's being proposed and the and this first eight chapters if you like is that what you 're asking for so in the operative plan where the existing deeds tears in them endless sick yeah right it is it 's a huge icky aside for us to do we 'll do what we can but I can 't say that we would have that ready and prepared for you to come back counselors in terms that they need any legal under ceshi it is possible under the RMA for a council to decide to down zone bhai DC to load you see that is possible very few councils to my knowledge do it because of the effect that has on evil in terms of the investments and property and areas the cause of current zoning and their didn 't there will be a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its current zoning and I wouldn 't expect them to be terribly happy with that property entitlement being removed likewise this there 's people that have bought property in this existing area of the existing zoning that do not think it should change as I said what I don 't know how much information and how quickly we can get to you with respect to a map that shows the density regard zoning and how much of it has taken up we 'll do what we can do with will we still need for the time to get through the program in order to meet this program so we 'll just have to see how we go with it but we 'll do it and I think that 's actually a brief vehicle like these guys are working party wrong house at the moment I 'm just very aware that if you want to downs on as it were an area you are going to being caught and you 're going to have to have an incredibly compelling reason and i 'm not actually sit i know that area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing I 've been seduced as given we 've got so much existing zoning i would i would not support any new zoning to increase intensification and density because i think there 's enough capacity in this area already you mean around the KOC sorry ah because we 've got one from Andrew that suggests the area from lynnwood Park you come out of the yellow yeah yeah can I put that one first and then put your other two areas that is effectively what yarn is suggesting is there general support for what Andrews suggesting this area at the bottom this area come out currently living to remains living to what is living to in the new skin same thing us I 've density of suburban density over last bit right it 's their general support for their yeah I 'm taking that as a uses really hard to read okay so thank you Colleen you can have a street named after you in this area okay right so pretty much agreement with it the other suggestion from yonni was that the other two blocks as well they excluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is I I know these areas well having worked in this area for a couple years I think that this is actually potentially a stunning you I like it a lot and I like the immunity of value around it my logic so the area across from the mall bad traffic bad access bad connection but putting that to one side it 's gone hearts development mechanism so I would say that that would be opportunity what I don 't want is what i saw in Richmond with housing New Zealand who put an existing l3 with urban design controls and everything else that we currently have a really hideous development that basically destroyed local amenity I always consent it i don 't know if it 's been built and they might be thankfully i think revising the plans but that could occur as of right and thats what would really concern me so given that it 's got an enhanced development mechanism I think that actually intensifies that area so I don 't see the need for it to be cotton to a phone right yeah just until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 10 years but ten ten years as their life of the plan under the RMA but councils they plan 14 years in councils plan long-term what I 'm going to suggest is is there general support for yannis concept of taking these two blocks out as well which would need leave actually effectively no intensification around the limb would madam cheek and I just asked Scott plate sorry John to outline where the EDM area is that it doesn 't actually cover the whole of those two areas yep it 's just hard to find out where it is okay so I 'm just focusing on the intersection at the moment so if you follow me the EDM is a set of criteria based on the location of individual sites based on their distance from schools supermarkets bus routes open space and a few others it 's not a it 's not a map to zone as such it is a location based assessment should assess it consent stage so if someone were to say apply for a resource consent here on a site of 1,500 square metres or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would need to assure the consent planners that they are within X Y Z distance of these various criteria this area I 'm compared to some others is is because of the way with the location of everything around here and the EDM is not is not very consistently applied across this area and that 's just a that 's an inevitable upshot of having a criteria based assessment rather than a map based assessment so I made this point right at the start was that what what you have here is an area where you could sit good get some medium density development happening but what you will leave is some areas where which don 't qualify for EDM which will be left as low lower density zoning effectively the outcome here is is is one of urban form an urban urban character in general and um what you have in zone in this area for medium density is an opportunity to look at an area as a whole and try and get some consistency of urban form across there while having a consistency in zoning and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ED my medium density Zen was appropriate in this particular block the ED implies to some extent also to these a ver areas as well but it 's this particular bot blocking where the EDM price most significantly reasonably quickly so that we can get through to some other things and if you 're in favor of yannis suggestion of taking those two big yellow blocks McLain street and hemlock street area out of the thing can you just raise your hand okay boy okay if you 're not raise your home one two three four David 's hey you i 'm going to Betty to stop you okay tricky question you might just need to bring it back where there 's a few more counselors I save it the other thing is that because I need ten people made submissions but it really concerns me that the biggest area of intensification it feels like the given actually connected with people to know what 's going on and it does certain the back of my mind I do wonder and well I mean what it would seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the public by going out for submissions and further submissions this is just a draft that 's going to the ministers you can see where the ministers have anything to say about this particular area although i will say in loop and in chapter 6 it does talk about intensification around the KAC which is what this is about so there may be comets come back from the minister then you can revise your decision as when you put it out for notification as to whether you take it out leave it in every chapter once it 's been through with you for a workshop we had bought we 've bought threat three or four of them back already and that 's our intention to bring them back for a second time to show the revisions that we 've made on the basis of the workshop and that 's what we know let me talk about the orange color that 's the second round okay thank you one if you to just put it in context it all that last discussion if you change the last page in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all these movies about these are all the zones that are proposed portion of the eastern releasing a focusing its got the largest area book you can look at the proportion against the north and the south of the city it just gives you some perspective about the quantum can you hear the net play seven go to the next

New Zealand",4417,ok so the bishop Dale centre-right a relatively compact center focused around the bishop down wall and with park next door really consistent street network around the center which which scape the accessibility criteria a quite circular shape around the center itself so again a driver here as with many of the other centers is a supply issue simply proposing to to look at all of that area for the medium density would perhaps put too much supply into that particular area so we focused on those blocks which have the best accessibility to the center itself which are the ones are joining the center and also the ones that are to the south of the main road there please haywood road and that is those the areas which are marked in yellow on the map and done the sort of the broad sweep and then listen to what 's happened and then cut back to the slightly more finessed it hasn 't just been on the basis of community college that has been one factor but there are other environmental factors that have been considered tone yeah was there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intensification this is sort of social housing round you leave the comments are quite next that Scott Megan and you care to elaborate them just find the comments if you can tell it on the comments please yeah relatively relatively low number compared to other areas 13 and response yeah of some of those one or two we 're very strongly opposed but on the whole they used the word the usual shall we say rationales for their for the for the opposition and those with traffic and parking concerns but I would think that of all the areas that we looked at around the city and these character Bertie centers that Bishop Dale would have the least in the way of traffic and parking you know and of any traffic and parking concerns just just find it phrase you know nothing personal but usual rationales it kind of well demise it of it I mean if we look at the recommend people who came in this morning to equal bit usual well shall we say a category of concern that is quite common to all of these areas I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just that there is a common thread that goes through all of the opponents and one of them as traffic and parking or can I just ask am basically why you took out the part sort of on the north and west side of here would road to Emily and lift the other part of might and in terms of the medium density well so again they ended we start with a large area and we have to reduce it down to match the what we boxing maybe a pro inappropriate supply in the area and we looked at the areas which are most accessible and those were the ones adjacent to the adjacent to them all harewood road itself presents something of a barrier to walking and cycling access so in the balance we decided to focus more on the areas to the south repair the roads in the area to the north and so it 's comparing one against the other and a non balanced lunch to the south are more appropriate so and I 'm not sorry i was away idiots this morning but I 'm kick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ map of bearing and there 's no change with the Barrington area from the original from the earlier draft or is that no I 'm leaving across the city about I 'm sorry dude beer here are two areas that we haven 't supplied max for at all and those are Barrington and church corner right it was a upon review of the submissions and the available technical material and and general soul shall we say technical review we felt at these stages at the stage they shouldn 't be resigned at all so we 've just focused on those areas so they won 't be Ruiz owned no there won 't be where I was coming from and it was a previous it was like a previous to such a draft and yeah it 's just so we 're comparing some intensification right across the city and we 're actually beginning from is that it seems to me this area here as a higher area you did better drainage Ford intensification but we 're not this isn 't what we 've decided to to reduce the area that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of discussion about this this morning unfortunately we 're in there were decisions they were simply draft maps to get feedback on and we were required look at intensification around k acs through the loop and chapter 68 so hints the first maps that went out subsequent to that we 've done more intensive research into each one of them we 've also done further investigation into numbers plugging the numbers and how much we 're required to supply out to I think it 's 20 28 is it in comparison to the existing operative plan which provides out to 2041 I think it is so so we have had the discussion about the context the numbers that we have to supply and where they should be slow Kate we 've also determined that it 's best to spread it spread it around the Centers rather than concentrate on one or two centers in and then we have a huge amount of medium density around one or two centers rather than spreading it out because medium density also provides an option for living types you know smaller units and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best to actually spread that that housing choice out around different centers not just concentrated and one or two areas Thanks preciate it I 'm sorry I wasn 't here that 's right thank you for them to church corner and barrington no change as proposed and what went out and the very draft thing has been reverted to where it was pregnant he knows no medium density areas around those hey I see thank you thanks Danny thank you so there 's no traffic constraints is no infrastructure constraints this area is pretty low intensified at the moment I would have thought this is like one of the best areas that you could intensify in rather than putting intensification into existing areas that already have a high degree of intensification if we take the kind of spreading it out across the city so like I 'm not convinced of the reasons why you wouldn 't intensify in this area like is there any other reason why I mean if it 's just putting a new traffic light hand or a pedestrian crossing you know it the traffic here would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have a removal of wood so the yellow areas are to include medium and dense medium density intensification it 's just the hatch areas that this max shows proposed to be deleted from that but what but why for the reasons that John 's just been through that firstly we don 't want to oversupply in this particular area and secondly because of the accessibility and we 're talking walking or biking accessibility that 's why have made in density a few pacing that if you just take you know you don 't you don 't want a whole bunch in this area but if you look at existing areas where you 're proposing to intensify that already have a high degree of intensification Mirabelle 's one that we 've cut back littlewoods another why wouldn 't you want more intensification in this area but there 's a remember that you 've got by more than 500 houses per key activity center or how we taking an equitable approach to getting the activity centers intensified to a sufficient degree that means you know it 's sustainable it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of having problems understanding the game going back to the strategic objectives which tell us to to look at key activity centers of folks intensification across the city it 's not singling out any particular activity center over above and Avila we looked at all centers and for various reasons we 've we 've reduced the need the area of intensification and some or and some we 've not looked at just to begin with when we looked at the potential for intensification around each of these centers it 's based on an accessibility criteria which would focus our study area around each center there was not an intention to for any of the center 's to to include all of the area that was identified for study as medium density if we did that we would effectively create a medium new medium density area she would be not too far from what is currently zoned for medium density across the rest of the city so it 's there was obviously an oversupply there so but the over spy going in we 've effectively an oversupply a gay gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on board what the community of told us to actually identify the areas most appropriate around each Center where intensification may happen I would have thought that it 's not actually a case of the area we know we 've got huge capacity at the moment with existing zoning so actually a lot of it will come down to individual opportunity probably within a wider area for intensification so that would soon to say to me that actually it 's better to have a wider area to enable that capacity to be increased because if you have a smaller area like we currently have for whatever reason it 's not happening it happens in the poor areas it happens you know like it happens in lynnwood happens in philipstown happens in charleston but but in these areas it doesn 't it hasn 't happened to the degree that I mean this area hasn 't even had intensification yeah and there 's the point some areas already are on the there in the transition already from low density over the last 10-15 years a lot of the area 's REM riccarton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are already on the change they 're already intensifying when you 've got places like Bishop gel which are low density areas have got little pockets of sort of some high some more medium density you 've got to acknowledge or recognize that the market is it 's part of probably not ready for change as other areas are already are so they 're all really happening so a low density areas such as the ship down got to be careful that you don 't sign it over zone it in terms of a medium density because it 's not it 's only just starting to change it may go very fast and there may be a time to come back and look at it and say well this has been highly successful it 's that a high take up and you 're right that all the infrastructure and as in the air it has got a lot of benefits to it but it 's still an option to go wider but at this point of time we 've way all the factors up and just think it 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how it checks up on it yeah I think at sunset will cover what a conversation about what we 're trying to do yeah just looking at the map and looking at the way that area is at the moment the area directly opposite from the mall so on the other side of harewood road and I appreciate what you were saying about the road been a natural barrier although there is a median strip in that road that would already make pedestrian crossing easy and I know that there 's already been some redevelopment on that side of harewood road it looks as though you know traditional living one type houses have been relatively recently demolished and there 's been older persons housing put in there over 60s units so that would suggest that intensification is naturally occurring to the extent that it is able to within that zone that would suggest to me that that block directly opposite the bishop Dale mall would in fact be a good contender to be made yellow because it 's actually happening too to the extent possible already that again it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it was starting to change that fit with the pocket that I talked about but it hasn 't because of the numbers exactly what John was explaining we just stuck to the other side just way now but I mean it could that could still warrant if their support for that we 're happy to consider adding us a smaller area of that from across the road into the pen and I I think it that area you 're talking about is actually very similar in nature to the area and Merivale that we excluded in this round area that already has meets a certain medium density level hence the net gain would have been very little minimal for us which was the initial driver for this exercise however I think there is there there is a discussion that you 're probably going to have about perhaps it 's not a bad thing to encourage it further in these areas where there 's already uptake so if you if you go that way both Mara well that 's section of mere well in this area have the same properties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it 's already happening organically would make sense to zone that area so that we can legitimize what obviously the market is telling us is a natural progression for the area anyway so I certainly would be in favor just that blot opposite mall of making that into a medium density zone and if I can summarize just a couple of things in terms of oversupply in terms of why not all the supply so that 's the question that we have asked ourselves so and we have two two main answers to that as to why we don 't oversupply you one is that we can better target council 's efforts if we have a more consolidated area so if we 're going to do Street upgrades street trees then we can actually target that to where intensification can happen as opposed to a large suede of area where intensification metal cure pepper potter and the second reason very related to the first one is that in the purported large area one intensified development here another one and a kilometer away was that from the public in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would get one here one another place without proper consolidation end working together and it would the comment was that it would just it wouldn 't help us with numbers it would just annoyed neighbors becomes fact the contrast if you 've got a whole street developing a lot of the recent investment verizon recently motive so will you concentrate the investment in the area for example Mirabel that 's exactly what 's happened be successful in that men are saying with riccarton similarly if we just consolidate these areas a bit then hopefully the interviewer the investment and the effects on neighbors start to become you know not as great when you 've got a two three story house mix once there is more kids more impact then we have been the same type of development side to demonstrate so can I just ask so you 're comfortable that we add in that area opposite the mall on the northern side of here would road okay thank you for the last Methos lynnwood they see sort of goes almost against everything we said when you 're trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roads with a huge amount of yellow on the opposite side of two major roads well away from the key activity center which is a little bit more escape what 's the reasoning for such a large area to be intensified so we 'll let John speak to them there ok so I 'm within word you 've got some existing living to zoning nearby and you have to the south of the mall you have lynnwood Park similar reasoning there as with hornby and you have a pedestrian routes across which are not robust routes so there 's some benefit there to to the area to the south of Lynwood park the area to the north of the mall it is one of the more accessible areas to the mall and I take your point there are again very busy roads in that area and then obviously the areas that joined them all are more obvious in terms of accessibility one of the factors in the lynnwood area is the in hearts develop mechanism which is operative in the district plan is also applicable over this area and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's it 's not it 's not a very consistent area for example that you find it across Barrington it 's more patchwork around in words so we 've taken that into into consideration as well it 's that there may be as an opportunity to intensification to happen anyway through that process but one of the outcomes of that may be that some of the areas that are closest to the mall actually would do not qualify for the enhanced about mechanism may be left outside of that intensification opportunities is that there 's a risk there of consistency of the verb inform question them all compared with them just a little bit beyond that was one of the drivers forum for the looking in this area quite quite closely but it does go against the same principle as you 're applying in Holmby this here here sort of goes you you argue the point event not replaced in those areas and listen this particular map here it 's almost the same type of area we got some main key routes at the yellow part on the year the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the key activity center this is better understanding and when I look at the plot sizes on the Guinness you see the plot so sir a tiny you 're quite right to a degree I mean the ones to the south of loan would pack the obvious Reuters through them what part but they still hit to cross the busy road to get across to the mall you 're quite right similarly up north we have to cross Buckley road or come down Buckley road and still cross and to the mall you 're quite right and my main difference to corby is a normally there are a large number of koldus X and so in this area the streets are very well-connected in terms of the grid structure and the other difference is that there isn 't the industrial use that we have in handy so this is mainly low-scale the residential around epic scale single foremost and activist center and small shops as opposed to the hornby model where you have a number of lots of large scale down part industrial area so there is some difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that precise proportions of each children it is information that 's available from the census data though I see if we can find out if it 's just I 'm just looking at the very low levels of submissions in this area and wondering what 's driving it because that is a very major intensification the area that you 've excluded the one around wellington have lock which has quite a particularly interesting character and what was the reason for taking that off given how bigger chunk you 're doing the area that 's been taken out which is to the to the western wall that block their part partly this there 's an issue of access there we can 't escape the fact that there are the mall is situational an intersection of two busy roads we can 't escape that fact but the access from that block is somewhat less than the others in the them it requires two major roads across rather rather than one but apart from that there 's also a level of developments already happening in that area its current sonia 's living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we speak similar in some some expects to what 's happening in meribel so one balance is the less less appropriate area than the other blocks that have been identified hecht of the particularly the part to the on the city side of that what what what does that do when you put such a big piece of real estate into intensified development what does that actually mean to a neighborhood sorry I are you I 'm talking about the rest of the heart yes so it 's an existing l3 area yes its existing anything that 's to the west of the Cross intersection is existing yes this is and this is an interesting area few reasons is because that lien has been zoned for many years now and it 's been quite slow to be redeveloped this is an example where maybe the areas identified for medium density in the past the markets not hooking up and it 's maybe not ready for the change there is well we considered the fact that the market may be more open to medium density development around the commercial center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a look at it but also the markets do team to pick up closer to commercial centers especia well as larges my apologies because I 've misunderstood so that big chunk on the left of the my computer lift up there it is already residential 303 that 's correct at us so the impact of making this yellow on this screen is actually negligible so if I just want my indicated with with the pointer oh yes sir this area here which I 'm proximally outlining is existing living three so that will transition to residential medium density but it 's effectively no change this area here here here are the areas where the zoning will change either from living to or living one yes except that it 's all called medium density and the proposed plan thank you know um yang in contrast to my comments on some of the other areas this is one that I do have some concerns with particularly looking at the area south of Lynwood park I mean if we look at the Lynwood area in general it 's an area which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area which has largely had a lot of its original character destroyed in some cases with some pretty ugly commercial development and certainly some not particularly good examples of l3 development in that big area of yellow towards the left of the page that area south of Lynwood park is one area where there is some character still left in the area and if Linwood was ever to for want of a better expression gentrify the arts and crafts bungalows and the workers cottages and that sort of thing in that area would be right for that particularly been right on the border of the park there and if you take into account some of the logic which we were talking about earlier around the the juxtaposition with the key activity center you 've got to cross a reasonably sizable part to get there the nature of the area is such that there would be some residents may rather not walk through the park particularly at certain times of day I don 't believe the linkage is there to the mall in the way that it would be in in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so you know whether promoting this type of identification intensification and I identify that the the land prices in this part of town probably would be lower than in some of the other areas that we were talking about which in turn which which would lead possibly to a rental type of development rather than ownership developments which in turn may lead to a poorer quality development rather than a higher quality development there 's enough there to give me some concern particularly around that blocks out of Lynwood park I actually don 't believe this would lead to a positive recovery for this part of town yeah land prices is quite a big part of my thinking in what outcomes might in fact think yeah if this it just pull ups down the school which is being closed its nursery road it 's the right yawning pool oh and this here is going to be is it right in the yellow I 'm just trying to find it yep yes so high and can suffocate or higher intensification the school 's going this is what lead me to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm just all we can 't be having it we can 't have logic taking over,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

New Zealand",1980,through we have hornby Bishop Dale and Glen when still to work through and then there 're I believe five more issues after this but this was definitely the biggest issue working on these maps so over to you John I 'll start with for me if I may and just I have to remind you on behalf of the people during the live stream to put your microphones on when you speak so be the hornby area again going back to the original criteria around accessibility presented some somewhat of a unique situation in that the horn weekly activity centers is focused in an area that is bounded by um two very large parks car park and Denton Park and they 're also the roads are very very busy and present something of a physical barrier to access an additional factor in Holmby is the presence very close to the center and to existing residential areas of business zone business owned five land as I mentioned with papanui this is something where we 're keen to avoid reverse sensitivity issues around so this is a presenter somewhat of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the potential for medium density around the area but once again it is key activity center and therefore we we need to look at it the accessibility analysis taking those two factors into account showed us that in terms of accessibility the most appropriate locations were focused to the north west of the center and an area to the south east of the center and those are the areas which we consulted on as potential areas in further analysis and take into account a range of factors again the supply is the main driver here as with many centers the identified area was was probably over and above what was really quiet so we focus down on the most successful areas and those areas are shown in yellow on the map the two groupings our to the north of Cairo park and to the west of Denton park the area to the southeast we just determined that that was probably less appropriate than the other areas and therefore for this reason we are indicating that would not be a super where intensification regarding to our staff recommendation to remove the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or comments you have received whether there 's the majority resident against and Scott 's just making it up view it 's in your six and thirty two documents same areas we looked at last time but if you look under horn be a meanie fix oh haha traditional because then here you keep the tool platform after changing from the current the living zone to the residential media intensities on conservation air these two because still a debate distance from the home area in this wider residential area and also calcium present in a town is less a place why you consider is anger over changing me medium density residential is rather than the shopping mall my understanding even though a lot along the street at Waterloo work they are small shopping more in this area a kind of he 'll catch up and also the a kind of the local tell Terry sharp residual in this area but you are not doing this way through this one as a reason the accessibility criteria focused on the access to the key activity center rather than the local centers which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can see in yellow on the map there looking at map shows the road network but there are actually a number of have a pedestrian and cycle routes which make those scents make those particular areas accessible to the center those routes through across benton park and carroll park so in terms of accessibility they were the most appropriate and of all the areas we looked at yep so the road network you can clearly clear reach the center using the road network but for walking and cycling routes there are more direct routes available using those particular types of transport through the pack we don 't know that we don 't have that here I mean we can look it up for you and it will they will all be in that big document that you 're given and they don 't used to see really give their addresses either so this area is just booming jobs are going into this area factories are moving from east to west this is where there is a huge demand for housing like I just I still can 't understand the rationale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this area to reduce this even further like have you looked at the economic activity that 's happening in the city and the number of factories that are going into this area or light industries versus the demand for housing it 's we we are aware of where the city is increasing a number where businesses are moving to however for the reasons that John has spelled out that that 's why it has been reduced if you 're considering it needs to be extended back over that area that 's that 's why we come to you today but I think that the issue is that you 've got housing already here so you know what this says to me as we 're not going to really intensify a normally at all we 're going to cut the area more than in half and I 'd so you know it seems it just seems really hard to comprehend given how much activity is moving into this area why you would why you would do know that one of this was actually a very tricky area when we looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the key criteria is walkability and the difficulty we had here was walkability was not well achieved and any any direction they were there were a lot of barriers I mean you could extend it that is definitely an option for that reason but you will have to accept the fact that the intensified areas won 't be as walkable as others I I wasn 't particularly used to this area so I had to do quite an intensive sort of get to know it it is actually needs quite major overhaul in terms of its design one of the things the community board has just done is lower the speed limits well be well beyond what the traffic engineers recommended in a number of these areas that the fringe of the urban development in this whole area it 's just it 's it needs some very intensive concentration not necessarily of houses but of transport solutions honestly so a couple of things hello I 'm akhian that 's nike backwards if you want to visualize cups and so one thing that John keeps saying is that these the key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so we 've been looking at walking routes rather than transport routes as in vehicle routes and this area has a lot of cold or sex are lots of fittings that don 't connect on a on a map you might think it might look very close but actually to get out of your house and get to the key activity center is a very long walk so these areas reflect that sense that level of refinement in terms of whether you can actually get there and there are very well-established parts through denton park and kyle park hence the the top part that you see to the north of carl park the area is actually really well connected to the mall because there is a direct access way walking route that goes there 's a small but that goes underneath the railway track which otherwise as a barrier so it only had occurred in one place and there is an existing level of pedestrian activity there because there 's a school in it near that green area to the north of Kyle park and a wall establish route by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back so if you go there so on a Saturday you 'll see a lot of activity there whereas he wants the in a bit pedestrian activity swear which confirms our selections now you 're thinking south a south of yep yes oh that area here 's a lot of transport barriers so some of these and transport routes are real barriers to walking and they 're both they 're both perception barriers and actual barriers and that it takes a lot more effort psychologically to cross a six lane four lane high-speed road then it does in a local road so it actually it is actually further in terms of its connectivity to the activity center yeah can 't can you John confirm what was the egg selectivity seemed to center my understanding is that it was hornbeam or not not not it that the mall is is certainly a focus for activity in the Holy Center but you 're right there are a number of other activities within that in that general area which contribute to the center key activity centers are not exclusively about about them all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both sides of the the main roads throughout that Center but they aren 't they are still significant barriers to access through and across the center and to different parts of the center walking access and cycle access to a lesser extent one of the issues is that in that area and it 's it 's perhaps the shape of it may appear to be quite quite odd but that is because we 're taking account of the business five Zone in the area and trying to avoid reverse sensitivity issues which gives gives you this sort of area of that we looked at which sits within a lower density area around it so its own way now Paul that all the pros and cons and perhaps looking at this area as an isolated pocket of intensification still surrounded by lower density areas was was perhaps inconsistent with from them informed point of view whereas other areas where we could look at blocks with accessibility was better were perhaps more appropriate in the hornby area but think you just weird the building 's going on at calling out with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that area there 's any any kind of change or its by least least place just with the intersection of those major role in the middle so sorry sorry what was your question um my question is is there any anticipated change to the zoning needed or no existe first it then the issue in that area is it is again if we be consistent with the business 5 with those sensitivity issues um that that area is quite close to business 5 so then golden ave is a separate it 's an individual development I know the site you mean it 's a mean it is a medium to density dependent on an existing them sytner that 's already going through a consenting process so that 's in some ways it 's coming before this this review okay no no change but i would say at the moment that the area is living too so it does carry a slightly higher density than the areas around it so relatively happy was the proposal in okay thank you okay brookdale,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

appendix to obtain they implicate from the individual users that 's a very personable for this have a report and exam it goes from Britain 's Bianca Mirabelle so the second feedback on on traffic and parking grounds was pretty pristine rightfully all of the areas but as you can see here at a bit out of the 13 Pacific that I 've got motive quite a larger proportion often 67,000 symbolize Mitch unpacking and it 's right it was it you look at all the factors you have to you balance all the factors away everything up against each other but I think for the free area to the to the west of patent or erode when you when you get down to the detail of that area the the existing zone there is living too and it 's one of the areas where living too has actually been quite readily taken up and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of medium density development already under living too so the potential from going from what 's already there to residential medium density is is perhaps less than elsewhere anyway you 're identifying via is by increasing the height and I think in the submissions that was of a concern to you wasn 't it so rather than putting more peer site they 're going to go up to intensively well there 's not much more potential to info in intensify not a phase one it 's done it 's going to be addressed in phase one care for we 've taken out of our gear was some of them are business look at them some of them apart zones you can see with these parts some of them will be commercial hospital it 's just that they 're not in this map on purpose at the moment either because we haven 't dealt with them and phase one all because we try to declutter the map and what we can do is give some more thought to those traffic and parking concerns and when we come back with this map @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we come back with the revisions of the chapter like we 've done with other chapters we 've come back with changes I 'm accepting the logic that you 've provided and I think you know it 's Vicky said its pragmatic but the area between lynnster walk between lynnster road alastair of going up to milk what 's that crossroad in this road isn 't eaten straight so the HD row that you 've got removed in going are to me that would seem like an area where you should consider so just add that little button because as it does seem again we talked about the importance of corner sites and the Avengers I 'm workshop that you would actually want consistency around the corner science so I would have thought that dear it could be a case for removing in the l2 fine not removing from where you 've got l1 because actually that 's where a lot of activities happening and extending it up to the corner don 't know okay is it as I say we 'll have a further look at this particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on all the comments that I 've made that you 've made and and and see how what you think so I 'm sorry I don 't have a clear guideline here edged the one that is hatched I see that if it 's able to be intensified it should be and if each particular site is not able to be everyone get resource consent for it because it 's already intense what then that 's covered but there must be strikes anywhere you could quite easily and I think ivory with yanni it 's perfect site for it I 'd prefer to see this go back to yellow I mean there 's the argument that you 've put which is that it 's already quite well intensified as l2 but there 's another argument obviously economically or from a social viewpoint that 's worked so if there is the opportunity for further intensification even if it might be small scale there 's a likelihood the intensification would work here because intensification has worked in the past so I 'd see this go back to yellow I think there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well I manage the shopping center that 's five and a half years so there is quite a bit of intensification going in there anymore and I think for it to continue it would be good there is also a lot of old houses that actually are about to go so they could be a catchable so it 's it 's it 's 33 to keep no sorry I 've got around there at four to keep it in the yellow to put it back into yellow and three against doing it well that shouldn 't matter it should be based on resource management decisions anyway so at this stage we won 't do anything further to this map and it will come back for revision at another time but we will look a little more into the traffic and parking issues Oh max are you sure we have a lot to get through but as I 've said we 're going to have to get some more times anyway so what time course called it to two were coming back thank you","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

New Zealand",3540,sofa pepper nuit when we looked at the initial the Pappy knew even the initial area to study was quite big this is really as a result of the way the center itself is geographically laid out it 's a long and thin center includes northam north and Moreland goes right through the commercial area along penury road so taking again the criteria looking at accessibility first gave us quite a large study area to look at initially which went either side of the railway line there were some constraints in the area there 's an area thumb business five so an industrial land which for reasons of reverse sensibility we decided to avoid looking at that area in particular close close to that industrial and that 's to the northwest of Northland small just indicated on the map here for you it 's this area here okay so for example we decided that we shouldn 't look at this particular area here for example bill um funny area the consultation rmd removed on this the red Burt why was that removed because of them it 's not related to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly that side of the area to the left of the drain or what 's is that other railway track so it so you 've got a residential suburban denson only a and then you 've got so why was that remote okay so overall for pepper nuit and the initial study area was was quite big I 'm just again the primary driver here is this supply and what would be considered a maybe external more appropriate areas confining again to those blocks which are closest to the commercial center itself the railway line is if you like a barrier to accessibility so unbalanced with compared to the other areas work to the more appropriate more accessible how is it a barrier ok it reduces the the permeability of the options for reaching the center from the west of the railway line there there 's an average in that area also is in the area and we it would that would not go as far though as that Kim play marvel would drive part of the area that was removed this area up in here right so the reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point about it 's got to be near Northlands that 's got to be near bus routes and so forth however without addressing the issues around transport and we all know what it 's like down mainly north road and coming in from the north and going out at the end of the day my concern is that we are adding two potential congestion in this area by shifting it onto those roads that are a huge problem at the moment when we could have actually spread it somewhat by including that other main access them down here would road I just and I take your point about the memorial but it doesn 't stretch into that other area there that 's north of us I just don 't understand why you 'd want to be adding to congestion and problems in an area when you do have another main arterial route that is actually able to assist and feeding traffic from their density into I mean that 's just like that look that 's that 's good comment we can do some further traffic modelling on that just to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right and we 'll bring it back to you when we bring you back the revisions on this chapter the multifamily class a dumb question but can you explain to me again the residential suburban density overlay what dat mean does everybody he me I 've speak up a bit we have an interesting living to zone and the plan at the moment which is us allow slightly high in to be at risk angel building then the living ones on when we started the review process it was a zoning they troubled us a little bit we had a choice of either completely campus owning it and do is going to meeting me today or bounds owning it and to putting it down back into living unplugged density in the end we thought because because of the property right implications around there would be in and while we want to simplify the and while we want to simplify the plan and reduce the number of designs it would just be easy as showing those periods those regularly do various things together nice just an area gibraltars found the receipt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a planning mechanism that we use sometimes the maps get very complex to read so it 's simply another way of indicating a specific area that rules relate to one of the drivers in the district plan review and indeed coming through mufe and through sarah is to reduce the complexities of planes currently across the two planes we have a hundred and nine zones which is ridiculous and about 40 or 50 of those relate to residential areas that means you have different rules for each of those zones there is no need for that number of zones yeah right right well can I just say that people who have worked was the operative plan may well understand those zones because they 've worked with it for so long those zones weren 't there before that operative plan what we 're also moving towards is a name for zones that actually means something suburban residential means suburban residential we all have a picture in my mind that that means a house one house on a side medium density is not suburban residential that indicates that you 've got further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 334 stories depending on whatever the heights are so we are generally as a feature of this plan moving towards instead of zones with numbers on them with an actual name that means something people and everybody will get used to them just as they 've got used to the ones and the operative plan but it does all years yes yes it 's on the maps it 's on the maps that you were given these are whole legions shout showing you what the zones are right those are years those those kinds of things have been said at the very introduction of all of the public meetings that we 've had well no in the public meetings that we 've had we 've head tables that show the old zones and what they equate to in the new zones that 's correct I do just in terms of meadow street Apollo you say the rationale for reducing the medium density as away from the key activity center but if you looked at the development that 's happened on Chrome fits straight with it 's now become you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seems it seems hard to understand why you reduce the density in those areas given you know the the neighboring development so why did you take those on Oh cranford street is no a key activity center it is it is a novice enter and take upon it has it has close ties with the with the the area of meadow street and apollo street i take take it back up to the regional policy statement objectives and the regional policy objectives talk about supporting the key activity centers and in this case it 's Northlands and and the associated commercial activity around there so the driver then is to look at intensification support of that Center and not cranford street but but even even going across to Northlands those those areas are a lot closer than orphans and SE bellevue blair a more aligned stroud lane so and probably have better access so why would you remove those not Northlands there 's obviously the focus for the center but the center itself is papanui which includes the commercial area which is to the south of Northlands more so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel but it just seems ludicrous to me that you 'd remove medium density away from you 've got a lot of increased commercial activity particularly restaurants bars wondering if it 's because I think we 're trying to take the terrific off cranford in in poppin oil is intended to be a public transport as a spring that be correct so you 're intensifying around the public it 's correct that 's one of the criteria because access to public transport okay so Mara how again stage 1 of the assessment criteria identified a large area around the the court commercial activity and some logical boundaries given the number of have a non-residential non-commercial uses in the area schools hospitals etc that was quite a quite a wide starting point again and when we looked and detailed this area we looked one of the main factors to come up was the the amount of medium density drain method already occurred in the existing living two zones a number of sites had already achieved quite high densities there up to 30 households of a hectare and there was relatively recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally zoning where you 've had recent development were less effective because the investment into their housing stock is relatively recent and you 'll say you 're less likely to achieve any any medium density in the short term so taking this into account plus elements of supply again we determined that it may be appropriate to reduce the area to the west of happen or erode and retain the area to the east of papua new erode as a potential area that may be suitable for residential medium density yes and that 's the yellow area to the east of Rapa Nui road um that 's what I was going to ask about you 've got a couple of very big retirement villages and rum homes here so there are a lot of elderly as well I mean is that something that you 've taken under consideration what the current demographic makeup of the area is I 'm thinking of safety as far as increased traffic already parking is a huge issue in the area as well because of the increased business and the mall and around surrounding areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home homes and villages are pretty much around the area that you 're intensifying to the e.r job with browns road McDougal ave across the road there 's a retirement village there as well so we 've got intensification in the exact areas that these elderly are living and yet on the other side of patna erode where r as far as i 'm aware there isn 't anything like that you 're removing that the hospital yeah things are like me of you well no nurse Maude was there but they 've moved to rocky road now but I mean there 's still the main hospital it 's the other side mansfield ave a look at the other side of the road I know these streets pretty well they have a very really tiny little streets hard access the malls start park around the earth I mean on the side that it 's been removed yeah yeah it 's exactly the same on the other side with the addition of the elderly and the hospice and the homes the additionally of the elderly in the hospice and the homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of homes that we would want to provide in medium density areas I mean those those facilities do create opportunities for for aged or infirm people yes and no we don 't take into consideration more elderly people on the footpaths and respect to that matter with regards to safety but certainly demographics of the area we do I 'm unsure of what you are saying define the massager it 's not that it provides opportunities for the aged and that it 's increased number of people it 's very social issues as far as you know groups living together cars shift working parties I mean wherever you 've got more people live living you get a more diverse sort of range of people living and then you potentially get an increase in those issues that come about from increased density and a diverse you know population well yes yeah that would be true and so it opens up opportunities for various people who want that type of activity who want to be able to have access to shopping to bars to restaurants to be able to walk to these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in retirement and hospices yes i agree that they probably would quite like to use the mall for the supermarket or what have you I doubt very much that they 're kicking their heels up at eight months on a Thursday night and with the increased with the increased number I knew the whole point about that though because i live in high-density really high density and the noise and the area i live is leased and when i lived in a suburban area Lamar 's going dogs barking kids playing it 's it is quieter in high dental in my view as your is your concern sir Revere sensitivity from higher density on those or is it on those yes rest homes and what increased density does to suburbs where I guess quietness or you know the quiet road traffic the Safety 's that go with that parking can have a negative effect on people who are living in you know retirement and my mother is not very fond of villages and nothing to do with others is that yeah quite a bit of feedback from retirement village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and department villages should be doable safe a point today how did the air how did the feedback was that they needed relaxation in terms of the look and feel of the place other place high density and from our top from the sound from any submissions from the from the comments would be the same as what the elderly who stay in their own homes which is something that we all try and encourage and you know as long as we can I 'm thinking of those as well i mean you 're talking about it from an operator as a business perspective but i 'm talking about it from residents perspective oh my quite interesting and we found in our community consultation sessions the biggest of what we got was from addley for anything to fication because it allows them to stay in their own suburbs but move to smaller units they don 't necessarily want to remain that in a big big section with a finger path and they actually seeing it as a positive were keeping our delivery they already are okay all right thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane is a blunt tool in terms of intensification there 's only one part of the intensification story when you come to looking at these areas and this is something the council undoubtedly would need to tune in mind to as these areas develop as the fact that when you 've got more localized planning as more often needed in particular areas particularly those such as you say that may have challenging issues such as parking so you narrow roads although they are beneficial because they slow traffic so there are some benefits to those intensification with slower roads and and then you get maybe on the other side of town you 've got very wide Road so they you know they can create just as many issues because these faster traffic movements so every intensification area does need a finer grained level of plenty you know to realize its benefits yeah and I think you also touched on the dichotomy that there always is when when neighborhoods are changing from lower density one house on a section through to medium or higher density I mean that 's the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly in Auckland at the moment but the issues are there that we just do not have the land to continue with normal or what we knew as ordinary suburban development back in the 50s right across the plains that 's why we 're trying to promote certain areas that meet certain criteria for more density living and and then that provides choice of housing type as well that 's right it does it does bring other issues that also need but that they 're not necessarily always those rules aren 't necessarily bought and through the district plan they might require other types of support you talked earlier about logical boundaries and there are two things on this map that I 'm seeing that don 't necessarily fit with that at the junction of webb street and pepper nuit road there are just two little sections which are noted as rmd when the rest of it has all been taken out so just two sections there and then the other question I 've got is presumably the grey area at the top of that block is commercial so how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks as though it wasn 't zoned residential in first place yeah so what the opposite at the end of webb street and on the opposite side of the road to two sections there in yellow on pattern uri road yet just at the end of the just opposite that wedge street junction there you know the answer to that you guys existing um well we 'll look at that a little more i think we 're trying to determine what 's actually on those two sites would it be that there 's something on those sites that already meets the criteria for medium density they may already be signed hmm Ron maybe well up for you already right and then at the top of that block where you 've got the consultation area that looks as though it originally went outside of the residential area how would that be so you 've got the area removed shading over a gray rather than a yellow area I i believe thats where did there was an issue about the there 's only the underlines only being commercial activity or res no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mistake no permanent that 's right but but look we 'll make sure we come back and we tell you specifically when we bring the revision back so overall you 're happy with it map apart from that yeah no I 'm not happy with them that I 'm support the area being kept in not removed and I do support the submissions that have said immunity lower haight and to park to car park controls so so so sorry just to clarify and you support all of the HD area to go back and is medium residential this area here absolutely it 's right next to the key activity center it doesn 't seem right that you remove it I can 't understand the logic the stuff on the other side of the road is actually further away from the key activities seem to this is the stuff on the others that you 're removing that actually makes more sense so I 'd rather see this area liftin but I do agree that there are traffic issues so I think you do need some site specific controls around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can 't really refer it 's in the public comments on the feedback that people support us but they do have concerns about traffic which I share so we need some guidance about the met first was quite a lot that was about saturday us about average pick and general is with consultation we tend to hear from we hear from d to hear from the less than happy people I think it 's fair to say that the general tone of all the feedback would have been about 18 18 six ninety percent not Scott and perhaps you could guide the counselors to that area 's part of your section 32 I think we you heads these submissions broken down into each of the centers and and then you could have a look at the comments yourselves just,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

New Zealand",1320,"much more detailed discussion at appendix three means it 's three right the second there isn 't got paid under for the appendices I 'm sorry hold it up what it looks like show them the page wouldn 't have said it looks like this but it 's at the front if you start with the front near the a3 neither to see the bay freeze about five pages after five to ten pages after okay I 'll just tell what it sees quickly so appendix three goes into much more detail it has a table view that sees the central city now this is based on zip 2009 growth model and you may or may not be familiar with the growth model but it underpins pretty much all our household yields and capacity and subscribe for the regional policy statement we 've got a different version the new so we don 't have we 've only got a table starts with Brock with place salisbury street the type of the first table you 'll see an appendix 3 i 'll just quickly run through the first table the ridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the intensification split for greater Christchurch under the loop just be mindful that 's why we 've had to apportion it out to Christchurch it was always assumed through the Utes in the after year said about eighty-five percent of intensification would occur through Christchurch City and so the next table when you turn over so this growth model indicates a theoretical capacity and this is in 2009 so it doesn 't take into account any of the additional living a reef residential medium density zoning but it indicates in the central city so this is still hold true that there 's a theoretical capacity or yield additional yield houses of 19,000 household units houses have some things and in the rest of the city that it 's outside the temple city and this includes a living two and three signs now they were always considered together because as John has mentioned they were both could yield and typically yield up to 30 houses per hit da and had the ability to be redeveloped to deliver 30 houses heatgear and that gave us 20,000 and then the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redevelopment about 4,000 on the fleet and 900 on the hills and summon lyttelton harbour but essentially the figure that you want to look at the most of that 20,000 because it goes the largest way towards delivering identification order to answer Glenn 's earlier question o.o Ali 's earlier question the ward that went by a country mile is Hadley fairy medium this intensification stakes yes because of the Senate is simplicity yeah but also the total the total existing capacity is sixty-six thousand or sixty seven thousand one hundred so you 've got the 46 300 plus the 2800 so so we 've got another 25 so if you look at the table before with a projected growth as City 36,000 we 've got twice as much almost twice as much capacity and the existing chain city plan so then the fundamental question i have is wife and create more intensification when you 've already got so much spare capacity i come back to my earlier point this is the district plan provides owning the 2041 not well beyond 20 28 I don 't have that right i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it won 't cover oh yes actually i guess i 'd take a ball with me come we can come back to on that but can I understand that the point wait there for intensive if we 're creating greater areas for intensification we 've already got 66,000 capacity at the moment how is that justified to areas that are going to be intensified we are not just simply carrying over everything into the proposed plan the repose the proposed plan is a as a new look at everything so what we 're proposing now is not the same as what 's in the operative plan it has changed and it 's based in the areas based on on the Centers the final question I have is what is the total capacity with the proposed changes that you 're proposing in terms of the residential in an intensification areas the total yield above so we know at the moment we 've got 666 or 67,000 if we do nothing we 've got 66,000 if we do the plan that we 're proposing what do we have twenty twenty thousand so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional areas that are recommended is your 20,000 that 's loving to and loving through right just really simple terms just put the old fan out the door we 've it 's a complete new plane so how much extra capacity does that create in the city for a yield so we know the old ones got 67,000 the new one will have it must be more than 20,000 because that 's only know because the amount the amount a period that we 're delivering it over as lease the 60,000 was to provide until 2041 actually it 's only eighteen hundred houses additional here it 's very marginal so they 're looking at the big picture yeah terms of the hassle guess the additional zoned areas only contribute at a minimum if we if they didn 't only yield at 30 houses heat deal all we 're eating to that bigger figure is 1800 houses on top of what we already have Frank say so to put it bluntly the current zoning goes a long way to achieving the household targets it always did but we always knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty strong what what the whole process has been is looking at other areas that quite honestly the market is more likely to pick up we acknowledge there 's a lot of areas in the east which even though they 've been zoned for 10 years now has been very low development most of the development occurs as we know around key activity centers that 's where the investment goes that 's where the upgrades go and that and so we always acknowledge the fact that those things are some of the triggers for success for intensification with all that stuff and the land use recovery plan in the district plan you 're saying that is only 1800 extra capacity being provide only an intensification areas medium density intensification ears I mean this is still a whole lot of new sites coming on board through the Greenfield areas they 're still all the zoning current zoning that has capacity in it to put this identity like more like suburban residential in it but the figure that we 're just talking about now is the medium density but I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the utes was 50 remember this is post the pre youthquake was fifty-three thousand households required for christchurch new households to 2041 now we 're providing for some 60,000 there isn 't much of a buffer between 60,000 what the proposed plan that 's right and medium density or you take that odom please forget that total household for greenfield and intensification so you 've only got about seven thousand if you 're using the previous growth figures in terms of a you might call it a buffer or it 's not that it 's not that much really over the forty eight forty year growth strategy will go back to the maps for the next one is Emily","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

New Zealand",3947,"things that didn 't appear on an end pretty much anything north of it around so the next medium density area is the Shirley area right can I just clarify from those who remain are you here for a particular area anybody in the audience are you here for a particular area all right right okay right smiling the notes so the Shirley area again looking at the original area that went out for consultation look to the core accessibility criterion took into account some logical boundaries in this case it was a SAM Hamas Lee Park School the golf course and Shirley intermediate surely boys school to the south gave us our initial focus for our study area we 've essentially what we 've done in Shirley is is reduce the reduce the extent of the potential residential medium density area down to the blocks the most accessible to the activity center of the palms the main driver he is on basis of supply and there are a couple of other issues going on in this area which council might be aware of regarding the community housing redevelopment mechanism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this is where housing New Zealand have an opportunity to redevelop some of their housing stock to medium density so take into account that particular element and also the the general level of accessibility we thought it most appropriate to reduce it down to the blocks which you 'll see on the map there so it 's the yellow block yes so the yellow blocks are the blocks that will remain to be resigned for medium density residential not the hashed blocks that 's correct yes um you know the question yeah the area as well we 've got concerns with the jewel Dean Strickler said each we wrote at the top of killing is not their only so all along surely Rory does a flooding area too so the area in the bottom left corner of the map there is an existing living three area which was transitions to residential medium density so it 's not part of this this new intensification area mm-hmm in the rest of it we on the role of flooding Scotland I think not now might be a good time to bring in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this in the last in the last couple of days and it 's put a little bit unfortunate that the natural hazards workshop hasn 't come in come before before this workshop but the general approach to these existing urban areas will be to raise floor levels will be to raise the floor levels within these areas raise ground level raise ram raised floor rear of all levels and that will make remain mean that these areas will remain buildable if it is so difficult when you 're intensifying in an existing area because do you have some up some down some people in tree houses and some people down in the lake I do understand your concerns there as it 's just difficult for us to know how to cut these workshops but you know we can bring you all this information but the questions that you 're asking now are very relevant but I wonder if we could keep them keep this maps with you and keep them for when we bring the ebit anthe sorry natural hazards workshop to you which is Tuesday it may be that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a clause that we put on to say that this doesn 't apply until this what again as I sayings instead of giving you any off-the-cuff comments today I would really appreciate if we could talk about that in the whole as part of the flooding natural hazards I accept that there is some flooding there and there are reasons for that which we can discuss on Tuesday so that 's only next week on tuesday at the moment we 're just showing you how we 've changed the density zoning so that 's what we 're focusing on today just at the moment but certainly keep these mex in front of you and ask those same questions I don 't have the the natural hazards people here is there any reason take understanding what you 've just said about natural hazards but is there any reason why you have taken these areas right up to the main roads that are shown I mean if for example once we do go over the natural heads I want to preempt there yes it looks as though it might be worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flood for whatever reasons we 'll address next week do you consider taking that are you able to consider taking the back from the main road or is that done for a reason if there 's a very good reason flooding wise to not have it up to the main road we would have to reconsider that at this stage and the understanding is that there isn 't and but John might like to respond to why currently they do go up to the main road you 've got a continuous area there of medium density either side will show you out for example so going up to the main road it gives you that sort of that road frontage of new development gives you a consistent streetscape as you move along the road overall in Shirley the main driver is really a supply issue there there 's it 's a red City Compaq Center you have some reasonable access into into the surrounding residential area to to zone all of that area 's potential medium density would would you know would exceed the supply you really need for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to really the most accessible blocks to the center also taken into account that the community housing redevelopment mechanism is to the northwest of that site so it also seemed logical to have something of a gap between that area and the medium density around the center I I kind of you know I think that urban development strategy had a percentage of greenfield development this is intensification so what this seems to be doing is we 've already taken one big area out that we 're now getting less and less intensification more and more greenfield development which is quite unsustainable long-term so um I am a bit concerned how the extent of what you 've taken this out but in the submissions that we got from people people see concern opposition regarding storm water issues and so and it just is to be further commented on so when are we going to get the comment is there going to be part of the natural hazards chapter and can we see a really clear assessment around the storm water issues in this local area and the infrastructure capacity issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're quite correct but going back to the overall picture regarding the balance between greenfield development versus intensification and eggs and already existing urban areas we do have a slide on that we can either bring it up now or we can continue through the max first and then go to the chart but there is still we are still meeting the household requirements for both definitely over meeting the Greenfield numbers but we will be meeting the intensification numbers as well and we can either bring that up now or at the end of these material easeful to get like a just a like a chart that showed urban development strategy public consultation what the feed that was in terms of the split what was agreed and then what 's happened before that is great what 's happened post-earthquake and and what and where we 're trying to go as as the district plan so that we can be really clear because it does seem a little bit Hillary huh girly we haven 't come with exactly those details because we 've come with the main issues that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greenfield and intensity hasn 't been raised as an issue and the feedback it already is set for us in a sense through the RPS and through the loop so so this is what we have to you and this is to show you that we are still meeting the air essential medium density requirements under the loop and the RPS and I invite are you speaking to the Scott or John well I mean I think getting that information babe I don 't we could go to a long day till now that I just I just want to a very general sense to understand where we 're heading because I guess one of the fears is that we 've resigned in a huge amount of land and we 're not getting the capacity to the land that we 've currently zoned resigning a whole bunch more and we 're having it in some areas we 're seeing a huge uptake and other areas but not seeing any up to you might recall counselor I think it was last month we had the land availability quarterly report to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is happening between greenfield areas versus intensification now while a lot of that land not all of it yet and some of the greenfield areas will come through a chapter and phase 2 but while a lot of that land now has its planning in place we can 't force the developers to bring it online necessarily and that was a discussion we 've had previously and we 've awesome report to come back but we do together for quartering how does a public submission on this one saying concerned about the infrastructure not get picked up but in Rick it does what 's what am I missing there well I think we tried to explain to you that the first indications were draft where we were asked to look at what areas could be increased in their intensity and as you recall those max had sort of fuzzy edges they were generalized quite maps and what we 've done now is done the more intensive work around looking at the various criteria and assessing each of these areas against their taking into consideration public feedback as well but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the report that we 've got we don 't have any comment on the storm water issues or the storage issues that people will raise what we 've just heard in terms of record and as there 's not capacity there to deal with it oh I 'm trying to understand as council assessment have we done versus this area given it public comments have been raising these concerns councillor satisfied councillor we we have substantial modeling for the area of around record on and in the eurozone church corner that I 'm quite clearly should clearly show to us that there are existing problems within those areas in terms of surely it 's a que so there 's no we 've had no known problems from you know from our other experience reported back to us but there doesn 't mean we need we we don 't need to go back to our experts to to double-check those figures the table as usual be aware we 're left with 77 recommended residential medium density areas the table looks at the or presents the or products sorry the potential number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to 20 28 add various at various residential densities the regional policy statement requires the council to to deliver intensification at least 30 households a hectare the most we we used mate the most it could be delivered at is at 60 households hit deer and the but it 's more likely that it would be somewhere between 30 and we think 40 households the heck do so within each of these so the total number of residential units that could be produced at 30 as 1854 and again these these are our best these are our best estimates and at 40 3337 but we think that the reality will be somewhere between those and just taking bringing up drawing on some loop figures the loop projects a need for and I 've rounded these are twenty one thousand households and into an intensification areas within the great across Nigeria and the vast majority of those are to be with in Christchurch we 've estimated that to be about eighty percent of that figure and then which leaves us something somewhere around 17,000 for intensification with in Greater Christchurch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if all goes to plan with a central but the within the central plans for the central city will locate within those leaving us somewhere from ten to eleven thousand of these being with in Christchurch suburbs it appears to me that surely papanui is award plus some of the houses and bishop dough which again is quite high in the net yield our Lord looks to be by far the biggest when it comes to what 's actually going to happen as far as the intensification effects are am I reading that Creek and on the left other than sorry that they 're meant to represent the centers because all of these medium density areas are around existing centers so around the existing centers that I 'm seeing on the left that would suggest that the Shirley Papa no award has by far the largest number of homes as far as the increase in density goes the largest would be done would look good and Bishop tail at 478 and 350 sorry I 'm looking at the net yield perhaps if I could explain the net yield as as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area that may potentially be residential medium density so look I don 't want to split hairs and help me here I don 't know rephrase it repeat what I 've just said looking at the figures we 've got up there surely papanui will have the highest number of homes for the density no I jelly I only actually reach me directly very Meade will because if you look around Linwood and you add the 700 from the central city by Ward it will beat you we will surely Papa no II bishop Dale and some in the mirror sorry i forgot about i forgot your head bishop there yes so there are areas the feet of the chili papanui and I know it 's not a competition but what my concern is that we 've got huge problems as far as the flooding goes and the infrastructure goes we have huge problems as far as road and goes we 've got four laning going into the area as well we 've got major issues that the hills warrington intersection which is going to hold up traffic there how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you look at the implementation of these but I see what you mean when you add together the various centers with an award yes and you 're right now it 's not a competition these areas are based on a number of criteria that John has discussed about you want medium density areas to be within walking distance of waste your time announcer no no no really interrupt you but I do understand all that all I 'm wanting to know is yeah those that she scientist mentioned which are huge in our area and abroad but yes are they taking them to consider yes they are okay yes fair that the flooding issues will come to you on tuesday the roading issues I mean they are being repaired as we speak none of these houses are going to appear overnight and in fact in the existing plan we have a huge amount of living two and three that was never taken up these day these figures don 't mean that it will happen simply initial its enabling right it 's enabling that truck here that 's correct the pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have known for a long time in the structure gets upgraded there 's a huge head instructor at growth program so they have given consideration so these names major concerns from any of the understand what you 're saying but there are houses in this area at the moment that can 't even flush the toilet so you know I know that there are ongoing upgrades and that 's part of the program and business as usual and a normal circumstance magic I understand that 's but we are in a really exceptional situation now yeah without a doubt this is why who 's always being the approach to not provide me and deeds me and one location or two or four it near the more you spirit of across the setting the greater chance you and impacted him okay and and I would say to counselor that of course the specific issues with to do with the specific area would be picked up at the time of the resource consent or the building consent and that would be considered as well but it 's highly unlikely that any build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not supported by suitable infrastructure yet and that won 't happen well well they in fact won 't get the consent for it if the structure is not there to support it thank you thank you if we got proposed greater density and lower socioeconomic areas or is that my wild imagination know when I look at those figures as indicated to you they 're all around centers that left-hand column is not wards it 's center-based for the criteria that we use to develop these areas in the first place okay but even looking at that in terms of center-based it still appears to me anyway if you look at those areas such as Linwood that part of Bishop fail a secret it it looks as if and the lower socio-economic areas is proposed greater density and obviously we 're having pushed back from arguably higher socio-economic areas that 's fine that 's what this is about people have their say but I just it might be too cynical or was clinical because what what 's not included on the list is all of the green fields development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't know which socio-economic group you put that in probably fairly high but the new key activity center also in the meadowlands area like would if you were putting that on here it would be massive intensification or what is currently a rural field and so I that what you 're seeing here is a partial picture sometimes which is impacted by the infrastructure capacity down record and rode me rival 's up there is a scene 2 2 yeah perhaps it fun if I may just take it up to the the initial starting point for looking at centers was that they they are either key activity key activity sensors or large neighborhood centers and the largest recovery plan and the regional policy statement both both say to look at the potential for intensification around key activity centers and large neighborhood centers so that was our starting point and that 's why we 've looked at all the centers that meet those initial criteria just slightly different I do share that surely concerns it 's not only the flocked an area but staples road barrier to through the down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know obviously quite careful than yeah perhaps off of it also if I could just further clarify the table the figures there are net yield figures so a net yield is what the potential development capacity is less what is already there so in areas where you currently have quite low density development particularly you know living one areas the net yield will be higher than areas where you may already have a high density development in the existing urban environment for example Merivale compared to bishop del rey oval is presently at a higher density overall than bishop del hence the yield figure for mayor volt appears to be less than bishop tail but it 's a product of both the area and the existing density within those areas it 's where we 're doing the density in hell we 're doing it hmm that 's right and that 's why we will bring you to the urban design criteria and andrew course through this presentation and just then one last one last point on this slide you 'll note that we used to mated ten to eleven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that of course the figures and the in the estimates table someone less than us so the balance would be would be spread across the existing intensification land available within the living one existing living one two and three zones the new reason or obviously the new residential medium density zone and the luke intensification mechanisms as well that were introduced last december though we where we have a confidence that what we 've supplied to 2020 act to date should be sufficient if not perhaps a little more than what 's needed initially or to 20 28 so shall we meet also didn 't share but we got in the figure here for the Dixon area whether this figure already considered and reflector pew is you know the star mention the Prado show terrorists and the iris tree and diverse tree your original intention try to have a changing the medium density residential over popular you mean keep the remainder same soul Ithaca already reflect or not yet if these figures bring based on the original maxell the new maps behemoth the new mix those are the areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ um is presently included in that figure so that will have to be subtracted from that figure from so the outcome of which which for riccarton the figure will be substantially less please but we 're rixton you need to take into account that this audio frayed big area of l3 sorry what streep is that sorry daffadar wall street is to the east of the railway line and that area is already zoned as living three which enables medium density already so effectively there 's no changing it just help me understand most fundamental question our existing city plan has extra capacity for how many yield what yield so if we made no changes and we just use the existing zoning what 's the current yield that that would provide in 2020 we do in their section 32 appendix I with me I find it you","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"
NZ,NZ,Christchurch City Council,Christchurch City Council,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZETwErnCvvgbvBbnnHfyxA,02.05.14 - District Plan Review - Part 1,aQeXJh6K9_w,20140502,1466.37,"Christchurch, New Zealand",3250,so just welcome to you all and as I understand you 're here from the very special ward of racket and Wigram well what we will do is start with the items that are of most interest to you so that you don 't have to listen to despite the fact that you 'll find it amazingly entertaining and the entire rest of the residential chapter so okay with you present yep day the 17th where we only got through half of the industrial chapter so today we 're here to begin residential then we have another meeting later this week on industrial contaminated land and then we have another day on natural hazards and subdivision now you 'll recall that on those first chapters the process that we 've been through as we 've had some time with you to go through in detail each of the chapter and then on the previous on the following workshop we 've come back to you with just areas and orange where we have made changes according to the discussion and where we 've got to our understanding of what you the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still need to do that for at least four more chapters so this is the second part of the process and you see in big letters at the bottom there I 've got the words that we require up to an additional two days in order to finish this program to meet that 28th of June public notification of these first eight chapters and while we can 't do that right here and right now my comment would be to you for us to be able to achieve this timeframe we would need to get those additional days workshop in before the 12th of may which is the final air cow committee we would then sign off all of the changes that you have given us and the revisions that have been made that have come to you through workshops so just take you through quickly the papers that you have on your desk you should have the draft residential chapter and the section 32 which is this black bound copy you should have a copy of the proposed medium density areas and the changes to that and we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have members of the public with us you should have a net of potential local convenience retail areas that 's one with the green stars on it you also asked for in the mirror asked for a list of private plan changes and how they may impact on this program I would bring your attention to the back the back of the list where there are one two three four private plan changes that are contained within the sphere state chapters to be notified in June so they are ready to go along for notification and they are all Greenfield business or residential ears in the last thing that was a square and i 'm not sure if it was canceled johansson or others there are a series of mex here that indicate to you can find semi confined and unconfined aquifers for you to have reference to it your leisure so today we are only focusing on the residential chapter and I had with me members of the team who have been responsible for drafting this chapter in the section 32 we thought we should all be here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of issues that there are perhaps to go through so if I could just introduce scott blair who 's the chapter leader Sarah Oliver John scelan it can sarkin has a urban designer I have my our technician here to make sure that I can run this program in Brent busy here who 's a council legal counsel for the council in-house counsel so at this point these are the these are the significant issues that have been raised through public engagement process and also through C job comments and various other comments and we thought we 'd start with the residential medium areas and John scelan is going to talk to this and we 'll talk through each of the maps now unfortunately the system is quite slow so it may take some time to get some of the Mets up on the screen but we do have them here so John over to you thank you um before I get into the maps it might be quite useful just to get rid of context as to why we have looked at intensification options around key activity centers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this and we 're trying to be consistent to the work that 's gone previously in the strategic directions that have been set previously goes right back to the 2006-2007 and year development strategy it 's kind of long story short the output of the urban event strategy was a mix of consolidation and greenfield growth across the city through various developments including the land use recovery plan that strategic direction has been pretty much retained and we are still looking at a balance of greenfield growth in the city and intensification the focus for intensification in the city is really from a number of avenues this ongoing info which is development in existing living one living to and to a certain extent nearly three zones there 's also an element of intensification in existing medium density enabling zones which are living to living three and also perhaps the most person issue today is the issue of additional areas for medium density around key activity centers and large neighborhood centers so at the start of this some process we undertook a analysis of all the centers which would qualify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in dirt and and East recovery plan and from there we went through a process of identifying the most appropriate centers so lurk directs us through the regional policy st. went to the key activity centers and large neighborhood centers and of all those centers across the city for various reasons we selected 10 centers initially to look at in further detail so the key activity centers to name to name a few the likes of riccarton Barrington papanui Linwood Shirley and a number of others so what we did then was to look at what would be the most appropriate area around those sensors to look at initially as a focus for study and we base this on core accessibility criteria and some logical boundaries where they existed the core accessibility criteria is a ten-minute walk approximately 800 meters distance and this gave us our study area without taking anything else into consideration this is what we focused on initially so after that we moved on to stage two Halloween public consultation on again that study areas which is what the public received in their information packs and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ details urban design issues more logical boundaries within those areas to reduce the area around each of those centers down to what we thought was most appropriate to meet the demand for intensification so this is where we 've we 've got to today and we 'll be presenting shortly some maps that show the outcome of that stage two of our assessment okay so perhaps if we can get funding to that so this is a written here apologies to the members of the public and lots or how clear this will be for you but I 'll try and I 'll try and talk you through it as best I can we do have a large map here which we can also pass around given the clarity of this can you guys read that ok at the beach you probably know it very well anyway it could but I don 't know how to write right okay all right I can ask somebody to hang out of season Rachel or perhaps if I can I 've talked to this as best I can I just I think most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went out for the public consultation um as a starting point the rixton area is somewhat different from the other key activity centers in that already has a large block of existing living three medium density land to the south of the Richter mall and commercial area and then we looked at accessibility around there sort of taken it out there 's some logical boundaries there 's a special emergency area to the west which draws gives you one logical boundary to the west and heading north you meet the river and school etc which provides a more logical bounders in assisting the brooklyn area one issue that came up first was supply and taking into account the existing living three medium density area to the south and then we looked at some of the issues to the north of riccarton road in particular where some infrastructure issues have been raised and also issues around the pressure on parking in the area caused by Richter more the upshot of that is that you 'll see the hashed area there is we 've decided to remove this area from potential residential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is this block here we did initially this is the block on bradshaw terrace either side of bradshaw terrace we initially thought that this would be an inclusion however advice received from our wastewater infrastructure engineers this past week have indicated that we should also remove that area as well so in instant yes this was a proposed living three zone in what we tap for the very beginning consultation a proposed medium density knowing which is as some of the equivalent to current loving three years okay and your current proposal is that it stays pretty much as it is no no sorry I have Masood again doesn 't it yes at present the area to the north of brixton road is a mix of living one and living two zones the proposal now is that we do not zone that area to residential medium density it would become residential suburban and part of that will retain the effective via living to overlay in effect there 's no change so the hashed area which was originally in the proposal is for medium density to be changed from living 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be taken out yes it 's correct that 's right it doesn 't become medium-density it does not become medium-density the area that is hashed with the orange lines I know I would just like to be oh there 's just one one one more point just to confirm I affects only one point to confirm one point to confirm our breath dear the area around bradshaw terrace which is this area here which is not hashed however that will have the same status as what 's around it and that 's some late advice received around that area and so that area will also be unchanged yeah yeah yes yes I just want to be really clear about what what 's um the changes so my understanding is we 've got a residential medium density and then a suburban residential density but there was talk about some areas being l1 and some areas being l2 when you take out the residential medium density do you basically we 've got rid of l1 and l2 so what 's it going back to as l1 going back to l2 or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and speak in the like okay and just while Scott 's coming back to the microphone just to make it clear also to the public that these are changes that are being recommended to the draft that will go to the minister these are not changes that are finalized the this this whole chapter is will the existing eight priority chapters go out for notification for submissions and further submissions stand it but I have actually spoken to the minister about this one as well so I 'm reasonably confident on this one they the living the existing living one and living two zones have been combined together and to what we 've called the residential suburban zone now the existing living two zones that have not been they were not recommending be up zoned or have an increase in density to living free density I showin as what we call it a density overlay within the residential will within the residential medium density zone and in other words you might call it a living to zone by another name it 's not actually a living to zone it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly higher density applies now those rules already exists within the but there are some living to areas that are within the areas that we 're recommending to be rezone door up zoned to the higher density that will go straight from living from the having toe into the rear and to the residential medium-density zone no understand it sorry what I 'm trying to understand is what is that we 're in the l1 the existing l1 are you intensifying to help what is the residential suburban density so so effectively as I understand it what you 're saying is yeah Altos pretty much got its own little area nearly a little bit that goes probably into that new residential suburban overlay but then there 's also l1 that 's going to be intensified to an l2 level as part of the proposal so yeah that 's correct can you show us where that is in terms of this map and just give me an understanding of what the difference will be from what currently exists there in terms of l12 what the residential density to be the residential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very small area adjacent if you could just scroll to the west there there is a small area here where the zone change where the zone is currently living too and that will transition to residential medium density this area here is living too as well we will not be including this area because the wastewater constraint their associated with the rippling sector it 's not supported and intensification at this time no actual living one of science though in riccarton there are no areas transitioning from living one to residential medium density to residential suburban so my understand residential suburban still enables a higher degree of intensification than what you 've currently got in living one no no it doesn 't it it is effectively the same density as he as a living one but the land use the living one and the residential medium density had that had the same minimum allotment sizes and residential density requirements other parts of the loop from last last December have introduced other intensification mechanisms I 'm sorry bit but that 's really live that 's the final question I have um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't cope how many other areas I mean how did it get in here in the first place if that was the case and how many other areas have we checked to ensure that infrastructure can or can 't cope we are going through each of the medium density areas with you now up on the maps and we 're showing you how they 're to change or how we 're proposing they change depending on what your feedback is so and the reducing for various reasons infrastructure is one of them all have been checked against infrastructure but that 's only one of the criteria that we 've used to reduce them and then what we want to do is go through a simple table with you to show how we can still meet intensification within the existing suburban areas as it is required through the lenses recovery plan what I 'm trying to understand is given that we could never provide the infrastructure how did these areas get in in the first place surely that you do that before you intensify so you know whether it 's feasible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay but the process doesn 't seem to have worked now that 's John began by saying talking about the criteria that we use to initially identify areas that may be appropriate for medium density okay and those were the basis of the max that went out for public engagement since then we 've done further work to refine them based on looking at those criteria more I guess more deeply so John if you just want to recap how we came up with the first set of maps and then as we go through each of the maps we will give you the reasons why they have reduced in size and madam chair just comment on this on the statutory context here when the draft plan change went out for consultation the RMA requires that its consultation whilst the draft is being considered while stats under preparation so it wasn 't a case of officers concluding via views on anything before consultant that was consultation wall officers are forming their views and part of that is further investigations through their information gatherings mr. me that we put the community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checked on the most basic thing as whether infrastructure can cope with extra development and I can see how you might consider that but we also have requirements under the land use recovery plan and chapter six of the RPS for us to do this exercise so we did do that at a at a high level so be it as we were required to since then we 've gone through public engagement but also we have gone through further refinement and that 's why we 're coming back to you today with each of these maps to go through okay so can I just be very clear there 's no problem with any of the counselors from from the suggestion from the staff that these in more intense zonings come off so that we can allow the cookie of represent ago home and pursue their lives and that we can move on to the next area we 're fine with it you are happy Jimmy yep stop can you prove a with us regarding to llamala wheel easter and Marcus tree Easter power street I o streets still keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ryan the top corner variant corner pub right in this way also no change it not chocolate Thank You aunt this move thank you and we 'll just wait for one minute so if people want to leave they may thank you for coming it 's worth pleasure to see,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

2,m_jv3w94gwI,20140501,1404.059,"Christchurch, New Zealand",3948,"thank you very much I think people have done a bit of work over the lunch break to get this resolution unto a format and we 've got it moved and seconded by Councillor boxing and councillor Livingston so I suggest that we debate the resolution and then i 'll put the resolution and then we 'll be able to move on so would anyone like to debate Earl in Livingston thank you yes effectively what we 're beginning to go down the path of in my view is a housing plan for Christchurch and I think that what we see beginning today and then further down the track when we do consult with the other parts are the values and the priorities for housing in Christchurch it 's actually been said before that the measure of a society is its priority for its poor and this council has for decades kind of enshrined that principle in its dedication to social housing in Christchurch what we 're looking at leading on from this obviously is a possible restructure of their housing so in order to enable us to attract the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all is the provision of warm cry good housing for our tenants you also know that we 're looking at affordable housing much of that comes from the MV and other data which indicates that that is the biggest gap in the housing market and Christchurch at the moment is affordable rentals we will get to that later on in our consultation with the community some may argue whether or not it is the role of a council to take part in social housing and I think for the rest of in affordable housing in the rest of the country that argument would probably be a bit hard to to get across the line and I think an ordinary time that would be too but we 're in extraordinary times rent has gone up in private housing private rentals by forty two percent in the last year at least there 's been a loss of two-thirds of private rentals we know of people living in overcrowded houses are no 25 and one house and our suburbs we know people sleeping by the beach our Park Rangers see them really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we actually do have a crisis and I don 't think that that word is and the use of it is necessarily being that melodramatic fergie used it before a description of a crisis is anything or an issue that affects the community this is having a profound effect on the community we haven 't even talked about the miserable health outcomes of a lack of adequate affordable housing for our community but but those figures are known as well the government itself commissioned a report or had a report in 2013 looking at national infrastructure and housing itself was actually identified as a significant part of infrastructure so you 'll know the full well beings have gone although Sarah still talks about them in their recovery strategy they 've been replaced by infrastructure and this report actually confirms that housing can be seen as a necessary part of infrastructure so on the weight of that and with what we are going through and Christchurch I think once we get to that point that we will see I think in my view there is a strong case to pursue the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affordable housing in Christchurch these are extraordinary times I did have an amendment or actually not an amendment but in addition I 'm not sure whether you 're able to bring that up at this point Rachel in the staff and the policy on affordable housing it 's okay if you can 't find it there what it is Paul Cottam and I talked about this in developing the policy on affordable housing where it contains the principles the first principle is about housing being a human right and we had a piece that was going to go in there about as per the United Nations Charter New Zealand is a signatory to that charter in my view on this is that actually central and local governments are bound up by that and have an obligation at any time and following a natural disaster to make good on that signature in the Charter my view then and the total sum of this is that we must act we must act for our constituents together with the government they 've already given a cent to that in the signing of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for housing sorry counsel I 'm going to be a bit strict on time that 's all yeah I made an appointment thank you thank you Paul just three minutes things look no one looked out that we you know housing is really really important for our community and there is no doubt that Christchurch City Council was a large provider of housing and the social housing perspective where the second largest landowner in New Zealand signifies that we are in this in a big way my concern is the removal of queen or and the bullet points that follow that I think as a large provider we need to look at all options we know how difficult our financial situation is at the moment thing I want to see happen as it burden our ratepayers to any more degree than they were already are so I 'm happy to go out and I understand what the counselor Livingston said he 's almost talking like it 's a done deal but we 've got to consult with their community and we might find a different outcome from it so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go see how they 're thinking but we also can be very very mindful of our ratepayers so I would like to see those options still left in there I 'm not happy with them and its current form so I wish you 'd vote against us if that 's not actually reinstated in there because we do need to be prudent and look at all options a point of order and those options those options are still in there though were just some that was selected from the options that are dented I don 't know all know 10 options no I think the and other areas that we 've done in the forward pass point we want to make sure they 're actually of highlighted in the resolution so I want to see them highlighted in the resolution so they don 't get lost or buried and other documentation I 'm Jamie yeah thanks just before I do start on that Pauline 's point of order around them that option being included that that 's not the case since is the 10 options identified in the staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or all for portfolio sets and measured what it actually speaks to and the staff report is selling it to a communal community housing provider so that actually now is a stroker Weaver okay would it be appropriate to include selling down part or all of the portfolio 's was originally be able to now struck out I think option 20 from memory of the staff court anyway the thing is is that if people want to have a vote on that going back into the paper or do it as Paul seed vote against the resolution you know so all right well if you 've got all options being considered then I 'm then I 'm on board well why don 't we take out the word tin and just say through the options identified and just say yeah even just put on all all all the options I mean I going to come back to us with the statement of proposal so you know if there 's any way but Jamie do okay well I 'll speak to that then I was actually gonna I was gonna stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I just mentioned the point of order before but I 've actually supportive over now so i 'll just quickly rewrite my speech and on the fly look the reality is housing is an absolute crisis point in Christ you try now we 're all all aware of that sit around the the ball type of see CHL and I do have some reservations I 've got I 've got to be friends with you as a director of CC hlu you 've got to be acting in the best interests of the company you 're bound by the companies act can I hand on heart stand up here and tell my colleagues and community that are borrowing to the hilt slightly under benton covenants in 2019 is that in the best interests of the company I don 't know if I can but I need more options around them I was going actually some of my friends and the property game will speak of a swig of Barracuda and things and it 's that 's really about being nimble and having teeth and I think as as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and actually make the changes required to get the best outcomes for our community and I guess my concern around this which I hope we can find a way forward is that I can stand up here and I would love to make a whole lot of promises about what we can achieve as a council for our community because we 're all here to achieve great outcomes for a community and have a better city as a result of that I can 't do that because there 's so much unexpected items that will occur the one thing I can guarantee you is that the unexpected will occur so if we 're absolutely leveraged to the hilt and we don 't have that wriggle room to be that Barracuda I guess when you when you need to be then that 's going to leave us like this and upon surrounded by the Barracudas and they do have teeth and for the community that 's not going to be pleasurable and the slightest the fact of the matter that we 're going to include all the options in the staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genuine question that needs to be answered garbage and ultimately equals garbage out and that 's not what we what we are here to do we 're here to deliver a great resolution for the community and for us to be able to do that we need to have all information on the table and to consider it if we 're going to hamstring ourselves we 're not going to be able to come up with a good decision I 'm interested in finding a way forward with housing but it 's got to stack up I 'm not going to be shortchanged in the community and I need to find a way that it satisfies a good smart financial return the final point that I want to make is that I 've had a couple of people saying questions have been raised look is this going to be a safe investment I think it 's the wrong question safe investments are a dime a dozen you know put money in the bank means it 's a safe investment what I 'm interested in is a city councilor or representative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart financially prudent decision is about ensuring greater value return than the original capital outlay so if we have all options on the table and we can find a way forward and if we 're going to generate greater value than the capital outlay in the first instance hey I 'm in but we need to have all the options on the table I see that that 's been added in there now some happy we 're going to be asking a question of the community and we 're not putting blinkers on or hamstring them so let 's just be upfront and Frank and I reserve my right to to see if we progress this once I 've seen and if we can be that barracuda and be nimble it fells Thank You lien look I 'm not sure I recently I watched the film about Abraham Lincoln and one of the represented representatives of the time said this he said I 've worked hard for the good of the people without caring for any of them and I just want you to know that as a former social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not going to walk away from Christchurch City Council 's proud history of our policy of caring for some and especially most of our vulnerable people and I 'm sure our council is not either but some of the some of the facts around that housing crisis currently are really more than alarming we housing trust people tell me that we 've got they have cases of young young mothers who are sleeping in cars and babies with them as well and those young people have nowhere to go so clearly this is a very serious situation and we cannot do nothing I know council are not saying there and I just want you to know too that I think that much of the focus so far and why this is so important is about the rebuild and repair and people have been left out of the equation and that 's happened with the eqc and it 's happened with the counter with government 's focus on the anchor anchor projects it has not been unfortunately about housing for people this is the beginning of a housing plan is as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air people so as a I want air Council to take a progressive view we can use the levers of local government to resolve our housing problems the shortages are estimated of houses between eight and eleven thousand so creating the housing entity is like a first step that we can take it 's actually a total myth that city housing is costing the ratepayers it 's been self funding it 's ring-fenced there 's been zero cost and so with the new housing entity gives us a chance to develop new model it certainly develops the beginning and a sensible beginning of the whole housing plan and I also want to say and I think it will be an excellent investment when was housing in our city not a good investment so I actually want to applaud cancer Vicki buck and Glenn Livingston and Pauline cutter for all the work you 've done and I want to thank the staff to thank you Jimmy chin I support at least one the reason is we need to review the housing no matter affordable housing social housing this housing is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should obey our responsibilities and also our both our name will be concerned about a housing second is we can review a moment the environment in the atmosphere it 's extraordinary time it 's not a business as usual especially like the regular this model sheep emphasize rhinos housing a risk about 11,000 of property has been a damaged need to be repair or maybe quite a few unrepairable so how to meet the needs as a local government especially after the City Council I think we should take a proactive way this is a kind of ERISA for this one 's kind of release from signal we are not neither you know that ignore or neither nicknames almost the suffering the people third one is my personal view this this kind of the recommendation not only not only the care for the low-income people because it will base under the theories or you know under 30 percentage of the income you know the public energy by morning k not however due to the supply in the demand there 's a big difference actually affect middle class the population because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cannot meet the demand that 's a peek okay but you council take 480 way what working together with the garment with the housing of providers even if we establish this kind of independent kind of the company or entity but it is can narrow this gap between the demand and the supply H only benefit to the middle class the people s very important because middle-class people actually is the foundation is a base in keep this society more stable and also if we go to the public consultation with the proper draft a statement or proposal and affordable housing the policy edge we can get a more feedback from the community from the wider the repair of all the people give us sufficient information make the proper the decision now that in the initial stage we against I don 't think there 's our proper attitude so that 's why I supported this recommendation thank you thank you I 've got Ellie and Yanni thank you social housing or affordable housing the question that 's been asked and some of us have a considered as well as whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it apart should it be a part of our role and do the answers to those questions change because of the exceptional circumstances that we 're in and these are things that I have been grappling with myself over the last month or so no one could disagree that we are in a serious situation in the city particularly with regards to rentals and I for one know that looking for somewhere to live at the moment after being out of our own house for nearly three years because of insurance delays and we are not the only ones i do think that insurance companies in eq c play a role in this as well and they need to step up they are helping to add to this crisis with the delays and they need to address the part that they are playing this crisis affordable housing is an issue but I repeat again is at the role of the City Council to get involved and into this market or do we do it because this is an exceptional situation I will be supporting this so that there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are in exceptional times and we need to have all of the information to make an informed decision yani thank you um I will support these recommendations I 'm actually this is asking for more work to be done so this isn 't the substantive decision but I think this is sending a really powerful signal to our community into our city about us and tending to be proactive can I say I did get I think this is great that government have no knowledge that they do need to intervene in the marker in twentieth of April 2012 following the leader I sent in February 2012 to Sara the response i got back asking for intervention was that the government intervention in the rental housing market would be minimal their response at that time was to leave it to the market and we 've seen what 's happened as a result rents have gone through the roof people are stressed and suffering and struggling and we 've got a city that has a housing crisis so I think it 's great that government have now acknowledged although it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us would have liked that they have an important role to play in the housing market in Christchurch post-earthquake so it 's incredibly critical I think that we work with government constructively over the models going forward so that we can get action in place TPA the tenants Protection Association did a did a survey in 2013 and there 's three quotes as I 've gotten here which I think summarize what 's happening in our city rinks going up a hundred dollars a week is that a fair increase someone wrote the second person i 've just received a 90-day notice but I 've always looked after the place and paid my rent I can 't afford the rents now where will I go what will I do and a third one I 'm scared to ask for anything to be fixed they might put the rent up again or worse they might kick me out for complaining that is the reality of what tenants in our city are going through unfair exorbitant rent increases that they cannot afford afraid to ask for basic things to be done to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evicted so that the root can go up that 's crazy that 's not the sort of city I want to live in and I 'm incredibly proud that this council has a proud tradition of standing up for providing housing as a basic human right affordable and accessible housing is a basic human right and we should be incredibly proactive in that space because the market will not deliver we have seen a complete and utter market failure to provide affordable housing to our citizens in the greatest time of need that we 've ever had so I believe we have to do something and I 'm totally committed to doing being proactive and looking creatively at what the solutions are I welcome getting something out in a few weeks time where the public can also feedback we have a history of having a strong social conscience around this council table and in this city and I think it 's incredibly important that we continue to show that we care for the most vulnerable that is how we will be judged how we treat those people that are most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards addressing this major issue in our city so I 'm incredibly supportive of us doing it can I say finally it 's not just about rezoning we 've tried that as well one of the other government interventions was to just enable a lot more rezoning of greenfield land what we know is actually we 've got Spears owning capacity in the city for tens of thousands of extra houses to be built they 're not being built again market failure it is not about simply rezoning we have to move to a situation where houses are being built that people can actually live in and deal with the housing crisis we have and this is part of what we 're doing here when we 've tried other things that have failed or not delivered this is part of a new approach and I strongly support it","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

1,8F45Ydo-umA,20140501,849.76,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1708,councils role and affordable housing yep so I thought I might do some phone calls now can you just lock the door just joking okay so there there are some some supplementary there 's a supplementary resolution that has been worked on yeah yeah maybe if I just introduced this one this report was deferred last week to enable staff to present you with more information because we believed that we hadn 't given you sufficient information to make the decision that to make a decision in looking at it further and we 've actually come up with a suggested set of resolutions which will take us forward and I don 't unless anybody would like to add any background to the Y or the look we 're for maybe Carolyn Gallagher would and we could put up these staff recommendations for your consideration right thank you so the reason that these resolutions as Jane has said have been written like this is to address some of the discussions and the issues that have been raised since the report has been prepared so the first resolution first second and third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colombo we can get on and do this so did Stuart copy do we have a hard copy of us like it 's incredibly hard to see all of that right so I could wreck would you like me to read out the resolution yeah but I think having a hard copy and we may have to defer this to after that so okay so the first three resolutions relate to the sale of wells in Colombo and we think that we can get on with that and independently of the report in the ECP the second the fourth resolution relates to social housing and here we 're saying is that we have undertaken extensive analysis both from a a policy and from a financial analysis relating to all of the options open for our social housing portfolio and that we 're saying here is that we can produce a statement of proposal by the 12th of may and we can demonstrate a net proposal that we can go out for consultation around future use of our social housing portfolio an option M&E 5th resolution so the fifth one there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six talks to the issues that have been raised subsequent to the report being written and this relates to the affordable housing entity specifically we still need to do further analysis relating to the financial legal and governance understandings of the Affordable entity so we need to do more work around us so what we are requesting here as that staff be tasked with investigating as part of the on top of the proposal whether or not one or more entities should be established to take a long-term interest in the management of social and and or affordable housing and that this work includes possible structure financial requirements and governance arrangements for such entity or entities and then the final resolution that we have put their sorry number seven is that separately to this we aren 't relating to a statement of proposal that council requests staff to prepare advice on the consultation process to be undertaken and respect of the housing accord with the crown and an affordable housing policy and such advice to be considered at the next meeting of council next week is so there 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be we 're more than happy to go through each of these resolutions and expand on them for for you we have changed that the sign off on the sale of Wells and colombo has to be through the council so i just have just changed it through the finance committee to account so when then count finance committee and council right yep does it does anyone want to move the motion are you if I 'm going to move it I 'd like to slightly differently and that 's that within its probably covered and but it 's somewhat vague so like also that staff be asked for a further report on the options for financing the new entity or entities to also include as well as what 's really in the report either monies or a loan from the capital endowment fund or the transfer of some housing SES especially those that need redevelopment or a mix of those options and also any possible texture issues it 's probably covered in five but I just want to be really clear that we need this I 'm okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes back to the council on the twelfth of me so it 's not next week that 's actually the following Monday yeah that 's right that 's ten days yeah yeah and obviously the issue about whether we actually need to go out for public consultation on that on aspects some aspects of the affordable housing policy will we will have the previous week yep yep in terms of the work in the accord I think actually government has been very good to work with on us what they can see and what we can see is that if we are going to actually make an impact on social housing or affordable housing and the line is actually very very blurred even though I understand that they have different definitions but it 's actually defined by the tenant now after the 14th of april and then we actually have to do something and this is a raft of initiatives which means that there is war but some action so we can cause of action being taken in the city to provide solutions particularly for rental housing through which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also the issue of the current and sustainability of the City Council with social housing if we look at our current model post-earthquake of cancelled social housing and our need to redevelop the end and rebuild so many of those units we cannot do it from within our current resources we absolutely have to do something different we don 't have a choice on that and we don 't have a lot of time on that either if you look at the housing account it also addresses for us the issue that this council I think has been trying to address some years and that is to it to access the government 's market rents policy in terms of what they top up on top of what the tenant pays so only councils don 't qualify for that housing New Zealand as I understand does and every other community housing provider but City Council 's are somehow exempt and as the second largest landlord in the country that makes a huge difference to us so the creation of the new entity or entities which is allowed for in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it doesn 't control fifty percent of to access that doesn 't impact on the tenant it does impact on the rent received on units and potentially on the rent received on two thousand units it means that we have some of the wherewithal to be able to do new stuff in terms of the debate on the 50 million from cchr I don 't actually mind if it 's 50 million or 30 million or 20 million or whatever this organization needs to be resourced so that it can do with government worth of community housing sector and was the private sector a joined up approach to actually dealing with what I think is a housing prices in Christchurch at the moment and I don 't think we can deny the severity of the issue but I have no problem if this does not come from CC HL I totally understand the financial constraints of this council that 's why I 'd like us to look at perhaps a loan or grant from the capital and diamond fund I understand the restrictions around that but it does mean that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we simply have the loss of interest on that there is a mistake in the document by the way on page 3 30 where it talks about that 50 million and suggests in paragraph 11.4 that the cost three years out is 2.6 six percent on rates if you look at the maths two-point-three percent its 2.3 million is not two-point-six percent of rates it 's about point six six percent less than one percent however if we can do it by perhaps transferring some assets from social housing into this new entity so it has sufficient grunt that 's fine too all we need to do is get on and make something happen in regards to housing in Christchurch so I 'm fine with these amendments so long as we can incorporate and looking at a dish at differing finance options as well and I 'll get this amendment to to Jane and the are sorry yes that 's very good and and also possible tax issues which have been raised that 's absolutely fine yes just before spec just have a question of clarification to understand with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out number four and replace it with a new amendment okay end it with a statement of proposal that 's ready to go on the 13th of May isn 't that right in thank you I just want to speak if I may not I think thousands shoes but I would be careful saying that I think we s you need to look at that option okay so we 're going to break for lunch well actually well why don 't we come back then at half past it had passed one so that people can have time to have lunch and then get back here all right,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

I 'm being a bit flippant and I should um you know sort of my personal interest and this is a husband that like cycling in this area I think counselors are also a net position particularly this this row but I know that it 's its core critical to the port and it is that it is the redundancy is that we 're in terms of alternative access to the port and you know we 're very keen to see it at heaven and I guess I mean it 's a significant report that that we 've been given here in terms of assessing risk from rock for one and the work that that 's been done in that area but cannot be done any sooner than this because it 's just such a core critical road that 's so many men 50 my apologies for taking the agenda from page 52 page 303 it 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right I 'm giving you can it be done sooner well the gateway that we need to pass well there 's two critical gateways one was actually getting it through through council obviously and the next critical gateway is the consenting and it 's a conceding that has the potential to to slow things down a fleet out how long well the consenting process we believe if the council decides to process this under the order in council which is what our preliminary advice would suggest and that would speed things up quite considerably yeah if we have to go through a normal notified consent process then we can what a definite time frame that the tent would depend on with the on the submissions and how vigorously anyone who was opposed to the proposal wanted to pursue the cause could be putting up in the environment court so the critical gateway is around consenting things become very much streamlined if we are able to use the order in council process so but as the date is that the order and council process or is that we have assumed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so when do we sign off on that or when does that proposal come up once we have your recommendation to Council once council endorses those 6.1 and 6.2 hopefully yeah then we can we 're just about ready to go with that the lodging of that consent application great well I 'd be really happy to move it because I want to see this open as quickly as possible Paul lonsdale second recent yani so several questions one is have the fuel companies that Kevin talk to the council probably two years ago been involved in this are they happy with the response and will their trucks use this right if these proposed works happen 33 met Emilia yes the fuel companies have been involved in directly through our discussions with LPC with the port company so the the fuel companies are very comfortable with the proposed option that we have in front of us whereas when we originally were talking to them the option was not as significant in terms of rock remediation as the one we have now so so both the oil companies aimed LPC extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we 've worked alongside and included the fault company in our working group I 'm sorry so this will obviously have an MP Don other areas like Sumner for example with heavy vehicles going through Wakefield air what 's the time frame for getting some of those other projects you know this is for projects Mobley cave shenghua preserve way cool f Alice 's work you know how is this tie-in to the work that 's happening there in terms of budget and in terms of time frame yep I 'm learning Armitage on the project Manta that 's looking after this corridor work we 're looking at the corridor as a whole but needing to get started on some railroad first because it 's actually closed we 're currently working on the investigations around Wakefield shared Rock reserve or some people call that peacocks gallop and marl bone with a view to getting rid of those shipping containers and get back to our pre crate leave early service at this point in time we 're trying to develop a program that pushes that program for us were very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and things in the year 17 top 2017 our top priority will be anywhere where we 've got a compromised level of service for example you know through peacocks gallop there 's some nasty pinch points at the corner so those would be a quite a high priority for us to deal with those first what 's your current budget expectation that so affect the budget this all summer road and the rest of the corridor is part of the infrastructure rebuild overall some program so actually we 've a lot their allowance within that program to deal with the whole corridor so 40 million ghosts towards what we 've got a hundred million we 've got three others today we 're 60 million group doesn 't doesn 't quite seem no no I working through it and we help hopefully when and then just the final question was um the local community boards why haven 't they been involved as a stakeholder or her phone they will be in the next place we wanted to update the elliptical this before we went to the community boards so you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's not even a mention of the community boards so as it possible perhaps to add them as a stakeholder and just I 'm just concerned because if you get adverse reaction to some of the environmental effects from the community boards they obviously has the risk to delay things so you know I work for this report prior to coming to council needs to go through the community boards because any reason why that couldn 't happen but there 's no reason why that through you madam there 's no reason why they can 't have an impact on two things one is we we were in a program of keeping community community boards the two community boards that are involved directly endless up to speed right up until we got to our final negotiations around the preferred option so so there is a bit of closing the loop to do with respect to community boards and terms of bring them up to where we are now so it 's a chicken and egg thing I mean that we had the abrasion with with the mirror and counselor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's where a broader but like you say it 's it was important that we close that loop and keep the community boards in the loop around where things around and just in conclusion then that 4.33 how are we simply telling people what we 're doing or actually giving people an opportunity to give feedback on the proposal in terms of things like design etc so is it going to be genuine public consultation or engagement or is it just a case of telling them what we 're doing well I think if you look at the public consultation or public participation spectrum we are somewhere between inform and consult there are some things that given the removable that intrinsic to what we what we need to do to progress but there are other things in which people can have some valued input into and we may decide to what degree we take those comments on board and incorporate them into the design so that 's kind of where it 's sitting in the spectrum I 'm Andrew thank you just a couple of questions if I may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the finished project will look like I look at this through the eyes of a person who might be sitting in diamondharbour or pool around has any investigation been undertaken as to whether that area could be planted at some stage so where the benching happens would it be possible for there to be any planting on that to soften the appearance our landscape in ecology team of work closely together developing the consent application which was coming together the subject of planting the benches has been discussed at length it 's very difficult to plant those successfully because it really is hard bare rock that we 're revealing rather than a lowest soil arrangement also we need to keep the benches clear because there is routine maintenance where large vehicles you know drive along and literally either push push any rock debris off those benches which would damage the planting every if it would be made to not make those benches look too sharp so leave them whether whether the natural appearance but over time lichens and things will grow back on and that 's the sort of vegetation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like you know for example thank you for that and my second question is around certainty with the budget for this project like obviously this a lot of investigative work been done a project of this size you know there could be all sorts of things we find as we get underway and I 'm guessing will be more investigation done before we actually start construction what level of confidence can we have in in project budget at the moment we 're doing some intrusive investigation in the form of core drilling up at the top of the bluffs that will give us a lot more information about the rock formation itself and the method that we can use to form the benches at the end of the exercise which is expected to be in a couple of weeks time we 'll be pulling that information together in revising the engineers cost estimate for the works so as we refine the scope will be refining the cost estimate and then that will have to move through the horizontal infrastructure process in terms of approving the agents code that was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the infrastructure rebuild effectively with three clients there so actually we 've got to get the other two clients Sarah and NZTA alongside us and working with us and particularly with NZTA there 's there 's a whole process our own applications for funding and they talk about value for money and all of these type of things so there 's a whole host processes that we need to work through in parallel with delivering this project so you know we need to we need to understand what those costs because that will drive our application for funding through through the infrastructure rebuild program David thank you since the earthquakes back in February 2011 has there been any sort of quantitative analysis of any further rock fall since the earthquakes or we haven 't measured any volumes but we 've observed significant rockfall particularly in June the journey Craik was devastating for their nyonya doing sorry the 213 OJT yeah but there 's been a title that narrative the earthquakes of substantively do we line are there any ongoing Rock Falls yes yeah yeah yeah the cliffs above are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes down to two you know if we 're doing some benching and other protective works which I 'm supportive up are we any safer driving on this road than driving on Porter 's Parcells disperse the mill road house pass all of those that is there going to be some sort of the element of risk Andy Andy what degree are we going to actually try and mitigate well perhaps I can answer that but it 's the debrief of the scope of the project is to return the road to same civil at similar level of resilience as it was prior to the earthquakes we will achieve that over two-thirds of the section of some of the road one-third of the section involving slightly listen that the crater rim bluffs which is the area where the area egb that 's right that area will inadvertently achieve a higher level of resilience simply because that is the only practicable option for us to deal with the substantial amount of rock fall in that area tential rock fall in area so every if it 's been made to get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and similar to that which was there prior to the earthquakes paul Fisher graduate staff this is a fabulous before them and I think not only is it credible for their ongoing commerciality of the pool let us also a lifeline for two communities which could be stranded but this one go back to the environmental aspects and I was privy to a briefing which I think i was invited to but looking at what the bench in there even though you can 't privately it is it fair to say that over time that look less you mold into the landscape soda and it 's changed coloring and it will weather wait your weather over time and as a as we 've said your normal sort of species of plants will will start to acute and a pinching by the look of it actually fits into the contours of what is exit resisting relearn that 's what it 's designed to do so clean thank you obviously a very keen to keep this open as soon as possible but this is slightly related to David 's Christian the actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on motor vehicle our travel will that change here you talked about a tolerable people but is that it will it be above or below what their actual specific measure is one in 10,000 they are today with the rodent we 're taking a slightly different approach then we have with life risk for residents and a dwelling on the port hills so I I know that you are aware of numbers risk numbers that are used you know to say whether a resident is safe in their house or not no we don 't know use numbers like that on the road what we do is we do more of a qualitative assessment in terms of this looks like it 's going to be a problem if this rock falls how catastrophic as the result of that will it close the road hello will the rock be so it 's a slightly different mechanism which we call qualitative rather than quantitative so we don 't actually put a number on it is the processes used around the state highway system around at all of the network very New Zealand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this away as in they are on Australia to just just as eager interest all right so i 'll put the resolution Yanni do check in terms of so it 's not going out for consultation and it 's not and I just want to check it is it is it I 'm not making the final decision but there is a pamphlet let you see there yeah I don 't know and basically what it caesars um we 're not seeking any further feedback yeah so I just wanted to check this is just on a stamina road not the shag no that 's fine but can it go to local Keaveney words for it to do a presentation at local community boards i think that would be great before it comes to account so when it before it comes to count so i think if we 're aware what the board 's views are they will help key clinks going rather than having to come to counsel the back to community board so I guess when I baskets from this committee as a possible this report to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it doesn 't need to go to community boards for import first it is just simply I mean it didn 't even need to come to come to counsel I thought it was really important that that counselors were aware of the substantial work that was going on in the background thus the reason that this is not going out for consultation as is that there 's already been consultation with them with the major stakeholders you know who are all listed here including Notaro and natty Vicky they 've had a really good feedback from all of those have got everyone signed off on it this is a technical solution to getting that part of that Network open so it 's not going out for consultation so it doesn 't seem to me that there is an urgency in terms of having the report go to the two community boards before we meet next week to sign it off because because the thing is what I don 't understand is if the community have concerns what is the process for us is elected members to feed dozer we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got very clear views but what we haven 't had as a chance for the public or the community to raise any concerns and we 're being asked to endorse the public engagement prices in a consultation strategy that doesn 't enable the community boards to feed them to this process that 's what concerns me it 's a public engagement phase of communications and it 's just a bit by approving the release of a public information leaders actually went to a media statement what we 're doing that 's right thank you on this one well I mean on this resolution the whole point of it is that this is at the technical part of the negrooo so it 's a technical decision that has been consulted with all the major stakeholders there there isn 't any input able to be given to this particular decision but if you want to vote against that the recommendation then then that 's that 's open to you I 'm going to put that all right um Andrew thank you yeah I mean I do note in 4.27 that there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest in the project and the only one on the list there that hasn 't been brought into the conversation are the community boards I mean I know there was a meeting set up late last year that was cancelled I really just want to send a message that it would have been good had the community boards been informed of what was happening and given the opportunity for input prior to the report coming to us i mean i believe the littleton community would be very supportive of this and the methodology and everything else I don 't think there would be too many concerns coming out of it also and I actually believe that littleton communities will be really pleased to see this work done because not only does it address economic issues around the port it addresses issues around littleton and somewhere as neighbors and transport resilience and access resilience issues for littleton around current arrangements with the tunnel and governors bay road and so on as well the community that i would flag some concerns that i would expect that we would get some some feedback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the harbor and it 's great to know that in your planning you 've taken into account visual amenity and i 'm also hoping the construction noise and so on would be something else that you 'll be taking into account around hours and days of working and that sort of thing so that 's me kind of anticipating what i would expect the diamond harbour and pour our community would have to say around this and i certainly welcome the comments that you 've made around exploring where the planting was appropriate or possible and also the weathering of the new benching and that sort of thing but yeah I mean I 'm broadly supportive of this and I believe that the communities on my side of the hills would be broadly supportive of this because it addresses core critical issues for the port I spoke to Peter Davy last night and he was really happy to see this on our agenda today and certainly for the community it addresses those social issues and resilience issues as well so with with the one reservation that the community boards weren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this today can I just for just for clarity the community boards have been involved in the conversation before the elections I took this to the community boards to the Acura community warden to the heck l 'affaire immediate community board so that the options have been before those boards and I did get the feedback that the benching option we know when I relate this is our favorite option that they were support there for the benching options so the only time the community boards haven 't been involved is the time between council starfish and finalizing the benching option is a preferred option and bring the report here today yep can I then in that case qualify what I said it would have been good if some of the contents are all of the contents of this report had been taken before the community boards for their comment on this proposal but you are going to take it back to the community boards and all we 're doing here isms we 're endorsing the initiation of the public engagement phase of the communications and consultation strategy the steep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a media statement that 's the public engagement process there has already been a significant beginning to the stakeholder engagement which does include the community boards ok so I 'm but we really quickly I just want to say not with sending the requirements under the LGA and the need for consultation I just don 't understand why we 're having some of these conversations just get on with that good I will do that so we 're going to put 6.1 separately so 6.1 with web you hippie to move both and seek and both of them right so i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no carried","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

3,xwyJA5mU51I,20140430,850.26,"Christchurch, New Zealand",2103,I just like to reassure counselors that it is well underway and you 'll see there we 've got the next week days it 's in its seven days we 've had a tremendous response for how close just this morning you can have given us one of the top engineers to work alongside the the task force so there there 's a lot of enthusiasm to get this report in front of counselors as requested I don 't know there 's anything else I can see I will undertake to give you short updates every couple of days but this is moving quickly but we 'll do what we can to keep your breasts with and they won 't be detailed it 'll just be what we 've done how we 're keeping it moving I have a resolution that I want to put on the table and I know that it 's been raised with me by several councillors so I think there will be strong support for it but what I 've been doing over the last short while as getting advice from within the council about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are affected by the by the flooding in the same way that the rates remission policy assistance with is quite damaged properties who aren 't able to live in their houses but we 've got a few people who are not able to live in their houses because of the flooding the advice that that I 've received finally yesterday was that the earthquake damaged properties and policy is not directly applicable to Hauser to households affected by flooding I tried to get I tried to get a definition that would that would kind of slot within the existing policy and it it 's just not not quite able to be done so what I would like to move is that I 'd like to move this motion that you can see in front of you that the council rates remission policy is a provision that the council sorry that the council requests that staff developed criteria to address the households affected by flooding and report back to council for decision by the end of May so that I mean the next council meeting is next week I just think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other things that are on the agenda so by the end of the month will be the meeting after that and I 'd like to move that and Eddie Jones would like to second us so could I open that up for discussion Pauline terrible question but would it if any result be retrospective I am expecting that it will be because we did apply but it Peters now looking at me with the shocked look upon us space are we able to make it retrospective to the time that they moved out right that will be included in the report so develop criteria to address the households affected by flooding as well as the timing of the rates remission so that will be included in the report I 'd actually no no no put that in the resolution please they go down to the bottom but the council requests its staff developed criteria to address the households affected by flooding and then put comma as well as the timing of the implementation of the new criteria and report back to council for dessert ya ali i just like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a large number of residents particularly and flockton but around slightest reason to Richmond have been asking for consideration for a while I just know personally rates remission for people out of their houses because of the earthquakes has made a huge difference to the ability to to manage things for Nietzsche so I just wanted to say thank you and Andrew thank you very much and I certainly welcome this one of the effects of flooding that we 've seen on the hills isn 't necessarily water ingress into people 's houses or water damage as such its land movement caused by flooding and I was wondering whether with the permission of the mover and seconder we could add something in there just to recognize maybe if we added the words addressing ourselves affected by flooding and landslides caused by flooding just to to specify that so that you know there are a number of people I know on the hills that are out of their houses because of landslip issues which have been caused by the water runoff yeah yeah okay yep well I 'm okay with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you i think this is wonderful I very much wish this was a tomb ago dealing with this over red zone actually which is parallel to this great move the levels of service are compromised people 's living this compromise great good start thank you jaani I presume but now that you 've added an additional wording that it won 't just be people that have had to have moved out there 's actually people that have been any data that 's still living in these properties so the report that comes back it 's not just the people that have moved out is it going to also include people that had been adversely affected in other ways as well know that it is about people who have had to move out that 's what the current policy applies to so I don 't think that we should as a matter of course be creating a policy that has a completely unseen certain financial impact without extensive reports so I you know I mean I understand that people have been affected by flooding and I had actually had wording that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current policies what we 're doing with this resolution as we 're extending the current rates remission policies to to a set of criteria that deal with flooding as opposed to earth quite related the current policy is about people who have to move out as a result of it so the current rates from Russian policy which has been in place for a considerable period of time that does not exist for people who remain in their homes it only exists for people who are essentially paying twice they 're paying rates or they 're paying additional mortgage somewhere else Ellie I think the issue there is that if people are still living in their houses and they 're damaged will be dangerous or they 're unhealthy it 's the insurance companies that she 'll be stepping up and looking after them there that 's not our job to be honest didn 't he I think we wait for the report to come back obviously it 's just it 's a key question that the report should should answer sort of staff can just think about that there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been flooded so you know whether or not they qualify I don 't know but as long as I want to I want to look at school I want to make this clear because this resolution it 's not to address everything that has arisen it is simply to extend the application of the existing policy so the counts I 'm going to change the wording of this because I think it 's unfair that people have a view that that it you know people want to amend it then fine but I what I mean by this is the council requests that staff developed criteria to and then put the words extend the existing rates from Russian policy to and then take out a dress that I 'm Peters now going to tell me off for that the he called me met a mere appeared that the council has had a Rachel immersion policy for many years yes it the policy is developed through a special consultant procedure typically live in your pain and in the draft in your plan at the moment the policy is out for consultation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year of the year before wrote specific words around remission for the port hills which is where the you said you 'd got advice that narrow in terms of what fits and doesn 't there are specific words in there the count the policy has had for a long time the words in writing up there in the middle of the council rates remission policy has a provision the council can buy specific resolution remit any rate on all rights penalty where it considers just an equal to do so so in terms of the motion on the table in front you at the moment you do not need to change the rates remission policy in terms of this report what this report is doing is operating within the current policy but it 's how do you apply the words just and equitable and we have done that earlier this year from memory with the houses on the port hills in relation to the section 124 notices no no it wasn 't that it 's the best minute where that also does not fit within the port hills words and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved in discussions we are a mission for those properties could be achieved through that what i call the just and equitable clause now you 're quite right and cancel your Hanson in terms of well what goes in that just a nickel and what does not that tight use the word criteria because you 're quite right mad at me r there needs to be certainty in those words both for the residents and also for the council star applying and deciding on individual patients on remission because clearly it Denise be clarity around whose rates are emitted and obviously whose are not but at the moment there 's no need and when you use the phrase extend the policy that that 's what I was there 's no need to extend the policy it 's a question of developing criteria as to what Justin legal means and that 's what the staff report is is look it will be advising you on but but the policy the criteria that apply to earthquake damaged properties it require people to be out of their home correct you 're quite right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I want to welcome and in that case what you could do is you could say as a council we will take those criteria and clearly because and one of the reasons sitting here thinking about it there are fairness issues about how you treat people in terms of your emissions and you could say we 'll take that model and we will settle on that model in the context of flooding and under the just and equitable course that 's entirely but you could you could certainly do that but you are not limited to that it 's a metaphor ultimately decision by the council but those words you know that they form a basis for the sky hammer all right so take out those words I sorry madam echoed the issue is about extend though isn 't it couldn 't you say the council requests that staff developed criteria to clarify and apply to because the policy is there the ability is there you don 't have to extend it you just need to make clear what the criteria is so that the application can be freely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applying it would that be yeah and probably take out the words that are highlighted in seeing the project you 're quite right they don 't need to be there okay so you 'll see the council requests that staff develop criteria to well well to apply to you don 't need clarify it 's just a nice to apply to households affected by flooding and landing that is caused by flooding as well as the timing of the implementation yep all right i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"
NZ,NZ,Christchurch City Council,Christchurch City Council,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZETwErnCvvgbvBbnnHfyxA,01.05.14 - Item 5 - Acting CEO Report - Part 2,x5xGpdJpvLY,20140430,1691.22,"Christchurch, New Zealand",4317,15 and 16 of self-explanatory 17 is another one with a resolution or a recommendation in there and I think it 's self-explanatory we could keep going with our special consultative and process there 's no reason why we shouldn 't but pragmatically we think that might be confusing to members of the public so the staff recommendation is that we pause until it 's clear and whether trading in any substances can resume and it will just stop any confusion so people generally happy with that that position so Jamie in that I am headed with it and it does make sense but you also Jane touch on the fact that you know the fundamentals of it are aren 't changing from what we understand that legal highs are still going to be available lb it through a testing regime so the fundamental question to the community of where is the most appropriate place for this to occur and what leaders that the council has to pull should be pulled though there is two still stands but there is I use some sort of uncertainty around what it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got around this pause or is it really just wait and see and we 're kind of reliant on the government is to win the clarity comes I haven 't got a time frame here like everybody else with probably we there was a fortnight till the legislation goes through and then I 'm not sure but we can form up and see if there 's any more information and we actually get that because my understanding was that there was quite a tight timeline liars associated with this what I don 't want to do is leave in place what we 've currently got by default for any longer than possible but the whole I agree with you and what you say here the whole basis of it has changed dramatically and I can 't currently explain the government policy to anybody who 's making a submission I don 't think they don 't neither I I can come back with a time frame I mean my personal view after having looked at what some other councils have done is that we should we should actually review our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ application to the point that that it 's well yeah it 's basically the other councils have taken a far more proactive stance on on limiting the availability and location of where it can be sold to zero so I mean if people were of a mind then you know I personally think that we should use this pause as a period to actually review the policy before it goes out for consultation but you know that you know that was the issue that will confronted with last week yeah that 's right for any longer than we need to but but literally the legislation will be passed in two weeks so so yeah yep so that the council pause the fear the console take their will pause the release of the documentas and up for consultation until set or the policy the draft policy the consultation until such time as it is clear with the training and any substance can resume or until until until such time as the as the government 's as the government has lead amended the legislation yeah yeah because ultimately what they 're really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be sold and potentially maybe maybe so I guess it 's just really around clarity and what the situation is which we still a bit fuzzy yeah well it 's not government as parliamentary until that such time is the legislation has been amended yeah no no no don 't apartment is the legislation has been amended yeah so such time till such time as a legislation has been amended yep any comment Joey chill in the first paragraph or one point assailant they 're such the last sentence the who are lost or expert committee is under the Department of Health or is a separate independent committee I don 't know but we can for it up and see if we can find out ok thank you did someone want to move it Paul lonsdale Jimmy Jamie Goff giant Yanni um I don 't know whether this will go in front of the submissions panel but one of the concerns I have is that there needs to be some if the bands coming in I 'm really concerned about the lack of treatment services available so should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right into government to ask what support are they putting in place to deal with the addiction and mental health treatment or the other the treatment programs for people can we deal with their after the legislation has been amended as well well I guess their concern is that if we wait then we have a huge delay and if there 's no service has been put in place now when the band comes up and then you 've got another delay but we 've got Harlem us has to pass it so there 's no point writing to them now at this we 're talking about a two week pause and then the document goes out for consultation that 's what that 's what this resolution does you know I understand that what I 'm concerned about is if we don 't say to government now that we need there needs to be extra support in place to deal with people that have addiction to this highly addictive substances then we end up in a situation we 've got a another mental health crisis on their hands because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been put around to deal with the consequence of the band Jamie I started coming on their leg you know I don 't disagree with yanni that 's all very valid but I just think that 's a bit of a red hearing for what we 're discussing right now I think that 's a different topic yes that this isn 't an opportunity to submit you know to to parliament are around what the changes are going to be I just really see this as saying do you want to pause our consultation process or not and I think years I think what yarn is saying is valid but it 's probably not relevant to this it 's not it 's all opportunity to put in a submission no it 's about how we 're going to act with respect to the amendment that governments don 't like I don 't know if the government is going to call for submissions I mean that that but that doesn 't i rather bits wide rather wait for two weeks until I find out what they 've done I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the you know to the minister of health or the Associate Minister of Health who 's responsible for the legislation saying that you know but if the if a band proceeds that that we have a I don 't know that they 're going to banner that 's not agree with hundreds in what I 'm saying is that I that I think our resolution that we have got up there is for us and how we 're going to eat y as a result but I 'm quite happy to write to the associate minister should they should there not be an opportunity for a submission but I don 't need a resolution to do that I 'll just undertake to do that all right so i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye there 's a place they know that 's carried and the only other thing i wanted to highlight before i go back to flooding and questions was 4.3 on the infrastructure rebuilt you will notice that that 's expanded we normally just give you a table on four point three point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I hope is useful probably two things to highlight one is on page 11 in the box there there 's nine hundred and sixty million dollars of funding available left and you 'll melt there that we have a work group and place to review the remainder that hasn 't yet been committed and over in there somewhere else I 'm sure it 's in here right at the end in fact we will be bringing it it 's very clearly cancels option in terms of the forward program so that is another big tight tightly focused team working together to bring you bring to you some options for how you may wish to use the remainder of the original estimate that was made is there enough money in there to complete all of the work and the horizontal one instruction I think that it 's with we haven 't updated the estimates since 2012 we 're still working to that estimate cancels view at that stage was that we were in round figures four hundred million dollars short to complete the program that we haven 't got scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains the position in its week that will be done this year their upward that may be done this year and we 're in receipt of bitter and bitter condition assessments yeah I Glenn obviously timelines and you know allocation of budget go together with this I noticed with the bridges in the east there 's another delay of about four weeks from scoot with the opened our bridge so that has a knock-on sequential affect the other bridges some terms of the actual funding year do you know how that 's going what 's skirt the money spent what they 're hoping to spend and how much won 't actually be spending I don 't know that that 's to do with funding up but but skirt are coming to brief cap well no council was going to be briefed by council out it 's good on the fifth of may next Monday yeah they would hope that they could have come today but they weren 't available to come on but but it actually will be a much better experience for council to go out to skirt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in relation to the 400 million dollar shortfall it also says any better they looking to reduce costs by twenty nine percent is it on top of the four hundred million shortfall can you just can you refer me exactly we it 's in the box sits in a box in the bottom is because we 're supposed to be getting like to like even if we don 't really like the life of like what we 're seeing is a she a lying if Elise yep yes not listen what this reduction it doesn 't take into account the four hundred million dollars so this is living within the total package of 1.8 and we have got as canceled as the owner as opposed to the Alliance participant as saying we want to see more efficiencies just on top of our obligation is forty percent of the build that says she stands even without cost-sharing agreement so with that shortfall if we want to continue on and as she finished the job properly that would still require the government and nzta to fund the sixty percent will decree I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do around allocating that within our own budget so I think the answer to that is no there there isn 't we haven 't got to that point yet we actually have to we have to go through a prioritization process of what remains anesh and that whole skirt program but I think there 's a misnomer and people forget that the cost share agreement covers the horizontal infrastructure just not just the skill correctly seventy percent of the workers through skill thirty percent is through the council yep and the other thing to emphasize at the moment we have to not only do but we seem to be doing everything we possibly can to manage within the budget that we know we 've got and that 's what this is signaling Vicki to Christians a motion to skirt and the Summoner road in terms of our reprioritization is there now included and skirt funding allocation no I 've just explained seventy percent thirty percent so it 's within the horizontal structure allocation not the scoot allocation so when we did the reprioritization and we had a whole pile of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of urgency and we wanted to bring those into the overall budget that was allocated to skirt one of the projects was the summer road which we deal with today is that and anyway kept the coke for catered for in any of the skirt manners I 'll see if I can get it maybe we 'll listen there 's now a horrible and it 's call it horizontal I can 't discuss our budget sorry it is decently in the horizontal in the structure budget I 'm teary sorry sorry yeah percent of that is covered by skirt about thirty percent is covered by works outside of skirt yes at the moment the Sun the road is outside of scary but still within that horizontal infrastructure put your weirdest but but it is hard for me I 'm working with the heck in terms of the prioritization of the projects that go through and we 've identified some there 's a high priority to work yeah the estimate in the yes there is some funding in there in the horizontal infrastructure rebuilt for works in the flockton area it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure is but it would be not as much as what the technical solutions that we 've come up with beautiful Rio would cost and t is it right to see there 's a land drainage and budget and then on yep as I was total of about a hundred and seventy or million yeah in your non skirt part of the horizontal infrastructure a bit more a governance issue and I see the chair of Stewart has been away for some considerable time how is that they 're operating without a chair it does have a chair and Chris McKenzie who is I don 't know what his title is but he 's independent he 's cheering it he hasn 't mark Ford I understand has been ill and will know whether he 's going to come back on board I wish I just correct mark thought is the chair of the hick UT not skirt yeah Yanni um so just just in terms of skirt obviously we 've got the briefing on Monday but the point that Paul was making is at what point do we tell our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to get a lesser quality and are we doing any work as a council to ascertain what the impact will be in terms of our 10 year plan so we 're going to have to go on and do renewals ahead of schedule that 's what the prioritization is about coming up with scenarios to fit within the budget for you to decide what we do or maybe what we don 't do or is there there may be things you want to dafair you haven 't been given the the information yet to do that but we would see by the end of May to inform the annual plan and definitely the long-term plan and what these scenarios might look like if it 's out of certain doubts on your decision they for example type ring close for example the decision to only fix half of the ride fully and to do the other half with a patchwork repair job and one of the most damaged roads and the earthquake doesn 't seem to make much seems so we 're not going to get a chance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're going to have an additional cost coming on to counsel in the next two to three years so you know currently in terms of what skirt are currently doing could they not wait until we 've had a chance to prioritize as a council before they make these decisions so that we can be really clear from our point of view why our expectations are no they can 't wait we 've got to keep fixing the horizontal infrastructure in the city and it would cost us more money to halt and regroup again we 've we 've got to keep keep them going on but it would be an example that you could bring up what thurman acquainted us ask them if why that was why that happened and what 's the plans for the other side yeah I know but I guess we have asked them at community board we 've repeatedly asked them but we kind of past the point of asking we actually at a governance level I think need to make some decisions of that about it because just have it just being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we haven 't got the instruction to do it doesn 't actually help solve the issue the second question I hadn 't run scooters can you just help us understand what they 're doing to align with our master plans and our central city plan I think that 's coming up on mondays part of the reason right so we will get very clear information about how they 're doing alignment I hope so follow up before Monday thank you aight we Christians one on the artillery and one just notice that I would like to ask a question of the CFO in committee on the crossing car back but not have left part and later on in the meeting and the crestridge art gallery are we confident that the least that we 've got on the adjoining land for the base isolation it 's going to exert we 're still confident that there will be for a short time its all full of a page it 's page for the record ok I am asked questions just in relation to the freezing works that 's currently and I understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the river and when the flooding events can we just have a we report on that it may not be anything to do with the council but just understanding how that is and how long they 're allowed to do that not today no sleep for us yes yes am i working on poor method that these stone committee meeting last night and when the amount is too big to for the pipe to cover to Costa pages road the pump is switched off so they put it into a holding pond for up to three days it is partially treated but it is still contaminated and it goes into the river doesn 't seem to be any solution to it apart the only solution is that they cease operation for that time which they 're not in time to do but let 's let 's get a report on it there is there are plans to put a new pump and I think Jane is it happening now that pages road which should be able to cope was more hope to have that commissioned early June it it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still got us some major works on the rest of the network to actually repair and renew and it 's while we 're in this stage is the problems is there I felt um thanks Jane on the seventh Street chops yes and the shops already up as you comment and comments from locals are that they 're police with the design of those is on page 13 and I was don 't ask though in relation to Christian relation to plans for the development on the other side of cell and Street be in it which is part of the master plan I 'm just hope they seem to have been delayed I 'm just hoping that in fact counselor doing what we can to support that development through consents oh thank you and Jimmy patient ed a four-point-oh one buster item regarding to the new South waste service in the library to replace the second service center last under based on the Acting CEO reporter have been defined you know the time period will be presented to the commune upon the council in May but this time that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I don 't know why what 's the rationale you know q is the acting CEO report has been decided a wider postponed what was the reason again I 'll follow up yeah on page five same page I 'm even River precinct I see that the detailed design will be complete by May so when can we get a copy of the completed design and how can we have input into it and what is it doing to address the flooding issues that we 've had recently meeting later today on the open River and monthly the first time I will get some better information so we 'll come back to one side I 've been development it 's just that further on in the agenda we 're making decisions about that Ivan River precinct about transport projects without having any plans for that what the avon river concept is yeah i think i 've shared concept plans with you but they 're into the details man no no that they I 've been told they 're out of date the ones that we got that were confidential and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give us information back about the flooding I mean it just it concerns me that with that 's possibly spending a hundred million dollars on something that 's going to get flooded so you know I think you 've heard some of the people talking in the last few days about spending money from the anchor projects into other ears that are getting flooded then you do have to start questioning the open for oppressing the second question was the high street spatial plan is there a special plan for high street when can we have a copy my understanding is that there 's been a whole bunch of work done around around that area but we don 't we don 't have any visibility and I again I am concerned in the traffic section of this report today that we don 't have any understanding of how the traffic is going to work in that south south area south of Colombo stroke sorry south of the square south of Litchfield with high street Jorm luttrell so NASA so is there any thing that we have as a council that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is being proposed I don 't see any saying all yes a good staff so I 'll fall off and find out with dr. Tim the traffic plan is actually contained within the accessible City Transport chapter so the overall plan for the road and the various transport networks are in that we will give staff here for their for their item on the agenda so if you know I 'm at the appropriate staff will be here that could perhaps you know bring that information was like I mean you know I understand that we 're not going to get a say in that and you know it 's probably just a little piece of land that will go into private ownership but you know I think one of the trade-offs we would like to see is that there are public laneways going through these areas as a result of the public roads that have been given to government but I don 't have any sense of we are those lanes are what we 're getting back so you know I just want to raise that caution happy for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think there should be an expectation that we 're getting something back at the end that goes back into the public realm then in the southern frame and which is quite a radical departure from what was originally suggested when you say project completion I know this is not the council 's one project completion jus at third quarter 2017 is that for the little bit of public realm that they 're now providing yes thank you must be so just for that bit it 's going to take another three years I 'm pretty sure that 's right long time for top off yep can we come to the flooding that now then task force now,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

1,YJe4uJVRnNM,20140430,391.65,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1010,thank you very much and again apologies for not getting this out till last night and perhaps not giving you enough time to get the questions to me ahead of time however but can I leave the flooding task force update until I just highlight another couple of things in the report with two things that in fact there 's three things I would like to highlight but but perhaps just moving quickly through struthers lean is for your information and you 'll recall that we had a small group to keep things moving and this is an example of how we apply that just to fast-track a simple thing and look old things up 1.3 the majestic theatre update I think you 're all aware of where we got to with that that just summarizes it all in one place I would like to draw your attention to 1.4 in particular there 's a recommendation there and I just need to emphasize that when exit accepting a recommendation like this without a comprehensive report you need to or we should minute that you are happy with the information you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that sitting there for at the moment and in fact the next one would you like to do with it now yes maybe I 'll move the recommendation that council ratifies the decision of the acting chief executive to extend the due date for rating sort of objections to rating rating valuations by 10 working days is which takes it to the 12th of May 2014 do I have a seconder for that motion Paul lonsdale Yanni thank you um I 'm really concerned at however evaluations we 're done in regards to the red zone properties can we get I 'm also concerned that we had anything on can I I 'm going to deal with the resolution that we 've moved and seconded which is about the extinction of the due date for objections can we can we just first have questions dealing with that matter okay and then we can debate that matter yeah and then if you want to deal with other matters arising from the report then we can deal with that the my understanding is the reason for the request for the extension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our revaluations were done in the red zone is that correct correct that 's what our report says that 's why I wanted to ask about that because I 'm happy to grab the extinction I do wonder whether it 's long enough given that as a counselor i would like to also get information back in response to the human rights commission 's point of view and also understand more why the revaluations were done the way they were in the red zone so I just I question whether in extensions is actually solving the issue that 's at hand and whether there 's any additional resolutions that we could part to actually get more satisfaction so that 's I 'd you know before voting on this I just wanted to ask those questions so do you think that the the length of time for the extension is long enough I do think it is I took it was on legal advice that this period of time was suggested and in relation to your questions about understanding the re-evaluations I recall we did send you some information so i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still require some more we can talk about that no I think I think I think yannis raising the question about how the how the rating valuations we 've done for residential red zone but i 'm not sure that everyone 's got a copy of the Human Rights Commission later right no we don 't I will circulate that the outstanding issue as well is that we had the human rights when she can 't talk to us we did ask I think for a report back on the debt report what has recommendations to council about how we should do things on the rating valuations on a whole bunch of issues from the Human Rights Commission I only want to deal with the rating evaluations right now because I want to deal with this motion okay so are there any questions on the motion or any comments on the motion but can we just get clarified when we had the briefing on the rating revaluations we were told that one of the reasons in the red zone was that they couldn 't be issued with building consents though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not trying to be unhelpful but what particular briefing are you talking about we got briefed on the revaluation process and on how things were done and what was you know what was taken into account but what I 'm really asking is do we as a council need to change or give clear direction to our valuers over how to revalue stuff in the red zone we 're not we 're not able to do that which is why we are extending the time so that people are enabled to lodge their objections and so what can we do if we have concerns about their process if anything we will have to deal with that as a separate matter okay but we haven 't formed a position we haven 't formed a position on the rating valuation and the residential red zone but i do think if we get that information recirculated then we can and certainly come back onto the agenda i 'm absolutely confident of that yeah are there any other questions or comments that people would like to make I 'll put the motion all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's carried like you can carry on with your report,"(-43.5320214,

Martin 's to lyttelton harbour because there is a difference in height above sea level of about five meters which would allow our downward flow and I 'm not sure that the militant people would be happy with it some interesting idea finally there can be no delay this is that because time is of the essence thank you very much there any comments you 've got your bullet thank you any questions I 'm council of clear water thank you and your point about flood proofing house by high foundations I understand it 's random but he 'd get some houses had been right there live would have divorce had been raised some years ago do you want to comment on how they feed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've had in 150 years I i 'ma build up my name is Roger Kershaw and I did an extension on the house five years ago in waimea tears and we raised that extension at the back and the match to first event at the peace at the back was fine additionally back the old house was was lower and that had six inches of water through through their house in the lower section and new section fine that 's further back session but and which level did you raise it to we we raised it was 300 mils from the existing and house foundation floor little of the objects on top of the 400 pre-board yes yep no yeah the cost of doing that interestingly enough about 15 years ago was you had a ten thousand dollars at that time allowable and the owner only had to pay 1000 so it was a temper sent to positive you like on amazing thickness they had the house the holidays the house that we did five years ago they these people because our flooded day went through the process of raising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house and the price of that was 160 thousand dollars uni so like she said to me last night that really wouldn 't justify spending that much for the cost the house oh god I was gosh Nick yeah yeah I said it like she is silly what do you think nice of all probably 60,000 she set out had another hundred talk it 's probably the cost of the big piles who knows oh I see so it was additional piling as well what probably wouldn 't know it 's not teasing no but it cuz that would have been prior to the to the land I mean people would have tested land in their area anyway yeah it 's interesting i 'm gonna bear might be worthwhile having like a bit now right if i may say Roger had his area his section surveyed just recently and apparently he said literal his sections got 150 150 mm well with began when like it 's 150 ml several late reply brief like no the council-owned 150 mills less so the guys that came around they said what 's happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river yeah yeah second time we 've got smaller and we haven 't got bigger but we 've got this river yeah yep yep no I totally get there r if you hit a question so can you just explain the upstream housing development and the impact on obviously the down stream flows mean what are we doing wrong in terms of those developments that is causing an impact down strivin being I haven 't put head feet on the ground there have you know I don 't that was one of the questions wonder asters I mean I was brought up in causal and and when the opens development was first at and we never had any and we had a big drain across our open drain and that 's now being closed down and and I don 't understand how these swales work and that was one of my questions today already and there 's a lot of houses I mean Aidan 's field now blue skies halls on the park and norms of state now they all flow and somewhere along the line to the his cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other side of Junction Road my understanding is that the storm water there goes into the halls will river which goes into Lake girls Mia as the storm water contained in these whales and then as are they floodgate it so that therefore the water stays in there and then when the heath cup drops the water is released and or does it just flow and then the event does the water just flow into these flowers and then straight away into the haircut river I don 't quite understand it but there 's a lot of what I think anyone is technically able to ask a question here but but we made it will be part of the report that we 're getting from the task force so and there 's no exacerbate equal I the subsoil as you know or you might know will and some of these areas got a lot of clay underneath I mean it 's not Rolleston so where does the water drain gee that 's what I wanna know especially at the super saturated State yeah no it 's good um Yanni I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the task was it something I have specifically asked that we review our subdivision consenting to ensure that not just what they 've put under H in some cases have a actually put in what they said they were going to put them so we 'll get to the bottom of that um I just want to ask you though about post-earthquake what the differences are post-earthquake versus before the earthquake how much of the recent flooding would you attribute to the earthquake and the fix of the earthquake versus what used to happen before yeah well of course the spin to love rain event and recently but the last time it flooded was I think it was 15 months ago and it 's used to flood are you talking about previously yeah I didn 't interest an understanding yeah yeah for the earthquake what was it like and what 's it been like in a recent either flooded more than just in our case just over the road just burst its banks are slightly and it 's just to cure approximately every three or four years but I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I don 't want to get emotional but one minute you see that the river in spanks the next about it now ladies up level in about an hour and a half later your house is surrounded by yes the speeder that imagine all this runoff you know it was a small River once upon a time and they 're trying to overload it all this with us run off it 's not necessarily coming off the hills some of it I think the first question at the beginning where he prefaced it by saying you know the wettest month on record since they began in 1864 okay he 's contributed because i think that the lens been saturated it hasn 't had time to recover before we 've had another deluge and I you know that has certainly contributed to the problem but it you know where I guess that what we saw and those areas on Susan E you know on the big day the sex of March but but then subsequently on Good Friday and end on monday this week you know it was just it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the driver behind that don 't just say there 's an overlay on this it 's called pollution yeah I 've you 've got a house hey that 's got water inside with sewage yeah and or a garden with sewage and he 's trying to grow things yeah not a good look and I 've been in the area only nine years so I 'm airlifted to think that we 're talking about to become a boat company and the people I did the operation for that been in there 12 and to ask your question there was that they used to flood say once every four years and that would be you know it might come through the gate and it might be 275 miles of water hundred miles away not not to the extent that we 're getting now yeah and the other thing is the water would go down very quickly not the reason we didn 't get a problem I think it was cyclone I eater or something no that was the one that had nothing on that yeah I sorry this last one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have it was low tide everyone looks at the low-tide shot yeah if there have been high tide I it would have been that much higher well our house is a 70 meters from the rubber so we 're up a backpack dry and and we and the first event we had water to the underside our floor which is about six hundred mils now the problem is that comes up a long drive the next long drive away long from us upstream and then flows round our place and then down our drive so it 's a like I said to Graham they are the day the the water that the river channel cannot take the volume of water that that 's coming down that river at the moment yeah and it it 's like and the early part of the 19th century when the wimax used to burst its banks is the water from the headwaters what they do they put increase to stop being site so we either got to go deeper with the channel or increase the fight of it thank you both very much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has got quite a you know significant report and who report about the task force so we will get to that when we get to get but thank you very much hopefully coming to the next meeting on May the theft in the beckenham service center which is going to relate to short medium long term all right we 're gonna mention that Phil yep yes and so am council staff of kindly agreed to go to the next spray-tanned here security board and there 'll be a special presentation on flooding around the mid Heathcott and so these issues will be discussed and and the staff will have will put out some solutions to ensure excellent so think thank you very much don 't come they have thank you thank you could I and fight Robert right to come forward good morning everyone good morning thank you for the opportunity my reputation is on behalf of the the mower residence group and the Peterborough village committee thank you you can feel free to sit down if you 'd like no definitely no no bits and also absolutely fine father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the suggestion of cash flow jana johansson it follows on from a deputation made to the lady ferry meet community boards some weeks ago in which we argued the case for doing what the council wants to achieve with richard regional structure of sorcery street as opposed to what the organization skirt was to achieve with the reconstruction as a as it announced to local results the record reconciling the two organizations responsibilities is what i hope to try to achieve and what I 'm hoping the council will achieve because I think there are bigger issues at stake so rather than talk about self-interest of the neighborhood I thought I 'd try and put the arguments in the context of the local government actually council responsibility to satisfy for for well being environmental social cultural and economic soul 's retreat is whether the number streets no neighborhood that a barrage of boundary asphalt told these feet and gilman street were designed as one way streets to get vehicles from A to B as quickly as possible with no thought to the surrounding land use that was pre nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housing the consequent loss of private grief space and the desire for some can 't compensator increase space within the street environment the provision of brief space in the road reserve has number environmental values I suggest some of these would be the the need to attenuate flows integral rivers and streams by reducing the amount of runoff other person run off with epson ashphalt introduced free space you reduce everyone off and you can also improve water quality at the same time there 's a desire for green space by people of Los Feliz placing their private fuffley because of high-density development there 's the ecological value of providing a habitat for birds and insects another for there 's the cultural aspect clusters prices have of being a guard the city and the council has done tremendous work in that regard in the past do you know a graceful revenue that runs off salisbury street and connects into karen street but that 's still got the original street design there we ever a raisin carriageway going into a grasper when they need to deep concrete just channels within a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grass that have to had the capacity to detain water filter out contaminants and provide climatic benefits for the presence of trees well then there 's much later on there was the decision to make chester extreme east and west into residential streets of identity and the council did a wonderful job of rita straight on those streets with worms and trees and then in fact they had the effects of stimulating redevelopment because people found it so attractive and desirable place to live so then that that 's the cultural respect the social aspect is that for everybody the straight environment is the most immediate opens public open space where a variety of things can happen not just getting people for way to be the economic aspect is there to a lot of those values are just mentioned Kobe have a dollar value attached to them as well so it 's quite possible to safe to group of people here are our options the utility option brief space option and this is the cost of each these are the benefits of a shin these are the dollar values of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the work that the Scared does probably doesn 't matter that much to them which set of plans they use whether it 's a like-for-like reconstruction set of plans adjusted from the previous plans to suit new levels new ground levels or whether it 's a green street design which incorporates more green space unless as phone so that I want to think that the tiffies crush we drew their grave and I 've every confidence in council staff of the delivered delivering those designs delivering the cost-benefit analysis and metal the counselors decide place on their responsibilities I think I 've covered everything I intended to cover so I 'm open to questions now thank you very much yani would you like to start off with the questions I think thank you all for making the deputation um I think of it used to if you just tell counts as what the response was from skirt when you raised around that what was happening in sales Bruce tree going back like-for-like all right and probably just a little bit of context around some other local planning you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some of the local residents have done around the opportunity for a different you know different way of living in the central city all right when other relatively new member of the committee 's so unfortunately people learn more about that kind of thing void available with such short notice but regarding skirts skirts no capacity for exercising discretion or initiating a different design approach they believed they had a job to replace life alike based on the insurance liability for reconstruction so I think it 's something needs to trigger that the ability of scary respond to a different plan or different design there is a I 'm quite amazed that the closeness of the particular Peterborough village committee I labeled rather although they do have wonderful turnout for meetings and they have guest speakers to talk about our architects and landscape architects and people who really know how to make a difference to the character of a neighborhood and we 've the committee has gone to a lot of trouble to engender boats and excite interior of the possibilities that lie before us with the rebuild I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so the people have contacted skirt directly as a result of the spirit response they came to the community board and now in our agenda later on we 've got revised transport projects which is about deferring the public realm work and kill more straight so in sales retreat is also mentioned so you know I think it just to give some context to that deputation but I thought it was important for you to get directly from the local resident it 's very good okay well look thank you very much mr. white for coming to the council it 's very much appreciated and obviously that will assist us when we get to a later item on the agenda so very much appreciated thank you thank you right so","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

't I haven 't got 16 money normally I 've just filtered them through and to my in order but I hadn 't so i do apologize so I can read active products retail locations policy consultation documents then there 's the recommendation there would someone like to move the recommendation Andrew tuna seconded by Phil Clearwater any questions Yanni and then Paul wanted to check with staff I I see the met at the back and I 'm a little bit concerned about the next year sign because of suggestion to residential so if we I just wanted to check or signal the idea of an amendment that basically we remove the mixed-use Central City zones and just wanted to check the implications of doing that for staff I think the potential implication would be the restriction the risk of restricting the retail outlets to just the core central city core area in the issue here is associated with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not a lot of retail opportunity or really currently within those within those areas so we were looking for a reasonable option that the retailer 's space too though perhaps I moved in them in they then that deleted the Mexia central city cooler except for the area bounded between Shawn to Morehouse and Manchester to Montreal would that seem to be quite I could compromise can we do that I mean I 'm going up we already had a debate around the around the detail of the content of the policy I don 't know that we can do this just prior to notification of I 'm asking a procedural question of staff is it possible to amend the consultation document if it doesn 't reflect the decision that was made by the counselor yeah yeah you caught right the sustained of debate was had had a previous council meeting and need and you just you may be made a decision on what you wanted this was really being back the right consultation documents to enable that decision so yeah you 've pretty much already had this debate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice on that because I like the only suggestion I 'm well aware that there are builders we want to build in their area who are now feeling that they can 't because it 's going to have a concentration of legal high shots we 're going to get us Peter much shorter come out ok we have a legal view on I know it might be a pain in the neck but I 'm not really worried they may be another way around this here then we just restricted within a certain distance from any question that we 're asking is whether or not we can amend that the consultation document at this point and the process that 's the question when counselor Henson first raised it just now I looked at the recommendation to this somebody Saints the council please adopt this for public consultation and so I thought well why not because at the end of the day this is the final step before it goes out and you should be able to do that however given the information suspend football is to buy water about previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effectively it seems we are looking to am in a previous council resolution without having gone through the procedural requirements which you will be quite familiar with and I think that is the the arts of so from my point of view at this time on the information I have is no you cannot amend at the lakehouse your hands and wishes the option you have is either go out what 's here 's a day or you defer this or a another council meeting or potentially you could say well it 's defer it to the earthquake committee meeting next week give the earthquake committee the authority to approve whatever recommendation comes before next week and then we wrap around that words that allow our counselor Henson 's suggestion to be voted on by the council I 'm just there is a degree of reluctance because I know that it was quite a close decision around the central city and councillor goth isn 't here at the moment and so and I know that he was a very strong advocate for not allowing for not allowing a broader scope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of submissions on the document the question is do we get the document out there in this current form and just allow the process to to amend it or do we bring it back and potentially open up the scope for another debate around it I know that a number of people have certainly mentioned to me since we made the original decision that the the lanes which are a requirement under the city plan creating significant risk around safety and the CBD by locating all of these in the CBD they earn a lot of money they can afford to pay to be in those lanes so I just say that if we start to open this up again there may be people who change their position that they had on the previous resolutions so the question is do we put this out now and let the submission process direct you know an opportunity for council later on to to revisit some of the aspects of it or do we allow the thing to be opened up again and if we allow it to be opened up again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not related to or the next council meeting so those are the days of the issues and Paul well I was very opposed to just being located the center city I know they came in a victim of it being like Atlas FC as a problem we 're also trying to rebuild a city with 30,000 residents in a city with 30,000 reasons and also try and rebuild a city center and concentrating those we heard that from one particular owner one of these sores 300 customers a day your times there by eight your 4,200 of these addicted people come into the central city it 's going to be a massive problem I want to see it keep well away and I 'd like to amend another amendment to actually keep it away from households so anywhere with a residential house I think it should become a sensitive site as well so so this is so this is what we were up against we 're either going to revisit the content of the document or we 're going to release it for public discussion and then we 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I kind of don 't want to have a major debate about it but Glen David though thank you if I could ask Peter in terms of process how different is this from say the annual plan which actually we amended a few weeks ago over the other grants and so what people received and it looks to some people at moment is it no there 's been a those grants of not there but they 're coming out by another funding Avenue so going out for consultation this is a legal process for a plan under legislation that so it 's it 's a plan under legislation ATS under the psycho active selective substances but we amended the annual plan craft when we is that the annual clan is our plan this is a plan that we do under the under a piece of legislation winds making note is that it 's very normal for us as a council to make a decision and then have staff make the necessary amendments to give effect to that decision so so there 's actually no reason except it we 've already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is are we going to reopen the document that we are going to send out for consultation or are we going to send the existing document out for consultation David and then Phil thank you look I was one of the was that was against centralizing into the central city we 'll look I think we 've we 've made made a decision last time and this document really is just bringing it back to to restructure the the document really in line with what we decided last week I 'm actually quite and favor narrow of putting the document out for public consultation I 'm sure there will be a large number of deputations submissions I should say to this this policy and look we 've got another chance to come back at it later on so we could waste a lot of time just making amendments here there and then delaying the process I 'm very much in favor of putting this out for consultation letting the letting the probably have their say and we can come back and I mean which you agreed yeah so the I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central city max do science and central city core and district centres and that the pros that proposed mended policy be adopted for consultation so um look I was actually looked hoping today that we might be or even tighten up on the on the number of outlets but I met you I think it 's important just to get this out other we can 't we don 't have time to relitigate the whole thing and so I 'm I 'm okay with the decision we made when we previously decided on these recommendations so that they are the the the actual yet so that so either either wait you so I 'm going to put the resolution that we go out to consultation I 'm not going to accept an amendment to the to the I 'm not going to accept an amendment to the to this to the statement that goes out for consultation but i will accept an amendment that says that we will defer that a certain and and revisit elements of it at and i think it would it has to be the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is quite recovery meeting because and then we can prepare a report that has their own properly that has it properly and the and the format that it needs to be unto change the decision that 's been made is that acceptable Oh mind standing of that then is that the council does not resolve today that to commence the special consult procedure effectively defers this report to the next council meeting then the paperwork is done to effectively reopen the debate for the next council meeting and then from there a decision is made to commits the special consultant receipt yeah but not everyone agrees with that position it 's an amendment just actually know that that we defer the paper to the next council meeting a Bligh on the table to the next council media and that start produce a report which enables what I 'll call that the debate to be opened up again and then at that meeting a decision is made yes all right so who would like to move there who wants to move there amendment Paul second goodbye I stood and hearing from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm torn behind the need to get something out there so people can make submissions versus delaying this for another month which effectively this will do which seems to me kind of crazy really we need to get something out there so people to make submissions well that 's my view but I 've got I 've got the impression I 've we 've already had advice that we can 't legally change the document now yep I wanted to ask on a different issue I 'm actually I actually agree with yanni that it shouldn 't include the residential areas but I 'm happy that we have that debate after the submissions not at this stage so that we actually get something out there but in relation to a different issue which wasn 't previously debated and in the sense of sites and we stipulate that what are sensitive site is and indeed we stipulate the means by which those have been notified but for example if we know of but not through those means a preschool or a school or a health facility that is going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means to that part in on page 3 D which talks about future sensitive sites oh I think it creates a whole load of problems for us because what will happen is is when an application for all of these shots comes comes in will then get asked by the Ministry of Health are you are you aware of any tentative sites by other means again try and trying to establish that across the whole council you know all the council stuff whether whether somebody in the council knows of something by another means is going to be very very hard to achieve it with any this is exactly the same issue we can 't amend the wording of the document that 's going no the last council meeting request was made as whether whether we could add something to the policy to deal with sensitive sites that we were aware of but weren 't in well we 're coming but we 're not actually in place one but what I 'm aware of is that for example there are schools yet to be located in the central city there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they probably won 't have a resource consent filed by the end of the year so they 're likely to be affected then by a legal high shot very nearby not okay so what I just want us to be able to do is have a less formal process of notifying the council about these future additions but what I 'm saying is I think that it requires some formality I don 't think I informal someone someone 's told somebody in the council that there 's going to be a school in such and such a sight it 's just not going to work Ministry of Education announcement for example of two new schools coming back into town seems to me a reasonably definite commitment to those two schools coming into town again with with site-specific know that 's the democracies well it 's going to be sighs mrs. so that means we 're going to restrict it to the center of the town but they can 't build anywhere because there might be a school somewhere this the other the Adil sorry I probably it might not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the next 12 months was it would mean that there a resource consent or building and seen or quite a recovery pain yes in depth over here alright so as any what does anyone want to defer this to the next meeting because if not then the amendment fails for want of a seconder in which case i 'll move to the to the to the resolution itself does anyone want to debate that Andrew yeah I mean I look at this as a matter of process we 've already had the debate we already made the decision there was quite a bit of discussion in the the very full and frank debate that we had about restriction to the central city core and we asked some questions at that time and were advised that that that wasn 't advisable we then looked at the result which we looked at the debate which resulted in the map that we 've got in this document here today I mean with I 'm actually in favor of what counselor Johansson is suggesting but the right time for that to have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm in many ways in favor of what counselor lonsdale suggesting but the right time to have suggested that would have been in that debate my understanding of what we 're doing today is is simply completing the process which was started in which was the result of that debate which is the council has taken a position on what it wants to go out to to consult on it 's taken a position on draft policy all we 're doing today is approving and it 's approving the result of a decision that we 've already made so whilst there are some views today which have been expressed that I actually agree with the need to just get on with what we said we were going to do in my view is paramount and that 's the reason I didn 't support the amendment and the that I 'm happy to to support this people generally happy that we leave it to the council secretary to establish the hearings panel which she has some delegate authority to do that in consultation with counselors all right yeah all right who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can they please ensure the there for the whole time that you 're into panel runs yeah cuz on this particular better that will be absolutely critical they must be there must have commit to the time yeah all right so it can we tidy up that part of the motion to do that i 'll put the resolution all those in favor say aye those opposed say no cancel a lonsdale record opposition to that that 's carried thank you","(-43.5320214,

Part 4,ZH5hQol7z5k,20140424,795.74,"Christchurch, New Zealand",2045,ki I 'm sorry Pauline thank you this is a very difficult one the concern to us with our crisis we are we going to put the 32 people from cary street from the 20 people from kohls while their construction is underway i would like to flag that should the council vote against Rome development that we could get some sort of urgency around that site to be mitigated that the number of people that are complaining about the ice all of it is and I is your not being really keen to at least have it cleared which apparently we can 't do until we get the global settlement settle so I would plague that the other thing I 'd like to pick up on us Ellie 's suggestion that Brom could actually be tackled in a staged men so they may be parts of that site that we could begin to develop without having to go back to all the owners there might be some part of it that actually we can work with I 'm with Flynn I 'll go with the will of the council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then probably carry after that because once against about numbers it 's about agency of housing here I am concerned about the additional time for brown because it 's new information that we 've gained from this meeting the additional nine months is a concern for another forty seven units so I 've just flagging that that if bro fails here could we please have some some mechanism to a team to the Excite thank you yep i 'm paul de this was heavily debated at the meeting the issues around bra and I respect the fact that we do need to do something with that side we can put a lot of house only with us too complicated and we know it 's nine months just for the additional work not forgetting it is issues around ownership the public grew accept and it could take longer than nine months the Kerry and the coals are both old cold houses that need tipping over right now and so the people living there aren 't moving in good conditions I 'm going to be supporting the cary street i think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we can get underway quickly and we are under obligation to get something signed off today and I think Kerry for me is the next best opportunity for this council notwithstanding that we do need to start working on brother but we need I think this thing 's a lot more work needs we 've done there at this point so I want to see an exemplar up and running that has the maximum use of the land and I think Kerry street actually offers that and Phil um look this debate it 's very important for us to understand that building social housing is far more obviously about than one just numbers it 's about a quality of housing it 's an endless an exemplar gives us great opportunity to develop some new types of housing and then I think Carey Street fits that bill we as a council certainly want to avoid anything like utilization and if we concentrate a lot more social housing in one area there is still some risk event and that that 's something which we entirely want to avoid work with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our exemplar project projects on beside a motorway with all the noise pollution and air pollution that comes from me that is hardly the place that we as a council want to have our exemplar probe project for our social housing where people are already vulnerable with their older or younger people with disabilities so and I think the costs of developing the brand village goes into at this stage goes entirely against that as a site and so I 'm strongly supporting Carey Street as the the the second exemplar project and yanni something to begin this debate you need to understand what the purpose of an exemplar project is or isn 't what it doesn 't do is you special planning permission in fact what does there is the enhanced Development Mechanism there 's no reason why Kerry straight can actually be developed now it doesn 't have to be an exemplar and there 's no reason why you couldn 't go and just get on and do it if you thought it needed to be done so I would welcome that that 's not a problem but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing beneficial by being an exemplar project the exemplar as i think is a kind of confusing word everything or a kind of misleading term everything we do is a council in terms of housing redevelopment should be done to a modern sustainable environmentally friendly accessible affordable and safe manner it just goes without saying so we should be and we have in the past if you think of order a village and stand more just off thermal road that that was a really good development with you know stunning use of environmentally sustainable design concepts so there 's no reason why we should be having this big debate about saying these projects are owned and these ones are out I do think part of the issue comes down to how is this funded I think that is actually quite important the eqc global settlement will produce a amount of money that we will be able to spend on doing some of this development and so I think actually we need to start getting planning mechanisms underway for the areas of most opportunity and that would be brown village and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to signal that whatever happens and as part of the exemplar identification we 've already passed a resolution around airedale and I don 't know when that 's coming back but Brom also I think needs to have some considered planning it just seems to me that housing is critical and I know that some of our old units are not the most ideal places for people to love but they 're actually better than people sleeping in cars the better than people sleeping outdoors and tints and parks so actually for me Brown village is something that we should be turning to you as a priority I don 't think it 's in the enhance development mechanism of the land use recovery plan or they said that those boundaries and areas got changed by the government so I 'm not completely clear about you know whether it 's on or not that it would seem to me the best use of the exemplar process would be to identify sites that are not in that planning mechanism so that we can give them some special attention and if need be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sends a signal to the minister that if need be if necessary to help get these projects happen we ask them to use some special powers under the you know amazing Sarah act to enable things to happen so to me there 's a real advantage to having brom in that consideration giving all given all the all the constraints the final point i 'll make about frog is actually there has been a huge amount of work done around tc3 land every time we had a briefing was Sarah before the election with the elected members we were constantly being told housing New Zealand mb are working on these amazing technologies for TC three foundations that mean they don 't cost a lot more that they can be delivered in a quick time frame so i imagine as a whole bunch of work that has already been done in terms of some of the design solutions that we might use in TC three lab and I think the tv3 argument and the land argument was we heard another one of these sites that 's being proposed is TC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways around dealing with the complexities to Braun as of or even pointed out staging the development and and working through it on a on a logical sensible way but it certainly needs some attention I think it provides us with the most opportunity and I 'm very supportive of us doing it recognizing that it will be a different models of the social housing we 've provided before and just reflect on the previous example we 've agreed to today meadowlands and look at the diversity on the topology of the housing that 's suggested in that development look at the community is that are suggested look at the way in which that integrates them to building a community rather than just putting housing for the sake of housing and that 's the opportunity I think prom has and that 's why it needs to be included as an exemplar so in order to deal with us who are the movers and seconders of this Livingston and cotter do you have in a greed position on which one that you want as the exemplar which is that 's bro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the that we determine the preferred second candidate for exemplar as no go back to their and the Committee recommends that the council determine so take that out put that the council determine so leave that the council the preferred second candidate I know just the second candidate so take out the word preferred frogs in class status as Brian village right just delete the other words yeah madam chair yep just if in terms of the preferred is quite important that 's lifting because council has two decisions to make on these okay and there 's a second decision to make which will come to Cal next week okay okay determine the preferred second candidate for example statuses Brian village well can you put a comma after exemplar status and put well in fact do you need that do you need that first line the first sentence of that para no right right now and somebody who would like to move the amendment of the other Street as a carry place cary street you 'll move that so full and second it by eddie jones that Brom village be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copy the 1.6 and replace brown village with the words cary street now does anyone want to move the other street is it an amendment no good okay right so the first amendment is that the council determine the preferred second candidate for exempt class status as cary street all those in favor of the amendment say aye those opposed say no that is lost but i think i 'd rather have a show of hands that people quite comfortable with that so those that are in favor of the amendment if you could raise your hands those who are opposed to the amendment it 's a tie so okay so it doesn 't get carried it doesn 't go forward but I think that you 're getting a clear signal that is already included in the comprehensive development it 's in the development mechanism enhanced Development Mechanism area as a carry street it is through the lid you see it sits within the extent of the enhanced Development Mechanism uncle I think you 're getting a very clear signal from Council get on with it ok so now I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidate for exempt player status and the rest of the motion I 'll put that all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and Phil Clearwater would like to record opposition to that thank you very much so now with,"(-43.5320214,

Part 3,A-8PJWO1FDU,20140424,1683.57,"Christchurch, New Zealand",4351,"housing council housing exempt players move by Glenn Livingston second up by Paul Cotter I 'll open that up for questions Phil Clearwater well mine is really just to check with staff my assessment because key the committee didn 't come to a clear decision around the exemplar and it 's basically although we had the committee had decided on androids prison so it 's really just to clarify that my understanding is that if for example there are some considerable disadvantages with brown village there doesn 't mean we couldn 't look at it as to help could be become some new accommodation and mixed housing development for the future and maybe the council can can ask for them but it 's to clarify really that I 'm on bronze brown street or the motorway as it 's known there are indeed five of our city housing complex is all along that road it 's just read here that confirmed and so I 'll make some comments about why in fact and there 's reference in the report to her maybe you look might like to speak with us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not being overloaded with social housing for their own communities Carolyn so thank you so part of the exemplars and that 's why Richard Osbourne as here alongside me today the under the land use recovery plan we as council have an opportunity to show really good design new ways of doing things and particularly with social housing so we have to agree on two sites as exemplars under the loop so this is the reason for this paper here now in terms of consideration of the exemplars once I tendras crescent which as you 've identified in the sprayed and his cat Ward has already been approved by council as an exemplar or has been recommend as a preferred candidate I think is the correct terminology the other three sites that we bring to you today brolin village which of course is a really large site and the sprain and his cut we 've got Carey Street kohl 's place and I suppose from a staff perspective when we considered which of these three sites could be assist as an exemplar we were looking to have a disbursement across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sure from a loop perspective could inform us about the potential for identifying others other sites as exemplars in future years for social housing so I think that was a long conversation that we had at the housing committee was after we have identified two sites would there be an opportunity to identify other sites down the track four of us Pauline thank you is we did we did discuss this extremely robustly for quite a long time we do have a housing crisis we 've got a huge shortage we 've got the brown village which is the site which is huge at 16,000 744 square metres currently out of 89 units there are only three occupied with a potential to build up to 136 new ones on there as opposed to carry which has 32 units on it all occupied the potential to build between 30 and 40 that 's an increase of up to watch a teen and coles place which has 20 on the all occupied for the potential to build 23 to 27 so an increase of a maximum of seven so and i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unit could be a quite a bit of foundation cost there but I think Brian is an opportunity to to lead the way with design lead intensification there whether we build social or next you see I think that once we get the entity set up there could be an option to do that rather than just social housing you so I 'm just explaining those numbers because it does suck show relevance I 'm listening to phil as well because you 're concerned about the intensity of social housing but this has already been an existing social housing site it 's not like we 're creating additional social housing and reward dear so but I understand where you 're coming from nearby do think we have to concentrate on the fact that this is not going to be built the way we used to build sons these are going to be efficient warm interesting designing I think the location of Rome is quite a good location and then it 's really close to politic to bus routes to signum the beckenham to the parks so those the advantages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I do hit an open mind especially can I ask a question if we be good are we being required to choose one of these sites today because I wasn 't yep ok so but if we chose one of the other sides as the exemplar project would that stop us looking at Brom for example as an alternative design lead alternative for some other you know based on other other criteria the only thing that worries me about that site is the entrance of brown street doesn 't exist you know see it 's state highway 73 and it has enormous challenges for that reason but but I mean I just I I totally hear what what Pauline saying about you know why would you disrupt a site that 's got all of these people were really living there in order to develop an exemplar project rather then choose a site that 's already almost completely empty and and end do it there but I mean oh I mean I understand that the time frame is simply because of the land use recovery plan and our obligations under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know allowed to slip on on either side for and I just wondered whether it had to be such a you know complete decision one way or the other today but you 're saying yes it does so no le was first yeah if I had known and if we knew a bit more about Brian street i think that the arguments that Pauline makes would probably hold water a bit more as far as the entrance goes I don 't know whether that can be addressed on from another part of the site potentially because that 's clearly an issue as well the biggest issue and this is where the discussion was so splutters that I mean there are clearly economies of scale as far as savings and efficiencies with budget that can be achieved through building so many houses on the one side like Ron however the poor ground conditions and it 's not just that it 's tc3 there 's some perfectly fine land in TC three it has gone beyond that and identified this land is hugely problematic so the fact that the grounds poor which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we don 't know what those costs are you could be up for anything from five bucks to five million you don 't know so without that information I couldn 't support the bronze site I also wondered to whether options around Brom and its size hadn 't been explored further such as could it be done in a staged way could it be done on land that 's better than other land on brawn so again I felt that there wasn 't enough information around this for us to be able to make a decision and I 'd supported the development of fun carry as an exemplar um yani and then Glenn then Paul oh thank you yet we 're being left again so we 've got time frames in place that we have to meet we don 't have a choice all right just a quiet point of order on this mirror if I may I 'm not clear whether we 're in question time or debate we seem to be going over either I 'm ready today to debate but i 'm not sure why we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right given that we can 't say it 's a question of staff given that we can 't change the time frames in blue because it 's a stitch or document and grade what other process can we identify if we wanted to choose to exemplar projects today but to look at Bryan village and air delcourt which is another one we were asked previously for information to come back around doing some planning around the future use of those sites is there another mechanism we can use through the land use recovery plan like the Community Housing Development Mechanism or whatever those terms are that would enable us to do some strategic planning around the future of braham and possibly Edo through you madam GM so action eight of the loop definitely requires us to nominate two exemplars yeah but basically the loop is up for review in March 2015 so I think of today we counsel nominates that the two which go forward at the moment but if council feels that there 's other ones that should be included into the future that 's something we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the potential for more exemplars been added to the list at a later date alternatively i would imagine council could go through a process of its own volition to to do a design lead you know basically approach to bronze straight braham street or other developments and develop them without using the land use recovery plan but there might be other mechanisms in place that we could investigate for getting those off the ground quicker but soon to me kind of the consumers that branch that their unused unutilized for five years same same with airedale so I really want to see a process in place that gets action happening on those sites given the scale and the opportunity what what sort of resolution would you require from us to give you that clear stare I think and I don 't know if it needs to be a processor such I mean that might be what what the council wants and I think if that 's the case we would need to go back to the strategic partners and discuss that I don 't know if the minister is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the full review which is in you know 10 11 months time and when you work back from there that time frame will need to start you know towards the end of this year really so if there 's a direction of counsel that it does want to see further exemplars included with an action eight then that 's something that we could bring up with strategic partners and perhaps a steering group which council has directed us to to get together that 's the type of thing that could be discussed it that 's a level so I don 't know whether there needs to be a resolution today as part of this process but it 's certainly something that our direction could be made through the loop steering group which I 've recently asked democracy services to to set up can I ask two questions about graham street one of the what do you mean by the offer back provisions and secondly what do you mean by i mean that the ground conditions you know because i mean i think Ali 's raised a really good point about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that because it can produce the most houses but it could be the most costly houses and it actually could be the most delayed of all of the propositions for that reason yep so lately Samson project major facilities rebuild and we 've already done site investigations on brown street so i 've already opus have already done that work for us so we know there 's an issue there we know that we need to do some ground remediation or 15 metre piles so we know that there 's an additional cost of up to temper sensitive to the rebuild cost and so if the ten percent for the ground remediation that 's a premium to a typical construction costs yeah is there on top of the 50-meter piles as well and that includes that includes the the provision for for the additional engineering so what 's the lane remediation required there 's two options sorry this is this complete land remediation so they basically orders piled option but we 've actually put costs in for the for the we 've put a cost in to cover the there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in reality and cost tombs yes yep what about in terms of the building ourselves time frame certainly one of the main things about Lopez that we 're supposed to be leading the market and it 's it doesn 't for us at the moment offer a turnkey proposition because there 's ciliated three additional program implication sorry what does that mean I do sorry additional program like implications so it could add a further nine nine months sites of a i want to say I 'm sorry yeah so nine months ten percent extra and cost and and that 's whether we go piles or whether we go land remediation that 's correct yeah and the other implications is it 's still part of a the global insurance settlement process so we would be prejudiced in our current position although that there 's what I can 't you 're too because it stormed the cotton because it 's on the negotiation is part of the global settlement process but but i don 't i don 't think anyone no one disagrees that the place needs to be rebuilt or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the processor who thought their out later yep but but presumably that 's a challenge with all three sites and the issues are less onerous on the other sites because they 're past their lifespan there 's very little of insurance settlement claims it something to come to fruition and what do you mean by offer back provisions may restrict the diversity of the housing that can be provided as the land gifted the land was the it was a number of titles brought together on the Republic work so there 's a potentially onerous situation there in Tirana finding out who owned wiecej well I think the relation if we built affordable housing on there as well as social housing we 'd be obliged to find out who owned the land and offer it back to be at market value before we could proceed that 's correct i think in memory there was 30 or 40 plus titles that they 've been I mean okay so okay and so but we could if kept it all at social housing that wouldn 't that wouldn 't trigger that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was next Thank Glen you and eggs no no just a lady no I had a list of people sorry no yep four other name ahead of us I was going to go to debates on the point of view is quite correct the answers actually have been adequately answered by the various previous equations good Bucky just in terms of the financing of this under the current structure how is this is this to be financed from potential settlements because I 've looked at your accounts and then not stunning so how are you paying for say you are doing 100 houses to how are you paying for them or is it a PPP we 're still working through that what like given that you 've got very little in reserves potentially some insurance and a series of mo use that we talked about in paragraph 3.4 you 're going out for a request for proposals on whatever site which potentially may include a PPP is that over that there would be one of our options well actually isn 't it how many other options are there well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of the developments is yeah anyway and then taking it from here awright so we would have to come back to you with it so what 's the staff view around say the difference between Cole 's place and Carrie face Carey Street rather sorry and was obviously relative merits and demerits on each site I 'd say Carey Street would offer the most turnkey proposition it 's simply the easiest developed in it and with the constraints and the loop and was essentially leading the market it gives us an option to do that and Carey Street is also an enhanced development mechanism on the under lip so also gives us that opportunity to move move fast under the additional and enablers under the sea wrecked and multipath I 'm sorry and we 've talked about the issues with Brian Street and Cole 's place and is in an area of high amenity it 's got great transport links there is actually low levels of social housing in that locality so that 's a tick in the box from that perspective and probably as much as i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lane market to those both places cary street and is TC to kohls places tc3 but there 's no and it 's nothing particularly prohibitive on on that CC 319 yep further to that because that was one of the key discussions at the committee meeting as well there was an issue with land which film was talking about as well a reserve related to the development of Cole 's Harry so and I don 't know and I was it Andrews or anyway sorry I thought that that 's quite good enough but also there is a real need for two bedroom units that 's quite clear from the information that we 've had that two bids are in huge demand and so Carrie provides all we 'll provide for far more two beds than columns and also carry provides for far more units Sanders is that create I 'm just trying to encapsulate what we there is a lust that compares what they built yes oh it was an honor Carrie list yeah and so we need to get this yeah okay and this split time this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locality so the urban design team have looked at what would be an optimal mix and Carey Street offers 12 one bedrooms 24 two bedrooms four three bedrooms Cole 's place with offer 31 beds 18 two beds and for three bits in timetabling for the turnkey on carrying coals yeah well I mean what we 've got is an indication that there 's an additional nine months yeah what brawn so what what what what 's your timetable list that nine months were they this obviously subject to our processes that make up the concert of process how many more months it doesn 't matter like the in days but yet we 've said 18 months we 've programmed out a high level program for 18 months for its the Bogue that 's both curry and Kohl 's and it 's and it 's so nine months doesn 't host bit plus 9 for prom at least and it 's a bigger scale so obviously yeah Bell question but I just ask you another question about the concentration along brown street like my estimation for example of of Andrews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably only be about half a kilometer yes so in fact you 've got a 42 approximately you had a kilometer I think well maybe common yeah so you have two exemplars on the same motorway let only barely a kilometer apart in terms of your GF of distribution which you refer to you again thanks girl so I just list I haven 't got the Carrie numbers sitting in front of me so that I can put the numbers beside the cold place redevelopment which helpfully has the here 's the numbers sitting alongside them can you just run through the units so we prefer where we 're referring to unit numbers yeah that Cole 's place have got a the two-story three-bedroom 403 you got them i 'm sorry i couldn 't find that you know no but what i was trying to do was get the number of bedrooms so the number would you like total numbers for each I just wanted to compare them so that 's all so it was 18 verses 24 and Cole 's place versus Carrie that 's correcting so it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for booth this is for three bedroom so two bedroom yep three so that 's 25 verses 14 obviously bronner 's 136 but we wait another nine months and pay more yep um ok having not been involved in any of this can we just vote on this and make a decision yeah we can but but we have to have a debate on it so it 's all just had a debate no we didn 't we 've been asking questions ok so i think we 've clarified the questions everyone 's knows what the decision is that that they want to vote for so now I 'm going to ask people who want to debate it glen and then Pauline thank you one of the purposes of endorsing a site for exemplar is found in one of the criterion there which is known as diversity and I think this is something we need to take pretty seriously when we 're talking about social housing these days we 're talking about a kind of heterogeneous approach rather than a kind of homogeneous understanding which we may have of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of utilization but our development over this has grown that that we now see that whether you live in a social house as in social housing affordable rental home ownership that in terms of typology that may not necessarily be that apparent your local neighborhood what I 'm going to say about brohm the truth of the matter is we have to do something with it at some point anyway I will go with the wisdom of the council today obviously what I would say is we did hit the three way split we tried to resolve it but we couldn 't and that 's not a bad thing there are some really good compelling arguments around in terms of what I would say in terms of quantity for that part of the debate we have a growing waiting list we have homelessness in the CBD accessible exacerbated by the quakes it 's in our suburbs I know 100 and at least one sub sub do from outright without know any shelter to living in garages couch surfing etc and if the New Zealand definition of homelessness is truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually want to entertain we have a big problem given both the quality that the lack of shelter in the city and the quality sites of habitability question as well I know one house where 25 people are living in their house I mean you know is that acceptable is that the community we want we need to do something with bro him anyway development at some point will be required whichever option we go for today will be subject to consultation once we 've worked through when our affordable housing and social housing policy and the accord we 'll go out for consultation another aspect of the report which could be easily musters at the top of the page 348 about safety one of the criterion is about safety and what I would like us to move towards in the future is something along the lines of what Aviva is doing with their safe at home program so that 's building physical safety into into their housing that 's part of my vision and that something will start to work through following a workshop which you can see so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are people in our city who do not absolutely have any shelter at all it 's a critical situation there 's debate over whether it 's a crisis or not definition of crisis is something that affects the community this is having a profound effect on our community yes in the case of brohm there may be an additional weight of nine months there may be an additional foundational cost of ten percent but think also the social costs of people waiting for shelter which can also be translated into financial costs as well so I trust the wisdom of the council know we 'll make a good decision here from my point of view of weakness through brohm offers the greatest yield of an extra forty seven units carry an extra eight and kohls three that notwithstanding I will go with and support the eventual resolution of the count","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Part 2,QUJVBVvkU7o,20140423,1145.369,"Christchurch, New Zealand",3078,"our next item is the facilities rebuild north beach community crash terminate accounts okay no this has just come to right to counsel so the committee didn 't have time to consider it fully and thought we should just refer it to counsel I i I 'd be interested in hearing the view from the local councils below zero I mean it before who wants to move in second so if the two local councils would like to that would be appalling cotta and Ally Jones hey oh it 's a cylindrical why don 't we get one each because it 's coming it 's coming from one elite one board and going into another so Paul in Qatar david east so that it 's been moved and seconded so let 's have a discussion about that in the key question i had from 44 council staff and possibly for the local councillors as is there no other community use that the site on its existing site could entertain given that we are walking away from a considerable amount of insurance by agreeing we actually are losing a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take that on good morning my name is Gary Watson on the strengthening communities manager for the east part of the city so bill would Peter sources as one of my words through through contact with the community there hasn 't been a need there it has come up from any community group around another facility we have to reasonably close facilities one at Escott in one at North Beach is in community facilities this building was used to the sole use as a crush if another crush was to go back in the year there would be sorry where 's the North Beach primary school never heard of it it 's about towards the knee it says she called the north New Brighton promise unless it 's changed its name though no it is the north beach by me no no has it changed its name because of the amalgamation it look if I can clarify that there is the north near Brighton school there used to be the north New Brighton community crash they have now called themselves the north beach community but it 's really located @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erroneous as when locally it was known as the north beach school but officially it is the north near Bryan cool but i thought it might have changed its name because of the amalgamation of free though right officially is still that 's that 's erroneous that it should be that officially the North you Brian school last night I thought I knew that area quite well sorry that 's right so I just answered the question there hasn 't been a group that has come forward we feel reasonably confident that the site itself isn 't as in the best site for it for a community center for general community and that 's the fee that we 've had so how did you consult with the local community about whether there was a community facility need and we talked through the community forums every every community meeting with headsets come up as a discussion people were aware the preschool had no had no requirement to go back and we we asked we just had nobody put their hand up did it go through the community board with ya and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay it 's actually quite a small side too yeah I know the site yeah my question of what size is the site also them here I think it 's 540 square meals and a rather strange shape just over minimum sections of the way we are in the lead yep Ellie I 'm just looking at the repair Cotton 's and that 's basically what the option was from the insurer and quite clearly there 's a hundred and thirty thousand dollar difference between the indemnity value and the repair so the full cover for it was 280 and it has been identified as repairable and yet there is a key collapse mechanism problem with the building who has made the decision that it was repairable I think it was through the insurance company and the insurance company came back that they agreed there was two hundred and thirteen thousand dollars with a damaged city care went and had a look and they come up 217,000 and yes it was insured for over two hundred now for 280,000 all up so who I 'm just I can 't rationalize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's been decided for the repair have you had engineering reports and information like their completed on the building I just have to get someone else a little knowledge order I think it 's a really good question because it doesn 't seem to you would think that if it was that much damage it would actually be an economic to appear by any rational kind of measure so begin not only to hold things up but if there is more work or information that counts as one around us happy for it to come back to the committee next month and then come back to council but they 're not selling all about how they they 're selling part of it and it says that the collects mechanism is in the brief diaphragm which I would imagine as as as a significant part of the repair cost if that is the part that 's being sold I mean it it doesn 't make it clear whether that 's the entire building or or just a part of it has anyone got any of that information unfortunately the pit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we believe that there have been detailed engineering assessments done of this building yep and to to support the sublimation and this report unfortunately we just can 't provide those today well do people want to proceed with it today or do they want to comment today I mean my biggest concern about this is that without that information and without clarity on this decision I can 't really support something that essentially means that we 've got the repair of a building that we amazingly fully covered for when in fact it could possibly be uh neck anomic to repair and we could have a building there that provides services for the community I 'd like some more information before we see next month let 's just have it come back to the committee next month so why was it referred directly up here um we just run out of time ok comedy all right David well I think we need to sort of reflect on the fact that as gary has pointed out at a number of community forums in the booth texas area this property and building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on top of the the ascot facility and the war memorial hall at North Beach there 's also the freeville school or also very close proximity the school is closing but i 'm not sure what would happen to the hall there are more than adequate facilities in that immediate area excuse me for the community i actually think it 's actually quite a good opportunity for a neighboring group in spensive all that have lost their facility to actually have the ability to uplift part of this and i don 't think they 're taking the whole thing that 's part of it just part of it and relocated to dispensable I think it 's a win-win situation for for both areas the the site becomes vacant the land is not sure whether it 's TC 2 or 3 there but it certainly would be able to be sold off as a buildable section for council to recover the cost of the land and I actually support the proposal fully yeah I 'm Pauline only i 'm fairly supportive of this but don 't forget this facility is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council still up to ongoing maintenance and information of that however my consumers without having the information about the building we 'd be feasting it it 's an unsafe building on the other communities spencerville that would be my consume if we could get me clarify it appreciate that you know that i just think if it comes make sure the committee where we 've got the staff responsible because the other question the logical question would be why not actually repair it before you move it so you actually get a building it 's fit for purpose so that 's easy to relocate but again that the people that have that information aren 't yesterday they 're not taking it all that the dispensable Residents Association have agreed to be responsible for removal of the part of the building they require camping of water waste stormwater services at the boundary leaving their portion of the site level clear of hazzard sins and safe any building and resource consents they require to relocate the building to the alternative site so I mean they 're taking full responsibility for this I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get from an additional report I mean I 'm kind of both David east on us just just let them take up for a dollar but we 're losing twenty seven thousand two hundred at the moment we haven 't had any lease from the place since September 2013 we 've that the crash doesn 't want to go back there and we 've got no other community for it so you fix it for a hundred and something thousand dollars for what yeah I 'm actually in support of this I think that you 've got two communities one is through consultation has identified they don 't need it there 's another community that wants it and takes full responsibility of it I think it 's a win-win situation and I 'm fully support or but thank you well I want a live focus point ears on three point for future use of the site and I think that could be something that we need to keep in mind here with it 's a further report yep you know now we might sell the site we might you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's women understand about is that i 'm still not satisfied from the lack of information we have that the building is not a total loss if the building is a total loss why can 't we actually potentially have our cake and eat it too again i don 't know what the discussions and assessments have shown but if that building is a total loss then it gets its full insurance and they may be an ability within the insurance policy to rebuild that on another site I just don 't think I think we we are limiting our options if we go with something like this without the full information sorry yes Karen yes I 've just had a brain memory um this dispensable organization we 've given the engineer 's report which is just arrived last year and they they took the report away went through it they were happy with the state of the building they understood that that the section that they were getting was the piece that had that the roof issue but they were aware that they would be able to having moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so they were happy with what they were kidding and they were happy with the engineer 's report at the DIA system that was dumped it I 'm sorry I can see anyone 's head sorry my lack of Rico yeah but i think that the point that that re jones is making is that she 's questioning whether whether we should go with insurance and have it fully repaired but then not necessarily have anyone to lease it to so that 's the that 's the question point two is are we confident enough that the building is not a write-off because i don 't know what the policy is but essentially we may be an option and the policy there that you can if it 's any you know not economic to repair that you could rebuild that on another piece of land and therefore get your full insurance entitlement whereas with this option here you 're essentially walking away from 130 k which is fine if you 're making that decision based on on you know being in receipt of all the information that is my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurer believes that can be repaired is as do we and the only difference is four thousand dollars 213,000 versus 217,000 i 'm not i haven 't got the reports and information that backs up what the insurer 's saying and in fact who has assessed the detailed engineering report or where they come from the council has agreed with the insurer this is an unusual situation we know but there is agreement on the on the on the two that is that that is the position so yes it is true that we instead of repairing the building what would take a much lesser value in terms of the indemnity value but you know overall the question is is that it as you know we can repair the building for two hundred and thirteen thousand dollars maybe four thousand more than that but who do we being Lisa to as is very common in a number of insurance policies so I mean if you I understand what you 're saying so absolute trust and faith and what 's been said by the insurer and stuff if you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a question about whether this building is repairable or not then you have to start looking at what the policy says with regards to what your options are and if we can take a building at two hundred and thirteen thousand dollars and put it brand new on another site somewhere if that 's what the policy allows for why would we not look at that option but there is a moot point if we are going with what the DA 's have found to date which is that it is economic terrific the building is insured for 280,000 or 280,000 but that means that the economic to repair at 213 or 217 that 's what I 'm saying if you 're going okay no I 'm sorry I 'm obviously not making my point that if you are agreeing with what the staff is saying if you agreeing what the insurer 's saying I absolutely understand what you 're saying what I 'm saying is I don 't I want to see the information i personally would want to see the information so that i support what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going with what staff and what insurers are saying the years I is there anything and delaying this to return to the community commercially have the report updated and come back to the next council it 's not going to delay things other than another month 's worth of non non rent you might also include something can they report about the future use of the site so we could actually do get the whole thing sort of it at once which would seem is it possible okay all right we 'll do that but I 'll have to put the motion yeah the other thing I would say if we went down Ellie 's track and looking at st. the insurance company can we rebuilt this facility somewhere else and take the full value of the insurance what would you build for two hundred and eighty thousand dollars and I think you wouldn 't build much and that 's that that 's something that needs to be considered as well so the fact we 've got an offer on the table to take a part of it away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelley 's it 's a fair point and say well could we build another facility for another community by taking this insured value and rebuilding somewhere else what are we actually going to get for 280 k I would say very little you get nothing on that site because of the no no no I 'm not capitalizing on the the value of the insurance to build something for 280 thousand dollars i would suggest you 're not actually going to get much for your money well yes but i mean it becomes a question of do we actually move this off site or a dot and they do it all we get 82 k for the indemnity of it we still own the land which we can sell off then for poor housing or another use and move on i think if you if we go down alleys track which is it 's admirable we are then faced with the prospect of trying to build another facility for 280 thousand dollars i would suggest we 're going to have to top it up and about as much again to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along I 'm going to move Council Jones second that the

April 2014 - Part 3,dtohv1SD4Dg,20140423,898.32,"Christchurch, New Zealand",2369,that and so now what I 'll move that the reporters the whole be adopted seconded by David East is yep it in you would like to make a point okay David East just with relationship to item 11 on page 153 where we have requested staff to identify as 11.2 identify options for the Legacy Project and New Brighton just drawing council 's attention to the viewer Pegasus some horde discussed this matter on Tuesday this week and just that the time frames to give that back by the end of May may be a little tight the board has at the stage opted to use the community advisory group that 's been set up for the master plan and to expand that group to look at this project so we 've just got to go through we 're proposing to add the chairpersons or representatives or some of the local residents associations to that advisory group to consider options for the legacy project and it may be just a little tight to get that back by the end of May so just it was in the council look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I haven 't received a report on it yet I know that I 'm one of the signatories on the on the process so so I 'm expecting that to come to me at some point but i don 't think that council itself would be you know concerned as long as the community was in control of the process they are yet the we expect something big certainly in June but well if you if you don 't have anything available by the end of May just please make sure that there is a report on the agenda by the end of May to to state that because I think we 've got to get ourselves into the habit of having reports meeting the timetable and if they don 't if that doesn 't mean that the reports ready at least there 's a report that says that we would request an additional two weeks it 's just so that the council is signing off on the time tables that are then met it 's just a discipline that we need to ensure that we have in place pulling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police support endorsed your comments see you truly and it 's so easy to lose track of things and thinks counselor East for updating it on there just if we could just draw attention to page 152 7.1 that we did request Nugent report back on how to change the parameters of the stronger of skirt to better align with new program so if we could just take a note of it and hopefully letters in progress I think that Jonnie suggested there that 's a good idea hmm yeah Lee so I know that I think we 've asked for a briefing with skirt as counsel I know that the higley very much community board has been really concerned that the natural environment recovery program actually has a lot of really good things in it but there 's no statutory effect to it so there 's no requirement for those things to happen so it really relies on the goodwill of other organizations that are doing the work to take that the outcomes into account and unfortunately and I think quite tragically for the city that 's not happening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep dish channel is being put back which is almost hard to understand it you 've got things happening around the Easter II edge for example where the height of the road isn 't being raised and where we 've got master planning or coastal edge planning that we want to get a better level of amenity or environmental protection that the skirt are putting back what was there on sir timber forth but just an inadequate for our future needs as a city there was a whole bunch of other things in here around flooding around land drainage around storm water management just basically the things we have a wonderful opportunity to do as a result of the earthquake with the huge amount of work that we have to do in terms of infrastructure repair but the gap as that skirt are not aligned to it and that is something I think we should all be really concerned about so this is urgent we 've got streets in the central city that as part of the accessible transport plan that have been popped back as they were on sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the central city recovery plan we 've got old channel going back where we should be having new modern channel this is really concerning so I you know I I just can 't stress our urgent it is for us to be able to have the chance to have this conversation about changing the Mandate of skirt so that we can get those better environmental outcomes otherwise we won 't be able to afford to get there look I mean I 'm if we got scoot to come here and do a presentation then we would we would have the organizational structure presenting to us and they would quite rightly say that this is within our hands we are one of the three essentially governors of their organizational structure so so it 's I guess what we need to do is we need to direct our representative on the horizontal infrastructure governance group because I think there 's a mistake that people make their all of the horizontal infrastructure has being dealt with through scoot Edison the storm water and flood management as being dealt worth by the council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pipes are done by scoot but that but the other infrastructure is being dealt with by by the by the council so thirty percent of the horizontal infrastructure has been dealt with by the council seventy percent by scoot so what we need to do is we actually need to bring them really to the to the well to the task force on one hand but we also need to direct our representative on the horizontal infrastructure governance group to take a more proactive role in terms of the parameters of the of the skirt team in terms of their reporting back to us because they are not funded to do more than put back they have to come to us and get additional funding and I think I 've made this comment on more than one occasion the trouble was is that they look underground at the size of the pipes they don 't look around and see the external environment which is why we must I think significant opportunities in the woolston area around the tannery particularly around Road realignment and parking and access to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been dealt with it exactly the same time as scoop but it does need to be funded separately okay so in my view of it being scooping aware of it because places let lieutenant we 've brought to their attention the problem is that we 're a minority shareholder minority at the governance level of skirt so we 're why don 't I think you must owed we are not a minority it is done by consensus everyone has to agree so so well that 's why we wanted the report because we I don 't understand like when it first got set up we had a report come the council skirt got a mandate I 've gone off and done anything things have changed and evolved and I can you know I don 't want to refer to the fitzgerald f situation but things have evolved we have a lot more knowledge narrow about at natural environment we have a natural environment recovery program in place and that we didn 't have when skirt was set up so we need to have a good look at what is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we feel that it should be touched yeah so now i agree with it but we 've got the report on the agenda so why don 't we require that report to come to the earth quite recovery many of the whole next week yeah but yeah I mean so so so what I 'm going to do I 'm going to move that that that we request so I mean I can 't say that they 're in a position to deliver that we request that the report under item 7 of the earthquake recovery committee of the whole agenda be be provided to the earthquake recovery committee of the whole next week and effort is not available by then that it be included and the report with the task force on the flood of shoes so it said so that least it 's got a reporting timetable of one week or three all right just in the resolution it just needs to say natural environment recovery program yeah it 's just a mr. word is natural environment the noob is it 's cool and I 'll move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our tell you cream speak to it I just wonder whether parameters X goes far enough for me it 's about d 'etre modus operandi of skirt if when they came to the drill with Pegasus community board they presented the international association of public patient spectrum but only shows the board the first two blocks on the spectrum verifying and the first to our informant consultant so that that 's their understanding of their job though they could tell us what they 're doing and they will consult with us now the Prime Minister has see when he said engagement I pretty sure I heard him say meaningful engagement so to me that takes skirt further along that spectrum and I would like this actually if we could in some way could that report include in its scope looking at engagement process because it 's not gluten we just find a mismatch between the parameters I think for me it comes back to that modus operandi and which skirt actually operates I think it 's a misunderstanding of what scooters scoot is a structure of five different well infrastructure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council Sarah and the New Zealand Transport Agency so I mean the council ought to be further down that spectrum but that 's the council 's role I think that they 're doing what that 's their understand that they are doing what they think they 've been asked to do but there 's they need to yeah so I understand what you mean but I think we forget that it 's actually our responsibility to lead that consultation Ellie yeah just quickly I 've heard it said on more than one occasion that scooters not funded for anything more than putting back already there yeah it has already been made perfectly clear to the community boards and certainly is chilly papanui that they 're not even funded to put back what was there before so I 'd like some clarification on that Duncan Gibbs communicated that to us recently and it 's a budgetary issue and I 'd just like some clarification on it please yep we can we can include their 20 minutes I mean it might actually be worthwhile if we could get scoot to come into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole on on its program but but but having having them respond to questions about you know what are the the governance parameters is probably not helpful but yeah why don 't we actually mate with the government 's group because like we 've never met mark forward we 've never met the governance client group so why don 't we actually get them it just seems to me that we can we can deal with a management level to a blow in the face but actually it 's that governance group that is the key one that 's driving the way in which they work and what they bring in front of us for betterment this is what they just get on and do so can i I can I propose that we actually seek in meetings and urgent meeting with them to understand where they sequence and to hear back on on how we might be able to address some of the concerns well well I don 't think it 's appropriate to invite the governance group of scoot to come to the committee of the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll deal with that afternoon it after morning tea because I want to talk to you about this but I think that we will invite scoot to come here next week and just give us an update on their progress I 'm concerned about what Ellie Jones said that the manager of succeed because they are funded for for putting back what was the earth so I really want to hear about there I am concerned that they don 't sarily look above ground for the betterment opportunities to bring back here for additional funding so but we don 't need a resolution to do that so we 've got a resolution here that the report under item 7.1 be provided to the earthquake recovery committee of the whole if not available by them to be included in the report on the flooding task force issues so I put that resolution all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and it 's just us,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Executive,gEcrkSPTXAg,20140423,1213.94,"Christchurch, New Zealand",3365,and I should note that we have an acting acting chief executive here today and welcome Peter gunsel to the meeting our chief financial officer and if we can take the reporters read and now perhaps handed over over to Peter I said they report that from the acting acting CEO was circulated last night you will note within their that major issues has been a focus particularly with the second severe flood event with the the action being taken around as well as normal day-to-day operations setting up a task force with a real focus on those short-term temporary solutions in that space the future of the red zone has become a public activity and council staff we part of the joint communications and engagement team on that the answers to questions raised that last council meetings and previously as attached for your information on internal staff matters organizational updates and you 'll note that the new director of corporate services Brendan insta Sam started on Tuesday and he is sitting behind us today welcome bridden and Mary Richardson will starting her role as director officers of the chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ internal organizational update would be around the annual staff engagement survey we have got the high level results of that annual staff engagement survey and it shows that fifty three percent of the council staff engaged which is a decrease on last year 's sixty-six percent this result puts us in the moderate zone for engagement and places us just ahead of the australasian local government average of fifty two percent and with the level of engagement that puts us at the level recorded before the earthquakes obviously there will be an ongoing piece of work around this engagement result it 's not we wanted them to be thank you I thought that I would just pick up on a couple of things the first is around the that the flooding obviously that 's a huge issue for for the council at the moment and in certainly welcome the establishment of a task force to really cut across the different you know I guess silos within the council organization to make sure that we 've got people with the planning background and with thee you know that the delivery background @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storm water are now collectively working together to momentum to make sure that we get that momentum the areas that we 're looking at obviously areas where there were floor levels breached and if there were areas that that have been must on the slus we 've got the surely flocked an area woolston the heavy up valley littleton for a slightly different reason little river and a karora i don 't know if there were other areas that were breached as well then they will be included in the report so that 's just a summary of where we 've got to but the important thing is to have some certainty for people along two lines so one is that and i think this is clear in this report is that when we 're not going to be just looking at the the long-term engineering solutions but we 're going to be looking for temporary solutions as well that we can 't leave people sitting there for two years not knowing how long it 's going to be before they can actually deliver so and some of those temporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be reported in the next three weeks which i think will give people a degree of comfort clean and then Ali the kamir just wish to ask whether the scope of the report will look at some of the assumptions and I 'm thinking money from own communications point a few over for instance the one in 100 year event conclusion which we have at the moment whether we 're going to look at re yeah reframing that too on a percentage basis for instance something which has I know this is about solutions but wonder i think the framing of some of the discussions around flood risk you know people with expert backgrounds and knowledge move easily into language of risk that are not easily explainable a one on one hundred year event simply means that there is a one-percent chance of it occurring in any year it doesn 't mean that it 's only going to happen once every hundred years so i think the language itself might actually be better better explained so and I 'm course not a technical exclusionist regard myself but I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know climate change productions that we we cannot rely on on what our extreme weather events not becoming more frequent and I think what we judge to be a one in 100 year event or a one-percent per annum risk of occurring will actually change even in the next 10 to 20 years so i think it probably is unhelpful to refer to you know what a technically correct expressions our own building it refused a 150 year event so i think that we 're going to have to start thinking about what that actually means and practice without changing climate so it 's a really good point to take on board i think the communications have to be clearer yep thank you i just further to that too old just wanted some clarification on the one and 100 year and i 've heard your explanation there based on the amount of rainfall however one could say that the rainfall experienced over the weekend or just recently couldn 't really be described as heavy there it was sporadic and it was consistent so i wonder whether the one in 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as shouldn 't be based on rainfall but also how the rainfall reacts with the land and the drainage isn 't that the issue now it 's not the amount of rain that is falling or the extreme weather event as we 've heard it 's actually how any rainfall reacts on the drainage system with a be fair I think it depends on the different areas that we 're talking about so I 'm referring yeah big you happy yeah during to flop tan Pierre and I think flockton has a particular set of issues what I saw in the heathkit Valley is quite different right so I think that and that 's why I 'm really pleased that we 're going to get individual reports that actually identify what caused the problems in each of these different areas because once we have and right angle what caused the problems then we actually know whether we 're looking at a quick fix a longer term engineering fix and then what the temporary options are to deal with problems in the meantime you know some of the problems are clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it 's not all earthquake related coverage by eq see for example because it 's not all land damage that 's covered by eq see that causes the flooding and flockton the reduction and the capacity of the Dudley Creek is a major cause of the flooding and the flockton area that is not covered by eq c so we 've got we 've got multiple layers of issues that we have to address you know I 'm not trying to sort of say that I mean I know people get sick of people saying that it 's a complex problem but it is actually a complex problem what the way that we deal with complexity is to get the different parts of the council and externally Sarah as well we get everyone engaged in the process of looking at the scale of each individual area to look at how we resolve those problems I 'm feeling very confident that the the council has within its capacity the ability to bring forward a report that will address each individual area and we will know exactly in three weeks time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was regards to external involvement and looking at this problem in the short term and long term as far as the flooding goes are we involving insurers and eqc in this there is quite clearly an issue in the area now with regards to repairs being done with rebuilds being done in the FMA causing problems i know someone who 's scoping and building costs have been completely stopped because the insurance company says you 're in the FMA there is no other explanation are we including and involving insurers in eq c and the other part of this problem as well we we will have to because and both EQC and the insurer 's came to the flocked and meetings you know entirely of their own volition and they want to be in the room obviously they 've got issues in terms of their plans around you know rebuilds and repairs in terms of what they have to achieve but i think that the major concern that I have is the ongoing insurability and those areas and that 's something that the council is very determined to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really welcome the idea that we will services task force I think it 's really important we 've always indicated that we will look at other heroes outside of flockton and I think it 's really good that we 're setting up a discreet piece of work to do that I know that there 's been some concerns raised in the last month particularly around the fact that scooter putting back like-for-like and not taking into account what 's happening in terms of land drainage can visit anything that that staff have done in the immediate term to basically get skirt works aligned with possibly some of these either temporary or short to medium term solutions it just seems like really crazy that 's good are putting that like-for-like in areas where we know there 's been an elevator flood risk because of the earthquake and a nightan page 152 of the agenda today the committee the whole has asked for an urgent report back on how the parameters of skirt can be better aligned with the natural environment programme recovery program to take him to account the natural environmental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a defect complete disconnect at the moment so I really want to know if there 's any resolution we need to pass or anything that they 're acting acting to fix it ghetto for the whoever 's responsible can do you know just in the last two weeks I 've had ten start with notices for stormwater stuff that scooter dome which is all going back to as it was on September forth rather looking at the new circumstances and thank you for the question counselor and what I 'd like to do is take that question away and answer the next acting CEOs report rather than cydia so call me also going to to tackle it as you see it on on the agenda item later on thanks can we maybe just ask that that report comes back next week I 'm in it it is really urgent because it 's a huge amount of money that 's being spent given our financial situation we cannot afford to be losing the opportunity to spend money wisely and every day that goes past is another day of lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the committee of the whole next week that would be appreciated I believe we 're asking that question on and we get to the ginger item on page 15 to Andrew thank you I also welcome the establishment of a task force and I 'm particularly pleased to see areas of concern emergency identified the areas in my banks peninsula wart that have been severely affected include littleton where it 's not so much flooding that 's an issue but where land drainage issues of course multiple landslips a little river and a corolla we 're of course flooding has been a major concern and I just asked that when the reports written it clearly identifies what happened in each area and why and what temporary and permanent solutions there might be because of course one of the things we want this report to do is to inform public meetings and inform our own decision making but also to give a level of confidence to affected residents who I 'm very sure will be pleased to see that we are now doing some some work in this area so yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will will give residents a degree of confidence with informed public meetings and their decision-making as well so i absolutely welcome the response that 's good yes Sam Pauline Qi also welcome it and would like to just remind counselors in the impending task force that we had the petition from the H we rode residents last week that sits just outside the flockton basin area but it does involve the sand Albans Creek which runs into the Dudley so if we could just make sure that that is also including i 'm pretty sure that they are including all the streams and tributaries that run into these rivers but i wanted to make a note of it thank you yeah no that 's that 's good there was another area that I just want to move on to which is the prime minister 's announcement that the public will have a say on the future of the red zone just to reflect on on what he said it isn 't just about council staff being part of a joint communications and engagement team the minister will be meeting with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my very night our who and other agencies to design the communication participation process and I just want to make it clear that that and Christchurch that will include the you know the groups that have been set up to really look at the East in terms of the residential red-zoned the AVO no teclado network that brings together a range of groups that have been working on you know what the potential future of the residential Reds owners obviously our own community boards eastern vision the Traverse Wetlands Trust the Avon Heathcott a hoot a ste trust you know there are a number of groups that have been existent for a long time and others that have emerged in order to participate in a or to lead a community engagement and so I 've made that absolutely clear that that 's going to be christchurch 's participation and that is going vol of those groups in terms of trying to lead the community engagement because it 's a truly exciting opportunity you know as the prime minister said himself you know it 's a area of four times the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunities but just as important I was going to throw more important as the opportunity for the infrastructure issues that need to be sorted out for our city as a whole road layout water wastewater and stormwater networks and that is what is dealt with first and so again this actually ties into the work that 's going on with the flood risk that we have some enormous potential to actually resolve some long-standing issues in relation to the city 's flood risk by actually using some of the land that has been has been taken from residents affected by the earthquakes but n would have been exposed to significant flood risk had they not been red zoned we have a real opportunity to look at how the roads are laid out how the water wastewater and stormwater networks are affected by that and again thinking about the natural use of wetlands as they lead to the river in terms of our own stormwater management it 's a truly exciting opportunity I know that people don 't get excited about stormwater but I do now and I think that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and again the community needs to be very much engaged and nature isn 't just a metaphor council engineers and Cirie engineers to get together and decide but to engage the wider community and what that can look like so i just want to reflect on that because i think the report probably understated a little bit about the great opportunity that this does present to the city yani thank you we finally welcome the opportunity now to have some engagement around the future the red zone we have been waiting for quite a quite a while so it 's a step forward but like the previous question what what confidence can we have as a council that the skirt repair program is aligned to the future of the red zone so that we understand that we 're not spending money in areas where actually we don 't we don 't need to because the night can I interrupt you because I can tell you that it is holding up the skirt program that the skirt program has not been able to produce some of the results that they want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the red zone and so there 's no I and in fact we are wasting significant amounts of money by having to maintain services in an area and i 'm not talking about services to residences that haven 't moved I 'm talking about roads that are really damaged I 'm talking about some of the infrastructure that cannot be moved I mean some of the realignment of roads are so obvious but they and that would enable us to move the stop banks back from the rubber but skirt can 't do that work until they have access to the residential red zone and they are providing maintenance and areas that that is basically coming off that total spend on the horizontal infrastructure which i think is an absolute waste of money yeah so if that 's the case what 's the time frame for getting the future plan for the red zone do we know when no no that all the Prime Minister announced was that he hoped that the community engagement would be able to commence in May if that 's the case then we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zone for the stormwater road layout waste water water networks so I mean it so I guess one thing that would be helpful i don 't know if that 's intention are we going to get like a detailed report with what the Prime Minister 's kind of announced versus the work that we need to do before that engagement happens so that we 've made our decisions yeah and we 're clear about what we need to do regards to the red zone yes and if so when is that report likely to come well they 're all the Prime Minister announced was it was a paragraph on a speech which ship so we will be working with the government honor all right there any other questions on the CEO report when someone like to move that it be received Paul ons Dale second did Tim scandrett i put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's

and thank you for accepting the presentation of this petition the petition has over 300 signatures which ask you to take action on the trans-pacific partnership agreement also known as the TPPA or the TPP that is to adopt a 12-point resolution as the minimum criteria which must be met if New Zealand is to sign the TPP and then to present this resolution to central government on behalf of your people in the best interests of Christchurch or tackle and her people we urge you to inform themselves about what the TPP is because it will affect council budgets it will affect councils ability to

very much for this opportunity to talk to you my name is Greg Rezanov esky and I am a member of the renewables of modulator we are honored to be here we write to your council on the 20th march concerning the TPP and public interest and we address that we address TPP as a matter that had potential to adversely affect our key concern we 're a climate action group and our concerns about climate change and this led us to question keatley feasibility to constrain government 's from acting in the public and national interest New Zealand Street TPP is drawn toward global law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as privatisation it is a simple doctrine that presumes a self-interest will better direct the development of a resource than a publican managed enterprise do we really agree with this proposition it is the doctrine that made the Chicago School of Economics and Raja nomics notorious we see in the TPP many ways in which Christchurch City Council and its activities on behalf of the public and their well-being will be further constrained and pressurized the gender promoted by TPP appears solely about large corporate interests being entrenched the previously defeated multilateral treatment our treaty on investment is just one of the reincarnations apparent in TPP our understanding of the dynamic and relationships between capitalist enterprise and government allows us to see the government 's duty to care is somewhat constrained we are heartened that despite the amendment to the local government act where the for duties of government were removed councils the length of a

administration proposed a resolution to the auckland council and that was that TPP be negotiated in the public interest or national interest some councillors moved a set of twelve amendments to that resolution and they said well let 's define the public interest and they said provided that the partnership and agreements achieve the following objectives again I was specific to Auckland but we 've generalized it and made it generic continues to allow all local councils if they so choose to adopt procurement policies that provide for a degree of local preference to choose whether particular services or facilities are provided in house and by council controlled organizations or by contracting out or to require higher safety and health and safety environmental protection employment rights

just kind of wanted to check what the status of the petitioners versus the deputation it really shouldn 't have been put on the agenda the people encountered trying to work out what processes to bring

NZ,NZ,Christchurch City Council,Christchurch City Council,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZETwErnCvvgbvBbnnHfyxA,17.04.14 - District Plan Review - Part 11,S_Lu_iTtHcc,20140417,1327.03,"Christchurch, New Zealand",3558,"certainly happen to promote detail essentially that the story I 'm wanting to paint is that there 's a limited predicted amount of employment and off in terms of retail offices if we continue to allow dispersal of that and it dilutes what we can achieve in the center 's and so hence the approach we 're proposing and the industrial chapters to restrict retail and office in those areas to avoid it continued into dispersed through industrial areas like it has in the last decade we limit retail and office in industrially because obviously if people are working there they need to be able to go and get copy food all those sorts of things so they don 't have to drive to all those things we 're providing for ancillary retail and office associated with an industrial business and have caps of 250 square metres or twenty-five percent of the total floor space on the site which it was the lesser in addition to that we 're also providing for food and beverage outlets for the cop for the cafe like cafe kudos on booming and drive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're also providing for what 's already exists in a way of large format retailing so you 've got car sales yards along morehouse air you 've got the likes of bunnings that was in an industrial zones or that got changed and so it 's allowing for what we call trade suppliers and yard based retail which is another group of what we call retail activity the manufacturers association who want to co-locate with tate electronics well well because they 're not an ancillary well yeah I mean it 's the largest member but you know apparently it 's not insulated that in relation to the Tate campus what would it preclude from going there that is planned to go there anything that 's not tight and anything that 's not you know like but they could have a cafe in there we have reviewed the rules for the take campus and the other industrial park is owns the latest draft allows the five percent of the total full space on a site to be used for officers which has to be in association with high technology industrial activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ association with that is it does lead to different interpretations of lots and association with it 's trying to be more flexible than ancillary because in association with is in my mind not necessarily the same as being incidental to or secondary to an industrial activity but specifically on Tate on be able to discuss that now well great if we could because i think the conference it 's awesome and would love to sit but for example taters behind desk or the design school thinking obviously that sort of whole educational game but is where Tate is very very much aligned I 'd love to see them develop what they want to develop a think if we have great industries like Tate and trembles and all those guys we actually want to support them to other help rather than knock any creativity that they might have where they get away from sort of looking like an industrial complex and make it more a place where you would want to spend time I like the concept of what Danny get a sense to light but some of the trade-offs I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just had a real can we just learn what would be actually blocked from Tate 's or some of those other quite out there sort of industries from doing what they want to do in their campus style that we would be effectively blocking could they have a training school there or a branch of the university or you know an educational facility if I could turn to the rules attached which are on a page that on if I turn to page 112 112 right the rules for the take campus oh she start on page 111 but the reason for taking you to page 112 and for that matter 113 is it 's the list of what 's professors in the take campus tapes is tates campuses proposed to be a zoned industrial park zone which and the rules for officers and that zona more permit intended to be more permissive than other industrial zones such as the heavy industrial zone where we want to avoid office large office development because it 's more likely to have a reverse sensitivity effect but in terms of Tate tapes on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heavy industrial zone is often noxious odor or other noxious activities that are a cure and those kinds of zones rather than an activity so a heavy and desire heavy industrial zone companies want to locate there because it 's got separation from more sensitive users no no that we cleared as well sorry I 'm just saying that the industrial park zone which is a high-tech zone for want of a better term where distinguishing between from the other industrial zones in terms of the tapes campus the page 112 p5 does provide for trade and industry training facilities without restriction on science so they could have educational facilities there there 's no limit in terms of officers p9 is currently worded allows office activity directly associated associated with a high technology industrial activity and there 's a standard that it 's to be limited to five percent of the total floor space on the site so taking tapes overall cap of 50,000 square meters it would allow for two and a half thousand square meters of office floor space on their campus now there 's an issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated with high technology industrial activity what 's directly associated with could be interpreted differently and one may view it as not including in the manufacturers and Exporters Association and so up from the previous feedback you 've given you I understand you want to be able to provide for the likes of manufacturers and Exporters Association but that if it is where we draw that line we 've attended to by put in the words directly associated with a high technology industrial activity but that does open up because this is subject to legal scrutiny that is going to be those that come forward with proposals and argue that it 's directly associated with when council staff and even council may may argue that it 's not so but but then there are then anything that is considered not to be becomes a discretionary activity which was on page 115 and the assessment criteria indicated there what it would be assessed against yeah so if it 's an offer security and that exceeds the five percent for instance is subject to a discretionary activity status but if it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high technology industrial activity then it becomes non compliant and given that there are some key industries and Christchurch which are employing a lot of people when driving a lot of exports from the city and are doing quite interesting and exciting things how will takes just let 's be very specific about this how will they feel about these rules do we know we 've had a submission from them seeking the provisions that were developed through the plan change which referred to an office associated with our how to weave a high-technology industrial activity and respect to this provision from memory their submission six that this is worded exactly as the current plan changes which is and do they believe that that 's wide enough to cover bur easier manufacturers and Exporters Association so that 's that 's their interpretation but yeah but bad okay so that 's your interpretation I know that you can 't say that that that you would interpret it the same way but I want to know whether you wouldn 't end something like that to be included within it I mean is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be allowed no no generally speaking what we 're trying to avoid here is heaven for instance headquarter offices and industrial parks but if perhaps that type of office can meet these standards and is associated with the high technology industrial activity then that 's okay we are trying to keep and this is in to be consistent with the RPS and the lengies recovery plan we are trying to keep industrial areas for industrial activities so this is I can dust you always and blowing duty smoke out of a chimney or having series all of those things I understand it but it is industrially yes I know but it 's high-tech I mean we 've changed you know that I feel like our district plan is still you know and Dickens day you know looking at what industry is computed today I mean it 's not like an attached what I just see it was that if it 's an office that meets those standards and is associated with a high-tech industry yes it can go there is a permitted activity yes I know but what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has agreed with the proposed wording and their belief that it allows the New Zealand manufacturers and exporters to build their building the air and yet the council that is writing the rules doesn 't believe it extends to cover the manufacturers in association so it sort of doesn 't feel right yep let 's play devil 's advocate on we just look it up from a different lens for a second I totally hear what you 're saying and I sort of and I grieve what you 're saying on the other side of the coin is if you get an aberration where it goes in a way that you don 't really want to go this with these rules are intended for to be quite specific v40 as for technology before and the other land designations a design so you don 't get air brushes that go against what we actually want to see in an outcome and you know I have some concerns around loosening those rules due to a degree where anything that 's good start being advocated for because we 've set a precedent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from industrial other in industrial activity and and it seems to me that what I 'm worried about is that these wording this wording has been agreed by Tate 's on the basis that they believe it will achieve their objective whereas we 're very clearly heard that it won 't and and that to me is the kind of that that 's unfortunate in terms of what we 're trying to get here we 've got a situation here where we 've got a really good industry that we actually almost want to showcase they exactly want to do the same thing with their campus development they are wanting to bring their d.school into the center of town they 've got a really close affiliation probably the closest of any industry with Canterbury University so in Canberra university wants to do internship and all sorts of things what we want is a completely different style of thinking and actually it wants to be one of those places where people come in from China or wherever they 're selling their goods to and they see something awesome so it kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space green face all sorts of lovely things and they may just go there on their journey to Christchurch and that 's what they 're going to see is crass huge so it needs we need a sort of definition of industry for these types of industries and it 's going to be exactly the same with the whole of the IT and Street because it looks very much like your front room it doesn 't look like gelati you know it doesn 't look like you 're manufacturing tires or cars or the noise and you know living if you the reason for manufacturers on us and exporters want to locate there is because of the showcase that 's that 's why they want to be there they want to be able to showcase what Tate 's does and it 's in it 's the way that it does what it does I mean it 's changed its orientation from from from really the manufacturer of things to the inter in life lifelong service provision you know it 's it 's not yeah but it 's a bit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know that they tell an amazing story about about being and places that have skipped the whole analog generation they 've gone straight to digital and in radio technology providing access to coffee bean farmers to the price of coffee beans around the world which puts them in a marketplace that they wouldn 't otherwise be in so we need to start thinking about industrial late trembles new building for example with all the building information and stuff in the walls built actually by city care is stunning sort of things well it 's actually was built by main seal here we have us and then bought by city and completed by city gear and fantastic yeah and awesome and that 's the sort of thing we need to showcase so these things although their industrial need to be able to have around them all the sorts of things you see in those perks in China where you go and see electric cars and then you know there 's this amazing showroom and then there 's coffee and then there 's whatever my understanding though is that tight got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they change the land from v4 to be 40 the correct rural to to be 40 the team was didn 't exist before takes actually designate a bit busy but that there 's a p40 zone that exists the currency plan and William way and we and pepper and drive so if we want to actually drive an outcome that actually gets there can be looking for do we have to find a new designation oh there there are a couple of options that you can consider but I also need to advise you of the implications now one thing that you could hear for instance is take out the office space directly associated with high technology industrial activity and just don 't have it associated with high technology it because all of space own all of Tate 's own this particular land they know it 's their decision as to how much they want to give to office space or the types of offices and end and if they don 't save enough and for their own activities then then that 's their business that but you could still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other difficulty that I would bring to your attention as then there will be pressure on us to change all of the other industrial pet park areas to be the same wire you get to the same why because they might want to have certain officers that that are above the cap or that are not associated to the episode because there is completely come from anywhere else this is the one eggs at the moment at the moment I understand why you 're trying to write a generic rule but the thing is is that this is a specific a specific example which makes sense on every level except that you want to relocate office space to the CBD enter other commercial centers that are already zoned for that purpose so that 's the only reason for us none of the reverse sensitivities none of those things actually matter it is only about preferring it is the location well I don 't think that 's a strong enough reason to put up against what I think Tate has put forward as a reasonable position on on having their industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tate as part of its showcasing of the high-tech industry which is a big part of manufacturing and export and it 's and it 's got so much positive for its connection with christ church particularly in our post disaster environment the whole concept of moving to becoming a sensing city all of the all of the work that we want to do in order to get the city really on the mech for more than being a disaster but actually being a place where creativity and innovation are happening and these showcase environments it 's not going to happen and the CBD Tate is located where it 's located why on earth would we force its organization to go on to the CBD of Auckland which is where it will go rather than to have a concept plan that that enables a sensible colocation or that pool I just want to say that I would hate to think that actually we allow commercial office space to start locating in industrial areas that would be a real mistake in my mind because what we 'll end up having is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area the people who fear start complaining with the smells and the noise and then it starts becoming a problem with saying they 're great we 've seen it will have actually had activities like living earth and now to getting the smell spilling out to them to the residents totally agree so I would want to see it confined to the T yep not as the high tea so if I take only so can I ask are you still happy with a cap on the amount of space so you want no cap and you want no relationship to the high technology industrial activity I mean I have no idea around the Cape I haven 't got a sense of oh sorry that the camp for officer it 's let 's assume that the restriction of it being associated with the hi-tech industrial activities removed that there 's no to the 250 cap doesn 't apply in this instance it 's a total there 's a limit of five percent of the total floor space on the site so fifty thousand square meters of development could occur on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affects five percent of that would be two and a half thousand square meters yeah again so certainly open to discussing the cat Mike assume we 're not having any cap at all is that at all seriously they 're like yes it might get struck down for the sake that it doesn 't meet the requirements of the loop is it work no no no I was going to say that it becomes more like from Tate 's perspective arguably it 's that the lands worth a lot more if it can be developed and entirely for officers and the whole thing that becomes an office park so they can we can look at it and come back to you about yeah I 've got an outline development plan could we not just have a designated space in there like an as an outline development just add it to the outline development plan on this particular case give them a special circumstance right how hard is that is it just to concede can we do it part of the plan change because I think we 're still having an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the day go back to the stencils of the city plan if it 's non-compliant you apply freaking seem if it 's non-compliant it 's generally not notified and it 's generally ground up and it might have some conditions around it to mitigate if you think so so we 're not saying that they can 't have this space but is there another way that we can actually do it that means that we don 't have this long protracted thing that undermines all the other areas because I because I have concerns that what happens when people use the easiest possible planning mechanism officers put them into these areas and then over time all they do is say well we 've already built it and a lot of pharame departments that got consent for an office development in an industrial area that then turned into a residential department which has now come down","(-43.5320214,

this is chris i 'll choose a date that I 'm not here I 'm not here on the fifth of may would you like that day is it a weekday it 's a Monday to Monday I 'm giving a speech and somewhere else right well I might offer it up anyway just as punishment we 'll see how far we get on this chapter rice key issues that have come free consultation on the industrial chapter are five bullet points on the screen there and I 'll talk fruits of those points and then we 'll each amendment made in the industrial chapter the first is the restrictions we 're introducing on retail and officers and the city planners oh sorry sorry and before you go on sincerely took them because if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are seen through there are some over here apologies could we really useful to get our version in a daze on each one so I 've got many different chip fine yeah I 'll I 'll make sure the next version is the industrial chapters got vision to on it so what 's that I know including sources the first version of the industrial right the version you should have of the industrial chapter has on the bottom of it for it reads 40 Cal review 9 april 2014 the duty first issue that 's come front feedback of one of the key issues that come from public feedback in the media has been restrictions we 're introducing on retail and officers in industrial zones now the current study plan is and the respective offices is reasonably liberal in the sense that in a number of it and a number of the industrial zones of the city offices are permitted without any restraints and so that 's a result of in even before the earthquakes a proliferation of office development in suburban locations outside of commercial centers and what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under a different framework with the land use recovery plan and chapter six of the regional policy statement which sent quite clear direction in terms of industrial where is that be used primarily for that purpose rather than as a location for new commercial activity and similarly has wording specific to greenfield areas and notwithstanding that context and there 's been a mixed response there 's been a significant amount of support not into as a number but in terms of a voice from industry have concerns about the impacts that officers in retail can have on existing industrial activities what we call reverse sensitivity effects and there 's also been support from those that live close to or want to have accessibility to goods and services and commercial centers commercial centers generally speaking a more accessible public transport so some of those who have responded to see benefits of those activities going back into centers there has however been opposition there 's been concerns that what 's occurred in the last decade in industrial areas should be recognized and it 's late to be drawing a line and restricting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurred we 're in a position where post April 2016 there 's going to be provisions expire there 's expected if we would not take a restrictive approach to retail and office then there is a risk that a lot of those businesses will find locations close to or where they are now and will stay there in the over the longer term and that has a risk not just for the industry in those areas but also the center that we 're seeking to support and enhance and that policy direction is strong for the central city but also suburban centers that we ensure that they become the focal points of commercial activity that that 's just an enough shell that that issue I was going to talk through each of these bullet points and then come on to go back to each of these issues each of those so if you don 't mind pausing for a moment the second key issue is a industrial chapter there 's this an area proposed to be resigned known as the male 's male 's sites on the corner of memorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the language recovery plan as a priority greenfield area and also in was identified and proposed change one but there 's a lot of concern about the loss of the visual effects of development in that area but also visual in the sense that has got an interface with residential areas and is that a gateway to the city and there 's also concerns about traffic effects and the ability for the transport network to accommodate not just additional traffic but pressure for parking and the concern from residents in the oven head area reflects concerned about existing development that 's had those impacts nearby the further issue is that the next issues on touching on a all relate to concerns with there 's also concerned about the aquifers daily and yeah I 'm did you mention it no no but it 's quite a because it unconfined it the first yeah um as I know that there was a deal done with the developer do we have any details of what that is or because I 'm still unclear i know we we had some sort of agreement it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand what agreement we have with a developer which one I may also i 'm not aware of any agreement they can someone talk to michael taylor and find out because i think it 's pretty relevant to you know we 've had a group that 's a bit like the new brighton staff we we 've had agreements with developers over certain expected courses of action i think we need to understand what letters well i 'm not sure how far back you 're thinking this agreement relates to because the mouth site has changed hands at least twice that i 'm aware of in the last few years yeah so it was after the earthquake and i think it was a meeting in the victim service center of the South library and there was a number of desires around plan change one and a number of agreements were reached with developers improperly owners around the left you know expected levels of development in certain cases so i just think we need to understand what that was miley that it 's all changed but but we need to understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it in Duncan no madam chair I know nothing about that as we are talking about something that was done and PX please stop talking about it and we can and find out okay better be great thank you in terms of the other issues that I propose we discuss in the Sun and a similar manner to the Greenfield area on the corner of memorial wave and rusty road there 's a concern from rid of them residents who join a land that 's been identified adjacent to cook kaku x factory and Templeton concern about the impacts on the original immunity of traffic but also industrial buildings and close proximity we had a like the mail so we had a specific public meeting up with affected parties about that resigning and I 'll come on to discuss that shortly a third area another green field area between shanz road and main south road industrial area there 's a concern about the outline development plan that was expressed for consultation and I 'll come on to that again shortly just finally that the fifth key issue and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been sent to you is the future of the industrial areas in woolston and there 's a fruit a forum of manufacturers from Austin bromley industrial areas this Bennett support for every anything extending the area zoned industrial to provide more of a buffer between those industrial businesses and residential there 's also been a call for areas where the tanneries located where scaler up vacated and other sites for allowing allowing lighter industrial users but also a greater range of uses in response to the change but also a feeling that there 's a lot of vacant land in that area and to revitalize and get reuse of that land it 's appropriate to broaden out the users that are allowed there rather than limiting it to heavy industry and a third third group has thought that there 's provision made for residential and mixed-use developments in that area now I 'll come back to that and respect of how we 're dealing with it in the proposed plan but just touching on three issues to begin with the first of those talked about the restrictions on offices and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part by explaining that this direction in the lanius recovery plant it 's quite strong direction in terms of restrictions on those uses and it 's it 's really about not coming the inefficient yet the land and resources that we invest in commercial centers the risk being that if there 's not activity occurring in centers than the infrastructure that 's invested and such as public transports not fully utilized reverse reverse sensitivity which I talked about potential for investment and demand and centers being undermined by the lack of activity and so forth it 's we 're not we 're not restricting offices and industrial zones because there 's gun it because it 's going to lead to a shortage of industrial land this by no means a shorter turns are the way around no no it 's very much that in full car seems the forecast levels of employment and floor space required for offices and retail if we allow the dispersal that 's occurred going in correcting it centers because just I 'm not wishing to throw figures that you but wait had 400,000 square meters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the projections for office floor space 160,000 across the whole city to 2026 sorry how much 160,000 from win until winter until 2026 yeah and if you think of that it 's been fifty thousand square meters of office floor space approved from 2002 2009 outside centers so if you think of the existing office stock that exists outside synthesis we 're really in order to revitalize an attractant point2 centers we need to direct that hundred and sixty thousand to the central city and the central city won 't be able to regardless of that the central city won 't be R it won 't return to the size it was and we don 't believe it should but the risk is that we won 't how much has planned for the CBD because it 's certainly not 459 no there 's nothing no figures i believe on help but the forecast we 've assumed they had at least 100,000 comes back that 's it to the central city the hundred thousand is very much I figure that there 's not not a lot it 's not science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you for us because we actually want to know how much office space is being built in the CBD I mean and and we want to know actually how much is consented to be built and how much are they anticipating because and what their projections are based on because I actually haven 't seen that I 've you know if somebody 's asked me the other day about about projections and does that include light areas outside the frame or is this just or actually get us that the information about that within the complexity and the frame and then developments around because the developments down Victoria Street looked to me like they 're really taking off on us you know it 's just everyday patient to another building opening or another floor opening or another roof topping ceremony of the what I can provide you the projections which have been data for the purpose of the district plan so it 's not ccc no i 'd like to see ccd use buggers because they are the ones who are intimately involved in that and they are they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aren 't they yes so actually does does our industrial and commercial check now our commercial chapter does that apply in the CBD no no yes i 'm just getting it on the record there because residential was very clear we did ask if we could have a role and consulting on the residential chapter which was not accepted as the kind offer that it was made to be but I 'm I 'm a little concerned that we are designing the rest of the district plan based on our assessment of what might be happening rather than the people who are in charge what their actual figures are and what their actual assessment is based on what projections and how are those calculated I just want to have it I want to know how real it is because actually to be blunt I 'm a little bit sick of us being criticized publicly for you know in in the media for Deering to pro fear the CBD as if it is a little bit too much too late because I kind of would like people to know the reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the council and that we have no control over what is being planned for the CBD we at the stage don 't have access to the projections that they have and I think we need those on the table if we are going to make sense of the rest of the district plan we 'll do our best to get is for you you know this is not a criticism at all I 'm actually I believe I 'm actually speaking for the whole council but I believe I 'm speaking for large investment interests in the city who would actually like to know what this information is as well because what 's driving development down Victoria Street as something quite different from what 's supposed to be driving and debt in the CCDF area we do know since so before the earthquake there was 450,000 square meters of floor space for offices and the central city is that right it wasn 't solely officers can we get a performer also as offices in commercial break down right commercial and retail and the central city was defined by what the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I will need to go back and check this okay and so now just in terms of your best guess you 're looking at possibly a hundred thousand square meters of commercial and industrial within the four avenues just so I 'm comparing apples that 's what we 're assuming yes yes for office floor space yes is it just off two nights it 's office no no it 's just office not retail and can you tell me what you 're assuming full retail there what may much yeah I thought I think let 's get all the facts down on paper rather than you know trying to 0 as as modify industrial commercial etc and quietly expanding suburbs so that people have a preference for the central city but I don 't have an overall view of what is what it is that we 're aiming for in the central city one because we don 't have any control over it but to because we don 't know if there are 83 turns 42 finding the areas with them than the 4f central city is within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Victoria Street and two small surrounds and city center was actually a smaller area within the city center which is almost where the framers sitting around so yeah I want to compare apples with apples as well now I can sit there and end to be fear we don 't necessarily have that knowledge either so we 'll do our best to go back to crn ccdu and get that for you and then we 'll write up some hopefully easy reckoner it compares apples with apples and it would be incredibly useful and I think it will assist us not only in this process here but also in our conversation with the ministers before the plan goes out for notification yani like just from a visual point of view in from no scientific basis but it would be good time to send to the capacity that 's been built in Eddington and the capacity that 's been built at the airport so that you know we can kind of see because it might be that we just say well you know off Penningtons just an office park now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city and the airport and we 're going to have three central business districts and they 're going to be the airport Paddington in the CBD the yetis understand that because the airport meter is currently subject to a plan change which is yet to be heard and there are submissions and further submissions that have closed on that plan change so that 's a difficult one for us to give you because it will depend on what the outcome of that process you know those areas around it abandoned not part of it pledged the airport special zone but of the this whatever william harrangue man 's ear all of those we can do that the business party is yeah","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

New Zealand",2810,"really clear when we got the public notification that we were removing the public 's right to be notified because I think this is really at the heart of the debate we will have with government that they want us to have less notification less times people need consents and actually the community I know from vena you know and I would at least actually many of the contentious consents go through non notified and they would say where you get a big orange building appearing and a wetlands adjacent to a wetlands that it should be notified so I just think we need to I personally feel a little bit concerned that you 're removing some of the rights for people to be involved but I know that government are putting that pressure on and I know that the changes they 're making to the RMA have have meant that it 's harder for us to notify but I do you think you know I do i do worry that will end up with a situation where local communities are totally alienated from major developments and having any input @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every activity whether it 's notified or not the exception where it 's not to be notified as what is written and the activities where it applies and of course that 's just for restricted discretionary and discretionary activities but so the fact that um this is any activity listed in rule 15.4 3.1 so what page you send these sites so so you 've given belfast the commercial which i guess is a new shopping mall isn 't a new parade of shops so it 'll be a local center intended to only serve that new subdivision get up it 's a new but it 's a new more than that it 's banana it 's not a big mall development that 's a different one it 's a different one this is a this is a green filter is new to area so a future housing subdivision and women that a new commercial center proposed so a local center a local center so it 's the parade of shops that residents can walk to very well so basically with the effect of this rolling if they go if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no notification to the community if they propose the building of more than 100 square meters it 's subject to results consent to assess design but won 't be notified to the community so you could get like a big Bunnings or warehouse there the rules would preclude that so for a commercial local center it 's some visitors to be small scale shops a dairy coffee shop and so the height limits and the tivity lists preclude those activities from a large Bunnings from going in there for instance so what would be the worst case scenario for what could go there that the community might be really concerned what they would have no sale oh I 'd say that what those shots call them note that legal highs the negatives know like I 'm just trying to understand all seen some you know I 'm relaxed but if this means that people don 't have a right to have a say on things that drastically change what 's it 's expected that you know removes other my covers them in shade or whatever the night beacons never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first of all we need to look at the reading and it 's about a local center so there are standards for height and bulk and various other standards this this lack of notification or this this phrase here relates to only this one particular activity which is about urban design for buildings over a hundred square meters that there won 't be any notification of that specific activity but it still will be a conceit that 's right great that 's right and and notified and that and there 's a whole range of standards that if bridge would trigger a resource to send other reasons which and this this this cause is only consumer design so if there 's a breach of the high standard or a breach of the recession plane which protects sunlight to adjoining properties that will be subject to a separate rule which will trigger a resolves consent but not preclude notification of that that 's why it 's very specific under each activity where notification will not be required the matters of discretion are just urban design or that 's right but that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole chapter so that 's may not be in the package you 've got what we 've given you today is just the revisions that we 've made yet no I think it fit as 15.5 so that things like Radha general mattis 15-point 8.1 does that include all the sub courses in that chapter it would 15.8 point 1.4 will be included in those general matters of discretion the general methods of a description cover whole range of design measures about how our development fits into its context how it relates to the immediately surrounding properties covers even green buildings and the degree to which there is environmentally sustainable design but 15.8 point 1.4 is is only one part of that bill does it but it is effectively something that would come under that general matter of discretion so access parking and servicing that would be an area that you remove you basically remove the notification is that how I read this everybody 's reading it when you roll out this is this is about the visual impacts of car parking for instance and the transport chapter still has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effectively means that traffic affects of the of a retail use over 250 square meters is still considered separately you something to bear in mind is this is one of a number of rules that needs to be complied with and any other rule that 's not complied with potentially will warrant notification of that application so for instance that triggers the rule for a integrated transport assessment and it could well be the case that it 's based on that non-compliance that it should be notified but and respected this non-compliance is limited to design and and the visual aspects of development so hence in respect to that clause about car parking it 's about the visual effects of car parking amongst other messes and it 's designed so there 's a wider assessment that 's considered for the transport chapter looking at the traffic effects of development the next was effects of arcuate what a cool community infrastructure of large developments and in this context it 's public transport it 's open space as well as community facilities and the impacts of these larger developments in their commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn to page 16 16 to begin with at the bottom of page 16 there 's a new rule introduced and this is just in the context of the commercial corazon but it also applies in the commercial friendzone any building extension to a building or redevelopment involving more than 4,000 square metres of gross leasable floor area requires consent and an assessment is required of the effects that development has on community infrastructure now the trigger of 4,000 is based on a trigger in the current study plan which relates to the layout of a development and range of matters in terms of the impacts that development has now if I can turn to page 125 125 on that page your funds at the top at the top of 125 and ours text is the matters that will be assessed when an application comes forward based on that non-compliance with that rule so any development over 4,000 square meters whether it 's an addition or or new building would need to consider and demonstrate whether the extent to which the development will have adverse effects on a community infrastructure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government act and there 's defined as stated here it 's includes but not limited to community facilities open space and public transport and the effects on as you use availability quality of offer but also whether the development provides the infrastructure to meet existing and future demand having regard to a range of matters there so we 've proposed this approach that triggers the need for resource consent to enable us to assess the effects of each individual ditch development over for 4000 square meters to consider these matters rather than an approach of putting standards in the plan which would require they say for a 4000 square meter development we require 1,000 square meters public space that a footy of that approaches we don 't have an understanding of how much space is required or how it relates to other spaces within that center so from from a planning perspective it 's it leaves us greater scope to be able to assess the effects and what provision is made on a case-by-case basis rather than applying a standard which that doesn 't necessarily fit with all scales all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that honey would you require an outline development plan but is that one way that you could get some certainty because I do think there 's a need for certainty light because what will happen is I 'll apply for reasons to conceive and I 'll say well there 's a few bus stops up the road I 'm like like record in for example oh you 've already got a bus stop on the main road so we don 't need to provide for and they 'll probably get a resource consent because most get you know not notified non-compliant get granted so I just kind of don 't want you know ways for them to get out of this requirement so how can we be more explicit that it is actually a requirement that a set amount of something comes back because there 's a real need well that is what any rule in the district plan has to deal with an effect so if there isn 't a fit then yes then then we can trigger this rule to to determine what that is and what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bus stops on that road with an easy walk of all vicinity and it 's decided that this is not creating an additional effect and then that would suffice doesn 't because you don 't get that integrated land use plan that that makes sense or his comprehension what you get is ever-increasing retail stroke that that that just basically turns its back to things that people need to service it it 's what I 've seen at history based on an effete if there is increasing need and the effect is that one bus stop is not sufficient than youth another bus stop might be required or whatever it is that it 's being assist for and community facilities open space or public transpo so like the idea that we have overseas like you go to Malaysia or Thailand and you go you take a bus and you end up under the mall you just get up an elevator and you in a mall be really interesting to know like what planning thanks to they put in place to ensure that you get integrated development because you know I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to the developer they 'll hire expensive lawyers expensive experts that will argue you know till they 're blue in the face that they don 't to do it because there 's a library across the road even though there 's you know five major lanes of traffic going through so there 's no requirement and they get around it I don 't want them getting around it I think the thing is that though we have to work within the resource management age and while there might be other mechanisms or methods that are able to be used it will depend on what mechanisms they used overseas they don 't have the Resource Management Act all of our decisions have to be a fit space and so that 's what I 'm telling you if there is shown to be a need that creates an adverse effect then we can bring this role in to plan perhaps require them to have contribute towards further community facilities open space or public transport but if it can be shown that there isn 't the need for it then then no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debate that we had around you know what 's happened at recognize you know the the ever-increasing expansion of of that mall that the the huge clustering of people in that environment on a daily basis the large number of people who use public transport to get there and they they really stand in the way of our capacity to deliver truly effective direct access to them all from from the bus and ride a bus interchange you know it 's just you know if anyone had designed an ideal outcome from the outset when the when the mall was originally being expanded towards record and road they would have said you 've got to have a direct entry on riccarton road through a bus exchange you know it would have been obvious but the rules aren 't obvious and I mean you 've come back and you see that 's got to be a fixed based under the resource management egg but how the hell isn 't that an effect it isn 't it is an effect as I 've said before though these rules cannot be retrospective as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps now under these new rules yes we have various opportunity including the urban design rules to require that to happen but Rick tan mall is in place so far it hasn 't come in for yet another consent for increase in size if it does before these rules are made operative then we only have the existing rules to go by would you like to move about a memo my recollection of that my recollection of the discussion at the last workshop was that and you suggested there should be consideration of an option of rule that says once a mall gets to a particular size or goes above a particular size there 's a requirement for an outline development plan before consenting any further development and that as part of that outline development plan requirement the applicant would have to show you how things like public transport are going to be integrated with the development I don 't think I use the words outlined development plan because I know you know some kind of master plan yeah so so that that was raised as as an option that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deciding what are the most appropriate provisions and the plan which is exactly what we 're doing now it has that been further considered for the purposes of this chapter I don 't know certainly that this this what I 've before is one an option obviously we can add to it by requiring an outline development plan if development exceeds or a master plan of development exceeds a certain threshold and or if there 's development of a large scale such as over 4,000 square meters so I 'm open to adding that to this like so if you think about it so you get four thousand square meters and you go right so if you want to have a big mall and you know you 've you now have a requirement if you want to go to five thousand square meters The Temper center of that space will be Vista but other reserves stuff that we do you know where they give a contribution and it goes into addressing the issue so it might be a percentage of that land area that would be my preference that goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean that 's basically what what what are

New Zealand",2688,I met him here just before we start in front treat that was a slide that was presented to you and the briefings and also at every public meeting now I recognize you 've had a lot of information to take in and we didn 't specifically focus just on New Brighton but at least if I can just see that with you and you can keep it as a reference to refer to when we go through the commercial chapter that 's correct so that slide has been presented to you and to edit republic MTG to date so i 'll pass now to mark to continue and hopefully finish the commercial revisions shortly just briefly on the diagram the elevations on the top half showed the existing city city plan height limits and the bottom half show the proposed height limits to interpret it you need also the table summarizing the hierarchy and where we 're centers fall in the hierarchy but I 'm happy to answer any questions afterwards about this or now in more detail if you wish did you point out we 're in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new brighton as you 're aware has hide limits at 30 meters and 20 meters in the currency plan and based on its category as a neighborhood center the hive limits 12 and 8 meters but as i said earlier will go out and consults on that matter and that will be in conjunction with consultation on the extent of the zone area of new brighton center and other measures around scale so new brighton features in the middle of roughly in the middle of both of those and diagrams yeah yeah the large neighborhood and small neighborhood are identical so sorry on these lines you 'll see these there are bars that relate to New Brighton new verizon has a large neighborhood center sits here relative to this intra-city at one end and small local parades and shops that the other just if I could go back to the chapter the just referring to the amendments that have been made the next changes relate to objective one and quite rightly the title previously of their objective was recovery of commercial activities and centers but it wasn 't only about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will go for a phase of recovery but it we need to look beyond that and so there 's some changes of made to the title of the objective to call it focus of commercial activity which is about where we focus that activity sorry that 's on page three of the chapter and just in that set on that same theme objective one tools d I 've added the words there in orange so it reads supports the recovery in the short to medium term and enhances vitality and the amenity of centers to recognize that we want to enhance vitality and immunity regardless of time frames but recovery is seen as a short to medium-term process turning to policy five which is on page six one of the key issues raised was the what 's occurred aidan field in Northwood us sorry we 're just doing the amendments to the commercial chapter and then we 'll move on to the industrial chapter and the policy five which relates to local centers in Greenfield residential areas as we found an avin field in Northwood there 's not been commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reword the policy to strengthen it and state that those areas identified for commercial activity shall be developed and used for primarily commercial activity priva the previous leawood policy didn 't go that far and only related to areas that would get zoned this policy now relates to both existing zoned areas as well as future greenfield areas that are yet to be reserved moving on to 48 which is on page 7 there was discussion about principles of environmentally sustainable design and what I 'm proposing to do is come to you on the workshop that 's being organized how torn urban design for that forum of a circulator before then a paper summarizing options in terms of rules to consider for green buildings but in the interim will change the wording of the clause 8 which did read briefly principles of environmentally sustainable design and changed it to incorporating principles of environmentally sustainable designed to recognize that it should be incorporated in order to be well designed so what many feedback on that yep no mention of you at school water requirements is it somewhere else energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can make that more explicit it 's it 's it 's under the heading of water conservation design one yeah we can we can integrate something around it I think that would be quite the customers if you Joshua the big impact on their infrastructure and the feet of the design wash it is the elapse eat so takes the stress off insistence now not so um with the suburban master Cena p and plans it 's still right from what i read heat read it 's like they 're still dependent on the on something like a loop or two it actually have any real ability to a foot and foot enforce will require changes so one of the 100 the handouts this morning is a paper work at just to cited page which summarizes the rules that come through and sit below the policy to give effect to those master plans which give some teeth to the actions and the master plans that we 're identified as requiring an implementation for the city for the district plan there 's a whole range of other actions that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come from the district plan review because obviously the district plans just one tool but that handout that you 've got summarizes the rules which are the teeth that you 're quite right the suburban scene to master plans of January under the local government act they 're not stitched true plans and we there are changes needed to zones or rules that can be done through the district plan we 're there is money to be invested into these areas that would have to be done through the annual plan process and then there are other methods as well so the suburban seemed to master plans themselves are not statutory well it does because it includes as it shows on those two pages the page dot right varus in and amendments to the plan that had been made to achieve what 's requested and the suburban Sinta master plans that 's what 's that 's what 's listed here on this page and it 's just occurred to me there that there 's not a comprehensive list for instance littles in the community they 're sort build-up of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to retain that clean frontage and that 's a generic principle that applies to all centers so it 's not come from the table but there 's other changes that have come about because partly because it master plans um if I could just move on to some of the amendments that have been made to the rules which reflects the feedback and there 's five points i wish to briefly cover mm-hmm one of those was you 'll note there was in the earlier draft provision made for the breach of rules for this say an office activity that wanted to locate at ground floor level rather than being required to locate above ground floor level and an example given by councillor Johansson was a concern raised was the potential for a bar to have adverse impact surface not if it 's allowed to breach the standards in the plan and a lot of the discussion we had about the temporary becoming the permanent and the potential for adverse consequences of allowing for temporary breach of the rules with since taken those provisions out of the draft because they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure that if there is a breach of a standard that we 're comfortable that the effects can be addressed so that that temporary that breach for overall is for a temperate periods essentially now absent from this chapter and the second point is exceptions for an urban design assessment now after oh um I 'll refer to the page numbers for these next bullet points but these five bullet points sum up the amendments made to the chapter so the temporary staff like we 're just sorry I just kind of you 're removing the provision for the breach of roles or you 're putting them and I 'm removing the ability to breach the rules so no temporary so the issue that we 've legally given concede to a whole bunch of temporary activities are still valid last all valves and they all expire in a 4 2016 but what that earlier that previous draft that you saw last week had a provision additional to that which allowed for someone an activity that 's per message from the commercial center that profession I 'd put folder and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the high standard breach of a standard that requires for instance offices to be background above ground floor and I 've since removed that provision that enabled a temporary breach of standards because it could lead to the first outcomes so just so I 'm clear so like we 're basically when we notify will be telling people the people that have currently have got temporary concedes they will have to reapply the 4 2016 for a resource conceived with the new district plan revisions that 's right and there 'll be no no automatic granting of conceits or there 'll be a public process to go through the quays up your beads there 'll be a consenting process to go through a decision made for each of those consensus as to whether it 's notified or not and the underlying zoning of where those two free activities that currently know what will it be there 's been in the case of cafe metro we 've proposed a commercial zoning for that property given the permanence of that use but that 's an exception to the rule and generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's a temporary consent on the basis that those temporary consensus only temporary and unless resource consents since been granted for a permanent use of that site for commercial activity it 's not appropriate in our view to create any consideration for the consents process so have we got to lift up the exceptions you were given this morning this list of temper activities and there 's also a memo to go with it from myself that gives a bit of a summary and there 's also a met to show where they all are that was lived on your desk this morning yeah just to just put your mind at ease cafe metro is the only site where we 've changed the zoning height of a rubles consenting grounded for a temporary activity on a permanent basis yeah sorry can you use your microphone piece I saw in the and the consent sir I 'm just struggling to go like summer okay I found it um so there was some quite significant changes so like for example under for conditioner consent within three months of data we will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the character nature beauty is maintained and future changes so i don 't know if that 's happened or just been removed there 's been a restriction on the type of activities that could establish again that seems to be have removed signage shall be contained that 's that 's going to be reviewed this car parking issues n skipping issues i I don 't how much have the conditions that that went with it consent being it being changed their conduct sort of like scarlet you know 100 you know 180-degree turnaround or is it you know the kind i think i 've been percent or the conditions of the results consent itself don 't change as a consequence of these new rules but the rules to enable development within the scope of what the commercial local zone provides for which is broader than what the resource consent provides for having said that the resource consent is how there 's a requirement to comply still with the resource consent conditions if at the activity they want to do on the side it 's going to comply with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the resource consent that I 've got and then their activity is a metal activity under the plan yeah the alternative approaches that we continue to zone that land in question as residential whilst recognising that a resource consent has been granted for a commercial activity which is likely to remain on a permanent basis and unlikely to return to residential use and that 's about a point and we can go away and consider that further but currently any consent would be assists against the operative plan so it 's not assist against these rules that we 're looking at today right-ho carry on just on exceptions for urban design assessment just using an if I could refer you to page 9 of the chapter this text and orange on page 9 and there 's a series of exceptions when a requirement for a source consent for an assessment of urban design is not required based on these exceptions firstly where a new building an addition to building is not visible from a public publicly accessible space and publicly accessible space should be highlighted green because we 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site is less than 6 meters excluding corner sites or where the developments limited to repairs maintenance seismic fire handle axis building code upgrades and then that wording reflects what was coming from a plan change led by council up until this district plan plan review commencing plan change 56 which was subject to a submissions process and it 's to recognize that not all development should be subject to an urban design assessment if it 's a not visible to the general public and B if it 's those other conditions there in terms of the width of the site it 's obviously not it 's a narrow site then it 's not going to have a significant bearing on the overall appearance of a frontage so there 's there 's those exceptions introduced moving on to page 70 using page 76 as an example on that page there there 's a just an example of where we 've introduced a non notification clause so in this case in these belfast which is a reasoning a new commercial local center proposed and a greenfield residential area we 're introducing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requirement if there 's a resource consent required on design grounds that shouldn 't be notified there 's not considered to be affected persons and counsel wishes to make that assessment without the developer have having to pay additional costs for notification or a hearing and that 's to address one of the issues that has been raised for consultation that introducing urban design controls will have greater costs and in this respect by having an on notification applause that reduces the potential cost of a resource consent,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

New Zealand",3748,"so can you will find the industrial commercial chapter revisions at the table again and the chapter with your orange and it yep right far away right thank you again it 's good to be back um I 'm going to just go for it oh yeah how are you much better thank you kids there 's four points I want to make in response to issues raised last week on the objectives and policies and then I 'll talk you through five different points which relates to the rules and when I discussed those five points and respect for the rules I 'll address the point counselor Johansson made about the large-scale development and its impacts on community infrastructure the first point raised last time was the under clarity in the chapter around the differences between key activity centers district centres neighborhood centers and really ensuring consistency and and them that 's reflected in some amendments to objective one the last part of objective one the reference to while giving primacy to the central city followed by district centres neighborhood centers identified as key to these centers now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page four and in there what we 've done is separated out neighborhood centers that are key activity centers from other neighborhood centers and so the attend what we 're doing there is distilled distinguishing those neighborhood centers that are just ok I seized from those that aren 't and just a third point is and respect of addressing that issue is policy one cause see we 've added text to recognize that we 're prioritizing support for neighborhood centers defined as key activity centers and so those three amendments sick to just provide some clarity around that what 's the criteria read to you and bring into to put some sin que se que AC like you brighten as a neighborhood center rather than a district one yeah we compared will say you 've got in the other area escape for example and there 's a number of factors we consider the amount of retail floor space we 've had in the last six months surveys done of all the commercial centers across the city so we 've got up to date information about how how much floor space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's also their accessibility by public transport the size of the center in terms of land area there 's another factor as is the catchment that serves and whilst catchments are strictly defined generally speaking a small it has a smaller catchment than a larger center and so taking those factors into account we 've allocated different centers to those categories of districts and they were both we 've allocated kick to the dissenters to those categories of district and neighborhood centers so just to take one strand of that in terms of retail floor space new pricing according to our service has 20,000 square meters of retail floor space and you compare that with escapes us which each 30 thousands now that trigger of when does the neighborhood seem to become a district Center we need to monitor that on an ongoing basis in the future and revisit that but at the moment in our view new pricing is performing isn 't serving that sub regional function that 's that you tend to see with the likes of cricket and hornby which to attract people from much further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not diminishing its its role and it 's still a fundamental point seven those eastern suburbs but we need to look at as part of the master plan and the district plan review over the coming months the size of that existing center in terms of land area because if you have two large land area and there 's not enough demand for floor space within that land area then you tend to dilute the concentration of where that retail floor space is located and and there 's an argument to say that if you strengthen and focus on a cool area then you can achieve a better outcome but that 's something we need to look at more closely over the next few months and so new partners being the zoning of New Brighton as being reviewed as part of phase two so if it shrinks in order to make it work better this has an implication for its its kind of status it doesn 't change its role as a key activity center which we give primacy to that 's established in the lanius recovery plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in the hierarchy and even if it were to reduce a land area that say in my mind it would still function as a neighborhood center it could drop in the hierarchy in order to function better you know more compact DVD that the risk of putting it into district centre categories is that it 's not going to perform that function and it 's potentially the scale of development we allow in a district centre which is up to 20 metre twenty meters high build rooms is not necessarily appropriate in that context so the place that has in the hierarchy has a bearing on the scale of development we allow on that Center so taking a height for instance we allow up to 20 meter tall buildings and district centres whereas in the neighborhood census we only allowed 12 meters and if you if you put a 20 metre tall building up against the reason you want to face arguably that there 's the need to look at address that but 20 meters story are 20 meter high buildings and your boss and I odd viewers potentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the moment that 's right but so what happens then if if there 's a flip over and the area does boom and we get that sort of development and then maybe a few sizable sort of buildings and sister there does is there the scope for a shift from one to the other oh it 's always escape from plan change this is what plan changes allow for but at the moment this is what 's being proposed in the draft plan new Prussian already has that already had it already yes the world that I couldn 't go to 20 meters along marine prey so I 'm just wondering why we why we are downgrading it and rather than leaving of where it is because there 's a move of what to try and sort of boost its fortunes and and if we 're putting this sort of a proposal force for it may restrict its ability to me will they take away the zoning that allows them to build 220 meters along marine parade the proposed provisions we 've got on this chapter would reduce the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan has two different height limits and near Brighton the thirty meter height limit on a 20-metre height limit and to be perfectly honest the central city would the high limit in some areas of the central city is 28 meters so yet you look at the hierarchy enters of hydrogen scale of buildings and the central city would be dwarfed potentially plan change that went through an under pendant commissioner I remember the hearing as well i mean i can 't say that i was excited about the plan change but i think it 's inappropriate to make a plan change through this district plan review process and not tell people that 's what we 're doing but this is what we have been out with the public telling them about we 've all there wasn 't a meeting a new brighton I mean you know that I mean the truth is is that I mean this is news to me I actually hadn 't realized until David asked that question that this reduces the height limit entitlement and you brighten I don 't necessarily disagree with the outcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not sure do the people when you bright and know that this is part of the well okay in our meetings that we cared that people have come to we had made this obvious there have also been information sheets and as I say it 's been up on the website or thori abilities we 've been briefed as well yes we 've been to the workshop this is news to me that you 're reducing the height limit a new brighton i just well it 's not new in the drafts that have been coming no i understand that but unless you actually say this means this will reduce the height limit a new brighton then how on earth would reading all of this have brought that to my attention it has been made explicit i think it is okay it hasn 't been made explicit that 's what 's coming out so we 've been a private plan change that 's gone through and approved all us and now we are through the district plan just walking this is the process of a district plan review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and best practice just as well i understand it but there was I was inst the change so you know I 'm speaking against the personal position that I adopted I am not taking a position on the height limit I am merely mentioning that in in any legal scenes you really open yourself up to review if you don 't tell people specifically explicit interment it would yes a lead the the the plan change a new brighton it was contrary submissions on it but it was decided to actually make a change to that without telling the community specifically that this will change that process i mean if the two council are sitting around the table and the mayor who used to represent the area didn 't understand that from any of the briefings that we 've had I 'm sure that most people on you brighten have no idea that that 's the change yani it is a really important point that you 're raising and actually this isn 't the only area that 's getting change mine is setting and addington for example there 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the district plan will actually change so I think it would be really useful for us to have a list of the changes the date in which they came in and what effectively this this district clean does to those more recent you know over the last 15 years 80 or 90 plan changes that have come to on the operative plane in these in places these do go against okay so what we need is a list of the plan changes that have come on in recent times that are being changed by the steep ER in the rationale for change I don 't think I can I would just give you all of them because i 'm not sure what is meet by recent times because some that may have gone through ten years ago may also you know know that you verizon one miles 10 years ago give an example like keen away farms yes um so they had a plan change there 's a whole bunch of conditions things that were supposed to happen there a lot of those things actually haven 't been done yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the district plan review is going to come and remove all the requirements for traffic intersection upgrades developers to certain things that they were supposed to do as per the plan change I think local community in the community board are going to be incredibly upset we will to do list of all of the plan change and how its amended them and I can 't don 't think you can assume that we 're changing everything that has you don 't French oh no no no we 're not all we really wants to go we don 't want to know like every single plan change that 's either happen to the district plan what we want to know is what specific plan changes that have happened and in recent time so you saw I don 't mind if you go back X number of years but but what we want to get a flavor of is what private plane changes that have been through a process or what you know that are being changed by this I 'm ever do yeah yeah editing turned around the race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention with a little bit unclear about so that they may have been really recently in changing we are happy to do their end up there is absolutely no intention to try and hide information from the public the difficulty is knowing is having the there is so much information and this is the hairiness you know this is the this is the reality of dealing with such a major set of changes in such a truncated period we wouldn 't normally do the scale of plan change all at once I mean we 're totally up for putting the if a ton to get this right but i have to say that is news to me that we have by definition of an area reduce the entitlement around around what was a controversial plan change i 'm sure people would want to make submissions on it i should add that new brighton i mentioned it before the extent of the zoned areas being dealt with as part of phase two the reason we haven 't dealt the extent of the zoned area in your bhajan as part of phase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further consultation planned over the coming months to invite feedback on how large the center should be and in that same conversation with the public weekend we can ask the question about Heights and other measures so there 's not going forward to address this so this isn 't changing the height restrictions on your browser what I 'm saying is we can work in a park we can put me right into the one side and consult further on the height limit amongst other things as part of wider consultation on but I 've been asking for some time why and you brightens recognizes as a key activity center in the regional policy statement but it comes to us it 's a neighborhood center in it was never you know and this we dug deeper that was never explained why they were seen the implication I agree with Clement Ollie you know the land use recovery plan identified as a key activity center this is new to me where we are now redefining so the k acs into district and neighborhood there was never never any well maybe i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acs end of story well no there 's always been a difference between what is listed as a KAC at a regional level and then how that 's determined at a district level the KA sees have a certain function under the under the regional policy statement all we 're doing here now is ensuring that functions open above KAC functions are recognized on how large they are i would disagree actually and maybe this is a point for submission later on that that new brighton is enabled i consider it more of a district KAC my opinion but having to substantiate it later but and maybe that gets around some of these other issues of density and i bet but it 's not seasonally i think it should be a regional KAC is Marcis there is further discussion going on through the suburban seem to master plan and maybe of people aware of of what what the proposal is that there would be submissions there to say well we which ships out of some of these other considerations and and leaves it there Mike might consume probably sub stems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action going starting and evolving and that that the people out there I want him to take ownership of the area themselves and promote investment and private and public to actually left the place up again so I would be concerned if we are sort of keeping it in a lower region and there 's a lot of work going on to lift it up that will then got to go through another process to actually do a plan change to shift it from one to the other and say if I fear the meeting out there is required we 're happy to do that because I think what this is suggesting is certainly not to undermine the area it 's to try again if the vibrancy that it used to have but there is currently no 20 or 30 meter building out there and there you know that will depend on market market actions but the deal like that open and allow for development to a cure in a in a uncontained way so that it doesn 't create the vibrancy and this is this is what the issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public conversation about it that enables people to ever say you know and that 's the trouble so so can I get it clear does this plan that we have in front of us the amendment that we have in front of us reduce the height limits and the new brighton it does but as I indicated before proposing that that 's parked and put taken out of the chapter to deal with at a future date as designed area yeah because without discussions on the suburban center master plan and we can be part of those discussions and bring these proposed change rules to that community again I think it would be really worthwhile I mean if you had the time to do it to spend a bit of time with new brighton i mean just just as a separate one I mean I did kind of seemed a notes through about this a few weeks ago but the holding one out at Avondale school really didn 't because all the other key activity centers had a key activity center one and they saw themselves as a key activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be good if that could be done we can do that it just means though that those rules won 't come through to you until the second group of check yes no that 's fine i think that it solves it does partner show you and I mean you 've already set which side of the debate i 'm on i agree that we need to sort of intensify the focus of that little suburban part of it right up against the the for shal you know it needs to come forward it 's way too long there 's just too much development space in there but there are there 's these enormous possibility about what could round there and I don 't think that taking away the existing height limits because there were the higher height limits already applied straight down the right no no no straight down the sea view road and it was the extension out and to marine parade that caused the controversy in the community so yes that 's great so thanks Mary may have another meeting out there excellent statute sorry suburban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah I know but but but you brightens actually working on something a little bit more expensive than a suburban master plan they 're not doing the main street now they 're actually looking out a little bit broader and i think that 's that 's actually how new brighton is going to come alive I think we 've got a wonderful opportunity out there and I don 't want it I don 't want to ruin it by by by having you know multi-story buildings on the front and pretending the with the gold coast but when I don 't know that we 'll ever well I suppose climate change could possibly give us the give us the heat that that one would compare on the on the gold coast but the point that I 'm making is that we 've got to leave options open and we 've got to have an open conversation about there and actually building some of the apartment ideas because we have got to get people living a new brush and that 's the that 's the key and so ft if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues around the flood risk coming from the river so there 's this huge challenge in issues but everyone is up for the conversation about how you make it happen so I mean that was that was a good intervention david and thank you for drawing it to our attention and thank you for agreeing to go out and see them right should we should we stop for lunch and we 'll come back because it 's it 's after 12 now and we 'll come back at one o 'clock we 'll get focused on the draft commercial chapter conclude that and then we 'll out on the industrial chapter hopefully if we can get through that we can complete the land contamination chapter on the time available and if not that will just simply roll over to the next state yep okay thank you very much","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

New Zealand",3249,so it would be useful if the discussion that you described could take place in that week that ends the sixth of June sometime right so when 's the 15 days actually up I think it 's about the Tuesday right okay so so the minister 's comments will be available by the in years yeah so so actually yes that would be friday the sixth of June would be an ideal day for the meeting but that means that you guys have to work really hard to make sure that you can advise us on there on there okay we were going to do our work on because we won 't get well it depends on when if they can give us a draft copy before I give us the final copy because otherwise we were going to work on them between Friday the sixth of June and in the twelfth and thirteenth of june two you 'll actually have them on Tuesday well that would be the hope no no but the date will be scheduled and the in the legislation them on the Tuesday is that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that we were challenged by the by the longer time frame and of course you 're working with those officials all the time so they know what you 're proposing and they will have pretty much what we 're going to forward to them well and truly and time yes yonni I 'm just um they 're obviously needs to be some meetings with the ministers before this as well like who who were pointing to the hearings been or who they are pointing to the hearings panel would be something but I think we 've mutually have to discuss and agree on so are there any other it 's not a requirement the requirement is that they have to consult with us over the appointments so so we know we likely to get the order in council certainty I don 't know I don 't know so it 's kind of one of it all this because but the staff don 't know there either I know so does anyone know because it seems like we 're we 're kind of working to a process that hasn 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed I think I 've told you this before it 's not going to be in a greed process that 's going to an order and council process the tombs of which we have agreed the only thing that 's changed is the timer we don 't know finally I mean I 'm you know we 've had it confirmed that it 's the 28th of June for the public notification but that but that 's the date that we 're told is going into an order in council we haven 't seen you and that we 've agreed the terms of the order and council right so do we have can you just like do we have a list of what those tombs are I have seen a draft order on council yes end and so have you I believe no I hadn 't seen my thought on council but look um I mean all I was trying to say is that I think this is possibly other what we 're sorry I can get I can get that for you that just the basic terms of it I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting with the smaller group to agree what those terms would be so yeah I I think it 's fair to say there in that in fact what little councillors haven 't seen actually seen the tombs and that might would assist some care but we haven 't seen the tombs at you go we agreed the terms at a meeting it 's a no it 's a different things so what 's the cost year we agreed as a council certain things and what ended up in Akashi r was different well not a lot different i 've actually been through the two now so yeah we that need to understand us you know just in writing just a very simple here 's the terms that council has agreed to yep yep agent in it and then I think what all I was trying to understand is it would seem to me that the appointment of the hearings panel is also really critical and so I just wondered whether it was an opportunity for early engagement with the minister 's over the constitution of that hearings bill because if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list of names that we would be that would be acceptable to us behave we have you we 're here oh that 's come to us no no we have shared with the minister 's I believe a list of potential nominees for the hearings panel however it 's not our decision who will be appointed to those hearing panel 's it will be up to the ministers who likes a window where he has councils see that list well it 's not as it 's not a question of seeing the list it 's a question of the final determination will be we will be consulted about who is going to be appointed but what if we 're providing a list of nominees that where it find acceptable that surely should come from us as a well it did I did sign it off but I can 't remember the process of notification to other councilors so I didn 't circulate the list deliberately because there are people on that list who will not be appointed and it actually wasn 't appropriate that the list was circulated but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the top of my head what the process was there 's also no understanding of the availability of those individuals either sorry it was the group with carter act that signed it up so but i 'm happy to come back and talk to people about that once i have a summary of the of the process that was agreed I just haven 't come prepared to discuss it I agree with Jamie I 'm just getting increasingly concerned that this is like the central city stuff we 're going to spend all this time doing things that basically just get disregarded and you get a new plan that comes in and we 've wasted all that time because central government have very clear idea ideas about what they want and who they want and we 're just basically going through except that the hearings panel will be established and it will make its decisions under the resource management so it is not a political decision that they will be making so it is not it is not like the gut that the government can simply make a change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceeds understand but yes you are quite right the minister could intervene post the process if he wasn 't happy and changed the Landry 's recovery plan is recovery plan like the cricket thing at Hagley oval because of the land use recovery plan having the resource management act has to give effect to that it 's not the land use recovery plan it was in the central city recovery plan no but like the yent the land use recovery plan the plan review that we 're doing has to give effect to the way nice recruitment the the decision maker and the plan process can 't make it to such a mess and confess that question it 's just that 's my point and when you look at the objectives reducing consenting and notification requirements addressing standards relating to urban design that could negatively impact on recovery providing for existing industrial activities and business zones there 's some pretty wide scope I think the thing to remember here is this is not a recovery plan we 're talking about this is a district plan under the Resource Management Act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the Resource Management Act so it is open to submissions and further submissions in an independent panel to make decisions it 's not up to the minister to make decisions albeit the minister still has the powers of the syrah act until April 2016 exactly the Landry 's recovery plan than he can do that to me own to me the committee meeting to conform adoption of this one chatters there is a px or open to public and that hasn 't been decided yet which one until an me on the first page and the 12th of mercy before you know we commit your council adopt face one chapters to forward to minister to comments concern whether the public a community have opportunity to have comment because this is a meeting is not a workshop that 's correct but I think you need to be careful about whether you take a series of deputations or not to that meeting given that it 's now process of the council to decide what it 's going to put in its notified into its notified chapters it already has been open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then it 's open to the formal statutory process of submissions and further submissions producer the even community feedback with their comments however maybe some comments you know we are scepter maybe some comments is not acceptable this kind of situation whether a community of a pair still have a kind of eligible to have their comments or concerns absolutely but the time to raise them would be in the formal statutory process under submissions and further submissions there is then the formal process to make comment on the plane I think to understand that it is going to change who the submissions and further submissions process this plan even though you might think you 've taken on board all of the public 's comments to the point of notification it will still change through submissions and further submissions process so the public to be there need to put in formal submissions or further submissions that 's how they stay amongst the the formal process it can I mean de is after the 28 at you am i right that 's correct there 's a formal public notification yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet but that 's what we understand by the one crucial issue is the community they prefer in the early stage of the draft you know the kind of discipline review document if they have their comments you know whether before we thought this chart to learn Minister they can take a whiff taken away for instant neither northern part of the victim role you know living one to change it to the equivalent davines the ministers have known how to make a change to the our plan they make their comments to us and we have to consider their governments but my concerns before we submit it to minister yeah comander we take away the way yeah yeah but whether we take away or not yes we can we can okay thank you a new statistics what this process is about right now we are bringing the draft chapters to you for you to consider changes on the basis of the feedback you 've heard from the community I 'm sure they will be robust debate when we get to the residential chapter but if there will be offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 for me I 'm sure their counselor oh this is available yet this afternoon all is perform a night regarding to the gestation chapter the second of May is up via as the day that you have an entire day apart from one and a half hours for an urban design briefing the entire day to discuss the residential draft chapter yeah the deputy mere will be cheering that meeting because I will not be here and and she is actually relishing the opportunity of getting to the residential chapter I think the residential chapter is in for a significant change this before before it 's referred to ministers yes so so we 're going on to the revisions that were made to the strategic directions chapter here if you can find those to pay those two documents in front of you sorry just a review to the chapters that are in front of the papers there 's a page document look okay do page document that 's here to drive strategic directions chapter which is the amendments in orange and then again a two-page document it 's titled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tip for me I find the magnitude no I 'm just completely loved I don 't know strategic directions you yeah that 's why not and also busy table that goes with a thick table right okay sorry yeah everybody has those I just go through them and the first point dear relating to the relationship between severances and the central city is really just a confirmation of our standing of the comments that we took away which was that no amendments were being proposed at this stage but the meta may be taken up directly with the minister moving on the into the next the two which are relate to tempe recovery activities and first just clarification in terms of the need to manage the situation at the april the 2016 cutoff date the the common thea that the chapter as it currently stands provides the opportunity for a granting of extensions of time in appropriate circumstances but also just to note that as part of the stage to the review its proposed that we look further as to whether provisions need to be uncertainties and citizen to specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapter for certain types of team pre recovery activities but as I say that 's proposed to be dealt with at stage two in the second issue that was released raised in terms of temporary activities or was in terms of the fix on neighboring residents and the common fear that notes that I am sorry and also the potential loss of housing and so the note there is that the provision that 's currently in the strategic directions chapter does include as one of the considerations loss of housing and in terms of the impact on residential amenities we 've recommended a addition so on the copy of page 20 at the top you 'll see on policy three point six point one point for c1 is some additional learning and the right chip than myself yep in c1 we 've had a residential amenity to that clause so the if we go to page 20 the numbers are at the bottom there to the very top you 'll see some reading and orange which is residential amenity and on the surrounding community so just just to highlight that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a chemistry raised about needing to recognize the payback from sustainable design for future generations and so the recommendation is that we make an addition to the discussion of the issue so on the top of page 9 you 'll see at the very top via the very top additional reading orange an additional point to ensure that the issue recognizes that payback and the benefits for future generations then the issue of the council vision it 's about needing to be have some clear statement of how the city should look and feel the suggestion here is that we develop a set of outcomes of what is being sought to be achieved on the ground so to speak and the suggestion is also that it may be more appropriate although we started drafting something on those lines and may be more appropriate to wait until the council is considered the community outcomes that it 's considering early next month we 're in your hands as to how you want to deal with that we can come back with a draft of outcomes messages madam jebet we can come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in relation to the LTP in the annual plan and you are looking at community outcomes there I understand that feedback from keg through C jog is that there should be one version and not one just related to resource management and then another wider one relating to local government act so we are in your hands but perhaps we could wait to see what comes out of your further workshops and we can also do some work around a resource management version and then we can come back to you with some options how do people feel about that yep sounds good thank you yep could at least that kitsis started and then we remind us just machine capable that 's right yes okay so moving on then we had some further responses through the consultation processes that happened that suggested some manners that we thought were fairly minor editions that we could it would improve the plane so these came in after weird prepared the report to the previous committee I 'll just quickly go through those the first areas recognition that natural hazards is an important consideration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form and we think that 's quite appropriate and have suggested in addition on page 21 to objective 3.64 to so that 's it now subclause team so you should be recognizing the risks from natural hazards as one of those considerations in terms of the patent of development and urban form we had a climbing seeking recognition that the central city needs to be restored as well as enhanced to become the principal community focal point that I think recognizes the current situation more completely in the recommendation there is to add restoration to the objective and policies listed there so that 's on page 21 can I just go back to recognize as the rest of natural hazards is there a problem putting that it at sort of like number team I mean you know it makes it sound like it 's the unconventional rather than pretty pretty much time even we learn something you know kind of about what we 've been through my understanding is that legally it makes no difference but in terms of well maybe it 's a message we want to send those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further up yeah so I like I like provides certainty about where development can occur right at the start but I just wonder whether we should put recognizes the rest of natural reasons right up there yeah after suit yeah there 's no number two you 'll get five,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

New Zealand",3203,natural hazards is it actually just about recognizing the risk but when I read the Royal Commission part of the problem was that he can and accounts ago yeah there 's risks and we 'll just tell you what they are but we didn 't actually we needed to be in my view we needed to be a lot more proactive around preventing development happening with this recognized natural hazards no no no it 's not recognized natural hazard risks it 's the level of risk that is faced otherwise we 'd have no development on any of the port hills all this was actually one day something might happen that you know would happen once on a school in years yeah so but there 's a difference between recognizing the rest yes I agree and and actually enabling development because you 've told people that there 's a risk so now you can go ahead and develop and I was hoping that this plan would be more directional around so maybe the word recognizes isn 't quite the right word perhaps madam chair could just highlight that we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I deals with the objectors policies and rules relating to natural hazards on the 66 of may which I 'll havenít I think what you 're looking for you but I think there 's something more than just recognizing the right you know I actually getting it we do a bit responding to the rusty yeah you know management is yes or well with it yeah because well they 're there a variety of ways you know because I mean and certain areas we actually avoid is rusts from natural hazards because we are both aware of them and they 're you know the risks associated with them are both you know sort of real one and prison so and unable to be mitigated again so you could use the word management as just an overall a catchphrase or you could use the words of the Act avoid mitigate avoid remedy or litigate avoid remedy or mitigate the risks from natural hazards how 's that just just to be clear there is actually a specific natural hazard objective in the chapter which in our readings is quite short so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural hazards avoided or reduced to acceptable levels it 's still quite a high order objective but it raises the sorts of issues that we 're talking about the only reason we were suggesting to add something else to this chapter was that natural hazards is a particularly important consideration when we 're talking about the pattern of development so we just wanted to flag it at this point it 's just really a flag that we 're putting in there is this other objective which are specifically on natural hazards in this chapter and as Brigitte see you 'll actually be a whole Mitchell hazards chapter which will actually get a lot more specific yes sure the risk to people property and infrastructure from natural hazards is avoided or reduced to acceptable levels way through this policy setting objective development form and function is actually avoiding the development in areas of high risk from natural hazards I mean shouldn 't we just say we 're the risk cannot avoiding development where it where the rust cannot be avoided mitigated or manage no yeah so we 've got a plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're doing is tightening it up to say actually post-earthquake and probably pre youth great we knew that these areas have high risk we 're now putting an extra layer of protection or prevention because these areas are no longer fit look the circumstance has changed you know and I mean 20 years ago we might have thought that you know 20 years ago we might have thought that a particular risk couldn 't be much engaged against but new technology says that it can be so I think that these documents always have to speak in the present so we can 't reflect on on where exactly we are at the moment but but and I quite like the you using the language that we 've already got on that and the legislation which shows what is it again hmm no no not that one although I think there 's too long Oh avoid we module mitica avoid remedy or mitigate yeah that wouldn 't cause he opens for the objectives and yet and the chapter further I think it also spells out that we 're we 're we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announced that it 's taking a stronger role in terms the RMA and it 's you know lack of sufficient focus in this area okay but spoken about the adding restoration and respect of the sinful City so the next point under after that was in relation to the distribution of commercial activities in development of commercial centers there were two points raised one was seeking some general objectives and policies on commercial activities and the comment there is that that 's actually already in the chapter and the second was seeking some very detailed policies about warrior and how commercial centers shall be developed particularly key activity centers all those those are quite specific policies there we have policies dealing with those issues already in the commercial kept specifically on key activity centers and it seemed to be a level of detail that wasn 't appropriate for these high order objectives and policies so the recommendation there is not to make an amendment to this chapter there 's anything being done around the request that we 've made that if you 've got a big key activity center commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment that something comes back to the community taken by up all the neighborhood but it 's the comic dip and probably ask Steven max isn 't it should we be sagging some when they 're in the strategic because it 's a new strategic direction we if you 've got you know a big thing that basically takes over the whole neighborhood is a requirement to provide community infrastructure yes I difference to where we clean pass where you basically just get consent and keep expanding this it 's probably not so much a high order strategic issue as a as a detail in terms of how different sorts of centers develop right with all due respect I really disagree this is a strategic direction I think we should be sending because in the past we haven 't and it 's incredibly strategic in terms of a bus bus routes bus terminals community center minutes it is really important that 's a fundamental shift and a strategic direction that said we just enable this development without any thing coming back and at whatever cost this has being a much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get these huge conglomerates of activity that it is a responsibility to do something to provide community infrastructure and with your the leave madam chair Mark Stevenson has a response to that issue which was raised we don 't intend to ignore it at all but that will come shortly when we go over the revisions to the commercial chapter and if at then at that time it 's considered that something should go into the strategic direction this chapter we can take that on board yeah the other thing that 's worth noting there is that the strategic relationship to already activity centers should be our focus for transport for commercial activities for community facilities for a wide range of things so the general direction is already there and really the commercial chapter just brings in the detail of exactly water is going to be provided in those commercial zones so if we can move on and we will come to that measure and the commercial chapter and then make a decision in the final point raised was in terms of urban design to issues the year one that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both costs and benefits to evil design and the comment that was made here is that fact the chapter already recognizes that there are those costs and benefits but the second issue raised was that urban design is probably more important in some environments than others and that 's an appropriate sort of comment and i think it 's worth recognizing that so the suggestion there is that in the discussion of issue at clause three point four point three which is page nine we make an addition there aged nine and be so that 's the second set of orange wording on page nine just it just doesn 't sit entirely easy with me that and I guess it 's around that how you get a balance I except in some part some areas you know the other desire is quite crucial which is how our city centers and the some of the key local here is my pin example with the shops and and also with us more intensive housing say it just seemed certain sort of Richard I don 't know the entirely comfy of the statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really this pursuing the intention of the statement is not to say it 's not important across the city but that it 's more important in some areas than others and this is reflected in the proposed provisions that you 'll see either have seen or we 'll see in chapters for example and industrial areas you won 't see as much control on urban design as you will have seen in commercial centers for example so there is a different approach being proposed for different areas depending on how important now now sensitive there but I I term quite concerned about this if you take an example of the mitre 10 and farrah meant for example you know having these big buildings painted you know bright colors and that was adjusted to a conservation area but it just I I don 't know we should be allowing a city to just develop without good urban design I mean it just seems most people actually want to self better urban design and I don 't know how you distinguish between areas they should just like if you take some areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even design along the river I 'd want it through a major tourist thoroughfare but that 's an industrial area but it doesn 't mean that it should sort of second class so soon to it watering down the urban design um issues may I come in I don 't believe that all attempting to water it down but it is indicating that each chapter has a certain level of urban design with a nut and when you hear about the industrial chapter you will see that there are still some rules about urban design but perhaps not as detailed and not as wide-ranging as we would have under ezza dential or some of the commercial areas this is it 's an energy that 's an issue no it 's only an issue that 's in here at the moment but I 'm harking back to a newly a discussion that we had today this is one of the key issues that and you will need to have discussion with on the ministers and regarding comments yep it is an issue of balance because there 's been a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design not only from individuals but from organizations and then we also have the comments from C jog and and we all reminded of what happened with the ccrp poorly but quick call me up just seems to me that the the tomb good urban design here is being tagged to an increased cost to implement that and I don 't necessarily see that that equates nighttime with felony ani I 'm not happy with being written near dead at good urban designers more important in some areas and others and I wonder if we actually need to have that early well I think what why wouldn 't even if you 're doing a factory why wouldn 't you have good urban design no as I said before in the chapters that are still to come and in chapters on Phase two there are generally comments proven design but for example if you consider the rural chapter it may not have a lot of rules about urban designed in it so all it is saying is that there are degrees of the amount of input we want to have on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that area there 's there are still some urban design rules in the industrial chapter and you will see that when it comes to you perhaps is a suggestion because I think what we 're talking about is two slightly different lands one and say where is a good even design or whether and the other is how much control we have of even design and maybe it 's actually the sentence should really talk about their need to manage urban design is more important in some areas yeah is that no I think that Andrew and in David yeah i mean the comment i was about to make actually reflect some of what you just saying there may be rather than saying there are some areas where urban design is more important than others because I mean that really to me does suggest that there are some areas where we see urban designers less important if we 're saying there are some areas where it 's more important maybe if we said the urban design requirements vary according to different areas of the city with different uses different needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've been saying which I don 't feel is reflected in the orange here you know we 're talking about terms of importance if we put that into terms of requirement within the plan rather than importance it removes that suggestion that some areas have got less yet the urban design is less important in some areas when the phrasing that the phrasing that was used in the the committee comment was that the amenity benefits of urban design controls are more significant on some environments and others but what you 've written is good point the quality of the urban environment is who were important consideration some areas and others and I just wonder whether you 've actually captured what was intended and I wonder whether that second sentence is actually unhelpful and in light of the comments around you know a large box development that uses a very bright color to ever ties itself by painting itself that color in a conservation area you know or being seen from a conservation area I right on the banks of the of BS tree warranted and we can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are answering David did you want to comment further look I just said in a few moments ago as downstair sitting in on the customer advisory group between major building companies and and the consents team both building and resource and in a comment that sort of came through there this morning which sort of pricks my ears a wee bit with the sort of this urban design thing was that a guy down there had a complex that he had submitted plans for that were fully compliant yet the urban design panel were in were in disagreements with the with what he 'd submitted and he was basically told well his his application is not going to proceed unless he takes some notice of the urban design panel the urban design panel has a retirement village was it I wasn 't around I think it was just an industrial building sorts right commercial building but my concern really was that you know you get someone that puts forward a plan that is fully compliant under the rules and yet the urban design panel says we 're not comfortable with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between someone who puts up something that 's fully compliant and yet the urban design panel says no we don 't like it and he 's basically told well it 's not going to proceed until you address the urban design panels concerns but the project was fully compliant look that 's a very good question and and you need an answer to that and I think that 's a good one for you to keep as a case study a question for the urban design seminole or briefing that you 'll be having on a second of May because you 'll have all the key people here that will be able to answer that question and and and those questions do need to be answered for you so that you are confident with what we 're producing and these and these chapters is able to make some difference there is a difficulty I 'd have to say were the operative plan because they 've been designed doesn 't feature in it as strongly as it possibly on probably just flagging that maybe we need to consider some more urban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are doing and and they are being brought to you within each chapter though there isn 't a chapter on you been designer it features within each chapter well at that certain it would overcome issues that I 'm hearing on more than one occasion now where the urban design panel has no statutory significance and yet compliant applications are being pulled and manipulated to to actually comply something that they don 't need to in this versus part of that bigger question for you to raise with the minister 's yeah so if so that 's the end of your presentation on bed we 've got stalled the commercial come now there 's just the commercial revisions to go over quickly and then we 'll go into the industrial chapter and I 'm hoping we 'll get that finished so that we can also see through the lens and termination chapter three look where we won 't be able to start the industrial chapter until after that its own if we could get this commercial chapter out of the way now and then we 'll start back at two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the industrial chapter,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

New Zealand",3516,there was a question about the definition of noise sensitive activities and whether that accommodated the guest accommodation and the port noise and I think counselor tuna that was another matter you had raised and the comic there is it has been included in the port noise area will bring that to you when we talk to the specific chapters if that arises but in the state 's there 's no need for any further change I think the next one is just a comment about the number of definitions and we process of going through and revising and necessary definitions and the one there as an example being cinema it 's not required the other comment I think your worship made was the need for a glossary and that glossary chapter has been deleted completely also on this table as Brigitte 's it 'd be there have been some still some consultation comments coming through since we last spoke to you and one of those here is someone seeking a definition of transport system with every license would that be useful basically we 're saying here we just need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're saying it should be a transport system who you Lee and I just asked you Ellen just going back to about the glossary pan and so it would be there 's no it 's going to be deleted from this chapter but will the glossary be contained separately for the whole plane like it 's not like you 're not using that we get rid of weed not have it I sorry we were suggesting that the glossary is not in the plan some parts of the chapters will refer to various pieces of legislation or a strategy document or whatever and it 's purely a reference and that document is able to be found elsewhere so we don 't need to actually include the glossary or not and i 'm assuming until me please that I am create booking confirmed and in fact it would still be easily accessible to fight to find those definitions if someone wants to find the definitions yeah they 're not definitions their statements of say an act or a strategic document that the council has prepared so when this goes into an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if someone said refer to the transport act of suddenly or another then you 'll be able to go straight from the district plan to that piece of legislation so actually don 't physically need the glossary per se and if it 's again there 's a reference in the chapter two council strategy then that will just hyperlink you straight from that to the strategy well I guess having new technology will all be able to do it yes I guess I like seeing the definitions loud and clear so as long as I can find them and it sounds like we will in the electronic version Council just to clarify your question they have been to document set of been repeatedly one is the list of definitions and a second one is the glossary and these are two very different things so the list of definitions as the crucial part of the plan and will remain in it but what we 're talking about as being the glossary was a list of other statutory documents or other pieces of legislation that we 're referred to elsewhere in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the district as you thank you thank you the next one down there is the definition of utility that 's come from kiwiRail and their comment there is that 's a matter that 's more appropriate to when we do the utilities chapter and phase 2 so that definition will come forward when that chapter comes later on also kiwiRail seeks to be identified as a network utility operator and again our commenters that I will come to you with the utilities chapter later on if needs be that was the indole definitions and this is in question all right not just us petition on mum kiwiRail crees colleges chapter is not part of the stage one priority one chapter that 's ethically so so the concern really is that was special purpose railway land it 's very easy for people to get consents to pretty much do anything for you know like the car would carlisle street the key street the the depot so like I 'm a little bit concerned we 're leaving that to later because what we know post-earthquake as many people see that as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you got any thoughts about what we might be able to do in the interim we cannot add any further information into these first eight does they 've already been out for the consultation it 's taken as eight months to get this far that has always been a chapter that 's been in the second group of chapters to be considered doing commercial and industrial I would have thought there 's a case that actually they shouldn 't be special purpose it should have a overlying zoning which prevent certain activities from happening on that site without getting you know a fully notified consent or without getting some sort of other Commission so just explain this to me cuz on so there 's a lot of you and the job so just dumb so you 're talking about preserving rail corridors fourth so there 's a whole bunch of special people become special purpose own along the railway corridor yeah and effectively what that makes is a qrl can lease out the land to anyone and they can do anything on it and it 's incredibly hard for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that happen but when you get things like an let a bus depot guess um hazardous materials when you get things like the waste dump that over an castrate i think it was with a spear styles and all sorts is very there 's very little controls and so what people see it as it 's a really easy way to get content activities put into areas that have very little oversight from a planning point of view as a council so so did that so that 's a that 's a preexisting designation and the plane that we 're not addressing until later on yeah that 's that 's what we 've just heard but I guess their concern I would have as is there a way in which because one of the issues with industrial and commercial and many of these areas i think probably are committed you know aside from the residential which is pretty much got houses on earth so there no restrictions on what rail can do alongside the railway line even in a residential area I think perhaps in a residential not sure but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me and the commercial and the industrial areas that we need to have better buffers between their buddies you know much more clarity over what 's for better than what 's not the cycle lanes look good alongside the railway line yeah the issues that you 've raised we 're certainly aware of and we are working on they are nowhere near completed to be able to forward in today 's of going to the minister 's if you wish we could bring them forward and have a separate and process for them that 's some time before then the expansive chapters but they can 't be included until this round the work isn 't completed but is there anything that we could put under the industrial chapter for example in those areas where they were they with a merge well we could look at that we can look at that I would have to say though we haven 't had the discussions we haven 't completed the work with kiwiRail on these matters you 'd know what was that raised during the initial consultation that you don 't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being raised during the briefings earlier this year though i don 't know i 'm not talking about now i 'm talking about you know like because you you say we 've been doing this for eight months it 's longer than we 've been around so we 've been working on these first eight chapters for the last eight months there was it always the eight chapters you never you never had a broader no brief no there no there 's always been priority chapters and initially they were prioritized because of the land use recovery plan and the discussions that we were having one government that I 'm not criticizing I 'm just not inquiring and because what I worry about is that inadvertently we may have actually left ourselves exposed to incompatible use and then also potentially some lost opportunities as we try to recover the city well is and that 's a possibility however it 's noted that through the truncated process and the discussions that we 've had was with the ministers that the hearings panel can make the decisions about when it will hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave submissions on certain aspects of chapters until the second round comes through they can make that decision so that there is the ability to ensure that give us engineers what have you yeah all right all right and the reason it was in true two tranches is because of the need to get on and have two lots of notification to be sure that we can get the first priority matters out there and make them operative there are two chapters okay all right so anything more on definitions so we 'll move on to the strategic direction a direction so if you can find your papers in front of you on strategic directions its reunion or brigitte do you mind if I just asked a question seed way guy into this just because a builder holistic one um the more I 've been thinking about this just I guess with the whole district plan review I I suppose my fear as effectively what the ministers dry at the end of the process please pre if I 'm wrong is it is it a right of veto for lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of the papers that I 've seen drafted No so we we basically hand it to him once we 've done our piece and is it like there 's going to be line sort of struck out and things change quite dramatically so it could well be the case you have been given a copy of the Canterbury joint officials group comments that could well be that could well be what happens that 's why it 's going to the ministers for 15 days they will come back with comments then as I understand it the process remains still that the committee will then consider have regard to those comments and make decisions about what amendments that would make to the documents before they go out for notification and where it declines to make an amendment I understand their needs to be a paper to go back written and go back to the minister 's to explain why so there were sounds good and thanks for clarifying exactly how they will look there I guess my fear isn 't maybe I 'm sort of tainted better or I don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so proud of the sheer an idea process we went through our ice was staff just slowly guts out and it may be pretty proud to be a part of this council at that time incorporated wet and I think looking back with the benefit of hindsight what was just nonsensical is and every time we 've had a good outcome as a council as when you get all the interested parties around the table and so what are you trying to achieve what 's it where are you coming from from your perspective and I reckon that probably if we done that with a central city plan we could have been in a position that probably didn 't leave the people of Christchurch feeling like they had been slapped in the face like this council had been slapped in the face and within drawing a greater wedge between crown and local government which is I to be totally fear exactly what happened in my opinion with something like the district plan review which is just so defining for the city why don 't we it feels there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't we sitting down right in the early stages saying where do you want to come from let 's not have a centricity recovery plan share an idea thing all over again what are you trying to achieve at what 's important to you here 's where our staff coming from and here 's where we think our communities at needs to try and set a framework now and be on the same page at the start instead of just coming through and going through what my cynical side of me tells me it could be just to kind of slap in the face to divisive process all over again that 's my genuine fear around it I understand that if I could just take you back to the structure of the whole district plan review process we do have in place a collaborative advisory group which includes and representative from the ministries various ministries including our UDS partners ewee nzta as and they have met regularly almost weekly I think for the last perhaps for five months we did all that with a central city plant oh that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the points in these chapters however as you know from those comments and this is not different to what happened with the central study recovery plan there are still issues from the ministries about standards relating to urban design standards relating to some of the transport rules that we 've discussed in those those comments are always going to be there and it 's a matter of weighing up and balancing what you as a council want to put into the document vacation how it is no longer the document of the council in the sense that we don 't have any influence over it apart from potentially making submissions to it because at that stage it goes to an independent hearing panel and that 's really all I can say at this matter we have tried in a number of ways to be collaborative on this project including as I went over with you and the first workshops and numbers of hours given to this in the canterbury officials group the siege or group to bring them into the picture as well so there are always new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collaborative advisory group has been the same and has been going for the lust I don 't know three four five months and they 're also involved in the scoping of the the next phase of chapters that 's coming through to you want to entertain the legal framework is that that 's the hearings panel who makes the decision on the submissions on the notified plan that 's not the ministers the decision is going to be made under the Resource Management Act and there 's no change to that we consume their their stores no a great process there 's no exact process it 's been a great year so you know and the minister ultimately you know that 's still negotiation it 's ongoing as I understand it shall we move on yeah I mean I think it 's right for counsel of god raised us because and it does concern me that the quick you know the over at and from is that but last thing that we want to happen is for you know that fundamental you know sort of then result and if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estic response one against the other and it 's actually not in the interest of the city that occurred and I actually wonder whether it would be worthwhile at some point to sit down with ministers ourselves you know at the you know time perhaps when they I mean I know that it 's the time is so incredibly short but given that there will be a delay at the at the point that it will be publicly notified I think to the end of June Arizona it is it 's open for submissions for 30 days and then further submissions for another ten days so truck through the the after notification the draft chapters will be open for some mission you know no no the point that I 'm making is that when it goes but it won 't be notified now until June we thought it was ready to make yes so so there is a little bit of leeway there now that wasn 't there before and I wonder whether at the point that the ministers report back to us we ought not to meet with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good suggestion yeah and it 's just because I mean the last thing that we want to have happen is is essentially I mean we 're in two different frames of decision making you know and this is something that 's become very clear to me with the housing Accord yesterday is that you know the government makes its decision making you know it 's a closed cabinet process its budget secrets all of those elements that take the decision-making away from the public arena here we are in the public arena being live screened you know talking about the ultimate plan that we will be responsible for putting out for public notification and then an official process that will then take over if at that point we are subject to you know attack from central government because we haven 't understood what their concerns are I mean we don 't have to agree with them but I actually think that it might be worthwhile taking j point to actually meet with them at the point that they report back to us give you time to report to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through to them and for us to have a discussion about it but then for us to meet with the with the ministers just so that we have that real clarity of you around where they 're coming from and where they see our plan and I just don 't think that there would be any harm it doesn 't bind us to to agree with their position but actually nobody would be left in with the with the view that we would never advise properly on their view or that we didn 't understand what their position was if we gave them the chance to actually describe it to us personally is an end madam chair just as you weren 't in the room and the very first slide I put it that 's that 's all right I 'm your attention and this slide here so there are new dates now that have gone into your Diaries but if I you see here that we would expect the minister 's comments to come back by the sixth of June mm-hmm so potentially when they give those comments back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistance perhaps a meeting could be set up to meet the minister 's before they hand those comments over if you like with a time to reflect on them and to comment on them and then we have well if we get them on the sixth of June which is what we consider as an extra couple of days past 15 working days so if we get them then then we we have about three or four days to consider them before we come back to you with our comment on the minister 's comments and proposed recommendations for any changes to be made for you to consider then on the twelfth and thirteenth of June,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

'm not sure about the others and yeah there 's an apology from yani because he 's and uh he 's having to make a deputation to a parliamentary select committee so apologies for very small numbers but obviously we should get underway um so thank you councillor claire thank you just to remind everyone that this is being live streamed as this is a public workshop so the first thing i 'd like to do is take you back to the process that we have because there have been a number of other dates now in this process that need to go in your diaries and and if it doesn 't fit we need to know as soon as possible so um all of the dates post the second of may are now confirmed that you are available if we can just look through that so today obviously this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second of may the sixth of may is the new date in there and that 's to go over the final two chapters natural hazards and subdivision and development and then the 12th of may i believe still needs to be confirmed and i think that might have to be a special committee meeting of the earthquake recovery committee of the whole in going back to then um the 13th of may if they are signed off on the 12th which i had up there that 's when the draft chapters would be forwarded to the ministers for their comments then we should have them back by i think it 's earlier that week but i 've put in just to give a few more days we should have the comments received back again by the 6th of june then we need to meet on thursday the 12th and we put aside two days here and depending on the length of the comments and the length of discussion around that so the dates for um the dates that sorry the time for the 13th sorry for the thursday the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a note of that and i apologize i didn 't have these times in here um and from for friday the 13th of june is ten till five so there 's a day and a half in there to discuss the minister 's comments and determine what revisions what amendments you may wish to make on the basis of those comments and then on thursday the 19th again that date is provisional that would need to be a special committee or a council meeting date to approve the draft chapters in the section 32 to go out to notification with the current date for notification being on saturday the 28th of june and we 're really hoping to confirm those here today perhaps councils can check our diaries too um by the end of the day we 've got this afternoon to confirm would that be okay yes if you could go through clear here but i understand that claire 's already looked at diaries and these are the dates she 's been able to come up with so any changes we would need to know yes urgently i 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other commitments but i 've certainly looked at the meeting commitments that you have there are um on one or two of those days there is a board meeting that would start at four or five so just later on in the pace so it would just determine where you where you were up to on a particular day but certainly the decision-making meetings they are free at the moment as an example there but um in the mayor 's office will be aware too of of these dates yes thanks for all that because this is you know lining up the dates we know is yes i 've checked this with the general managers and the mayor 's office and the chief executive as well not kirsty but we manage the diaries but right now because the the schedule has been the you know amendment whether the community residence or group they have a comment regarding to these early stage the drop the discipline whether they are still allowed to give the comments solar email also the website the the comments are still open on the natural hazards chapter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing you chapters for your review we have had to cut off um the comments when we stated we would otherwise we wouldn 't have any papers to bring you to be updated but we 'll always to have regard to comments we continue to read comments as they come through so i know that you have a number of pieces of paper in front of you i 'd just like to go through so that you 're aware of what 's on your desk what we 're going to do today first of all is just go through the revisions that were promoted by yourselves at the previous workshops so you have in front of you that the chapters that we went through but just the pages where there are revisions occurring that we need you to be comfortable with so that 's the definitions introduction strategic directions and commercial chapter i just note at this stage that the transport revisions are still to come back to you and they will come back on one of those later dates that i 've just talked about and that 's because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the possible possible changes to the road classification trigger levels for the ita ruling and the runanga are also looking at the transport chapter so that will come back to you still and then you also have in front of you um a repeat of the industrial chapter in case you 've forgotten to bring it with you from when it was first handed out a couple of weeks ago and it 's section 32 can you see that i 'm thinking they might still be behind the desks when we did the industrial you don 't have them on your desk okay if not they are there behind the desk and they 'll be handed out yep i 've bought my own because there 's also and there 's the commercial draft of the commercial chapters too on our desk is it that 's correct but that 's for the revive the revisions we 've already been through the commercial chapter yes we have so that 's just for the revisions um and the contaminated land chapter and it 's section 32 now those will be on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already okay and and some of us have probably bought them because they were previously distributed that 's correct yep that 's correct then um there is a request for the cafe metro consent which you have in front of you which may not be obvious because on the top of it is a table that compares the conditions of that consent with the rules and the draft commercial and transport chapters that we 're looking at and it 's very clear two or three pages in that it 's the consent for the metro cafe that 's to read at your leisure another request was made was the list of temporary activities which looks like this and there is a memo from me just explaining how to read that list and the last request that was made for information was a list of the changes being made in the district plan review process relating to the suburban centre master plans just two-sided that 's right just one piece of paper it 's headed up implementation of the suburban centre master plans in the draft commercial and residential chapters of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cafe consent the temper activities and the suburban centre master plans list they 're all for you to read and have reference to as you wish just for your own edification i i would just share with you that there was a lot of interest on green building standards the possibility of including that into the phase one chapters residential and commercial i 'd just like to bring to your attention that in you you have a copy in the counselor 's room of a it 's a large document and it has a copy of all of the submissions that we receive to the date of close off there is a submission in there from the green building council

1,eqDEHPb8PA0,20140410,1533.519,"Christchurch, New Zealand",3669,to now somebody was saying that the other the other item of business might be a bit quicker than this fun is that right or should we get straight into this one well I just know that council Johansson wanted to speak to this one so I just think to staff I know I know I know you won 't you to behave you 're not to behave out there can we can we deal with thee is here another is there another item of business yes okay so um I was just looking after your untruth counselor well everyone 's here now so we 'll go back to the proper order of things we 've got the report of the committee this is the Finance Committee as it and so I presume counselor ing will move that the council consent to such security interests s er listen are you moving the cat committee recommendation you 're moving the staff recommends mangy second dirt councillor golf I assume that somebody 's going to move the committee recommendation as an amendment or not as if councillor stuff okay well so we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which staffer we got to deal with this one is that Peter or nope John for sale and Robert O 'Connor all right Yanni would you like to start the question i thinkI thank you in the report on on page two point nine so paragraph 2.9 it says see it has now buys cct that unless the security interest is vited do see it by cct together with a consent of ccc those funds will not be provided can I ask when we 're staff aware that this was a requirement and why is this only coming to us now rather than before we sign the lease which the acting chief executive was empowered to do staff were only aware of that when we wrote the report which was about a week ago and the untold by the Creator Canterbury cricket people they only became aware of the requirement 10 10 14 days ago when the documentation was received from the from the earth under their trust um second question is in regards to the consent to grant of security what what can you just help me understand why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the implications are if the security gets called on as a council what what the council is being asked to do is as landlord in its capacity as landlord owner of the ground to consent to the owner of the building giving a charge over the building in favor of its funder now the the trust the entity that 's building the building has received a number of grants some of those grants have been structured as suspensory loans on the basis that they are repairable if certain public benefits are not met and after a period of time those loans are written off and become true grants in the meantime the trust the funder requires that it that obligation to continue to provide those public benefits is secured in some way the only legal way there can be secure is by giving a charger a mortgage over the building structure and that 's what the council as landlord is being asked to consent to so the council has no interest no ownership interest in the building has no there 's no national implications for the council all the council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangement but what I don 't what I 'm starting to understand is we don 't own the building we 're not paying for the building so why why how does a security over a blank piece of land give any security at all and the security is not over the land the Securities merely over the building but we don 't own the building that we don 't own the building and we 're not giving the charge what we are asked to do is the council where the landlord and because the building sits on our land the funder wants to be sure that we don 't have a claim on the building and so they wish us to make that clear by giving a written consent so that their interest is is is not challenged or questioned by us as the owner of the land would the amendment that the committee passed actually mean that we couldn 't legally give the security the council is not giving a security no no I 'm sorry you consent to the security and source being registered but if if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that if there is any default on the lease the council determines that this facility be returned for public use then it wouldn 't be available to meet the terms of the security the security would be lost if there was a default under the lease the rickum the committee recommendation with the greatest of respect is actually merely meaning meaningless from a legal perspective because the least already delivers that outcome if the if the if there 's a default under the lease the landlord the council takes back position of the premises takes back control of the land so the resolution is actually unnecessary from a legal perspective so as I say it 's unnecessary right okay not can I be clear why we 're actually voting on that staff recommendation when it 's not the committee recommendation because it was the staff recommendation that was moved by the chair and in Council golf they moved the staff recommendation it was voted against buy them at the that the amendment was voted against by Councillor mangie counselor golf Council lonsdale so surely the committee recommendation comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imminent what I looked for somebody to move the committee recommendation and I had it someone moved the move the original staff recommendation I did look for somebody to move the committee recommendation and no one does well so but there is a clear committee recommendation to the council yeah yeah oh I 'm happy for someone to marry us still at another meeting could someone move it you can 't be very good be delicious okay Andrew Turner second did Bucky back I think the cheese still obligated to move it even voted against it sorry no it 's not I think so it 's the committee 's rizal I know anyway it doesn 't matter I mean I did look to the counselor to move that the committee recommendation but he chose to move the other one so ya know but it doesn 't matter alright i 'm happy to rule that the motion that we are considering is the motion moved by Councillor tuna second to counsel the bag and their counselor the two counselors before golf end and Men g that median golf have moved an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions to staff or yep yes so just to get this right you 're saying that I am the committee recommendation 7.1 and 7.2 up there are legally irrelevant is that correct no 7.1 is absolutely essential it 's essentially the make the substance of the staff recommendation 7.2 is unnecessary because you have with the councillors landlord already has the power to retain or regain control of the land in the event the least terminates because the councillors the landlord owns the land if police terminates episode factor the council 's back in charge okay I 'm out Phil and then picky can I just ask if for example Canterbury credit would have fall over financially okay and have a number of debtors where that if council take a security interest like us where does that leave council the council 's not taking a security interest the council is not granting a security interest the council 's not involved with the security interest at all the councillors merely asked to consent as landlord to the giving by the owner of the building of a security interest to its funder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely consenting to something that someone else is doing it 's a it 's a it 's a functionary process thank you and if the council were owed a lot of money we would that places well the council would be in the same position it is now in that it has a lease attendant has an obligation to pay rent and do things under the lease if it doesn 't the council exercise its remedies under the lease that 's that 's the current position that doesn 't change okay at the committee when we discussed this the concern that the legal people had is that we were seeking to bind a future council on the public use of this building and that it was not for us to find a binder future council on the future use of this building right yep so that this was deliberately seeking to bind a future council on the use of this building in the event that anything happens this has been this building has been effectively and the space around it has been effectively privatized for use by a particular group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be totally clear that this building reverts to public use I have no possible way of for seeing if there is going to be any debt or any sale of this building clearly the option of removing the building is is not really a viable one so if there is any default and that is always a possibility that is better to consider at the beginning of the process then when you 're in the middle of it then I think we need to be very clear at the start of the process that this building then comes back into public ownership it is not to be privatized further by a sale to somebody or other else now I understand completely that the council will have the say at that time I wish that previous council had bound the council that used to be on some further actions on hagley park and but I just want to be clear that we don 't want to do it again so I appreciate it may be meaningless and it may be difficult to and enforce and that it may not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to buy in future councils on the public access to head be park and hence the committee recommendation yeah Paul question becomes relative does 7.2 buying the future council well yea years resolutions once passed theatre to depart from it we you know council would need to rescind that and resolve fridge so in actual fact they could he acquitting 37 and return it back we can always do that we just need the report to be written by the chief executive of the mere as we know can I just ask a question because I 'm just struggling to find out do we still need the 5.2 and the staff recommendation which is the grant delegated authority to give the council 's consent to such a security interest being registered well that would be desirable but but the committee to finance committee asked that the form of consent which to start over there have you passed around to the counselor you should have that in front of you that that is the if give councils and look at that document and are happy with it then there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have a look at the so we need to read the actual document here now well the staff recommendation was to delegate there to start the Finance Committee insisted that the document be brought to you today what I don 't think that was attached was it okay so um I councillor Johansson um I thought it was really important that we see that sort the source document for the contract we 're about to enter and if you look at two point one point to what I 'd like to know from staff is what other funders are there that we 're providing consent to have security over this building for and what restrictions if any do we have over who that might be so it can understand like see it it 's a well-known public fund it 's a charitable purpose but if there 's other funders that are not charitable giving them a consenting to having security over this building to other private funders who we 're not aware of it seems a pretty extraordinary thing to do without knowing who they are so can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other funders that have requested this security who are they and what recourse do we have a fake or vomit in terms of future use of the pavilion the read the reason the documents been drafted in need way is because one of the funders of the funders has requested anonymity confidentiality and we 're not able to disclose the identity of their dead funder so how I mean so basically say we had a private funder or an anonymous funder we 're now being asked to consent to security over the pavilion if they default and if the pavilion goes back to that funder we don 't know who it is we don 't know what they might do with it I find that really quite scary so it 's not a security interest that gives them the right of taking over the ownership is it yes it 's exactly what it is I thought that it was so that they could realize they 're the dead it 's both of those things in a sense but the reality is if if the tenant was to default and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monies are grant money subject to the provision of public benefit these are not load monies where that we the tenant is required to pay interest and perform the terms of a usual you know commercial loan so this is this is this is not a circumstance where you would expect the lender to inter inter a mortgagee sale of the building this is this is this is an arrangement to secure the obligations to provide public benefits for a period of time once that period is passed that these these arrangements will become pure grants and they will be gifts so I think you need to think it 's been structured as in a commercial sense but but it is very much a non-commercial being ended in two if in theory however there was a default and the Thunder wanted his money back it would in theory it would attempt to sell the building but the building is a is a is a building for a sport purpose on on hagley park subject to release that only allows it to be used as a sports pavilion for public use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really saleable or could be sold to anyone other perhaps then the council or perhaps another sporting body but the council has control over who that might be through the least because the lease is that the least cannot be assigned without the consent of the council so the lease the council through the lease actually has absolute control over this parcel of land to point one point to any other security so the this clause that came to finance committee dealt with there ceat group about two point one point two SC on ecs any other security interest granted over the sports pavilion and by cct but you 're saying there are anonymous people that we don 't know um and can 't know who have security over this no there are a range of funders who provided funds to the trust to build a pavilion building some of those we know one in particular has asked for for their name not to be disclosed they may require a consent to a charge over the property if they do then rather than come back to council again the documents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a consent to a church over the property for people that we can 't know for what purpose like how do they exercise that you I think you need to remember that this this is this is not a charge over council property this is not a loan to the council there 's no financial obligation at all to the council all we 're being asked to do is as landlord because the building sits on our land we 're being asked by the funder to agree that we agree that we don 't have an interest in the building effectively we don 't own the building then we do not have a financial interest in the building at this stage but should it not be used for cricket subject to mystery funders or others having any charge over this then we absolutely have an interest in that building a public interest in that building and then we have an absolute control over their building through the lease but the receivers only be used for sporting pavilion as a conceivable is it conceivable that they don 't meet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay the rent that we 're required so that another party can take over the running of the establishment under their security interest and if that 's the case then why well why are we giving up because presumably it 's only us there it 's only against us that they can you know it 's only it the lease only comes into and to play if they breach the terms of our agreement with them what our ability to take position of the land only arises in the event of a default in the meantime they still have to comply with the terms of the lease and they can only continue to use the lease for the purposes of a cricket pavilion I mean this really is a technical issue I know it is dealt with every day of the week in the commercial world and there 's no there is no compromise or limit on the council 's position whatsoever by giving the consent it is simply a requirement of of a funding arrangement because the building sits on our land that there 's no compromising the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't so that I know all right so does anyone want to speak to the motion the um not so much this week to motion the same survey and more than a the amendment yeah just as a point of order more than anything else that I 've moving amendment which is the staff recommendation yep yeah you have we 've accepted that yes just as I really mean yeah it is here 's the amendment no but we altered around no no this is the amendment you what you 're doing is the amendment to the to the primary yes okay what I understood the chair tried to move the staff recommendation when presenting the report yet i guess around a point of order or a technicality or matter of process it was then moved by Vicki and Andrew yeah but I was ruled that that was the acceptable order so I just ruled that so I 'm sorry we 're gonna be vostok challenging them wrong no no no I 've just going cross-eyed no I 'm look I 'm trying to so my vote I 'm trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to put the amendment first which is your amendment okay cool and then it will go to and then we 'll look at the the total vote so the it has been moved as you can see there by Councillor mangie and councillor goth that we amend the the resolution of the world the recommendation from the committee to read as stated I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no can we have let 's have a vote on that so we can always well I thought that 's what you 're going to do before but I 'm sorry i 'll put the motion now so it 's too late yep yes yes it is carried so i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye fine what this is an amendment you put the amendment first and then you put the full motion what no what no what we 've got there we 've got the full motion now we 've carried the amendment and it becomes no it doesn 't it isn 't open for debate I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasn 't on them in what we do all these things together goodness sake it is the substantive motion I mean oh yeah so i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's well it 's carried would you like to have a vote on it again I know but that 's right i would like to clear it carry

2,HGFpTVnsblg,20140410,708.63,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1865,"before we get to the PX section so but that the cricket one may take longer I don 't know if we could go back to the go back to the finance question around the what was that the Mount Pleasant memorial yeah so so with respect to paragraph 4.2 on page 208 and I can confirm some of the details around the insurance there 730 1,000 has been received as an indemnity payment so that 's being paid already one amount came to us and was passed on the second amount went directly to the body there 's a further seven hundred and forty eight thousand eight hundred eleven dollars to come and that is paid across as the building is constructed so we 've got the indemnity payment and the 748 will come through the residence but as it is required so that is can fend the waiters can for tonight at 1.07 is fine alright so um that yeah before we go into the amount please run this can be the same question around the insurance money this is about field yeah this is Mount Pleasant I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other questions yeah see so given that council insured this building on behalf of the group and given that there 's a huge shortfall to what it actually costs to rebuild and they 're kind of rebuilding to a lesser standard than what they had before can you advise why the why the staff recommendation in the report is only a hundred thousand rather than an adequate amount for them to actually always do the do the building given that it was that kind of how lack of valuations it wasn 't for Peter to answer Lincoln was here before I don 't know where he 's gone yeah I 'm an innocent for Peter to answer he wouldn 't have prepared this report it 's a different different section clarify and it 's probably too it would have been better to a delegation but in terms of this hundred thousand it still leaves them three hundred thousand dollars short are they able to get on and meet the requirement for the start date and the in date that Derek McCulloch mentioned and has submission with just one hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand dollars in the bank yeah no I see that they 're good to go so is that their view that they can actually do it with just a hundred thousand one hundred thousand extra in a no discard any process yep I basically said that they could actually start building their whatever just mitigate some of the internal foot out and do that down the track so I think it was the mission that I who I mean what I suggested to them if you have a look at the contingency and price escalation actually if they can they can get a fixed price right now they should actually be able to come in under that budget so that 's something they could explore yes yeah I think they have actually been exploring many options to reduce the cost I think there is a nervousness about and proceeding on a project with having such a significant gap and you know again this is taking a long time to come in front of Council which has mean that you know the costs have been rising but you know I I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they are quite disappointed in the amount that 's been recommended given the shortfall based primarily on a fact that the valuation through the insurance was a lot less than the actual cost of rebuilding so you know I think I personally would like to move that we give an additional hundred thousand if you look at some of the grants that we 've paid out for example things like the loons which we didn 't ensure 250,000 to Alton it you know this ideally should have been funded through the betterment and improvement infrastructure allowance that was the reason that it was set up was to cover some of the funding shortfalls or insurance clearly this is a position that run because of our issues as a council and you know I think just giving a little bit more of a financial contribution to get this project happening is really important I do worry that if we don 't give extra funding that we will see that the external funding will disappear and also that if it does go ahead it goes ahead in a very limited capacity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long run to come back and fix later on Paul yeah I 'd like to second that there and I think we just got to look at the history of the Mount Pleasant associations 60 years they 'll show imprudent see over those 60 years but they had a building they built themselves and it looked after it in that period of time and this is more of a hand up rather than a hand up I say that I 've actually by putting a lot of their own money into it and I think that this one actually seen a really positive message out to the community that 's been hit very hard and continues to get hurt David thank you just looking at the costings that the group provided and the costumes and the report itself we were a variation but the the one thing that does concern me a little bit with rebuilding of community facilities and public facility well mainly community facilities is the amount that we actually charge for consents resource consents and building consents we 're actually here 's a community group rebuilding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the pair of them the the applicants and their report earlier you have indicated sixty three thousand two hundred and fifty two da two hundred and fifty dollars for resource consent and building consent and I think I think we actually hook it into our community groups in a big way for these fees and charges and I can expect from experience with a very mediocre project that i did with a surf club a few years ago the total project was ten thousand we 've got four thousand dollars worth of consenting fees and I think for community organizations this this council needs to look very hard at what it 's charging not-for-profit organizations for consenting it 's a huge cost for some of these people there 's 70 almost sixty five thousand dollars in this project we are charging them for consenting and I think that 's absurd m-am Tim to kind of meet in the middle because I do think that this is a very strong community facility and for and it 's very important to this community that we would suggest or I 'd suggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that wouldn 't but they would include we would pick up the cost of both resource consent and building consent so the actual cash change would be the difference would that be is a happy medium for most I don 't we just say we 'll waive all full counsel fees well because they come from two separate funds so one has come you know generated for services rendered the other comes from a welfare fund that has been contributed to by generous people actually all around the country who donated to get things on the move I 'm not unhappy that we that we make the full payment recognizing that 60 grand of it will go on consents and come back to the council that way I agree with David I that 's something we need to look at though as the whole question around resource consents and building consent because in some respects perhaps it is a gentler way of support and community organizations and a you know sort of rebuild environment to address that but where I don 't think that we have the power to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've had which is based on the mural Relief Fund and the Christchurch earthquake mural Relief Fund and I would be happy to see the amount increase to the two hundred thousand dollars so i would be happy to i 'll be voting for the amendment Jimmy up to now those remaining balance is 1.9 million dollars yeah ruv back to the two and a half years ago of three years ago six a seven point six million dollars so based on your understanding still have a son potential community who would like to apply for this funding or not and how is your reason there they are prideful 430,000 dollars by you when defending for oil country talent dollars what 's that bless your name when we looked at the fun with it as you say 7.6 million this being the number of expenditure pit over the last three years so 1.94 when we looked at that night round balance the 431 does not a request at that point would take it about a quarter of that fund out so it would leave quite a significant amount lease for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still suffering from back issues can come to the phone store that was at one of the reasons was that 25 cent was quite a large chunk to put out at this point in time on one application and you 'll see the schedule there on some of the other amounts that we 've put through in the last three years yeah I think I think that the thing is that it 's not actually a percentage of the what remains is the percentage overall and we spent three hundred thousand dollars on the Central City play and three hundred thousand dollars on the Isaac Peter Boyle and in terms of this community I actually fully accept the argument around the this community it 's been hammered they have done an amazing job giving me up and running with their temporary facility beer I 've been there others have been there and it 's it 's extraordinary how they 've brought about 17 different user groups together to actually make that community really really hum and if we 're talking about resilient communities which I do love to talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to move the I 'm going to put the put the amendment all those in favor say aye aye those opposed say no it is carried so now we put the bloggers in fact the full resolution isn 't it because it was moved is a full resolution so there we go so now we 've got we 've got one more

them in that 's me so it was rather than i 'm dealing with this amendment with this motion I 'd like to move that we refer the drafts of motion on the bill back to the submissions panel for the panel to determine the final form of the submission to be made on behalf of the council and that the mayor and in multi I don 't know whether other stuff but and that we will end that we know actually and that we request that the hearings be a hearing be that are hearing that the Select Committee conduct a hearing and Christchurch in which case the council will be presented by myself I don 't know who else particularly wants to appear on this matter Ali Jones represented by the mere and counselor Annie Jones along with appropriate expert staff because we want a really powerful submission made this Royal Commission occurred in our city and we want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be reflected in the legislation that has passed so and and if not then I think at least by the by the mere and appropriate expert staff if we have to go to Wellington will have to go to Wellington but otherwise will will seek to have it here so and actually we don 't need the woods in which case because the council to be represented by the mayor and council Jones along with appropriate expert staff but you might have to drop off LEF if it 's an airfare to Wellington ok thank you so do you want to just quickly run through the the main points that you think that we should be covering and the submission because I think we highlighted the other day that we really do want a strong submission yes I won 't I 'm going to be much into the background we know how we 've got here what we 're we 're we 've moved to form a discussion on monday is to flesh out the main points from the Royal Commission recommendations they may twenty five recommendations to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us or the main 10 and indicated on the right hand side where we see those our recommendations being supported or not by the the by the bill so to quickly run through those in terms of retaining the thirty-three percent new building standard for earthquake prone buildings that was recommended by the Commission has been replicated in there in the build the recommendation for unreinforced masonry buildings particularly hazardous figures to be strengthened to up to fifty percent of new building standing that 's a recommendation made hasn 't been reflected in the dog glare submission contains a recommendation that has looked there to give the the timeframes that the Commission set for priority buildings has been recognised to some extent as the bill has a mechanism for prioritizing buildings that will be sit in the regulation we haven 't seen the detail around their head the commission also between a time Francis fixin to be sick nationally that 's been recognized in the in the bell exemptions as the recommendation that 's been recognized information about building risk that 's publicly available that has been recognized the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be done so without triggering upgrading to accessibility issues so accessibility is the building code word for making sure that buildings able to be used for people with disabilities so accessibility and means of escape requirements so that was a recommendation from Royal Commission to the government that that upgrading trigger isn 't activated by a building consent to do seismic capacity increase wound there is going to be some guidance provided however we don 't know the detail of their yet around how that mechanism may work we discussed that at some length on Monday they also the requirement that the TAS to adopt policies to require hazards and residential buildings this is what the Commission put up to the government that hasn 't been reflected in the bill at the time of initial consultation the council supported the Commission 's recommendation some key issues out of those for us when we move with our solicitors around particularly unreinforced masonry buildings with what we see as high hazards decreasing time frames been able to address those high hazards as quickly as possible so we 're submitting on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high hazard areas parapets of the life for the prioritization of buildings the recommendation in terms of the Royal Commission identified this the shorter time frames with that high increase we can see that the council submission supported that and the legislation that we have the bill isn 't quite clear on how that is going to be activated there is an aspect of the devil in the detail leave of those regulations we want to enforce that our view on that with our submission yeah in terms of strengthening a consent for spring cleaning work activates other upgrading work so the Royal Commission talk there in terms of section 11 till the building it triggering other upgrading work that shouldn 't happen whereas our previous submission contended that that that upgrading work is as equally as important as the structural upgrade the bill contains the provision that it may not require that additional upgrading but there is the tools to be delivered via regulation as to how that will be balanced out in terms of the bill contains four regulations that will be set in terms of tools that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or provided with consultation as early on some but not all is it one yeah at the moment the bills drafted so that there 's only a specific requirement to consult with the council 's on the seismic capacity assessments it appears we 're not necessarily going to be consulted on what 's a priority building the criteria for exempting buildings end on this s beat so we 'll need to include that in the submission yeah that we should be consulted yep terms of the methodology and costs for size with capacity assessments the Commission didn 't address this issue our previous submission moved along the line that we need to be able to cover costs from dealing with the associative work and also we 've raised issues around where the obligation falls back to the council to deal with the building herath net cost recovery the bill itself doesn 't address those issues and while we have existing procedures for recouping some costs in terms of doing immediate work our viewers that these recovery mechanisms aren 't fast enough you are metering event here at its buildings the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shouldn 't be impeded by the requirements to deal with the regulatory process our submission previously supportive that heritage buildings should be preserved and retained wherever practicable and the benefits of heritage protection should be balanced over the safety disease the bill provides that can agree one historic buildings and the Historic Places act may apply to the council for an extension of up to ten years to complete any seismic of grading work as part of that extension process there is an obligation for the owners to manage the risk once again this is a scenario we are some regulations of or criteria going to be formed as part of the bill and provided back to the council thanks that 's great well I mean I think that what the motion that we refer this bag you know can I just thank everyone for you know the tremendous week that you did in a very short space of time to to present to us that the the different stages because i think what those that additional stage of the advice that the council gave to mb when they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a much clearer picture of the well actually the consistency of the position that the council has adopted throughout but i think that it 's our obligation as the Christchurch City Council to present very strongly and support of the Royal Commission recommendations it 's you know I think we owe it to the people whose lives were lost and who were severely injured when when buildings collapsed on and the earthquake so it is something that I think we have an obligation to take on so thank you very much for all of the effort you put on and if there are no through the questions or comments I would like to look for a seconder for the motion and Phil Clearwater seconded the motion i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very very very much and as I under cated we 're going to have to adjourn the meeting and come back oh okay well i was thinking straight clot but just to give us the that the time that we need to deal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and complete them in,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Theatre,_6BB35OhLww,20140410,1211.039,"Christchurch, New Zealand",2987,item number 29 acting chief executive report on the majestic theory theatre i 'll move that the report be received um and can i have a seconder for that uh paul lonsdale um so uh we can open this up for questions danny um thank you i i was concerned to see that um that we 've been advised that the demolition is well underway my my understanding is it 's only only just started very preliminary so i also was expecting that we would have some legal advice back as to how we could possibly stop the demolition but i know that 's not on the report can i just ask the acting chief executive if there 's been any consideration given to council taking an injunction or getting some sort of judicial review of the use of sarah 's powers to demolish this listed heritage building and if not how soon could we get that given um what 's happening in terms of the start of the demolition um no staff haven 't considered that we got your question through this morning about legal advice on these options @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not available right at the moment it was asked for last last week um so when i saw the report didn 't include it i i raced it again but i do i did want it recorded that it was not just something that i put in last night it was something that was expected from last week was that yeah when so what was sorry i didn 't what was my apology why was it i don 't remember us asking for legal advice last week yeah absolutely we were asked well um the acting chief executive and i were asked by council to meet urgently with the report around options for the majestic theatre in terms of opportunities to including legal to to challenge but i appreciate that you 've had a very short time to look at this and i do appreciate that you 've met with ccdu i i just want to flag to my colleagues that i would be quite keen to move an amendment that we do look at some sort of injunction around halting the demolition to enable us to consider what else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can take i mean we can take advice internally over over whether grounds exist but the advice that we 've received is that there are no grounds for judicial review that is the advice that we who 's that advice come from internally and i think the other point we were advised and we haven 't been to look but just yesterday that the demolition is well underway no just started so it 's it 's got a few um white things wrapped around it they 've probably started some initial work maybe asbestos removal but it 's not significantly um started in any way and the contract has has been there as we as we know but yeah i um all right well look i mean we can we can take some further advice on the matter but you know um i just um i mean we we could meet with um with warwick again he has left that um open to have a further conversation with him i think the issue the concern i have is clearly sarah and ccd are not going to change their mind around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what options are available to prevent the demolition and the only one would be an interim injunction while we go through that more detailed process yeah the thing is is that to get an injunction i mean to get an injunction you have to have some sort of ground for um for the for the for the reason for the court to intervene yeah this is just after what 's been happening with traffic in town i know things have calmed down now but i wonder whether the issue of traffic flow has been looked at with regards to the blocking off and reducing the flow around that key litchfield street corner my understanding is that that 's actually quite a key area and would if it was fully available be quite effective in alleviating some of the jamming at either end of litchfield we have some legal staff here could we please invite them to the front to tease out whether uh you know a threshold in terms of the grounds for such a course of action could be reached well i don 't think that people that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come and give us legal advice so um i 'm i 'm happy that we take additional advice as to whether there are any grounds for the council to act but i i really can 't go further than that because um one we have no idea where where we end up in terms of costs if we 're not successful if we get an attempt an injunction and don 't have grounds then we 're liable for the costs that um that the delay will impose on sarah so i i want us to take proper legal advice before we decide and if it is as councillor johansson suggested that the demolition is not as far underway as sarah have said well then um we 've got time to take that to to get that advice but we can 't act precipitously we we did um and actually maybe that is something that 's um missing from from this report and that is is the uh the advice that we received in order to um raise the issues with um with him but um we 'll have it we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because um i don 't want to put us in a position where we 're releasing um advice that we 've received that would be technically covered by um you know privilege so um i i would want to take advice on that as well but uh you have an amendment you 'd like to move thank you um i 'd like to move that we request the acting chief executive in conjunction with the mayor to seek urgent legal advice and options for halting the demolition of the majestic theatre and i mean i 'm happy to add there noting the concern at the use of the section 38 powers to grant approval for the demolition if that helps give a bit of a steer as to why there possibly would be a challenge and it 's seconded by you ally ellie jones that 's great i just think it should probably just refer to the majestic and the resolution so that it 's really clear when people hold the halt the demolition of the majestic theater um the majestic theater and on sarah 's reliance on the on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether there are grounds here hey well sarah is the body take out the word and no not that one the other one yep that one reliance on section three so take out on the use of that 's right and 2011 is the date of the act great right is there any discussion there are grounds yeah sorry instead of these grounds there are grounds on whether there are grounds yep grounds actually for the for the actually it 's grounds for the council to seek to help the demolition because um we have to specifically know whether we have grounds because standing is one of the one of the issues seek to halt the demolition of the yep all right yanny um i just think it 's really important that we look at what we can do in this regard we have lost so many heritage buildings and i think everyone accepts that some post earthquake would have to come down i don 't think anyone imagined the widespread destruction of our heritage not from the earthquake but from other means that has happened in our central city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings within the central city and where either council or government owned publicly listed heritage buildings i think we do have a responsibility to look very carefully at how we can save those i know in the letter and i appreciate and really applaud the mayor for her letter expressing the views of council in regards to opposition to the demolition again it just seems really hard for us as a council to engage with sarah over some of these major decisions that are being made and i think using the section 38 for a non-dangerous building is something that we should investigate because it just seems like the section 38s are being used to get around the publicly public processes that would exist in a democratic society and in a democratic country like new zealand for the community to be involved in these significant decisions to destroy our listed heritage and so really i think you know enough is enough we 've been incredibly patient trying to work with sarah ccdu and government over heritage recovery we 're seeing more and more buildings getting getting demolished i think we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's going on but let 's get the advice i would have liked the advice today i do think there 's a risk i mean this is time critical that you know that the demolition will ramp up knowing that we 're looking at options so i just implore that this be done quickly um and and that action can be taken if appropriate cool thanks um look yanny 's right uh we have lost uh a huge amount of heritage buildings in in our city but uh but it 's actually because of that that um they 'll probably be voting against this because i i think it 's about picking your battles instead of pouring large sums of rate paying money and tying up council resources and lost causes i think we need to appreciate what we have got and concentrate on the battles that we 've already won and put those resources into i guess cherishing uh things that we have got left such as the our city building the provincial chambers sarah sarah 's been set up for a reason love him i hate him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there to make certain calls they 've made a call around that i 'll be really honest with you i think this is i think it 's a stunning book actually on the outside i don 't think it is absolutely stunning building i think inside it is a beautiful building i think outside it 's touch and go but it 's got wonderful stories around it you know the beatles were there i 've been inside there and i think it 's a pretty glorious uh interior um in a perfect world it would stay but sarah has made a call we challenged that and said hey pause pause there we want to have intelligent conversation what can what can be done and i supported that i supported having an intelligent conversation and you gotta you know you gotta stick it to them and stand up for what you believe is right every now and again too and we did that and they 've come back and they 've said on for what we 've got laid out actually in front of us that makes sense i 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and they have justified it and they 're there to make calls and i think let them make their call and i 'll just finally reiterate i 'm not supporting this not for any of the good points that have been raised which are entirely true by the previous speaker but the fact is i don 't want to tie up ratepayer money and staff resources into things that are lost causes there are things that are not lost causes that i think we could get better outcomes for and make better use of that staff time and better use of our rate pay and money so i 'm effectively foreshadowing the amendment there with the with the staff recommendation because i think that 's prudent it 's not this is an emotional call this is this is a pragmatic one so i 'll be voting against the amendment thank you wish to stand for this i think my own take on this is that if we give the power away whatever the realities we face in christchurch as a city council over and against sarah we actually do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do that in this case the letter from the uh from uh warwick isaacs would indicate to me uh that um there 's a different nature there 's a different understanding of the progress of demolition that in fact it 's not as far as it has gone it suggests to me there 's a predetermined agenda there he 's saying that uh because it 's already begun whatever that means that he 's unable to step in and stop it i don 't accept that we 're dealing with um far-reaching cows now saying well i 'm sorry under those same powers i can 't stop anything happening and i don 't buy that for a minute we 're talking about nine meters of a building we 're just requesting reasonability that the road could in fact be diverted around that building this seems quite an arbitrary demolition there 's another uh fine piece of heritage further along not much further along the street i can 't remember the name but it 's being uh preserved i would also thank you i had it in my phone and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we see uh heritage and both future uh built form enhanced by the fact that two sit against each other the new lee 's building and another heritage building which ross will also name uh know the name of so if we talk about the future of christchurch my argument is you actually need both if you want to know what the future looks like and if you want to know what the past looks like i would vigorously support us pursuing this to see whether in fact there are grounds for an injunction i think it 's important that we do do this and that we actually don 't just roll over thank you i 'll put that sorry um we 're going to have to adjourn the meeting and sit later this afternoon because there are other matters that need to be dealt with today so i really had hoped that we would get this the open part of the agenda resolved so andrew i 'll go really quickly in that case um yeah i 'll be um supporting this um this amendment um as councillor johansson says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings it 's become quite normal in the city to see buildings been demolished and i think in many ways we 've become desensitized to the the demolition of of some buildings that we would have been up in arms about the demolition of in a different situation um referring to councillor goff 's um comment that we need to terrify cherish things that we 've got left the reason for urgency around this legal advice of course is that this is a building that we do still have left at the moment we do have an opportunity to do something about this and now is the time to be doing it um to to be sending a signal on behalf of the the concerned um ratepayers and residents of our city um that we we are concerned about this and we we do have an ability to perhaps do something about it let 's let 's find that out putting this into the context of the way a matter like this would be handled overseas there are plenty of cities in europe where the whole traffic network is determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no reason why christchurch should be any different we 've got some great opportunities to redesign aspects of the city i 'm sure there 's an opportunity to consider redesigning the traffic network around that which is capable of being saved rather than just simply knocking buildings over to to come up with an easier solution so i 'm very supportive of this today so i 'll put the amendment all those in favor of the amendment say i those opposed say no would would you like your opposition recorded jamie gough raf mangy david east so i declare the motion the amendment carried i 'll put the full motion all those in favor say i those opposed say no that 's carried no well it 's a yeah that 's so that 's yeah that was an amendment to that and this becomes a substantive you know it 's that the information be received and that we request so that 's the so this was an amendment yep right um so can we go back to the building earthquake prone buildings amendment bill submission just quit,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

rolling over while I 'm just talking about a few things out of there out of it on our report here flooding to comes through for banks peninsula and over the last mile beginning of March we had rather severe event that was a Wahine outcome for some of the catchments and banks peninsula now this is just a small clip thereof of going of through Little River the whole of the Little River Township from one from the left hand side of the valley to the right hand side was totally a wash with water and you well you can see what what it 's likely it was a huge amount of rain very intense this is about the third event that we 've had in the last two years there are people that are not getting insurance payouts there 's a whole lot of issues around it we are having a workshop on the on the first of May hopefully that will bring everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year in 2013 rare another one there are a lot of issues around the flooding and Little River we need to be working with Environment Canterbury to resolve it because it is a catchment a large catchment that has large runoff from the hills and the needs to be some workaround stream work yeah and and improving the waterways and things around there so we have a number of issues but I just sort of thought well I 'll give you a little bit ours is not because of earthquake but it 's because of the catchment a large catchment and rain falls are occurring there are a number of people that lost bridges and we are in our particular catchment and the homes bay catchment yes there was a council bridge that 's gone and we 're having got Kollwitz that we cover to go through the streams and things so it was a severe event so I just was making sure that you actually had a little bit of feeling about banks peninsula and the ivory we oh yes floor live also a bridge I 'm not sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that from an hour meeting that we here on the first of May this is behind the shops and then if you 'll see a shop shortly that goes over from the other side of the valley and how that whole catchment was particularly affected from one side to the other anyway I want to move on from from that flooding if it we have had another one in a Curragh and we 've had a flood meeting a seminar on it to resolve some of the flooding issues in a Corral they have quite severe failing to also the at the first entrance to the town and we are hoping to work to get there we are you look across there that 's from the service station right to the other side of the hill easy it 's a mess of water so there are a huge number of flooding issues for banks peninsula and we need to be working through those we need to be seeing that housekeeping things are kept up to order like the Kollwitz and the drains clean than you call what culverts replaced and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we need to deal with it so callous me so just am moving on from that libera the community is getting itself back again the it is the end of the cruise ship season and we 've got one more ship at the end of the month and the community sort of says to itself we 've got our town back again we have had wonderful support from the City Council over the time with traffic management plans we also had this flood which affected the wharf and there 's been a huge number of issues that we 've had to work through during the time I just wanted to talk about the number of workshops that we have we 've got a cruise ship workshop we 've got a signage workshop with the community but freedom camping workshop that 's coming up we 've got an a chorale civic trust workshop that 's working with the City Council and all of these projects we have cancer staff working alongside us and really it 's a big thanks to the City Council and the staff that work with us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the City Council for this support and all that work what we 're doing so and I just wanted to also a little bit more about Little River on page 192 and we have met birch the gentleman comes and spoke to the board this was before the floods and he 's patient about this issue but little river has had a huge number of reports done on us over the years and I suppose we 're concerned that a lot of them get lost and left and so that we 're looking at pulling together a scoping exercise for the future development of the settlement of little river we 've been able to find some funding or the strength and communities have been able to find some funding for us it 's just a small study that will be done on little river to bringing all those together to look at what the next step might be for a suburban study of some sort moving forward so in all of these things are about resilience lien you know coming from the community wanting to do things and and move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glimpse of there are whole lot of things I could talk about the exes way down at buidling sled and all the things that are happening aboot since that 'd be lovely to be able to share them with you all but time doesn 't allow me to I 'm hoping that we 'll get an opportunity to come and have a proper tour of the part of the electorate as a council breath yeah yeah hi Pam so in terms of I mean obviously this is called Little River so obviously there 's a river that 's been there it 's been a settlement has been there for a long time you mentioned climate change and obviously it looks like a big river at the moment in those considerations has any thought being given to the fact that the actual settlement may be in the wrong place well it would be a huge effort to actually shifted we would you shift it to there are a huge number of issues around little river you know it was built a railhead and the in those early days when there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason it was there because it was sort of a feeder and all banks peninsula and then it went out that way and it is growing and that 's one of the reasons why I 've proposed we 're pulling together this little little scoping study to look at it and now interesting on this flood this flood also affected coop town which is higher up from Little River but it was affected by flooding but maybe it may be a more protected if there was some River works that was done to keep the flooding away from the coop town area where there is opportunity for subdivision and things but yes I mean it is a good question okay thanks I 'm clean thank you thanks Pam just under five point one in regard to freedom camping have you been able to differentiate with that issues there between those who freedom camping in those who don 't have other options and appear to be sleeping there that workshop hasn 't haven 't had that workshop yet so we 're just working through it now k holder his ring or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going to be a difficult issue to resolve because there 's only one camping ground and there 's no other area that 's available for it so we will find a solution that for our community you know yet with Holly you know free of camping or no I quite like transfer no Andrew Denton thank you very much thanks Pam for detailing the Little River flooding situation and for showing us the video certainly good to see those images at the same time as your explanation I just wanted to make the additional point that of course that road that runs through the middle of little river that we saw on the video is in fact the road that connects the rest of the peninsula to the rest of the country so when that roads under water it means that the rest of delighted yes certainly expresses some of the importance of getting that getting that fixed but we do have that workshop coming up which will address some of those issues and the the planning for the wider issues around little river hopefully will take into account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that and flooding as well so we need to have some adverse events planning in place there is a lot of confusion about when the roads open or closed and things but that will be dealt through that which up as well right Tim I guess through their workshop without you mention that little rubber is growing and I just can 't remember seeing it and all I must admit I didn 't really take much notice with regards to the flood risk areas I was more looking Eric Ward rather than others that with regards to new building consents etcetera because I mean it 's fairly significant there they are included in the plan but I can 't comment on what they are but I know there are flood levels in the plan to deal with Little River ok so i guess it 's realizing with those meetings that you 're having with then presumably counts the staff involved with those that we really make get a wheel with them building consents what the risk flood risk areas are in the river and Edgar are as well Peter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at summarizing what what the steps are for how to resolve some of the issues about mitigation and planning and a whole range of things and natural responsibility in it so he the Christchurch City Council Peter kingsbury is very good at doing that and I 'm sure he will be at our meeting and there is some responsibility on communities and individuals themselves to deal with us so moved by Andrew Turner so you can do by tom skerritt i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no thank you very much pam that 's carry the report of the booooored pegasus community

Board,jUxxKjY7HK4,20140409,663.39,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1850,hinda as the report of the little tournament mount hubert community board meeting 19 februari call a smoke welcome no my heart like he did particle rocky hoped greetings from eight special oh sure are this was was not no parties in this report but a couple of things occurred to the board we had a briefing from murder Cooper whose the syrah relationship manager we 've known as the board we 've known motive for quite a while because she was very supportive during the foothills Len zoning issues and we and that has a kind of bearing on on the way we were thinking when we later heard from one of our board members about an initiative which you can see on page 34 that 's been taken by the Ministry of Social Development this was raised by a board member Christine Wilson who works in her day job a little gentle community house which is an organization which supports the vulnerable in our community and she had been involved in this initiative and there are seven across the city including in the area that we 're include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well and she was describing this initiative it 's a capacity building initiative which seeks to employ a person to help organizations become have greater capacity in resilience I think I 'm a bit vague about it because this is all second and third-hand of course but the board 's reaction to this information was well why is this needed because Christchurch City Council already has a strengthen communities team that does capacity building and in our opinion is pretty good at it and so we why this was neat and so that 's why that is mentioned you well I did notice this myself when when I was reading the minutes of this meeting because I also noted that apart from monica who I also know and and who was a very strong worker in the Christchurch east area during the earthquakes herself so I mean obviously Sarah wasn 't in existence then so she 's gone on to their role but then there 's a team leader community resilience Sarah and so I 'm seeing community resilience and Sarah and then I 'm seeing the Ministry of Social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cost of one hundred thousand dollars to work on the resilience and strengthening of communities well if they spit five if they spent half a million dollars into these communities directly it would do a lot to support resilience and strengthening of those communities just to clarify the salary would be seventy thousand in the 30 years no no there always a bit extra but but the point is is that the overall cost to the government is half a million dollars for a project which if that resource was provided directly to the communities would do a lot more to build you know strength and resilience you know in a in a way that would be quite different from bringing an external help to fix a problem which somebody else has identified when in fact we know that these communities have got enormous strength and with additional resource themselves can actually do a lot we 've already had a submission from the Mount Pleasant Memorial people who 've told us exactly what a community can do when they 're actually given the tools to do it so well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a community group that was involved in writing the job description for this person so yeah there were a number of groups that were involved in the discussion is so it was a kind of bottom-up thing from that point of view yeah but but the point is is that is it is actually about somebody else providing an external resource to the community and the strength within communities and this is the resilience conversation that we 're trying to have as a city you know that the resilience it sure it there is a top down that is required but it also has to be built from the grassroots up and for me the strength of what we want to be able to do as a city actually comes from from the grassroots not from the top down so so I actually wondered whether one of the things that we could do arising out of this as to as to meet with Sarah the people responsible for the community resilience element of Sarah plus the Ministry of Social Development that 's leading on this resilience and strengthening of communities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get some sort of joined up approach that would actually start to build resilience rather than adding another layer of a temporary support for a period of time because it 's not presumably it 's not an ongoing support forever it 's and I just I just don 't think that this approach is sustainable I mean it was what I took from the report and it 's not a criticism of any of the organization 's I just wonder whether they haven 't kind of stepped back for a minute and thought about the you know the resilience approach that we 're taking as part of the 100 resilient cities network I mean it may be an opportunity to change the way we do things as well and think it will be yeah yeah thank you um did they talk anything about insurance or EPC cuz it just seems really odd to me that all this funding is having made available to make people resilient but still one of the biggest challenges people have is EQC and insurance and the government whether it 's Sarah or MSD seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough funding for the residential advisory service that they 're asking us to know pick up the cost and it just like I did they talk about the kind of wider issues that are causing the harm to people that and how they 're interesting that actually and from a policy point of view rather than just funding workers at the bottom of the club from what Christine told us that is not the focus of this project it is capacity building in the same way that our strings mean communities team do it you know getting people together upskilling they I don 't want to spend a lot of time and I 've been actually trying to determine what is the motive until we 've had the major so I think I thought I think it would be a point that i 'd like to have raised as there needs to be a thought up a project like range I better decisions that are being made the impact it 's having on people and rot resources are needed to enable people to get to you know to get satisfaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can we I 'm just a little concerned about the time I thought that okay well I 'm Glenn and then pulling think you was housing actually asked about the reason i ask because paula is that we 've information from them is well feel fund there 's a big gap know their housing supplements aren 't keeping up with with ring so I 'm afraid this looks like a mr. target you but what Paul is raised is the fact that we 've got these resilience organizational resilience roles within organizations that we are not connecting to as an organization and the suggestion is arising and it 's my suggestion arising out of what I 've read in the minutes that we meet with them to talk about how we might actually direct it well not direct but but re-engage with it with the community in a way that builds resilience from what we know is effective in terms of that communities own strengths rather than seeing this as a needs-based analysis that other people are doing to these communities Pauline did you ever a question but I fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top of page 34 that you 've actually requested some statistics guarding housing in any housing issues from the relationship manager we did so be quite interested to see when they come back and I just had a question about Wharton bradley park or dread can 't find it now but you 've actually years all you picked that out we 've you 've very by water was appointed both boards of a point of the same person but we going back at the knee architects it was just a first date in the wording it says is a council representative not can I don 't know yesterday because the autumn bradley park board was established under an act of parliament the arrow brady estate act and their appointment there were appointments at the time from all kinds of organizations including a library with a wide river community rowena rohui why rework council cell mount herbert council in littleton borough and from christchurch city so the Christchurch City Rep on the board now is park ranger Paul Devlin the Laughlin amount Herbert community board because it 's an elevation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a gorilla worry we 're points1 so they are all kind of council reps in that sense but three of them are appointed by the community board and one by the council the difference is that he 's appointed not as a representative of council but the council has appointed Barry Bowater is the representatives they choose to sit on it 's just strangely worded there is a council representative he 's not representing counseling when he represents the community board because we have appointed them which right I mean there are a number of trusts that have these strange anomalies I just I just wanted to clarify via yeah it 's something we 're actually looking oh there 's we 're actually looking at the autumn bradley park it in where maybe the board 's actually thinking about the possibility of asking for some changes to the ACT to be made to improve it because it has become a bit anachronistic for example there 's a rip from the automobile association supposed to be a bit bored and want to supply anyone in heaven for years that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move that the report be received do-over second time Scandrick i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye as opposed say no

March,-PfKU01Xbxc,20140409,355.65999999999997,"Christchurch, New Zealand",902,"was that we recommend to counsel to agree to the rebuilding of the changing facilities and toilet blocks on the site agree the council offers officers proceed with detailed design building consent in construction of the changing facilities and toilet including a corporation of artistic features where possible and that the council officers provide regular update previous updates to the higley gme community board including on insurance excellent would someone like to move there yani johansson seeker the pool lonsdale discussion ok so unlike the previous deputation this is actually one of the best insured facilities and that we have as a council the toilets who are insured for five hundred and seventy four thousand and actually the cost of the estimated cost of replacing as 365,000 but one thing that we asked as a community board there was actually a mural that was on the side of it that we had funded and we felt that although the designs are you know modern and and you know quite stunning it 's just that we felt that there really need to be a consideration around the artistic incorporation of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know in terms of the insurance we wanted to start to ensure that we were given that we had invested as a community board in those murals and artistic features of those buildings that that should be something that could be covered through the insurance settlement so I just think it 's really important to emphasize and highlight that fact that this will be a new modern building although I understand the clock has been saved from the old building and has incorporated into the new design which i think is quite a quite a nice thing to tonight ok Annie as part of the next year 's street art festival where murals are painted this year only in the central city but next year will be bigger that this perhaps be incorporated into that a few they are they are reputable international painters let 's just handle it yep the the exterior the building it may not well be actually a painting of an aviation incorporation of of the exterior so it may be something like an aggregate type and a finish which creates a chemical because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think the the important thing though was home actually there 's some fantastic toilets and Taylor 's mistake where we have used some artistic elements and what the community board was really I 'm concerned about was that as part of the insurance settlement that we were ensuring that we were getting the money that we 're probably entitled to to ensure that those artistic elements went back as part of that given that we had spent money you know not no small sum in the past on this building and that didn 't come through didn 't quite come through and the designs David East think you look I support this report as well and echo the comments from the Arnie and and Paul I also note that this comment under three point seven and the report about the coastal pathway and given some of the we 're dealing with this particular matter oh it is sorry ya know and it in the coastal pathway another construction and in relation to the surf club building and the toilet facility and given some of the controversy in other parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when when that pathway is being designed around the toilet and the surf club and there the activities of the circular fountain pens in any manner by the location of the the pathway I just noted a while back when we did have a deputation a few weeks back with the Mount Pleasant yacht club and I could see similar scenarios arising so just drawing attention that I think some concern needs to be given to the coastal pathway design in both areas giving adequate mission of all the activities in both areas yeah i think sarah your comment see here are essentially that that 's been well under greater than to the proposal the coastal pathway as it runs through that area as head no it is comes from there like seven club yep right all right i 'll put the motion will those in favor say aye that 's a person no carried that 's very good now if you if there any other measures that you want to know the the the other meters from those particular meetings are dealt with the last council meeting they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise it 's great thank you very

here 's no political power of the hundred million earthquake donations received by our city I understand the shirley area has not had one CN allocated to it directly apart from applications for Red

towards higley ovals new pavilions a hundred thousand to rebuild the damaged pines be tall 1 million towards a new youthful community center and Aranui we 're in a shirley feature we don 't live an

@ @ @ of all now i don 't want to criticize that funding allocation as I realize that allocating funding is hugely difficult especially in our circumstances in from my point of view I think anybody who does it really has a difficult job and I appreciate they do it but my point is this that surely never features we have probably two-point-five percent of the population in christchurch there will be 2.5 million a million dollars going to overall so do you think that should be perhaps 1.5 million that was available for the Shirley residence it 's not our discussions that 's not really a point on I she asked me for money at the moment but I 'm just passing that comment now our discussions work nest with the national politicians and housing New Zealand regarding this the skipton streetside have been very favorably received with housing using an intimating agreement but as a writer that we need to have counsel agreeing with the proposal and advocating for us and at present this is the only request that we are making that we are making to counsel to advocate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deland thank you thank you um so the chili community generally hasn 't made applications for funding it we 've made funding to community trust and to lottery and we again for this project for this prank okay so we 've been working on that for you know probably 12 12 months of doing we also looked at another proposal earlier on so again we 've got funders on side and we think we can we can give there and you made a presentation to your community board because I would that 's right we 're here that if they were very impressed with your presentation but did you feel that there was strong support from the community board yes yes yes everyone we 've talked to have had strong support and as I say that the area is lacking in these community facilities we are welling running one or two programs out of Helmsley school but most of the programs are run from our little building and him as Lee school isn 't really large enough either work for instance we had a Friday night meal that we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have 100 110 people coming and that was to build community within the area we rely use program associated with that that 's moved to him as we park up we are limited to 60 in terms the numbers it doesn 't have a commercial kitchen so we having to spend a lot more time tuna keeping that going but we are keeping their going great I 'm what Pauline thank you thank you for your deputation I was actually going to ask about the hem ously site but you 've just answered that question and I was interested in the fact that you said you 're actually training people can you elaborate on what you 're doing the year well we run a NUMA numeracy and literacy program along with hailey high school and terms of doing there and that 's saying to help people if they need to get a driving license or what other things also it helps people who are immigrants into the area any training in that in the little cafe that you 're running yes we do and we run a friday cafe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've extended that outside and put some covered stuff there so that people can sit outside as well again we probably have up to a hundred people going through on the Friday morning we gain we call it Finn Dalton and surely we have very nice baking that 's done by a lot of community members and we train people and teams of we 've got a coffee machine sitting in there so we send people to barrister courses for that and we have people that come in and help in terms of serving there as well so there are a number of yeah there are a number of users thank you and thank you for the work that you 're doing um a year we 're of any like overall planning exercise happening and surely that would kind of work through where the intensive housings going whether this community space for community so these would be with you know all the different change that 's happening there is there any overall process you are aware of what do you think that 's a get and something we need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other scams worth housing New Zealand we know that they 're wanting to put a whole lot of new housing in the air and also increase their the housing sighs and I think they 've got a new agreement terms of the conditions for for putting you know large number of units in the area I don 't this my understanding is there 's no real overall strategy from council and housing New Zealand in terms of the shooting area we just saw that I don 't say you know if we talked to a lot of community groups we can probably wing this complex from a data set at least 50 seen at a time we think looking a bit of an income stream terms of actually running it and I wonder if the odd annoyed community trust couldn 't help you establish those sorts of relationships because that 's precisely how they started you know over 10 years ago they began with nothing and have now built up to be the sort of community trust that I think that you 're aspiring to be would that be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I don 't know a community trust you know that the residents have come together to film a trust so that they can form partnerships strong relationships with central government and council in order to get exactly what yarn is talking about yeah I just wonder whether whether we could we could make a connection here and help you I mean I 'm very much in favor of supporting your ambition to have the the land made available one of the council can can provide a supportive better I 'm sure the two counselors from the ward would like to move and seek in such a motion and we could we could provide that support but I also know that I don 't know he started in the same position where you started or appear to be starting they are now a respected partner at the table when these things are being negotiated rather than an afterthought don 't heed to that the unity sure that surely trust as a klp for our ward your key local project we the communal work this you 're a key local project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established trust they have been going for a considerable time and also encouraging that networking I 've sent them out to the Belfast network to talk to Linda goodrem there for a very successful program out there so they 're very open to yeah you know sharing knowledge and growing yeah well we 've come to the end of the time but we 'll deal with it when we get to the Lord report but I think you 'll find that they 'll be support from the council for and thank you thank you very much for your dictation thank you for that 's right item number four is","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Patterson respective yeah I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on ourselves oh well we can through the long term plan we can put put put in projects and put funding towards proving some sort of pedestrian and cycle safety and some of those areas and the major cycle network that we roll out will do that too toxic you know I don 't think you get my point is there nothing we can do in the district plan that would enable us to to change you know how some of these areas of a sort of provider for at the moment you know like there 's nothing we can do to the in the district plan to assist their process of making those areas safer for cyclists can I just clarify and are you talking about say for example one of the civilians into masculine say each we rode are you talking about how we can potentially slow down traffic possibly there might be one of the reasons because I mean one of the dreadful accidents that just keeps heading known as people opening up their door and not seeing a cyclist coming behind them and I know we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the person to look but when you 've got that mixed juice and you 're much more likely to head parking on the side of the road I 'm of these busy streets when everyone is busy and flustered and trying to get in places and people were traveling at speed nowadays I 'm an only be used to buy that first and the olden days we didn 't have racing boats back then oops that old three event I think that the perhaps the best way to deal with it is probably through the major psych away program and the other work that councils doing in that space you but the major cycleway program isn 't going to deal with every one of these centers that 's why I 'm just not but it but it is the only way to deal with a speed and if that is the case then speed us something that we could do in the district plan it you know no speed is generally and we were just discussing that actually a few moments ago speed is set by our operational people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central city have got speed written unto their yeah that 's a recovery plan that 's a recovery plan is not to say that in our district plan so you 're saying that we cannot put any speeds and the district plan so no we 're in the country does a district plan have any speeds lock done to correct that 's correct districts and operational measure and the speed isn 't always related to the road classification either no I know hmm I know right any questions Road change for years can we were late by a few months in traffic coming measures to they 're also not necessarily part of a district plan and the sense that they 're generally done through we talked about suburban Sinta master plans but also main road type improvements that kind of thing but I 'm making those decisions that look at the road classification and say well what what 's the tips of this road as an arterial is it supposed to take through traffic well you know we 'd want to create a rope which does that if it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose then council might look at that traffic calming measures will slow in it down what 's record I 'm right the mot nguoi materials that here all right what what 's Montreal straight that 's in the central cities and our silence intra-city okay one right here Oh outside Seth more house there but it 's a main distributor yeah which is to click the road within the CBD is it because it slows down or or is what is that what it would be regardless thats barbados straight yes all the roads within the seat of the one the four avenues are either let the roads or super city planners called to distributors but but if it 's the same terminology and they were local roads and they were all so that is what they were before there 's no interest oh no they were changed and it was muddy and further recovery plan to encourage people to use the four avenues to go from one side of the city to the other and to protect the central city for justice people aces in the silver city MN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those one of them so why don 't they keep them one way that was a decision to both cry and basara a Yenta but there no but that the proposal that we put on they didn 't that keep the one waste and that we meet one of them we would be the drum circle city of Henry we propose to remove Devon ways of all of them of all them a serial decided to keep her from process cells pretty cool more yeah 420 Emma 's yeah and so tell me that with thee so what was it before it was a click the road so vital straight actually was a major arterial but that was that was a hangover 20 years ago the ladle street actually really bit those days it used to be state highway one because it was the T road here through through the country until we bought the Johns Road rusty road so tell me as is this but bios street hasn 't caught up on the 30k that it 's I 'll just check that I think it 's nice no it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was my dress before it was so that was also a major to your office Barbados was the one myself yeah it was my main officer that was the main through route through the country tunisia so that was city this how far we 've moved on 20 years from now we 're trying to update the district plan yeah okay no that 's that 's interesting because I just wonder whether we may need to maybe put this down on the list of things that maybe we 'd like to be able to do in other parts of the city as well as they have done the central city if they want some synergy between the central city plan and and the rest of the plan then maybe we could ask for it the other way around and give us the power to impose a lower speed limit through some of these areas Madame sheriff I 'm a fear that is technically possible to put a rule and a district play at six of speed limit and that is that I die like that look at me sure about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasn 't under the RM oh yeah no we 're under the area if we got a recovery plan from the minister that enabled us to do it or an order and council that enabled us to do it we would be out a dog yes yeah as they have done for the central city they 've asked us to look at whether we can create synergies between the CBD and the rest of the city plane I 'm just wondering whether that goes both ways and if it was that they 've been be a rule in city plan that sets a speed limit as a commercial activity in an embrace of that speed limit by someone who sits the speed limits would require resources seems but best kind of frame were in bed you 're talking about so you 're describing a process of setting a speed limit that applies only to one person council because it 's the council that controls that road oh damn all right that was just a good idea to the council okay you won yeah Jim Thome L&T that that 30k speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets to be self explaining so and what I mean by that is that they 'll be redeveloped so people will want to slow down bisutti kaiser now when they when they come across and that that 's owned that hopefully we won 't have big signs and flashing neon saying 30 case will more be narrowed streets and planting and you know traffic calming measures and those sorts of things that will that will encourage people to slow down to the indicator now because that 's a speed they 'll want to drive through there and when we look at the kind of wider issues of appropriate speed zones throughout the city that 's the approach that the engineers take it 's kinda like if you 've got a big wide Street and it 's long and straight you wouldn 't want to put a CD or 40 K zone on it because people just naturally drive faster and so it 's really about designing the streets so it explains the speedrun or two people as they use it you but reckon I 'm Road us into long straights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side and you 've got buses Paul runner yeah and that might be an appropriate place for for you to say well hey that that 's something that the operations people could look at and go or maybe that zone should be less maybe that area should be 30 or 40 KS and whatever else but we could do that outside the district plan review process all right no i 'm totally going up Jimmy we should kill you either the the item 16 in the City Planning here we got into the improved petition in the cyclist safety issue here I 'm wondering what 's the relationship between this one and any player or maybe the long-term plan for inside example by screen co is kind of busy rope ladder attracts a heavy motor vehicle pursuit but intersections a missile we collect a lot and also Amy saw also collateral collector law that 's quite easy in many the tracks pursue so cyclist or PDC sometimes you know to take a bike or cross the street is high risk but I remember when the community or people told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high priority we put into the kinder of a long-term plan but maybe started from the 2016-2017 so whether we put a spare one here where higher priority or not it 's my concept this this is a bit about assisting when when we have a new development so if there was a new development popped up on Springs Road that bit you know did you generate a whole lot of pedestrian movements then then we had the ability to say to the developer well we think there should be a bit across on odds from throat and and we can hopefully them to pay for food for that improvement the long-term plan and annual plans more about what what are the issues were aware of now and what is our program to to deal with those of course the developments pop up all over the place and the long-term plan is we don 't have ability in NF and afford sort of programmed to respond to every single development as soon as it comes through the door so that sort of makes gives us the ability to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause of your development you need to mitigate those effects by by improving patient safety we 'll deal with the problems that we already know about through the annual plan process but this is a problem because of your development because you 're developing on front row for example so ceniza if a new subdivision is not a directory in a new street noodle in f the surrounding area is existing law but they are sucks a new subdivision is in the nearby whether the developer need to bear responsibility of nice yeah so this will give us stability to look at that and to assist with a developer potentially needs to deal with that it 's a part of the assessment don 't have any case by case basis and we can just give us the ability to be able to look at that and and because council head to deal will deal with all these issues through through through rates then obviously that would obviously have a favor funding application with the in your plan so a valid showing developers if they 're causing the effect they mitigate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper in relation to that the names again so can you just give us the names I mean don 't do it now but give us the names of the streets and the CBD with their names that they 've given them and what the matches for the plan and whether it would be sensible to to have them the same and the second one is the back there some roads that are currently classified as collector and vice versa are actually acting as major minor arterial roads and vice versa yeah so some collector roads are actually being major or minor arterial because of the way that the check has redistributed post the earthquakes and that 's not to do with them the number of Road cones there are in a particular Street at in one time or how many road weeks they 're going on the CBD all at once but actually in relation to really relocated officers etc etc so you know that road that runs as a white the Avenue you know I mean me of arterial now but wasn 't probably designed as one so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the district plan as well because presumably once life goes back to some semblance of normality then the the status of the road will change and maybe we need a mechanism and here to state what their actual function is at the moment but in a simple mechanism for changing them over to the appropriate status we 're not infected changes but you don 't have to do that right now and I so just a it might be quite a useful little note that could be done would that be right yeah absolutely we can do that I was just checking my friends know that you actually can 't change anything in a district plan without a plan change so there is no simple way to change something in a plan other than go through a plan change route well then why just bother having types of roads anyway then I mean let 's not give them any names because they 're going to change is that I mean that that 's the trouble I mean maybe you can every a trouble committee you could create an additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer required anyway apply your planning brains to it breeds already proved to me that I can 't think these things through when I think about her who 's actually covered by disturbing the day week you might you might come up with a clever idea or you might just tell me that I 'm wrong and not it 's not possible but if it is possible it seems to me that we could actually we could actually provide a plan that speaks to you know present and future requirements in a way that doesn 't require us to go through a major process we could potentially even have two classifications in the plan relating to particular dates or something like that yeah yep all right anyway so is that is that all you would like us to look at you might have actually reached our capacity I 'll allow one more question or two more questions or any and it 's going bit bicycle parking so one we 've got a page on page thirty-seven point two in H here so then you 've outlined what the what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the building is up to the street and you 've got no room for parking then you 've got they may be constructed in a position which most nearly complies with the 30-meter prerequisite now why I don 't see why we have to have that differentiation why can 't we just say that let 's have cycle parking as close as possible to 30 meters from the nearest pedestrian entrance with it because then if someone wants to have a recessed front urgent for a cafe they can put the cycles as close to 30 meters as they can but there doesn 't need to be in the front park that 's what I 'm getting it so with pot this requirement n because we want to ensure that type of partner that 's provided as an accessible location we 've got no human cells with beautiful soft am but it 's wrapped around the back or an adapt for now we 're and you wouldn 't want what I 've Joe little and leave your body and so so we 're trying to ensure that cuts off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously issue before that cancel raced mentioned if you 've got no ability to put it within 30 metres of the of the front entrance closed year the interns is right on the on the footpath ID on the wall but I 'm going close as possible but there was my point exec I 'm trying to address the fact that if you do have a seat there because you 're wanting to use that for your cafe tables and then you have this this obliges you to put your bicycle parks in there because it 's there to be no more than 30 metres from your entrance ways just so I 'm trying to get around that so that UK FA has been able to hear Vell Frisco and not have to put the bikes in there so I mean so but there was the porthole point before though if you build a building this is the co whole case in this consent that I was sitting on a few months ago if you build a building to the whole footprint you don 't have to provide any car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park see that it the minute you put a recess and you do it and that was my whole point before you finish it with them what I 'm addressing because actually the factors that you have to provide cycle parking now in the new this is the new I only hope I don 't build to the if you build to the entire new proposal you have to provide cycle parks but you can if you 're building up to the street frontage you can put them further than 30 metres away then you don 't have to provide them what I 'm saying is I want to remove the I 'm wondering if we could look at removing that that they know more than 30 meters if you 're doing a recess because it means that you may I may not be able to use that space there 's pattern business so the through any way we can give some flexibility around their dens it depends on how you read their rule because the second sentence talks about it needs to be within 30 metres of at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be right and that right close to that public entrance it may or it may not be if it is then I guess we 'd have to look at it and we 'd have to consider a restrictive discretionary conceived but but which is to say that every single every scopus of dining is going to be within 30 metres of and it only says one main pedestrian entrance way you know if you look at riccarton more this water about three main entrance ways into the mall this on applying this to perhaps tick so you 've got a street and someone wants to build a cafe not in a more but on street right here and so if there is the only main entrances at the front and it 's racist off the street they have to put the bike park in there so I 'm just looking for flexibility some here and I see your point and we don 't want the cycle parks and stuff yeah way but I 'm just wondering who can find some flexibility without triggering a resource consent because it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that fear that that it 's about the more pictures you allow obviously the more people will use it to their advantage and we 're just we can stay on the rule so there is a balance between having having a line in the sand and throw the suppressor field hand have it principally but um we all heard of it but also if you are looking at one shot it 's a requirement for how many psychopaths 11 water depends on the size so it depends on the size so there again I mean that 's an understanding of all of the rules working here though if it 's one or even half parts and it 's not anyway we 're going to wrap up so one more question from Phil just following me everywhere on the committee just throwing that is what a point out the counselors that cyclists certainly like being able to park our bikes close to the entrances which is why it 's see what is good Curtis ask you briefly pets to explain what 's on page 16 briefly in terms of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say to large buildings and that kind of thing and how we can implement there so there 's on page 16 seven three-point-four minimum number of cyclo parking facilities right so yeah pay trip seen our assistant matters that calc you can consider if people don 't meet the minimum software pattern requirements which are on page 31 and 32 34 so yeah so if developments like provide a min amount of soccer patterns that top soccer fact that they 're required to do under page 31 to 34 then they will need to apply for consent and that 's the assistant matters on page 16 that are the vectors that we will assess they sinned against and decide where there is appropriate for them to get approval for that or whether it should be defined as they need to provide them there it goes all right Oh race you 're at manor and at the right place two artists but really a rail is this something that is going to be considered because I mean there 's a couple of things here one I mean obviously big picture considering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be silly not to think about rail we have the tracks we potentially have rolling stock from other areas of the country which they don 't want is this the right place to actually say we need to actually have a look at it even at a very basic level and secondly even in terms of rail corridors and potentially making sure we 've got the rail corridors and I 'm talking basic Rolleston Amberleigh in terms of the rail network and obviously littleton over the next i mean we have the technology now but imagine in 10 years when we 're looking at driverless cars for example again all that requires is corridor so windshield about 30 mile an hour speed limit in town they 've done the tests on driverless cars will show that that 's actually the speed that you can get a very free-flowing traffic network so I think to not consider these types of options now probably misses the opportunity even if you 're not going to put them in right a second oh this doesn 't restrict or director that rail should or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a directional net that 's probably a decision the council would need to make which sits outside of it okay certainly a little bit of a seat ESP provides a bit of a steer on that that direction and we are doing some work because there was a whole work done for the Crushers the drive crushed your central recovery plan we 're trying to collate all that bring it all together into something which is meaningful and then our ideas that will report a bit through to council but this doesn 't you know give us dear one way or the other as to whether rails of profit doesn 't matter other preclude sorry what one thing it does do they are Muslims as part of us that there 's some pretty strong provisions and the proposed fan over previous sensitivity and on the transport corridors so what that 's about is making sure that you don 't get highly sensitive activities residential it 'll be too close to rally right yeah good so so that is particular those for that poor give you but here are some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you everyone for the incredible effort that you put on to all of us and even answering my questions there you go elections thank you very much down but we really appreciate it and look forward to our next session next week 17 p.m. thank you,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

14,xQWhMXRqtBU,20140409,982.119,"Christchurch, New Zealand",2539,thought that like the integrated transport assessments are what deliver the integrated transport system which is the objective but i think what yani tseng and i could be wrong as that and it 's a little bit about what the joint official said to that there needs to be clear linkages with the subdivision and development chapters and the zone chapters so there so there it 's actually an objective of those chapters that it feeds into a single integrated transport system so that the developments the subdivisions that they aren 't them you know by their prisons and the cumulative effect which is why I 'm still just a little bit worried about who does why not because of the wanting to absorb more costs into a decreasing rate base but because I that is its than the interest of the city at the hole that somebody 's actually taking into account those cumulative effects that Jonnie is talking about and they may not be pepped up in a single assessment of each individual development so as long as the as long as the chapters that deal with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got sitting and amongst them the need to comply with these objectives then then there is the risk that we won 't that we won 't take full advantage of this that 's the way i read the joint officials anyway and that 's a good comment I mean they do need to they do need to work together so perhaps we can look at that and look to see how we can wor integrate that certainly though as Brent says I think that needs to come through objectives objectives and policies the rule is the delivery mechanism only yeah and depending on which level of consent whether it 's full discretionary or not all the objectives have to work hand-in-hand they 're all considered not one later but in the other needs that this one 's saying that the a single integrated transport system that is accessible for blah blah and it 's under grated with land use well actually land use has to be integrated with the transporter yeah which is the other way around okay look we 'll have a look at that yes if what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so so under if you can flip back to slides please so the next one I 'll cover is the the road classification and it was raised earlier today as well so there have been some requests from some some submitters for changes to the Rope education so just as a summary that the records patient 's a biz maps and starting on page 51 and a list of all the roads that are fast quite either as a major arterial mine arterial or click the road and so there were some requests for some rows to be to have a different classification maybe maybe a high presentation or a low education and what the submitter wanted and if there was also a request through the sea job that we look at look at how we can incorporate the one network rotation that the New Zealand Transport Agency and local government is cylinder working on at the moment as I mentioned earlier today council developed their own classification system it went through a public consultation through this document and the price of transports treatment plan example years ago and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this document so that 's why we have ensured that their own education is very similar to this hesitation ISM the equation transfer the strategic plan and the the National Road classification is still a work in progress so we that we are the very consistent whether it was with what went through public conservation what the public vomited on a couple years EO we 've had a look at the one it with specifications at the draft that 's out at the moment what if we and in the future wind down that path and ends up with what the conditional this question is saying it would involve quite a number of roads probably being raised in terms of the classification so quite a lot of local roads there are currently local roads and people may important that on that local road which was it because the white nature of it may become an arterial road or may become a collector road because the thresholds at a national level are a lot lower than what we have come through this plan and we 're still waiting to hear from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so what that will have on community so we there is a very concerned how much we take these out of that that new has fashioned for the ball will fit I 've probably got a quarter of the roads and the city will end up raising in their status and that may mean we more through traffic on some roads and limit our ability to to reduce from the through traffic the the National hesitations very much been produced to drive London and that 's what other than is the on turn four agencies roles so they 're trying to get a consistent approach to ensure that roads across the whole country look the same and and kind of accordingly so so so that we 're not finding roads and powerful more than we 're finding roads and tomorrow or whatever so that 's all debts and is on transit agencies sort of main goal behind the initial hesitation we 've we 've got some concerns that have been adopted right now we will end up affecting the way we came in and Jenna quick in terms of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public went through public consultation couple years ago so that 's why we stuff into the the public document that we went through and we 'll have to talk about the future within the National possessions it 's made fine David did you have a question or are you just holding your hand at me here waiting patiently look since then the road classifications and and and here a road such as married her road our sins road to goo wood road can be deemed a collector road and then a minor it 's a minor arterial of greater significance from booooored road through the round the back of the hospital to frost road it just seems expectancy the back-to-front or or something wrong there but what 's lots of criteria to actually classify our own there are a number of criteria and we 've listed as a section 32 document so a pinup sets turtle to the event of a loss document it depends on the number of volumes that look traffic it of the road carries the mario road between Martians Rodin and Berlin road which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of old ones it can be called a collector road and it 's probably the most jammed up piece of berry hill road out there and yet it 's a collectible but that 's one we 're having traffic lights on and adansonia is only collect arose yeah but if it comes a minor arterial once you hit between goo hospital and frost road here there 's a reasonable amount of traffic on there but I by father if you trap it 's coming off my sins right that splits it at at boo at hospital and the traffic volume decreases them what they go in all directions there but I just can 't fathom how as well just asking what 's the criteria Harrow Road come on one side of an intersection B collector and on the other side it 's a minor arterial is it just seems to be completely back from so far fear to presumably Martian rotors the arterial there is the connector yeah it 's because the volumes between Marsten Road and beer wood road on Mary herro because most immersive rural at the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be with hospital cause of the hospital traffic there 's a lot higher and the fact we 're putting in Jack applies emotions road and prior to that you get a traffic backed up from marshalls road pretty much back up to the hospital the tripadvisor motion road is a partly because of the amount of traffic on maxim 's road tomorrow allowing Trevor to get off marry her oh yeah it 's because of the significance of the traffic movements down Martin right yes but also the significance of massive the road doesn 't have an S on the univer by the way Hara Hara road booooored road in both directions onto onto murray hill road and out onto Martians right I think it just doesn 't make sense that that 's what you 're saying that it 's just Delta it 's done purely on account of traffic is it right no a little bit there 's one of our key area but there 's a number of other criteria if and I 'll take you through this more detail if you want up if you look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with hospitals forms part of a sort of a link from from sort of preston 's road through to to parklands and so so Preston 's road and then the part of beer would road up to build a hospital is also mine arterial and and so it 's sort of forming part of that at T connection and it loves the tubes bill at hospital which is of the one in a key hospitals so it 's partly because of the perfect counts but it 's also partly because of the key roads that the dead metros serves and that 's to that road suits burwood hospital and there 's a lot of the traffic movements to probably what hospital do what hospital is going to probably expand or there 's been redeveloped alone so we are anticipating future growth the SS prolly wild like we are looking at future volume increases on that part of Bill of Mary high road well it doesn 't make a lot of sense but but do road classifications then flow on to speed limits and other treatments of roads as well they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obsessions made right here at motherload of a major arterials have 60 k speed limit there 's usually not a difference in speed limit between a collector and admire arterial it means with its in a rural area or a urban area but there 's a lot of other factors around speed limits as well so it 's just because of aromas own I wonder who doesn 't coordinate minutes gonna have a higher speed limit can we fix the speed Lasher on Preston throne while we 're here hey you 're wondered with you needing an iteration but this the designation of the road is not for any purpose other than the connections of the roots you know like us it 's to get a sense of the network as a that 's right and the purpose of it haven 't the district plan is really about what what what what access we 'll reel out onto that road so so what drivers will be allowed and if you have if it 's a minority rule then is more or you need to ensure that the driveway is designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example yeah and so that 's why roads with high traffic volumes there 's more concern obviously about people 's backing onto those roads they 've been on a local street so it 's more about the different plan about how that the land use is integrated with the road so how the excess from the from from the land use light field hospital is designed so that we don 't cause issues on the road and as opposed to what the speed limit is that that 's more operational matter of it that 's exactly my point for the rest of my O 'Hara road you 're talking about you 've given a minor arterial classification to the portion between booooored road and frost road and presumably you want to be looking at sort of access issues and things like that and then you have this other section of Mario road which ostensibly is through farmland ATK speed limit on it majority of it and I would thought that access to it and people coming off and on and off it would be more of an issue it should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the classification of that the whole of that section it just doesn 't make any sense at all we 've also got additional to do additional access requirements for the rural roads for a lot like that so that 's why a lot of debts is required some really around urban roads yes rural roads with is a high speed limit yes we 've got even more real requirements to ensure that there is an issues for the speed of the vehicles so there 's not so critical to for that part of America 's just captured towards a rural road and this is unlikely to be much excess off it anyway because of the restrictions around rural development busch gardens are verily the other end of the prison subdivision other 18 months or so we 'll come back out onto that road anyway so yeah internet will continue to expand these there is provide for them so we can have a post look at Mary harrows that 's a case doesn 't want that but I 'm getting worried about the time here so wandering alone how often do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face of the city and look at my dress street I 'm sure that was once a major arterial it 's done as a collector that 's rapidly becoming a minor arterial as we speak and how often are they revisited what as know the previous district plan was put in place more than 20 years ago and no but but plan changes can occur at any time however generally two years past the date which this proposed plan would become operative any time after that all we can even do a variation during the plan change but that 's not required at the stage so so if Rose do change dramatically in the next few years we can do a plan change to change what type of classification it gets if it 's necessary a counselor plan change,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

13,rh82IN2Bj3o,20140409,1202.3,"Christchurch, New Zealand",3299,now i 'm just so i 'm just concerned about the you know they 'll be I 've seen this before it 'd be a lot of requests for information and climbers money so on yeah just want to have the sticks up we want to keep it has it done yeah so that 's why we put together guidelines and we 're encouraging people coming for pre-application medium come talk to staff to ensure that everyone is clear on what information is that needs to be provided so that hopefully if the information the it 's complete then there will be no need for any further information request so we 're trying to help we didn 't have your lines in the previous city plan so we 're trying to provide as much dignity as possible so that we can ensure that everyone 's on the same page and we can get these through that 's quickly as possible I think I mean the concept is really good you know the you know and I 'm all in favor of it it 's just that for me it feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be you know once this triggers we should be checking to see whether it does meet our requirements as a city and in really only putting an onus back on them if it doesn 't so that 's how it feels to me but others obviously know a lot more about it than I do so not as you know I just wanted to say that I think it 's a very good concert it might be that especially around the threes the threshold for the residential part that needs to be fine-tuned but going before refer to two so the categories like a basically a 4-1 going to say that we 're just the sum nickens of the light really assistant will be in the beckenham shopping center where if this had been applied you wouldn 't have the chaos which unfortunately still have so there are some your streets to just as a mechanism well but nothing that happened in lincoln road would have triggered it you know like in that particular area necessarily i would have thought it was a safe for a shopping a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking about their developments the office develops on Lincoln Road the threshold is 900 hundred the city square meters of which first floor area and i must say all these thresholds are based on New Zealand Transport Agency going on Chester how much development have a happier development is before it triggers to an effective vehicle movements today so yes there may be occasions where you think oh this many students will turn more than in this many residential developments but actually there 's a lot of research behind this that that is about 10 trips per day per house so 992 houses generate 9200 but certain 920 and trips so yeah there 's quite a lot of research behind us is to make sure we 're not very onerous on one development over another yeah I would speak so I I haven 't been involved all y 'all sit on it but but I know some of the large ones definitely would have yes 916 as quite as malaria and her office but what what would that theme do like so so you get the integrator traffic assessment what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that requires them to provide us information as to as to the type of development that they 're providing what what how to providing for a different modes and and and how their maintenance Ronettes safe and so forth as I mentioned before and so that they 're all be lodged with council and the resource was an application and house Trevor engineers or if we need need additional support from consultants will look at that and check that and efforts all find then in the temple will likely be granted if there are issues then we have the ability to require and changes to the environment or even in some cases so this is not appropriate location for this type of development which so so you could actually do that you could say that this this is too large for this road to cope with that I go back to the the commuter forfeit so you 've got Lincoln Road and they 've got a lot of new buildings going on down there you put a one building doesn 't initially have a big problem may not even trigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three rules you know there 's give me a number of buildings so there must be a cumulative effect which should have an effect on potentially all the buildings so continued buildings have a small street you know just going to even have long-term you can have some major issues so with one goes you know there 's going to another 45 so I 'm just wondering is it is your a mechanism for that in there yes yes they were persistent kind of like that people were in the pond you can see need to consider the it 's around the environment and inherit that some of the surrounding violence and so without entertainment council there the existing problems and show them that only set about them the they need to consider that as well yes yeah yeah then how much of a social housing filter was put onto this because I 'm you see before about it 's based on residents team trips a day I 'm not sure how many of our tenants help vehicles and some dude I 'm not sure with that make ten a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being here but they 're socially housing unit yeah we all these averages we could have a much longer for more complex less than have a whole lot of exceptions for different types of atividade but never make a much more complex plan so we 've simplified it and put them as averages but if people come in for a contingent say look this is all social housing and we have evidence to show that that the people will not provide or not have as many trips as what its standard house has then that will help and consent process and that they all do reduce their their effects and probably more likely it will be non notified or and will be granted that will be weighed up when we go through this is minh does this apply in the CBD as well no so we had this um well as some of the approach to this on the draft scissor City plan that we that helps put together in 2011.the zero with the ccrp they changed it slightly so so there is a requirement but if it is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a retail zone did this doesn 't apply and we 've already had issues where we have had quite we 've hit the retail development and the retail zone which has caused it fits on the transport network tell us because of the size of the development and at the moment and this is our people we chart out with there is no mechanism to to look at those pics and so that that 's one of the four teams behave that 's why we 've introduced us and we introduced it in the original plan so that 's some but the ccrp came was approved before the regional policy statement required and territorial assistance so there 's a historical issue here as well so they might want to update their there again so this is another one that we can take the box on yeah put on the luster put ok they will not want to put this in a single city for housing like this I can guarantee you it 's in the regional policy statement so at the end of the day we will be obliged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there before so we have to have a conversation about it but we have to have a conversation about it I mean I you know and I 've kind of got this thing that 23 seems awfully like yeah and you know if we 're talking about the 400 development that we know is going on to the CBD then I 've got no problem with that obviously I mean I know that the piece is going to build a car park building anyway which will take some pressure off other people so it 'll be great but it seems to me they 're not having this I mean have such a big process sparked off by such a small development just doesn 't seem right to me but what if we increased it to the size of a substantial subdivision and its impact on the neat way we use that one so the thresholds for the full assessment is on page 22 so so this so the threshold on page 14 us for the basic assessment page finito is the full assistance and it 's between oh I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a picnic transport network there 's also the release ability for us to ensure there is accessible for modes and some of the conversation you had before around to other versions and ensuring that they provide local shops that people can walk in the shops and ensuring that that is the footpaths are wide enough and the roads are wide enough and so forth the so they 're perfect for new Greenfield subdivisions it is but for brownfield sites that there is no I DP requirement for brownfield sites yes but there 's no required from an outline development plan in those areas for the system urban areas so there 's no requirement if someone buys up an entire block in one of these many visitors into the areas in redevelopments there 's no requirement for them to put on any amenities for the tent for amenities for the developments well we can assist have her posters to those of immunities until we have an appropriate for assessment is a million hits the areas are close to amenities but but people could also and take a reader up a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it to a lot of density then originally better still no requirement that they provide for the needs of those residents yeah Annie do you know when the last do you know when the last time was that we said no to a resource consent application because of high traffic generation or traffic issues I think well I think certainly for parking requirements you 've been several hundred consents applied for an granted over the previous several years but but what they doesn 't take into account one of the reasons why we 've put forward the approach that we 've suggested here is to minimize those are necessary consents but what it doesn 't take into account I guess is the negotiation that goes on once people put the consent in the door and what 's actually granted so while they can see it might be granted they might be granted you know as to what the people I guess I 'm really trying to understand as light do we ever get to a point where we say sorry that development is just totally incompatible with that area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know on to fury road that 's already a minor arterial carrying major arterial traffic and the network can 't just just can 't go so no you can 't have a traffic light you can 't have an exit going into the road because actually the traffic network can 't cope with the high traffic generations it 's difficult to turn people down on traffic affects right yeah so I mean I just think we need to understand that this is a tool by which hopefully we would get a more holistic approach so we would have hopefully an evidence base for saying actually sorry then supermarket in that location the traffic network cannot cope and we can 't give your consent it just will not you know like if you take lincoln road for example yeah if we if we had a proposal that the only way you can mitigate the traffic was to put another traffic light I 'd be quite shocked but that would get consent in the new plan I 'd completely understand why it would get consent on the old plan you know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have some key community of assessment of traffic affects I don 't quite know if this desert whether this is still just looking to local or whether this has the ability to look at all the other potential development around I think this is the best tool that we 've got and the in the toolbox and you know the key things that these what I TAS do was that it 's local and you know if you look at Lincoln Road it does pick up on all those issues those those immediate effects around there and you know when people come unto us with these these integrated transport assessments what they 've been asked to do is a see sit in that local context so it 's got to be specific to that area and the existing effects that already you know occur along lincoln road so it should take all those things into account and you know if something does come in and it really does push the boundaries too far this is the mechanism through which we can say will not hang on it 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you considered that we would actually do this so because one of the other problems with our district plan all but the RMA is who can afford to pay it 's what they want so you just keep hiring more experts to give you different expert opinion to what the council has and if you can afford to pay more and more and more give more advice and they sort of they get permission because they get so much advice spend a lot of money and you know it 's kind of like if you can spin the money you can get consumed so you know the idea that we would do this kind of independently if you like of the developer any neither maybe recover some of the costs or you know do it in a different way have you given much thought to that because all I can see is light if you 've set through regionals content hearings where traffic 's been a contentious issue you get you know three different traffic experts all saying no no there 's not going to be this amount of traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like orphans and when someone comes in through this process they 're required to show to counsel that they avoid remedy or mitigate the effects and traffic 's no different to landscape ecological or anything else so the onus is on the applicant to provide us with the information and in the general processes that we assess it but we do have models which are available for people to use and gain access to so that sort of thing is as available to the public or to developers the other issue I 'd say if we were to do it ourselves would be one huge cost to council because traffic modelling is a really expensive process and there 's just so many parameters and variables that go into it and as you 've correctly pointed out you know when people come in you have two or three traffic engineers and it seems to go on forever if we were to do it ourselves I think there would be one cost to time for us as well in three week we kind of do it to a degree and that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but for us to do it for each individual development and would probably be going beyond our role as the consent authority I 'm not sure breezy own opinion on that cancer to come in some Network ones that effort that when the application comes council offices assess the application if there 's anything in it that raises a flag they didn 't get the council 's own exists ever look at it so the council 's own traffic engineers or a consultant traffic engineer has a look at it and that 's the costs that she tied to the acronyms that 's the cost of processing the application that the applicant peso so there is often that independent chick anyway and most of the most of the contentious can sense that I 've been involved in the time at the council they had seen their case of an exit on one side and then the council expert also having a look at it so that happens anyway yeah you asked a question before about the ability to decline consents under the assessment matters or the integrated transport assessment the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority is processing it doesn 't turn so much on the assessment Metis there but more on the objectives and policies that the rule is made under so so if your concern is about the ability or strengthen tips what what you 're asking that we have a close look at the objective some policy and that rule is made under so that of something well once a ceased under the assessment medals looks like it 's not going to achieve the council 's of Jesus we have to actually see what those council objectives are and have been really expressly set out in the plan so that someone 's able to say well no it doesn 't mean I guess what worries me though Casilla object has become so wide that people can argue any objective see what they want and it becomes quite hard whereas if you had a very discreet traffic assessment that basically said lot theory roads are minor arterial and allowing a thousand extra vehicles on ferry road is just like I mean it 's just ludicrous because actually I can 't code and before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual concedes ferry made development win ahead there was an environment court to a high court case and you know it was pretty critical of the high traffic generation and the cute of lack of assessment of community of effects so there has to be a better way than having that sort of you know kind of wide-ranging argument over does the central city you know objective have more weight than the industrial pyramids own objective in terms of a vibrant prosperous economy etc etc yeah I would have thought traffickers one way that you could actually do that,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

12,SUvme8i6cZo,20140409,1323.63,"Christchurch, New Zealand",3256,eyes of the unit as well and f where yeah if we could get a general idea of what size that we 're looking at on the impact because there are two things that are kind of going on and one is the flow-on effect onto the street but then there you know it will come a point where we 're in certain parts of the city there is only so much that you can absorb really by way of transport accommodating you know two three four parking spaces for it for one unit which is what 's happening an all-consuming the same level of car ownership amongst there is a trend amongst teenagers now not to buy cards and so I always mean we 're returning to the old trend where teenagers couldn 't send bike so because of the seeing it as a liability rather than SE and so is are we sort of extrapolating based on current or the the last two or three years of changed behavior sort of this one of the reasons for going bit gently down down to just one for your house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that 's about 1.7 cars per house on average so it 's less than two that 's why we thought to was really a bit too onerous but for some houses so moving down to one it 's pointing out better in that direction that there is a trend to to reduce our ownership over all and if I can add to that of course medium density has been proposed around KAC so there 's more ready access to public transport yeah so um a lot of suburbs over the last 15 years the streets have been narrowed as you know and like Eddington as an example and and we 're there 's not enough room for cars depart on one property they 'll pack on the boom they 're kind of thing and then the streets are quite crowded with cars everywhere so is that to to your approach going to help address that especially for example when there 's new developments and some of those old streets in ellington like brownfields yeah well if its larger houses yourself up obviously they 'll need to provide two with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues around Eddington is this altar with a commercial development around there as well I was a girl from that from the violent and just sort of supposed to pick up related that on the Hazelden developmen from what I understand the reason why that cutter part was the motion I we can clarify this but was it was the earthquake damaged and from what I was on drove past into the other day it 's been rebuilt now so I think it was a temporary it 's quite damaged su rather than a dash will change to their to the parking reference welcome I mean I just wondered whether we 've we 've thought all of this through because you just triggered my mind over the use of that phrase key activity center and when you 're thinking about our desire to get you know sort of off street cycleways and in bus priority lanes then increased on street parking as an mo to that so there 's just so much to work through us and there that that there are multiple multiple users particularly in those those main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the those those important arterial roads in terms of public transport and cycling and maybe even cycling off those arterioles but you know alongside or adjacent to just that 's why we haven 't removed the minimum pattern requirements and district centres and we 've owner averted from the local neighborhoods think it 's because it 's likely that those districts into this is going to be aware that public transport priorities needed to be and maybe separate safa lanes so we 've realized that there is a real tension and those theatres is too funny the small smaller local that no one since we were provoking them Sir okay so we 'll come back to that but what 's a little bit more information we 'll make a decision on which one we notify thank you ok so I 'll move on to the next issue yes yep so the next slide please Linda so the next issue was around the integrated transport assessments and we once again head sort of what Polaroid can you do direct us to a page sure yeah yeah so page 14 so just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have a rule called the high traffic generator rule which means any development that generates more than 250 vehicle movements a day is to apply for a consent and that 's a process where we can look at whether the development is going to cause adverse effects on the transport network and we can take pic outcomes like safety and ensuring that their access is adequate so that 's on the current city plan we since the sense of the capital plan was written in the last year or so the Regional Council through the regional police a statement now requires all district and City Council 's in Canterbury to require integrated transport assistance for substantial developments and Angelo transport system is a process which originated from from the UK but it 's now been used quite widely and Auckland and Kerala and and Hamilton and queens down and what I understand and it is sort of rowing in use across the country to to ensure that largely Ted and not just for traffic but they also cater for all modes so some of the concerns that were raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access to into supermarkets and three Tapout sand under shopping malls and good good cycle access and good public transport CS and also obviously good safe car parks a nexus for the cars as well can all be considered under and transfer assessment so it 's much more motive model assessment then what previously we head under the current city plan and so what we what we 're suggesting and what we put out on the proposed plan for consolation was that we require that these high traffic generating activities so the seventies that generate 250 vehicle movements a day require provide these underground transportation so we can assess whether they are providing for all modes and also in a safe in a special way so it doesn 't cause issues on the company version and different for safety issues so for a clarity and pursuant he will because it 's always been hard to throw to work out what activity generate 250 bilkul movements a day we 've translated that figure into these thresholds that are and the box at the top of page 14 which shows the some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those developments that would need an integral transfer assessment so this this is Ben we 've been seen as best practice to do integrated transport expense apologies Oh Land Transport Agency and so we 've had some support from from the siege over from the paid members to have any road transfer resistance but we 've also had a number of comments from from some property owners and from some sort of property groups saying that they think this is too onerous and and that i would like to either see this completely removed or their activity their own business except from this requirement or or have these thresholds raised so that they had to go through a consent process can you just run through what an under grated trace of traffic transport assessment does sure probably the fear to write right at the end so page 84 and 85 the appendix which has a thickness of the plan of families that we would we would require a developer 's development to provide details on so it can be assessed as to whether they are providing for all mode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we would require would be obviously a information of the kind of activity that is proposing Herrick sisters for for all modes with your walking or cycling or by public transport or Claire how much part in your providing and then sort of an assessment of their fits of that and he may be a mitigation so what so why would anyone object to doing this I mean that 's what I can 't understand here 's his here 's a plane that makes sense well well how much does it cost to do an integrated transport assessment I think one of the key things to note what 's what 's been proposed in the transport chapters is there 's a basic and greater transport assessment which is something which is not going to be expensive and shouldn 't require any modeling or anything like that and then there 's the full ITA which is really for those significant projects where you do have to do quite a bit of work so I think of the basic level the cost should be huge and it 's definitely best practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at you know your PT excess looks at how people can cycle their walk there and everything else but certainly for those significant developments there is going to be a bit of work required and as soon as you engage traffic engineers the cost does get up they don 't come to but why don 't we do it for people i mean you know i mean it 's it seems to me that it 's a public good that this work is done and I mean I I know that you can force a developer or I mean some of these are quite small developments yeah so but I would have thought yeah so more than 23 residential units will spark a an integrated traffic assessment at thus leave all transport assessment so I 'm just I 'm just wondering what why is that a private benefit it 's a public good surely that we have an under grated rentals I mean at the moment I know that we 're writing the moon and obviously they haven 't worked before because that 's why we get traffic I don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ integrated transport solution it 's not the city isn 't that why we exist to do this work yeah we 're going to help assist the developments to ensure that they we help them as much as as we can without guidelines to explain quite clearly what we expect the reason why we need to get rehire very good traffic engineers we 've got excellent traffic engineers yeah so the reason why we need you and we will use those and but the only way we can use those traffic engineer expertise that we have is we need it to go through a sincere prices because otherwise if there 's no trigger that an idiot wrote and sent in Council won 't be informed of the development and the development will just go ahead so until there 's some trigger that yes you 're going to put a no a new supermarket or something we need to have a tree on the plan so that we can get out at traffic engineers to have a look at this development and work with the development or ensure that there 's no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can we can intervene okay well I 've got Tim vinh phuc e then Paul so my real my only concern with this is would be if it was made easy to regard to those residential roads or smaller streets wheres a daycare have been opposed and that 's the real a showman we 've got one inch and liev I thank you know there 's a couple of others around now sit on a couple of hearings with regards to them so I think for those areas it 's really important to those residents have a very good and robust system to protect the kind of the areas of the living and so they 're not certainly going to be inundated with cars parked and trebling 24-7 or whatever it is so there is a reason for it and it 's very important about you Vicki by putting this as a requirement for any block of more than 23 residential units we 've effectively unloop the loop and that what we are seeking to do is to intensify development through all sorts of Design Lead mechanisms but suddenly having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have any clue about what the people coming into that unit which is not sold or let to anyone at that point is going to use as their mode of transport is just fantasy so I absolutely cannot sit 23 is for example more than the exemplars that the housing New Zealand are doing there too it will be more less than most of the council social housing needs to do towards to redevelop any block it will be less than practically every private sector development for affordable housing and it 's it 's based on nothing we have no clue the mode of transport of the people coming into those units so all we would do be doing is making up data because there is none and delaying the whole building of those houses so I am totally totally opposed to at such a low 33 shoulder for residential activity and if it was maybe 200 or 400 or 600 or something I could understand it but 23 is actually quite a modest development so I carry up to the point of it let 's counselor one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a standard parking requirement being exactly those social housing if we had the two come two packs per unit then it 's not it that so one of the reasons the advantage of the ITA is if we stuck with the standard of two car packs per unit say for the social housing then that requires those people to come and ask for us to do a dispensation from the car parking what the ITA does is exactly the social housing people can come and say we don 't need all that car parking because we have this type of development this is exactly what it provides that opportunity for but you may not even require one great so so what is trying to say there is there are some advantages for reducing the amount of car parking or reducing things which is difficult to get under the current plan so but through you madam chair I think one of the key things for that the 23 that 's it the basically will vie ta that I referred to before so that that the requirements for that are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 90-odd ver 9292 for the full integrated transport assessment so in terms of slowing down development read your concerns about that it 's not going to be a really detailed assessment that we require at the 23 level but it will provide some good information as to what the likely effects of that development will be and that will help counsel as a consumer Authority to consider whether those effects have been avoided remedied or mitigated they would be attached to Cathedral yeah basically see job comments and I can 't recall specific there is MV that bothers housing is he on corporation certainly there 's generally support from the sea job for the whole ITA approach because they 're seen as best practice and nzta have even written a guideline on them and given direction as to what shouldn 't she be in them so we 've followed that and but I 'm poor and then Flynn my concern is around the residential areas where new activities take place where it does is she cause major congestion of roads and the scene of a up towards the airport with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there the impact that has on the streets and I 'd be concerned to see that a developer is actually putting that charge back onto the right power thing the modeling is about right maybe it 's just how that charge has put together but i think the developers do ever have to provide us with surety that the developments not going to destroy the residential immunity ugly yes how much will this add to each unit in terms of costs you talked before about the basic anemic form it would depend on on the size of the development I mean for a basic all we 're really asking that 's just a series of questions and to put for developers to tell us what what with what we proposing what kind of salad is he proposing for the residents or for their employees are they providing more soccer parks which may mean they there will be more people soften or is it just down the road from a bus stop or is it as there 's some local shops around the corner so that the won 't be as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further away so by while in telling us that the type of development and the location of the development will be able to help them to ascertain the approximate number of people that would be careful Mumbai those different modes so it 's really just just the amount a whole little question so we can help that ensure that this development will not cause adverse effects and and then they will they can also have a look and see what things that they can do to submitting out their distance so we 're really not trying to impose more development costs we 're really just trying to find out more information about what they proposed them so that we can ensure that we can both work together to ensure the effects are minimized so if it 's a non notified resource consent the resource must be processed within 20 working days that 's the statutory time frame that is under the resource management it and we meeting that time frame most intense and most of these are non notified at the moment we 've had over 300 consents go through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non notified the process doesn 't mean he knows if ever a significant development or there is significant bits and esteemed there needs to be notified so that community can have been put into it then there is a notified process but majority of consents culture on an unmodified process so it would be 21 days,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

11,sh8gL7BPxe8,20140409,1300.4,"Christchurch, New Zealand",3551,open again and we 've just made some rearrangements in terms of the timing of the meetings for next week and I 'll just I 'll just confirm those now that we 're sort of online we will be we will be meeting from 10 to 12 on the seventeenth of April we will do the industrial chapter and again from one until well actually we 'll do it one until three okay yep yep and then that 's that 's so that 's that we should we should get the industrial chapter done in that time if we if we 've got extra time and we can move on will do contaminated land or one of those chapters is a very brief checked all right yep all right so on till the transport chapter thank you just the form we 're starting on three of em thi answer a question that was great before about this you most certainly can I like people who answer questions before they 're even asked again so with phantoms less about the main north road traffic lights that were asked before yep yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went through a plan change a few years ago it also went through the environment court went through quite a rigorous assessment process they live all be in it additionally the traffic lights between rateliff road and steps Mill Road to service that development and that 's all been approved by than his on transfer day we 'll see who control that stay holy I 'm now community boards plagued opposition to that for a long time because you know it 's a it 's just so close it means is three lights really close on the road it 's crazy and they could have just here to lift and lift out on that and come in from Red Cliff Road but in who pays for their counsel for the developer all right so probably been it another hopefully and well right on it Garlin the question that was raised before which we just simply going in circles there 's like we can 't just keep putting traffic lights every time a supermarket wants to develop we 're go on your speech in your absence we did it for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we asked whether this was another example of what you 've been raising and we 've now been told you said us so but it isn 't really good enough and I don 't know whether as part of this plane whether we 've got well we here basically because it does deal with them this integrated transport mechanism is inert that there 's a requirement to plan around that integrated transport needs of the area when you 're doing a subdivision say it right yes that 's right so we are looking at the new district plan trying to trying to find a situation and yeah from yeah it 's the integrated transport to see certain say was the language I was looking forward anyway you take us through the truck Mukesh uzum okay so i 'll just run for the the Kia shoes and then to focus on the first two book which is sort of polarization of reviews but so the theaters first of all the biggest issue that Evan transport chapter was around car parking we got the most comments on that and then quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Internet transport assessments and the thresholds and requirements for that and let them talk about that in a minute we also had a number of comments on the road classification and that was raised earlier today and i 'll talk more about that the CG I 've also talked about the relationship between the district plan rules outside the four avenues and relationship with the ccrp and so explain what worry about that and then we also had some concern about pedestrian safety cycle safety and access efficient to commercial centers and through car parks and so forth and and we also had some some other volumes of traffic especially heavy traffic through some residential streets so those are the key issues that I 'll cover this afternoon now if we just flip to the next one Linda start talking about the tower packing and so um it 's the one so in terms of car parking there was probably a mixed reviews their words we had a pop up survey and just over the fifty percent of the part of people responded to the public survey agree with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's just did we should even go further than what we 've gone and the proposed transfer chapter and remove parking requirements even further but then most of the comments that were written in where were against the the changes of the pattern requirements and most of consumers around especially around the reduction in the requirements for residential developments we were generally removed what we generally had two parts required for your house and now with just in one part per house so just supposin summary the parking standards have been so sort of a fine balance between try and set obviously sure there 's not pattern issues are on our streets and is not a noticeable of packing but also says a little down on one side but also we want to ensure that development is affordable and we want to also make sure that island is sustainable as well so it 's we 're trying to find the balance between protecting our streets and also reducing that the cost on development and ensuring that people don 't have to provide multiple cars as they choose not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modes of travel so yep thank you I have a constituent at the moment where they have a dwelling on the faculty of place and I 've gone to visit them in my mind of you know I know best endeavours of legal team but the gun V fest I think to provide for extra parkings there 's a double garage two dedicated parking spaces off the road council staff Nell tell them that because of the plot ratio they 'll still need a with them going over that the ratio of dwelling to lean they will still need a resource consent which will cost an X dollars a citrus so if this is an enabling plan how much flexibility can we expect to see in it when you know I think people were doing the reasonable best to abide by the rules and the staff have to uphold the regulations but seems to me this person 's done the best approach into their own kind of green immunity area in order to provide the parking if they still have to that bar is still leading to get over it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the rules around pot Roshan to the how large that the building is that has tripped them up as opposed to how many carts they provided but good cuz they 're providing more carriages that 's obviously impress the size of their it brought it ends of it will it all up with the double garage and two extra packs and the dwelling in the back for cars can be accommodated all off the street yet they 're still having to seek or been told they have to get a resource consent because they 've tripped up in terms of that so it sounds like in building or having that garage to accommodate the parking it 's now defeating its own purpose so I 'm just thinking that you 've got the public saying they want more flexible parking for plants it 's it 's a usable at the garages for parking can zero it 's a live case I 'm dealing with I think that that 's probably an issue from the residential capitals I think what is what 's tripped up in that case oh no I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the size of the building is as all the special scale that it has breached the rules in terms of how much but what floor area building you can have on a site and so it 's a only need to provide all of the currents of you play in the maximum of two caps so they 're obviously provide more than that and that 's the size of the building that 's probably it was probably too big aborting to smaller site that 's probably what 's happens so it 's probably a question for there is an intricate that when that comes to you yeah that 's fine yeah yeah yeah yeah that 's residential chapters on second play right yep so just just an summary in terms of what we are proposing and the in terms of car parking where we are looking at retaining across Motor City we 're looking at retaining the minimum capital standards because we want to ensure that build up our here and there isn 't of those attract issues and immunity issues and so forth the bet the only areas where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and local neighborhood centers so those are the sort of the smaller shops and that 's for a number of reasons one is to enable those to be rebuilt with a lot of this moment shops didn 't provide parking pre-earthquake littleton and symptoms in a tarp or bed and now pattern has seen as to owner us and adding more caution and preventing some of those sites been redeveloped and it 's also to encourage people to walk and cycle to their local shops because the local neighborhoods to shops but for the larger development within those centers and balance and district centres there will be this required for integrated transport assessments so they will still be real quiet for the larger shops and I mean quite supermarkets and so forth to provide parking and to meet their needs and so the only other sort of made major change is a net residential zone where we 're still requiring a minimum number of contacts but we don 't inquire minimum one as opposed to in most cases we require a minimum of two previously and yes for those reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to how they they travel there to provide for multiple cars if they don 't want to and it 's the reduced cost of rigid often housing the what we 're recommending as part of this workshop is either we can got two options really either we can we can just keep with it that depth current house rules that that wind out consultation or maybe a potential changes we could say that for a larger house and we 're talking about a house with more than 150 square meters of floor area which would be pulley four or five bedrooms then you need to have two car parts because of the size of the house but if it 's a small house then it 's fine you can still only 1 150 square meters is not a big house about three people just yeah that 's the same approach that we have them the l3 and l4 signs at the moment they 're medium it designs that we have the moment have a plan change at we throw a few years ago we are the same appropriate larger house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have two car park for a smaller house and the most hazardous only need one do people have a view on whether there should be additional car parts for larger larger buildings initially I 've been in favor more flexible and car parking approaches but actually having feelings go vehicles we just end up putting that parking on to the streets and that 's that 's the concerns though I think actually you do have to think about that yeah otherwise we 're already having problems with car parking on the streets and it 's probably just going to get worse and if I look at where it went to where I lived in London you know you had people driving in and they 'll park in the nearest available street away from the permit things but and then the permits keep growing and in ppl park in residence permits but it 's just as constant chase for car park me everywhere and it 's you know drives people and nuts and so to actually yeah allow some development without parking spaces wouldn 't be a good idea because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they don 't have any off street parking at the month of our central London but it is a good point so I mean yani do you have you iberian interesting understand by hazeldean why they demolished a car parking building when there 's a chronic shortage of car parking in the area and again i think maybe it goes back to the monitoring of the conditions of the consents that when those developments were granted but i did they apply for a variation to the originals consent today I mean how does that how does something like that happen you know there might be a legal way that it 's at but from a public perception point of view it seems really best like so it 's not really the issue that we 're dealing with right now but but as an important issue so I mean I agree what ref saying that issue is that in an ideal world by not having a requirement to produce car parking you would see a change in modal shift that hasn 't happened and it 's the same concern in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create a nuisance for everyone else around the area so you know I 'm really interested in how we get people into a different modal shift but I 'm not convinced that just not having a car parking requirement does it but that 's why I 'd be really interested in learning what 's happened in eddington because there might be lessons there that help can help us come up with a better solution that 's not really basing it on residential yeah you know the size of the size of the Pennington was commercial yiannis multi-story office yeah no I know exactly what it is and I think I want an answer to that question I think that 's a really good question to ask but it 's just not on this issue the issue that we 're dealing with at the moment is do we do we go with the plane as its proposed or do we make a change to it so it indicates that there are greater parking obligations for larger properties and what do you say you 're not really suggesting 150 square meters a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's probably it easier for in terms of enforcement better to do it on floor area rather than number of bedrooms because the number of bedrooms can change in a house yeah rumpus room can involve yeah be tuned to a bedroom and it just comes to enforcement nightmare so that 's the approach that we had on the l3 and l4 plan change we did a few zo that it was based on the floor area at 150 I mean it does seem small tomato shot should clarify Daniel some things we want a small two-story a bit it please the garage so it 's it 's excludes the garage right 150 square meters of just living space and the reason it 's 150 is because the predominance of I guess medium density housing would be one and two bedroom size houses it should be quite large I had an apartment with two comfortable bedrooms and other rooms 860 square meters so 150 is considered a large unit within a medium danceteria okay take a look at Eli straight to see you know and I don 't know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and seeing what the current ratio is versus what your proposed the trouble is that you 're looking at historic cottages that were in felt to the current plan so new modern apartments that we in turn with minimum car parking requirements in Eli straight and more straight and melrose each of them had had a head to provide a car part it was a minimum yeah and I 'm just saying what what 's the difference between what we had before we made the l3 changes because we we 've actually been through three different what two different regimes there was a change about what a year ago two years ago at l3 l4 they removed the need to provide car parking so yeah maybe you can talk more yeah from what I understand is before the l3 and l4 plan changed it was requirement perfect for two parts per house across the board and then the l three or four plan change header some of the type arrangement where if it was less than a hundred fifty square meters only need one it was more than hundred fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they either when they eli development with that came under the old rules or new rules but you also have cottages in the area that we built a key or years ago they probably had no caffeine so and is also and it would have exacerbated what was happening in this year and you 've also got us falling from a single City there as well my liver the areas are not a nice one of a need I student I don 't agree so there 's a number of compounding factors any luxury yeah until is a lot of Street toaster oven so I 've lived everywhere anyway there but the thing is is that so so I think the general census is there yes we would like it notified as the jewel rule so more for more for bigger close to clarify what actually happens so 150 square meter house which will catch a lot of houses what does provision for two car parks actually mean does it mean hard surface or does it just mean space that you can if you clever that do get that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or through parking so it could be it could be the bit the back lawn yeah yeah we used to the counters family which require a dirigible space so enough space to put a garage but we 've we 've removed it and proposed plan what 's in to reduce the costs but the main things we want tears off the street with it he will put it on a garret or not it 's up within tell them yeah not really no I really doing this yes yep yep yep yeah it can be You Madame chair one follow-up question on that that there are rules in the plan I think for some high density living accommodation where you 're required to have a minimum area of outdoor living space but you 're not allowed to put other stuff i can at minimum face so those two rules both meeting compliance can we just understand the effect on affordability of housing with this rule I 'm assuming most affordable houses will be less than 150 square meters anyway and but if you 're required to have a minimum requirement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased density in some areas how much space per unit are we actually now looking at if you required to cap acts a minimum of outdoor living space and 150 square meter house what 's the actual impact of it you know we 've got dimensions on how big a car park needs to be it 's about Mark nice what 's wrong it 's about just over two meters by five meters so the rounded under rather than people I mean people people we have to make a serious decision here so rather than do that now I think people need to just get a little bit more facts around you know how that water would apply I 'm getting a sense that most people would like to see the the two-tier approach but maybe maybe well here I 'll give you some diagrams yeah well because it does as,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

10,CIHE1_WfMJo,20140409,2132.71,"Christchurch, New Zealand",5452,"which is a very good example is it stands there is nothing to stop another crematorium coming in that area yeah well that 's the kill that 's right yeah I mean this is the front page jeez it 's the burning of the black waters down there you know very hot I need to I need to check this but a crematorium I believe would fall under the definition of a noxious or offensive activity which we and Anna noxious or offensive activity is non-complying in the industrial zone that surrounds the commercial area of Sydnor so essentially what we 're saying is noxious or offensive activities should only be considered in the heavy industrial zones this isn 't a heavy industrial zone it 's a light industrial service I 'd be retrospective unfortunately no what a pity may so I mean I think we 're getting examples of where our existing plane is actually not fit for purpose and part of what we 're doing here yes we 're doing it on a truncated time frame because you know we have to you know support the recovery of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of these decisions that we 're making now will be decisions that we want for our city going for because their current plan actually is the one that 's holding us back hmm all right so you 'll give us a list of those existing you know that the sheets that have been put together with the existing master plans that have already been concluded so we 're recognizing that ferry rotors and New Brighton us and get get those and all of the district plan changes that relate to those master plans so hopefully give that to tomorrow we already have that rector yeah yep no thank you all right next item the last policy policy teen is to recognize not a human fnl worth they use defenders or landscaping and tree planting where it 's required in commercial zones yeah moving on to rules I won 't refer to every change but now I main changes oh sorry page nine page and I thank you there 's a lot of red ticks in the first paragraph but just starting with the fourth line down any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from compliance with activity specific standards and built form standards while the comments made in central government offices feedback was the need to provide for at least on a temporary basis activities took her within the commercial centres that may have always retrigger a resource consent so the examples example given in their feedback was if an office wanted to locate at ground floor level for a temporary period of time it 's all such until they 're added ears was done yeah yeah yeah essentially what this provision does is it enables that to occur and until April 2016 which aligns with the water in Council timeframe and be exempt from the belt form standards and activities specific standards which say that officers have to be above ground floor with the exemption of hice and recession playing rules so that 's to avoid impacts on adjoining neighbors so as the prop it 's sought to address that feedback we 've had from central government offices but yeah we under the table on that page nine the first line any new building alteration or addition or appear to an existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as relocatable or relocated building to acknowledge that there 's a lot of relocated temporary buildings which we 've it appropriate going forward and will support the same activities that we want and centers so I 'm going to jump forward if I take you to pay 12 under restricted discretionary activities 15 point two point two point three we 've introduced the clause that a consent required for a design assessment need not be notified and so that 's to avoid unnecessary costs of having a notified resource consent application and the hearing which would otherwise arise but a development has triggered a assessment purely of design now there could be other rules that are triggered like Heights for instance which would potentially be notified if there 's potential for adverse impacts on adjoining neighbors but interconnect rigging a design assessment then we don 't believe it should be subject to that wider and put yep Paul just put can 't sit here but it 's my make sure there was some talk and the blueprint mohe outside their jurisdiction but it 's down here is a neighborhood center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center yeah sorry what page are you on on page nine if what causes generally more than 400 so I have you gone backwards we try to move on this coming back that because it was important okay put causes more than generate more than 450 meters so that would preclude a business like that and a neighborhood center is that what you 're saying it 's that threshold as to avoid larger retailers from going into smaller centres not necessarily small on the face of a church corner mere available Bishop Dale is to avoid a dominance of larger stores with bigger footprint which displaces the Rachel for a greater range of shots but also ensures that the larger scale at the larger footprint stores go into the burger centers and the central city it 's as a promoter activity that they can stall locate there but they would require a consent and they have to give their consent fees even in that in a large neighborhood seemed to her quicksilver 's in your room it 's not what calls but another outfit and now you know those are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give it over saying and a lot of the stores generally speaking that those stores in New Brighton would say 99 percent of the tendencies would be less than 450 but I welcome billions oh sorry I don 't know what 450 square meters looks like bigger than 450 meters and if you 're talking pixel you amazon amazon stores are quite large stores so any new brighton issue would be restricted to certain types of stores and a lot of those surf types tools are su quite last I 've sort of a amalgamated be quite quite big footprints you brighten died when the anchor tenants went through farmers can I just say that it 's not a restriction you just if you go over that size you require a consent in the various types of assessment criteria that marks been talking about would apply depending on the type of consent you need we 're going to look at you know that fresh shot oh so it excludes supermarket under part in the store so that farmers would be allowed to go in but not what cause now it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know there 's are not allowed to its size unless you 're a supermarket or a department store Yeah right jumping to a page just clarified something you see before in relation to 15 on page 12 again story and Joanne seen you that in example things what that means is that things like design of buildings and the front of the street in fact there 's no opportunity for but for objection to their by way of for example requiring to be publicly notified that 's right which kind of like fits into a discussion about what kind of bottom lines are going to have our requirements we 're going to have around the urban design and we having a workshop on there but mmm just seems to me that kind of potentially allows anything no that 's that 's why it would go to a design panel and have design assessment always saying is that it wouldn 't be notified wouldn 't be no to have liked to have a say on net Christian as as the device design panel and does it have enough texture end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could be rich let 's put that to the workshop yeah I think that 's a really good question because my understand was the Richmond housing news on you know the 50 units were there were three houses that went through the urban design panel and they said it was good and it was Phidias said its portfolio we 're gonna put up to the wish I just asked about the bars so well just allowing these temporary activities not to comply with standards so where is this oh it 's on page 9 page now become a detective you 're going back citizen yes it was I was picking up half all but just try to understand the development you know the temporary stuff that we issue 8 where you 've got like you know things that cause a nuisance or potentially cause a nuisance and have an impact on communities I 've kind of puzzled as to why you would exempt them from complying with specific standards that uh that still be subject to the noise provisions in the district plan it 's what standards would there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's only the built form standards in the commercial chapter because they 'd still be subject to noise standards and the general city provisions of the existing City clam if you 're building any bar for example and you 've got to put an acoustic paneling to prevent the noise from going out into the residential neighborhood which I presume we have some somewhere in here the requirement but if you 're putting in a temporary by you would be exhumed from doing that no because that 's the belt no it 's the bits noise I think that 's yeah well I thought they would be designed the noise will be the noise that goes out into the community no the noises to separate raw we just heard there didn 't we noises dealt with in a separate chapter and the intention of this isn 't that it would be exempt from noise standards and I 'll finish this yeah statement to make that clear yeah I think that would be good where there were things like traffic offense would it also cover that or not that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll make that clear all right carry on through page 15 maximum building height standards fifteen point two point three point one one one thing with does some modeling work on and I 'll cichlid these two afterwards we 've looked at the interface between commercial zones and residential zone and the potential for that in some cases record them for instance there 's a on the back street of record and mall there 's you 've got a twinning up to 20 meter story a 20 metre high car park builder and and that 's obviously directly opposite a residential zone and other areas of the city you have got a commercial corazon like that adjoining a residential zone and we want to avoid tall buildings which potentially have shading effects but also dominance of building form and bolt on those reasoning sure properties so what we 're proposing is where a site 's wholly or partly within 30 metres of residential zone that there 's a reduced height limit rather than applying the blanket 20 meter rule which applies across the rest of the zone so that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the residential amenity just to be really helpful for you know the public consumption on this can you give me how many stories each of these are yeah sure so 20 meter building is a 55 stories I stories potential potentially six six five to six stories and 12 meters there 's three to four three to four yeah so what a Joseph rota who 's a principal advisor of urban design standing around is it 's a modeling that 's been undertaken showing the interface between now it shows in shading the potential heights that buildings could go up to everyone 's good yeah sorry thanks great so so you 're saying that within 30 meetings meters of residential you 've got to be at that three to four stories and then on the site you can go back further from 30 meters at five to six stories that 's right yeah and so the the map the visual illustration just circulated shows the impacts of 20 meters relative to relative to the residential properties so the purple is the commercial breeders the residential and as you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper stands out like a sore thumb relative to the residential zone which is the red and stepping that back is difficult to see but even 12 meters with 30 meters step with a twin a meter height limit step back still still stands out but the bottom diet bottom image on the right hand side shows that if that 's articulated so if there 's breakup and how that looks with windows and so minimum glazing and a good design it can integrate better with the surroundings so a combination of height limits design assessments and other controls to avoid shading and impacts on outlook we can can better manage that interface between residential and commercial zones yeah I 'll leave that 's that those images for you for now page 16 of the chapter one of the issues raised and then the proposed rules for the commercial zones we require build up to the road from but in some cases supermarkets for instance can have sites which border three streets and it 's unrealistic to expect every street front of that block to be built up to so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those sites which are those sites that have to two or more Road frontages that there 's not a requirement to build up to those road france it 's a risk tomo commercial building it 's not it 's a rest times got its own definition and is defined as a care home I believe it 's just that I know that just using a current example where the development of a retirement villages being required to build the rest home component right up to the boundary of the site which creates a problem because normally speaking you would have an entranceway which you would enable a driveway to to drop off and pick up and an ambulance to drop off and pick up as well but that is not being allowed in this particular development and they say it 's because of the current rules around frontages we can bring that example to the workshop if you like dealer given design brief okay I had the absurd situation and a consent hearing a few months back we 're a commercial building built to the front of the footpath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there because they had the setback they had to provide cycle parks if they went straight to had a complete frontage along there they didn 't need to provide any cycle packs are we addressing those sort of situations David thought no my colleague knows the situation and compositions potentially comment on it it 's in the central city plan it is so yeah we obviously can 't change the security of cci pay but put the district plan we are looking at changing it to the reason was that obviously if the board is bright up to the road frontage there 's no space for safa parking outside the front so that 's why it was a bit exception was the put in place that it 's brought up the road from you didn 't need to put cypher partying but obviously it correct that everybody feat that if you set up back suddenly all these soft diamond requirements that were required for the exception was no longer there so we are going to look at saying you should still need to provide safa parking and people have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back so it 's not what I rs2 that support it to the row finish even my point i think was if you actually built up to the road you didn 't have to have cycle parks if you did if you had the recess you did yeah so we 've removed that abstention you have just don 't need to revise of a pain but it can be around the back if you pulled up to my advantage removes that yeah i think i was sort of getting to the point though there was there was a discouragement for a developer to make an attractive building frontage and have a recess and provide for joining on foot for example but not exactly on the footpath and they were being penalized for having to provide so cycle facts where is that they built to the edge had no recess the building look bland there was no no character to it all they didn 't have to provide any soccer facts at all so so is that it is it a matter that 's been dealt with for ya so we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to clarification if they want to building was a recess and they want to put dining the can they put the cycle parks around the bed where are they obliged to have them at the front no there is a recess of zero as it 's going to conflict with their young if it 's an occupation probably just going to concept with their harness it caught up the very front of so all it map to talk about that was that the rules require people to finish the transport chapters coming to you after lunch yeah but well yeah because I mean that this is the consequence of requiring everything to be built to the pedestrian walkway is enough so yeah that their requirements and the commercial chat very very much buildings have to be up to this up to the street front so and doing so that any provision of the cycle parking would need to be to the rear vision whatsoever for cycle parks if you built if you built to the total footprint of the of the section and built your frontage right up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatsoever if no no no but I 'm saying if you if you had some Flair in your design and you recessed part of your building to allow for outdoor die whatever a nice is what this is the issue you 're not going to allow any well we 're not going to allow on the district plane anyone to rhesus their buildings on a pedestrian site so that they will have to build to the footpath that they can do but they need to go through the consent process and the assessment of design will necessitate a consent so we can assess that non-compliance and conjunction with that but it 's that to me it 's sort of the irony of wanting some some decent design and the city rather than just a bland frontage of everything but then then you actually force people into a consent and you start having to talk about per cycle parks and all sorts of other things when all we 're trying to do is get some sort of decent design I don 't think cycle parts is the issue cycle parks are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane but I would like to invite Josie just to respond to you as to why it can send is necessary and in that situation yeah so just in terms of what we are looking at is trying to get some continuity of the street frontage partly because it helps with things like pedestrian flows and traffic there is the requirement in terms of if you do want reeses to to go to accotink process that 's true but what there is also Anu is within the assessment measures this recognition that those spaces that provide for you know public community like dying dining seasonal that sort of thing I 've valuable and so it actually balances out through this isn 't meters so there 's some indication that that 's something that we 're looking for positively in the right location if it 's designed well apparently what we we don 't want to get to this or the situation we don 't want to get to that we 've had in the past at places like Victoria Street where these being quite a bit of allowance force it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of dead space that 's not actually being utilized so we want to be able to have a bit more consideration about how that space might be used and how it actually contributes the whole of the pedestrian environment even what we 're going to end up with is you know a set of recommendations coming back from central government they will have been given exactly the same example I 've been given and in the person 's all the way through the whole process until right at the very end redesign your entire plan for your entire retirement village because you can no longer have something out the front and I know we 're going to use that as an example in the workshop but you know to find out at the last minute this is this is this is what gives the Council of bad name and gives the district plan a bear named if they don 't find out till the end of the process that they have to now suddenly go through this other process which is it makes no sense to somebody who 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ambulance drop off at the front door or that they have to move the front door to the back could I just speak to that in terms of that particular consent process suppose involved in that one or I am still involved in that one and this is probably what we should go through a bit more and out even design soon on next week in terms of that they were actually give an indication right at the pre-application stage not that they have to build the whole building to the frontage or anything along those sorts of lines but the priate notes are really clear about the different sort of layouts that they could have a look at and even bringing part of the building forward so in terms of last minute I 'd have to say that right through the process though given an indication of where there may be issues that arise and and at all stages the applicant the owner was involved in those meetings so it 's something that 's probably something we can go through a bit more next week but it isn 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the truth is is that there are different rules that apply to tyrant village being built today then would have applied to every retirement village being built in the city before no that 's I mean in terms of that particular I haven 't seen a single retirement village where you don 't drive up through a round button and the issue is not that they drive up to the frontage the issue with that particular time at village is the extent of car parking and roading and number of other elements that are right across the frontage on waters a very large block within a density be zone so part of it is about the context and the character of the area and it 's not about saying because we 've actually said to them know we want your entrance way to be visible and clear and people can drive up to it that 's not the issue there are a number of other issues and it 's not as simple as sort of saying it 's one thing or another thing it 's a combination of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this one all right so we can put people and I think my issue really i think it so it comes down to the fact that we we have this rule where we want to build to the to the footpath edge doesn 't allow for a bit of variation and building design but also i think when we have that rule and someone then decides well we 'd like to step back it opens up so many other things that they 've got to comply with the minute they step back off that frontage and that that to me is an impediment to sort of getting some good good outcomes and i use the cycle pup but parking but there are other the minute you come back off that foot bath or a number of other things that also start to to rear up as well and i think we 're actually doing ourselves a bit of a disfavor in some respects in being absolute that the primary focus shall be to the footpath because the minute we step back from it there are all sorts of other things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you raised are good issues for this briefing or whatever they like to call it that you 'll be having for an hour to an hour and a half and it might even take a bit longer on urban design and and and as a whole you certainly need to be clear about what you want and your plan or not regards even design and also at which level you know whether it be guidance material and standards or assessment criteria these are exactly the issues yep so we 're going to have to break because that 's just giving it 's beyond one o 'clock now so how much longer do you think this oh I 've got three more points on the rules can you run through the three more points and I won 't take any questions just while they run through the three points and then we 'll see whether we 've got questions that we 'd like to ask afterwards yeah sure paisa 38 yep north falls well then you keep to the center we 're proposing the special height limits introduced rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided for in that center we 're promoting a lower rise scale of development to reflect its context there 's landscape considerations for the port hills but there 's also being a new residential community around it we need to look at greater integration between commercial developments and residential and because it 's a blank sheet we can look at these things more carefully and in a in a comprehensive way so special height limits provided before they 're just on page 39 the maximum retail floor space camp that I commented on earlier to avoid impacts on not just the central city but the likes of Barrington page 91 yep in general terms we wear require residential to be above ground fool at ground floor level in a car are the town center zone extends over areas that are it 's more of a mixed center and in that respect their special rules of the current city plan that 's enable reading into a ground floor level on a student section I throat that enables residential on ground floor with the exception of a certain section of beach road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there made a submission and we 've addressed that through carrying over the existing rule yep and then the last points I 'll just lost but that could be it Oh pays 898 yep gordon in littleton and this special building heights we 've introduced for the south side of London streets to avoid shading of buildings on properties to the self of that which with MMR 's the plan it promotes laneways running through the block between norwich key and london streets and the creation of public spaces through there and one of the means of avoiding excessive shading of buildings on the south side of London Street on those properties fronting Norwich key is to limit the hype so that 's what that provision is about there and the recession plain requirements which look controls sunlight and access to sunlight with also restricted those on the north side of London streets ensure that London Street itself as as a lot of day license is a public space that 's utilized as much as it is now for markets without being overshadowed so that 's extent of the points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get an indication from counselors but who 's got questions that they want to ask on this chapter all right I 'll take Tim and Andrew and they 're more break for lunch and the not the existing horse world supermarket site we 're retaining the current height limits that apply there of 12 meters the special higher limits that applies to the north laws wealth center because it 's a new center and we 're looking to achieve integration with the adjoining regional community it 's about having special provisions for that which don 't apply to other centers ah sorry that the limit of 20,000 to avoid impacts on barrington rather than thing the same shot Harrington 's currently got in the order 12 up 12 thousand square meters Andrew thank you and one question in one point if I can p14 on page 91 the point you made about the a corolla provision for residential to be on the ground floor and commercial area is that a new provision or does that reflect exactly what 's already in the backs peninsular district plan sorry that reflects exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ status quo it 's no change from the status quo but it 's a change from the draft which removes that exception yes now that 's good and then looking at littleton style and design guidelines on page 149 point 53 norwich key is a wider single-sided street it would be really good if we could put either mostly or mainly in there because of course in line with one of the other things that we picked up earlier about south side of knowledge key a part of Norwich keys and single cited that junction with Oxford Street is anything but single-sided thank you thank you all right so when we come back at two o 'clock we will go on to the transport ship chapter and are we going to deal with the industrial chapter as well will we you 've told mark to go home yeah it is so feeling better if you have time happy to do that but we also have a whole other day as i said before so were you take that on alright so what do we hold it on over so we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and thank you very much mark we appreciate your energy despite your state of health and hope that I 'm um I have to confess a feeling much better after that there 's probably only cause it 's over anyway thank you very much and we 'll see you at two","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

9,h5lH1oBg3sc,20140409,1183.77,"Christchurch, New Zealand",3285,well it 's just briefly to reiterate what you civilly in about the need for a workshop shop around urban design of buildings yeah and that we make a note and do that we support that as counselors know when it is happy with a lot of what 's going up and i def of you know a lot of staff are too so it 's just a look at how we fine-tune their part but it 's also to understand the principles around guidelines and guidance and standards because and it picks up the the green argument that we 've just had then because you know we we have this amazing opportunity for sustainability to be one of the hallmarks of the new Christchurch and it 's just you know I just don 't want to see this opportunity wasted and three medam chick and I just say that we 're proposing to bring to you an hour to an hour and a half briefing on urban design exactly discussing what you 're talking about on the morning of the 17th which which is that new day that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell me oh it 's all right oh sorry now so I understand that clear has now found that space in your diaries we have a whole extra day and there 's a 17th of April and we 'll begin that day with a briefing preferably just a briefing not a public workshop on urban design and all of those questions that you 've been talking about great and Paul what I see question especially estate and all I want to say is it what is here at the Jan hundred years time it is what we build today so that 's why we 're going to make sure and our rules regulations we build something we can be proud of in the future and I think it encapsulates everything Pauline said the mayor said so we 're going to make sure that all we leave behind is something like they 'll have some value in the future use n masses yep yeah Yanni I I do think we should be putting in some minimum environmental standards for development guidelines are not going to do it throughout here 's that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we prescribe it and I I just agree it 's such a lost opportunity modern sustainable environmentally friendly today we have a one chance to be unique and we 're losing it and you know just because government rejected before doesn 't mean that we should you know not ask for they 've done a lot of things that we don 't like well we 're not happy with that people don 't appreciate like you know shutting schools but that doesn 't mean we shouldn 't stand up for what we believe what we believe is right for our city and you know their intervention is um I mean we should be working in partnership yes really or and I think this doesn 't mean that they tell us what we can do but they may not have that they saw that this stuff that I know now that I didn 't know you know when the you know when the central city plan went to government you know and they came out with the blueprint you know that and I mean my own understanding of how these things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really just come off my last visit from there there is there is much that we can do that actually isn 't directive but as but actually facilitates the that what will happen is a matter of fate because there will be there will be nobody in the world Oh ultimately that will invest an unsustainable greatness lies the problem I know it 's how sure it 's how we get there it 's how we get there people say the funding through their insurance which means they going for maximizing the insurance but in some cases the lowest cost lowest quality unsustainable under van design light buildings so it 's a huge problem here because the funding isn 't actually dictating you know the good outcomes that it might be doing in other places yeah just to comment madam chair is usual to read the comments from see job which were given to you this morning to understand where the officials are coming from and secondly if you do wish us to put any standards and this plans estate supporting sustainability and we need to know that today so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ministers I think you 're getting a very strong view that there ought to be statements and plane around you know minimum requirements but statements but not spoil I don 't know see that I mean until we hit this workshop around how guidelines can you know sometimes not having a direction will achieve the same end as what you want to achieve you know or do we say that this is a line on the sand and actually we want that written unto our city plan it should have been written unto the CBD wasn 't maybe this is an opportunity to have that conversation with central government as we go forward you know I mean this is going to go to a nun dependent hearings panel it 's not going to be decided by the government and what is notified to the government notified by the council will be the council 's plan how it ends up determined by the hearings panner was a nun dependent process we can come to you with some options as far as that workshop okay it would be great thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapter do you think because I know that the individual rules won 't I think necessarily hold us up we 've dealt with the general principles under we do you want to carry on until you 're done and then we 'll break for lunch max just told me up to an hour so allowing Fenella how disciplined a casual is going to be well let 's say if let 's see if we can get it done in half an hour we 'll give you two one o 'clock and then we 'll break for lunch yeah all right okay policy nine it 's recognizing all the suburban centers that were councils preparing master plans for or has adopted master plans for so it 's recognizing that and that 's reflected in the rules that give effect to some of the actions and the master plans and the Signum master plan sites with a furnished to colombo street there 'll be no vehicle access on to colombo street is that part of the city then I understand that is yes and the rationale given how many shops and things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a situation which similars a little some of assyria having an act of frontage which has got continuous building france to us if you have breaks in that building front for every property with individual accesses you lose that continuity of a clear building line which is what makes it special yeah completely understand that but if it was developed as an overall concept and there was vehicle access that perhaps came around the bag would that just destroy that like if these weren 't developed separately but we 're developed as an overall properly with good designs allowing vehicle access does that there is a street behind the area that you talking about yeah it 's not not colombo is straight it 's the street the hunt that runs beautiful you know that way era lo no parent I 'm not the parallel I 'm not the opposite of parallel back on straight yeah at 90 degrees yeah yeah yeah I 'm just not sure about it yeah very very does come out seasonal here to make brahms traitors highway a simile form is there more about achieving design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can consider purpose and power changes to helps Delta through that design assessment and they 're not requiring they 're not publicly notified that 's right okay okay um David and then Yanni thank you look I 'm just concerned about the policy and hair of deals with the scope of mass plans and the fact that there 's not a lot of statutory recognition and thirdly the linkage between the key activity centers that some of them are and the provisions in the loop to recognize that status I also to bring this up as opposed to looking at the new brighton master plan that are focused just on the business area and ignored even the pier and the library over the other side a couple of key assets and how these master plans actually are scoped what provision the policy allows full scope of master plan and the fact that in the end they don 't have much statutory recognition anyway the district plans obviously won over a number of tools to give effect to the master plans and is the statutory tool to give effect to parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never understand intended to be statutory so the district plan provides rules which using the example given before of sibling weathers special provisions applying in light of direction from the master plan we could potentially do the same in new brighton but it 's one of a number of mechanisms that to achieve the master plan vision but it 's not the only one and a lot of the other mechanisms non-statutory measures revival among non statute was it 's very few of them and norms church retreat well they do differ widely amongst the the eight master plans that there are suburban center master plans the the scope of the suburban seemed to master plans were set 2011 I think 2011 and which centers they would apply to all of that was determined some time ago and under the local government at the aspirational plans and their planes that talk about being undertaken not only by the council but with landowners in the area business owners there that kind of thing so they won 't meet to be just directly put straight into district plans those elements of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go through district plans but the since was never that the whole of the master plan would drop into a district plan in fact it can 't very few of them ever do so I just actually block me sort of query the effectiveness of having the master plans anyway because I 've seen for master plans for New Brighton and not very very few of any of the aspects of that master plan has ever been enacted so I think we spent in an ordinate amount of time on these master plans they have no statutory recognition and the scope of them is so limited at times that I really wonder about how effective they are at all which is why I taped over old on the one affecting the area that I represented when I was a member of parliament yeah we had this debate last term council and unfortunately it was it was lost but it was always my intention of the must fend wouldn 't have statutory effect because they 're exactly the conversation we should be having with local communities no they 're not uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not actually done they 're not joined up with the residential they 're just Main Street plans that just um silly anyway anyway but like I think I 'd be really interesting to get a list of which master plans and what statutory changes are being put into the district where so you can really clearly see I also think of the useful to have a timetable of work that 's been done around the district plan changes and proposals as part of those mice plans so there 's some visibility so whether it 's you know coming up with God urban design guidelines or you know what what work is being indicated that will happen is serially we 're being done on any of the master plans and that regard specific role changes in the district plan there 's rules in this commercial chapter thats give effect to must okay so can you just can you just refer us to those quickly yeah sure and can I just ask that so you 've got you 've got those master plans identified but we 've got also specific development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us Street more outs of Salem Street and railway line development plan what where does that come from it 's an outline development plan that exists in the current city plans so there 's outline development plans for defined areas that are different from master plan areas so that outline an outline development plan is a broader concept which applies to greenfield areas but also in some cases blocks of land have developed in the past or could be redeveloped and guide where future road access points are and and where landscaping is provided within those areas for instance through so I do wonder whether the masked men shall be turned into outlined development plans at some stage so they do have some statutory fee um can you just take us to the list of thumb of it Oh about an example for sipping beer with me remote there isn 't a single list of all of the no but one could be arranged yeah I think let 's do that rather than just go through them one by one is that all right we can just give you an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ok alright community making submissions on it they 'll want to turn to the fury road master plan and go bright here 's the proposed district land rule changes and objectives and here 's where I comment and the phone app I just want to make is I think there 's a real need for again the issue around monitoring of consent conditions of our line development plans i just think i think that the communities in these areas have been sort of really miss leaders to watch these were ever intended to do but anyway can we use the ferry road master planners and also oh no no we 're going to use pseudonym as an example because you know the fury road master plan is still going through okay all right use the sources so what 's right Janine say we came up with a really good document for Littleton which shows all of the the district plan review changes and proposals and how they reflect the outcomes in the Littleton master plan projects deal is a master plan if that was able to be done for each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done it was all just some of them and yet completed so for exact opposite have been done so so we 've got a list of those but give us an example out of the CID naman so appendix 15.9 points 6 hasn 't met have all page sorry 133 130 and that introduces and took into the plan oh I can see that really well yeah it 's a it 's not clear that scale the EDS the system area with columbia street running down the middle from the top of the page down to the bottom and there 's several things shown on that plan that were identified in the master plan including the former synonym school site which is the bottom right-hand side of columbia street and adjoining Brown Street and that site 's been vacant for some time now and is that in fighters site providing for a potential potentially makes use and if I turn to the rules page 46 of the rules prescribed that I restricted to script I restricted discretionary activity status as any development within that site subject to a development claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can look at how its developed going forward and so that site was Emma there 's a brownfield site for mixed-use in the master plan and with salt spray matt frewer and the rules for the chapter turning to page 47 which is what would happen now so say one of these comprehensive plans was put in place before this rule change takes effect at the current time that site the southern school site is zoned light industrial right and the current rules would essentially an able to be developed for industry and those rules don 't necessarily promote the use of the site for residential but say could you put residential on there at the moment under the existing rules they the policies wouldn 't support residential industrial zones so it 's constrained in that respect but having said that it 's because it 's vacant sites that 's been a brown it 's a typical brownfield site that 's that be potentially have you taken by a consents team of resource consent was applied for a mixed-use development that is suitable for development for residential and commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one of the issues that came through from the joint officials to was was the need to promote brownfield sites for for mex you so have you only done that for the master plan areas or have you done that more broadly it 's come through more strongly in the industrial chapter and the industrial areas are where there 's greatest opportunity for brownfield redevelopment and our commercial areas we enable residential developments and commercial developments anyway so we don 't tend to have a policy on brownfield sites as such what does former school sites though this is a former school site and that 's light industrial oh sorry its most school sites as own cultural sorry right I 'm wrong yeah no no I know but it was a school site but it had so had an underlying designation that 's right business can actually question to clarify this my understanding in terms of the sping mixed-use was that previously parietals master plan elected members had seen a model of how it or could be and included mixed-use for example commercial in residue on the one block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incorporated into the master plan good am i right that that that that site could be in effect mix it mix juice that came from the master plan erupts but it 's not the pre-existing rule change I said rules don 't apply that 's the thing with the master plans what we 're being told is that this is an example of where a master plan decision has been given a thick too and the plane change now yeah yep so that 's good,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

8,iKrb99amnOA,20140409,1326.299,"Christchurch, New Zealand",3653,there could be a requirement for a landowner to produce an outline development plan for how they 're almost a master plan for how it 's going to evolve it 's kind of like they 're still leading this and is there not in some ways I think most people in self glaciers would say look Barrington mall is probably big enough words it works pretty well except for the traffic okay it can we not build Andrea playing an effect by and large overall the supreme of the mountain for example is big enough so we 're not contain some help we is we we have discussed how how malls can be contained and it goes back to the first diagram that Matt related to or that the chart on page four where it talks about the zoning and the zoning within innocence is the barrier to any further development so there 's a natural building envelope that can be built within determined by the highest and setbacks and so forth but also the extent of the zoned area that within that commercial center so Rick Adam can 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to allow for the expansion but in terms of in terms of a master plan for how record and should develop and grow beyond just the Westfield looking at the whole center that 's something that would require further work obviously if taking a suburban center master plan approach for instance could be done for a key to the dissenters but that would require a funding obviously yep hang on look I 've got other people pool next and then Yanni look we have to understand these developers are very clever they plan years and years ahead before you even put that proposal in front of you so and I know the saying with Westfield I think there needs to be a trigger that activates at a certain size if they want to go any further than that size these things will start coming into place which would be a transporter change a service center for other community because it because they will increment then secrete they will do one development which doesn 't has a minor effect they add another development which is just causing a major effect which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time and we 've seen with all the major developments and I know Westfield have actually got plans down the future and purchase lot of land around the area and we 'll wait for a council to come in they can actually activate those changes and activate a bigger center so we need actually a line in the sand I think we 've all talked about it a certain size when it passes that size whatever that is I 'd say it 's your reckoning an orphan it 's or any passing role here Yeah right Yanni I mean that was my when you said I can 't expect that they actually can they just get a non notified non-compliant reasons contend and they in a way they go so we are we making it prohibitive so they can 't expand or what are we doing if they 're know if record and more wanted to expand across meta post rate for instance because look looking at the malls footprints that needs fever intensify with car parking areas or or go up which is what they are planning to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas yes yeah so so but you 're saying that they couldn 't under the proposed plan if they wanted to go into the residential adjoining residential zone that faced policy because obstacles but they could advise a very considerate can see you bye could they be hype is it so all of those houses say yeah on the other side of Matt upholstery then they could come say danger badger they could but the policies for the residential zone strongly retina to avoid commercial activity in that zone but I can 't make an issue right now they 've each got plans to extend your upper floor right through to the supermarket they can do that on the existing footprint that Hollywood HD activate we 're talking maybe another 40 shots which is another 500 Carly from today which there is no infrastructure to cope with the increase in people using the people in their face okay so we good and and this I can only repeat what I 've said before and that is to say yes they can do that kind of thing quite easily under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get these new objectives and policies in place as soon as possible yeah I 'd certainly support strengthening whether existing big format developments or moles on a redevelop or extend that we had we do have some requirement for them to actually do a lot more than what they 're currently doing yeah no I 'd already I just think that is kind of line on the scene time in jungle they really oughtn 't have been allowed to develop to the size that they are at the moment without giving something back by way of public transport immunity that 's just to me it 's obvious but anyway as I say I 've hibbity to history and heading so we shall leave it to the experts to come up with some helpful way of resolving that well what 's the next page just to some policy 8 I know I jumped it but clause b which is ensuring the design of development makes the positive contribution to streetscape and character of the surroundings while having regard to functional requirements of activities i mentioned in in my slideshow they the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of glazing build up to the road front and design assessment not having regard to the needs of those larger retailers who have generally a bigger box large areas of car parking loading spaces so we need to recognize this up and in some cases they bought a 23 streets so this policy whilst it 's not how I didn 't read it some introduced into this version to recognize the functional requirements of those businesses so it 's a balance of function and design but we don 't want to lose the good quality design in in what 's put in place some still win favorite design but acknowledging there 's a functional aspect to it as well yep the next pack and save then look or rebel sport or whoever the warehouse and the the assessment that 's made so come on to it with the rules but essentially any developments within a commercial center over to over 250 square meters which is reasonably small that that development would trigger a need for resource consents in some parts of that center if it 's on a what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large about amounts of pedestrian activity like on record and road or will require every every development to come in for resource consent to assist the design of it and amongst other things when assessing the design of these new developments we there 's a range of assessment matters that are considered and there in 15 points 8 I believe 15-point 8.1 page 118 on my one vice and then I won 't go through those in detail but essentially as to avoid the large blank walls and to my event design friends Josie and the audience here will join means is to avoid the large blank wall and to get some break up in terms of design which can be achieved in a number of ways so you can have variation in terms of a height of a war you can get different setbacks to achieve break up that blank wall color glazing and and its various design elements that a voyage pedestrians having to walk down she 'll new brighton road for instance past the blank wall of one of the supermarkets yeah we know that we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that shouldn 't proceed along those lines so that every single destra and facing you know we 'll keep the pedestrian facing place has to get a resource consent that they 're going to get advice from their officials saying no I shouldn 't do that yes but me so what are we going to say in response to their I mean I know that we 'll have to consider the advice that we received from the minister but be quite good to know when they get that advice that we 've provided advice to the ministers ourselves in terms of how you know important this is for that look and feel of the city the rebel sport is building as a classic example but it 's but it 's but it 's hardly a key pedestrian area so it probably wouldn 't trigger but the resource consent it 's a drive-by it 's not a walk by and it 's the it 's the walk bias that that I think a lot of us are saying well we don 't actually want people walking along so I remember my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked about there wasn 't enough prozac in the world to make this an interesting places yeah we also could be key will not just on next the blank walls especially businesses certain businesses on the ground floor to get a row them like banks which we had on both corners of the square with the anes in the beans in they actually create a black hole we 're people initially really like walking past and it does kill activity to a degree so it 's it 's more than just actually buildings and how they interact with with the street but it is actually businesses and how they actually enter it for this week yeah and if Matt could just speak for a little minute to stone what he has supporting this video particular rules on urban design in the section 32 that might be helpful yeah so so we 're talking general terms in the section 32 about the effects of blank walls and so forth and that the benefits of having a activity that 's prompting the streets and there 's relationship between will the use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pedestrian activity the a lot of the a lot of works been undertaken which preceded this district plan review which was for a plan change that was going through the process plan change 56 which is was to introduce urban design controls on to our commercial centers and it 's been absorbed within this district plan review now as part of that plan change there 's been a lot of work done on looking at not just looking at examples but for instance there was some financial analysis done to look at what 's the additional cost of putting in glazing for instance what 's the additional cost of building up to the road rather than being set back from the road which is rules that are being introduced to and respective urban design now in terms of the requirement for consent for an assessment of urban design that service against trigger consents that wouldn 't otherwise be triggered but in that in presenting it in that section 32 it 's about the broader benefits that bat provides and the economic benefits it provides to the center as the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essentially it more attractive and and more interesting and inviting to go to so it 's not necessarily getting down to analyzing the costs of someone needing to apply for consent or not but rather what 's the wider benefit for that cue for that Center and that 's very much how we 're proposing how we 've presented it to the central government offices group today it is there a cost you know that we could you know minimize when something comes in that 's obviously taken into account the design guidelines and and and does you know sort of like instantly complying because it meets that test I mean I wonder whether that one of the drivers will be that the ministers will be the cost associated with applying for a resource consent don 't I mean we want the outcome isn 't the isn 't the you know in a way that that if we could make it so that they didn 't have to you know if they meet the guidelines then they didn 't have to apply for consent but if they didn 't they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's that 's a very good point and they 've come back again and you 'll see that I think in my covering comments oh sorry little read though no no and I apologize that you only got them this morning but they 're also concerned that there 's too many standards that people have to meet so this is again that 's weighing up whether or not something should be a standard so that their certainty so that when plans come and they know they 've achieved it and yet then it becomes a permitted activity versus having them as assessment criteria which is what Mark has but they need to come in for a consent so again it 's the swaying up about whether you have it as a standard so that they have the certainty about what they need to do to achieve it or not in there they 've raised issues about that as well I mean I just think the whole urban design issue is an issue for the government and inputting constraints on development how we deal with it there are there are various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that also seems to have issues related to it you 're not a key question here was about whether there was any way minimizing the costs of the resource consent process might be able to answer this in relation to the notification part of the resource and see process because a lot of the costs often come when when the application of snow side and these are here again we might be Appeals the council 's able to put into the plan and consent applications for breach of particular rules they 're going to be non note of mine and not served on it up so that provides the ancient with substitution with uncertainty about what the process is simply and keeps costs down yeah simply just on that we 're introducing a provision that any application that 's triggered by the design assessment rules doesn 't need doesn 't isn 't notifies and therefore wouldn 't have a hearings process effectively it would be a decision that 's not a comments aren 't invited from the public or from have it any other party for that matter on those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge we face in terms of putting guidelines and to standards is that if we try and put everything into standards we lose the potential for innovation and creativity that can come through providing flexibility and the guidelines and we don 't want to inhabit that but and so we 've gone with a dual approach of having some standards and summer system of matters but rather than one approach or just putting it all in the system matters and the other approach of just having standards I don 't want this to end up being a debate about holding development back or putting you know sort of strict rules around them sort of you know sort of you know enforce design because because it could be sold the other way you know and so I I think that as a council we might want to have a little bit of a just a workshop on the whole guidelines versus standards around this plan so and maybe just take that away separately from the discussion about the individual chapters because they do come up and other chapters as well just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years and I 'm just mindful of that so just done with the policy eight if you look at it through a a heritage liens and bearing in mind what Paul said before I think you know that makes some such a strong compelling argument not only for heritage for teaching but for all the things you you talk about street frontages and Direction visit visual interest I think of the lease the new leads building the corner bar is at high end Manchester Street there 's a heritage building right next door it 's also offers a majestic theater but it 's it 's retaining that over it against the other which serves to bring about those things which I think we 're sinking here so do we kind of maybe it 's in other chapters but make explicit that the place of heritage in its retention and our city so to highlight that which we 're aiming for you it 's not it 's not comfort in this chapter it 's more so in a chapter that 's been dealt with in the phase 2 here having said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 on page 116 is about whether the development reinforces scale and character is surrounding development and natural heritage and cultural assets by one of the bullet points is retaining or adapting protected heritage assets and existing character buildings so it 's a captured to a degree and the assessment of design so i gave pauline and then so do reflecting principles of environmental of environmentally sustainable design including energy efficiency and water conservation is that strong enough and should we be preps teasing that outer but i don 't want to get into more standards necessarily but i think this is really important and if you looked at something like a big bits we 're talking super market developments and the impacts of the stormwater shouldn 't we be addressing or putting something in there where they have to take more control of that or or as their to the part of the resource consent these days or can we be stronger and things like rain water gardens one option we 've considered as introducing requirements for buildings to be up to a certain standard in terms of green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a there 's existing that there 's a standards there are standards in place and Auckland 's applied it in some cases to large larger office buildings for instance there 's a there 's two different types of standards base I believe and green mark and green mark only applies to larger bass is what isn 't far off isn 't far above the existing building building act requirements so in terms of base we could introduce basic requirements into this chapter but that currently I understand being considered for review to up the standards and until we know what those new standards are perhaps premature to look at that but in terms of the other benchmark or standards the green mark requirements apply to very large office buildings and we 're unlikely to see development of that scale and suburban centers so I haven 't been applied here so we haven 't got standards in this chapter for green building requirements but happy to look into it it 's interesting in Melbourne there it 's it 's it 's now just an absolute I mean it 's not required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five star most of them are building 26 and the reason is is that overseas investment funds will not put into unsustainable building practices and tenants are insisting that they will not lease a building that doesn 't meet the standard so actually it 's being driven off a new approach internationally to both ethical funding and also people 's own commitment to their carbon footprint as sustainable businesses because if they want to attract the new generation of young people coming through they 're not going to get them to work for their companies unless they meet their ethical standards so it 's a really good point to raise Pauline we are just wondering perhaps on that perhaps that would reflecting principles could be changed to you know embracing yeah so stronger but more stronger weird and I just say that do what you 've been discussing was in the central city recovery plan when it went to the minister and the whole lot was taken out so if it 's taken out for the central city pen I think we find it very difficult to get it through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the residential chapter we have introduced some standards there yeah that 's I mean it 's a very good point because it is actually quite a shame really that I was taken out of the central city plan because it is a must opportunity in that regard Phil you hit a quick,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

6,cgwo6Lv1gbE,20140409,1713.19,"Christchurch, New Zealand",4397,"policy too I 'm sorry I kept up my god about activating kind of big boxes so that there was some interface with with the public and these key activity centers so a pack and say for example or any branch of me yeah so I mean objected to on page six and policy that supports a policy Apes our design of new developments okay sorry we 'll come to it apologies sorry policy to the ranges their claws a we make reference to the zones that make up captivity centers in the lip we required to define the extent of key activity centers and we 're proposed to do that for zoning defining the extent of the zone and we now just we now describe what zones make out the key to the d center clause c is a bit better articulating that we 're giving primacy to keep to these sensors are headed neighborhood centers so what that means is we want using the example i gave earlier we want the larger scale development the larger scale office development or large retail development to go into the record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into bishop dial or it 's where which could look at a proportion with the context ism so it 's about giving prime support to keep to the center 's over other centers and it also reflects policy direction in chapter 6 and the loop and policy three there is this the previous version of the policy was very much focused on the new well north wales center and this an existing policy in the plan which is for the new Belfast center on the south side of red cliff road adjacent to main north road which got rezoning exists if you plan for an environment court decision and we have reinstated policy support around thats future center that just on that it 's getting into more detail than what the policy is about but i 'll touch on it now the aroma court decision put caps on the amount of office and retail floor space within that future center on the basis that and put caps on associated with timeframes so essentially stages the development of that future center and those caps were put in place stage and catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would otherwise go in the central city from the locating out in belfast so the environment court 's decision has been reflected in this policy and that 's clauses H&I of this office policy in terms of earlier clauses to that policy it 's carried through the themes that were in the original draft of policy but some legal feedback we had was that it and the original wording of the policy didn 't articulate clearly what what was sought so with sought to improve that and that 's by adding the belfast elements has drawn out the policy any longer obviously obviously yep sorry and just about the bill for the Red Cliff development the state going to require another seat of traffic lights and there do you know uh just asking yannis question Elizabeth I kind of tell your handle I need to check with a colleague I think that there 's there 's been concern raised as we 've dealt with other measures usually usually by way of approving the installation of traffic lights where there seems to be a growing sense that traffic management has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any development you know whether it 's commercial industrial you know retail oh I suppose that is commercial but even even residential subdivisions where they reintegrate with a main network you know that there does seem to be quite a limited approach rather than looking at the effect on that on that transport network as a whole as have i got that right is that that 's the sense that I 'm getting from different counselors yeah I think that 's a difficult question for mark to answer yeah there 's a transport question and I 'm not sure whether David can or with it we might like to go upstairs and find some of the operational people and well mostly maybe maybe it 's something that just needs to be because we noted it part of what we need to be doing at some stage during this process is looking at the integrated whole the impact of one on the other and so commercial and transport and industrial residential they 're all they 're all linked to transplant and and the need for some detailed you know integrated transport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transport planning but we 'll get to that chapter as I heard that there was going to be another set of lights there and that would mean there 's would be once it when you turn left stick small road to go to the dump and another one at northwood and then the new seat would sit in between those which would be through in a very close proximity and that 's why I was wondering the cotton I 70 yeah I certainly take note of the issue and get you so to your question yeah gleam and then term thank you in some cases where some places have the distinction of being a key activity center a neighborhood center and also attract the master things such as New Brighton how does it work with the different rules and what what takes precedent and is there a joined up approach their suburban center master plans the center 's identified for those master plans with understand those it 's sustained significant damage and required a comprehensive approach to their treatment and didn 't necessarily the decisions about which centers had master @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the function that centers serve whether they were enabled disinter or district Center but having said that master plan we have given effect of those in this document not just at a policy level but also in the rules by for instance having specific rules that were sought through the master plan process well did in the case of the two you know Egnew bryden 's both the key activity center and a neighborhood center can you tell me how that works putting aside their master plan I 'm sorry can in terms of you know which goes first and how the rules apply oh so you brighten and spray tan or Berenson so new brighton is a neighborhood seem to end a ka c that 's right yeah how did that happen oh that the regional councils defined key activity centers across the city which significant focal points range of activities which serve if you 'll each serve different powers city is obviously overlap between the catchments but in doing so they 've looked at which areas which centers serve the eastern suburbs and they 'll liberation was identified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale and volume of activity happening such as record in Holmby they they were obvious it 's the key activity centers but when we 've reviewed that list of kicks of these sensors which comes through and chapter six of the RPS we 've looked at are they are they all really are they the same how they all should we treat them all the same respective the scale of development anticipated so for instance a district Center we allow for a much greater height limit and so we 've when we looked at which centers fall into which categories of districts a neighborhood we 've also considered having regard to what what 's anticipated and those centers is New Brighton and the same camp as a home via Rick Adam and we don 't believe it 's the right approach to treat them all the same because New Brighton for instance we 're going out to the public and the near future to ask the question about possible consolidation of that Center and when having regard to that we need to consider what scale of developments allowed and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Center and the same for the Barrington are on par with what other district centres could sustain its as a scale of development for instance ok so I 'm hearing two things one 's a regional policy designation which is that KAC and and our interpretation of that has been to separate some of those key to the dissenters into a neighborhood center group but for the rest as a district centre group both belong the artistry of things yeah yes okay oh yes it 's really just talking about the hierarchy that we mentioned before from the largest from the city center right down to your local no patience Oh Tim had a question too they just look at the North Halsall arm area with regards to the halls will supermarkets site I mean that 's expanding their redeveloping that site has it been because one of the developer one of the people we meet with regards to the portal Basin development was they had a vision of something closer to say the home be more or something like that as what did not affect the development the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the work we 've been doing to inform the scale of that North Hall as well ok captivity center we 've hadded by economic advice to look at the costs and benefits of that feature center and what impact it would have on other centers and most recent advice has come back that there could be significant impacts not just not necessarily on the existing halls well centered on barrington and so the previous scale provided for in the plan of center that provides for 60,000 square metres of retail floor space and the proposal rules that we 're putting forward to you that 's been reduced down to 20,000 but having said that we haven 't we haven 't produced the zone the area for that commercial ariat significantly because it 's not just a retail center it 's going to provide for a whole range of activities including a civic square public transport services entertainment and cultural facilities so we still want it to be a focal point for that wider community of the southwest the existing population end future population which is going to grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of retail floor space that that center provides for and looking at the impacts on other centers and so that 's why the version that and the rules that accompany of these policies we 've got a much lower cap in terms of retail floor space are we in touch with the developing developers doing the holes will supermarket the revamp of it because they they 've given notice to all the shops at or attacked each to it so I 'm just wondering there is a kind of small shopping center there anyway so as what is the development because if they are thinking of something bigger the and including the post offices or and banks etc that would that not would that not it 's change the extent of what we 're doing in the basin that the existing holes well Center there 's obviously constraints to this development is got residential and close proximity and we 've had concerns raised from residents in the past and in a different process around the urban design provisions about their interface between the supermarket and residential properties and there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support a range of activities and a decision was made quite early on that and you seem to be developed in this north wall to our location which is reflected in the chapter six of the regional policy statement that that provides from for a larger center than the existing hallsville center that existing holes while center still has a role to play for that immediately surrounding neighborhood and suburb so it still has a role and the proposed NewsCenter wouldn 't have such a significant impact on that center from the evidence we 've received but it 's about them working together and just to add to that too is some further background the southwest area plan which you may or may not have heard of was it was a plan and a local government not in the district plan but it did Meechan the amount of residents given given the whole of that area around the Southwest base and some twenty twenty-five thousand odd residents going to be located there and that the existing halls will Center was not going to be large enough and to provide for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undertake and this is what max talked about and this is why the section 30 due to documents are important is the quantitative analysis on distributional effects retail effects from any size of the new symptom well we we don 't know exactly what they 're proposing at the stage for that re existing the redevelopment of the shop supermarket period not a task the details to hand no but I that there 's a we 've had discussions with the big retailers about the proposed chapter and certainly we will discuss further of them what they 're proposing but there 's a there 's a fix that we can consider of the new center on that proposal but also that we need to consider the effects of what they 're proposing is an extension on other centers to as realistically we could seduce that the removal of those small shops along the edge of the supermarket our result of the expansion of Christchurch due to the earthquake as a supermarket is expanding to to cater for the extra growth in that area so they 're kicking out those small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the results of the expansion in that area from the smoke so there are things hitting really well before the eight ball that 's how do Thank You Jimmy the regarding to the key away activity center the policy to a you particular emphasize the two words recognized in it strengthen the law of the for industry and neighborhood fainted but I 'm particular concerned like a victim victim or in-home be more wisdom Alamo is a different location different a situation for instant like a victim or are you are where surrounding areas high-density that they stains your area but most part is kind of keep living one area it 's not a wider current you know space or area is original or the existing the commercial industrial area so if you strengthen in this kind of all my personal particular concern you know maybe none also suitable especially written is very close to the central city so if you more victim or surrounding the the retail shop or part sh 0 whether I have a competition you know with the central city because we all aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more maybe difference at least in area they have wide awake and of space a moment still belong to the commercial older in touch area so you can have a potential expansion in the area and also the residential areas more far away from the exists in the liquid more in the retail shop so whether we need to separate this one 's you strengthen victim or my understanding majority of people in the area against if we keep recognize this okay that though they 'll grow in different ways who me there 's obviously areas that were car parking that are being developed into as an extension of the mall and arguably there 's a larger area for the center to grow and strengthen riccarton there 's pockets where there 's still there 's buildings that were demolished after the earthquakes that provide some some capacity for it to grow or to replace what was there and and record and because the extent of the zoned area is limited that provides a natural constraint on how much the center can grow and obviously the land area and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so we still want to strengthen the center and ensure that it maintains that that role was a strategic center but obviously it 's the way in which that strengthened is may not necessarily be in terms of the capacity but in terms of other improvements for instance a public transport interchange to support greater access by bus and walking and cycling so by strength and it doesn 't necessarily mean intensify or expand the other just on that on records and the north women each surveil centers there 's different there 's different zoning for different areas of a center so record em for instance them all on the south side of record and Road has a zoning which enables a much more intensive and larger scale of development whereas on the north side of record Monroe 's we sign a friend commercial friend zone which provides for a much lower scale of development and that recognizes that there is a relationship an interface between those commercial buildings on the north side and residential properties that needs to be respected and to avoid effects of those of that development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not residential properties to joining the south side of the mall but the as we 've seen there 's there 's already been a significant scattered development occur there so it 's recognizing what 's there as well so I mean I know that you 've got the key activity centers in the definition section I actually wonder whether for the sake of completeness that would be better to put that the definition and and the center 's role description because you got district you 've got neighborhood center large neighborhood send a small large format center and local center I wonder if the CLE activity center should be better placed and their what the specific definition of what it does and the locations rather than have them at the beginning sure I wonder if it would just give us a better line of sight I I have to admit that I can 't see how how they 're defined you know by area or yeah that 's certainly a good a good point and we can look at doing that yeah so so but via zoning can but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so acute ility centers yeah the de said that can be commercial Corps commercial firms commercial retail park and be in Belfast and keep key activity census yeah they can be it since the k 'tralli center includes lens on commercial core and where applicable commercial fringe and commercial retail part that 's right so it 's the same definition as dust road except that some of the character of dissenters this is the difficulty between a regional plan and a district plan we get down to more detail in a district plan the key activity centers in the regional plan name some of what we are calling neighborhood centers they 're not all the same level they 're not all the same types of centers I know that 's the problem well but then do we want to sort of our end where we 're compounding the problem by separating the definitions em by well it 's not so much it 's when we 're not trying to compound the problem with respect to definitions that 's not where the issue is in a sense it 's about recognizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centers which means that there are two forms of character very centers in this place that aren 't but without without sort of defining them as key activity centers and then splitting them into district and neighborhood center at large which they they 're all either one or the other aren 't they is there well there 's nothing that really sits a key activity center apart from a neighborhood center large other than than the fact that they 're named and the regional policy statement yeah well do well we can 't see the point where the regional policy yes I know we can 't be a system intentionally we could I mean we could look at how we could integrate the two so you people are understanding more for instance KAC district or KAC neighborhood yeah or something I think you need to deal with them as k acs because otherwise we will be i think creating are the problem and they do need some definition around them to set them apart from a neighborhood seem too large that listen okay i see is yeah looks it there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move on to it 's a very minor change to add the words enable a wide range of it till ities well rather than just enable a range of activities it 's a tube knowledge that as a not just one or two three different activity groups but it 's these centers provide for commercial community recreational entertainment residential activities so that they 're almost a mixed-use locations of mixed-use so in that respect it 's just greater emphasis of that and then also including the woods visitor accommodation because some cases centers can provide for a visitor accommodation or could do in the future apartments for instance quest apartments as an example of that we see elsewhere in the country of the guest accommodation upstairs from retail all down pseudonym policy five as acknowledging that if in providing for new local centers and and the proposed future Greenfield residential areas we want to provide for small-scale local shops to serve that future residential community but we don 't want it to impact on those residents arounds that new sensor so it 's about providing for it but avoiding impacts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's around that News Center so just to expand on that and the southwest area plan for instance where which identifies with where the growth occurs in the southwest and identifies all these new greenfield areas for housing in each of those green filter is identifies a future node where there 's provision for a gross grocery store or coffee shop for instance which conserved residents and that surrounding community but not not of a scale that 's going to impact on the supercenter they go to for weekly groceries like the holes well supermarket so I think that the only caution that I 've got on there is that we have seen you know entire suburbs develop with nothing because the developers have just given up they 've just said it 's too hard to put in a dairy so we 're not going to bother and that means that everyone jumps in the car to go and get the Sunday paper you know and it 's just crazy I just don 't think that should we should ever let that happen again because we are all we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they live their lives because of the the rules that we put in place yeah so I think we have to be we have to be realistic and I and not allow for residential subdivisions to exist without any amenity at all yeah this is another good reason why outline development plans were brought into effect for greenfield errors and so that it can be indicated where the commercial area is going to be amongst a number of other factors well as long as that actually leads to a commercial sector being developed because we 've actually seen examples of where that 's a developer has produced a wonderful plan but then given up on the process in the second tranche of chapters will be bringing to youtube and development areas which looks at exactly that and strengthening rules for how those ODP sr22 be done right there 's a and certainly one of the changes we 're proposing which is different from the current planners at the moment these green green filter areas there 's an outline development plan which identifies where a commercial center is but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maps now you 'll see a commercial local center within those green foot areas to recognize that it is intended for commercial activity and if someone was at the developer decided like as I could aid in the field and and northwood that that I want to develop a commercial center they want to develop it for a residential then they 'll either come come in for results consent or a plan change because it 's obviously inconsistent with the rules for a commercial zone but at the moment because it would only be consistent with an outline development plan and not necessarily the zoning it gives the plan more teeth go going forward yeah but I mean I it 's I mean I honestly think that we we cannot argue anything around sustainability if we allow for people to opt out of their responsibility to provide amenity to a local community and you know I don 't see that there ought to be a capacity to apply for a change and the zone to prevent or to develop more residential which might be more lucrative for the developer but isn 't very sustainable for the community","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

consistent as possible Tim just it 's just the summer climbing here we were here what 's right yet yeah the stuff that were given a father this Oh which chapter you go to commercial oh no no we 're not on today yeah yeah we 're just doing the definition okay so if we 're all done on definitions and glossary one more from Glen sorry business I 'm just under sheltered housing there the last line but not where residents are detained on the site time student so that means as in permanent residence is that when it bits to do with for example somebody detained under the does a mental health legislation or something like that that 'd be right yeah okay so as long as they 're they 're not being detained under legislation yeah yeah okay all right well thank you very much that 's very good work and let 's see if we can reduce the number of definitions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that you know that the legal issues around but if we could make it as simple as possible it really would be I think quite a relief to everyone including the lawyers great thank you we probably won 't know until we 've completed face to us no I 'm not really them yeah I know because it 's all gotta it 's all got to connect together but it is a fundamentally important chapter and I you know I think you know I 've made a few flip and comments about definitions but we have to get the definitions right because they are the backbone really of the of the whole framework so yeah thank you very much for all your hard work and now who did we want to hear next tank was and Mark Stevenson on commercial chipped on the commercial chapter okay so we 've got a section 32 report and we 've got the draft commercial chapter in front of us and we 've got mark who is going to go home immediately after the presentation on the maze and stretching I 'll let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us through this certainly Oh a slide please clean Oh slam is right remember just on the screen there 's a summary of some of the key issues that have been raised for the consultation over the last five weeks there 's a more the table that was sent to you on friday i believe provides a longer list of some of the points raised and what 's on the screen is just a snapshot of some of the issues i pulled out the first of those is is concern about the focus and the commercial chapter on support for the central city and a larger suburban centers the comment a comment made in that respect was that there 's not enough being done for smaller local centers I 'll come on to explain shortly how that 's being addressed the second issue was really about businesses that have temporarily relocated to suburban locations outside of commercial areas so we 've seen as you be aware there 's been a significant reallocation of businesses is in the order of 800 approvals that have been given for businesses to temporary temporarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central city or to have a commercial centers but a number of those want to stay where they are and I 'll come on to that shortly third issues really about urban design not long ago we had a meeting with the number of large retailers with field progressives and kiwi property who owned some large malls and their concern is that the provisions aren 't flexible enough to recognize the functional requirements of those businesses that they have a specific business model and generally speaking ever have a larger format to their business than smaller scale retailers and therefore a greater need for car parking for loading areas and so that they 're opposed to the requirements for an urban design assessment but also requirements for glazing for build up of buildings to the road front and so forth I 'm concerned regarding the scale of commercial development that 's allowed at the interface with residential properties and what we 've done is reviewed where there is a boundary between a commercial zone and residential zone particularly the commercial call zone which provides for a larger taller bulkier scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interface to avoid residents who currently join those commercial areas avoid them having to face a large blank wall comments about the new large no large number of comments for the public meeting ends in writing about the new center at norful as well just pulling on one of those comments that was concerned about the scale of retail and office development that 's provided for and that center just to refresh our memories the rules would that in the draft that went out for consultation enabled up to 60,000 square meters of floor space which is of a scale too similar to northland zombie even record em and then just a final point on the new center of Belfast which is so self of the Super Center there 's a green fee there 's this green field site which is being resigned in the current study plan for a new commercial center and the owners and proposed developers of that Center opposed the restrictions on retail and office activity in there those restrictions were put in place to a support recovery of the central city next slide so just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the focus on the central city and large centers I understand there was some discussion about this yesterday but there 's obviously a direction in the land use recovery plan and chapter six of the RPS for us to treat the central city as the primary destination for a range of activities and an effect to give primacy to it but it 's not we 've been cautious that we don 't want to put Saul to say to the market at anything large has to go in there where we believe there 's a balance to be achieved so we 're also providing for large retailers in our larger centers so the record in zombies Northlands but also large format centers like tower junction like Blenheim Morehouse Avenue and so forth and really the chapters focused on enabling small scale activity and the smaller centres to avoid government the sale of our scale with its context so an example of given at a public meeting a spin of a large office block going up in the middle of Merivale or Bishop Dale that 's going to look out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the surroundings so it 's about managing the appropriate scale of development according to its context as much as anything it 's not saying that we want to direct all large scale to one location that 's about also recognizing what 's there and what we wanted to look like having said that wet in a respective offices when the key issues was concerned about restrictions on office developments in to the central city and suburban centers and so we 'll come on to a discuss it shortly but we are also providing for offices in a defined office parks and I 'll comment on that and this there 's a rule which permits office development within recognized office parks we 're still providing for small-scale officers in other locations but commensurate with the function of that zone and the focus of the chapter is on providing for their return to commercial centers but obviously there 's going to be issue and so there 's a lot of existing up Allah is there 's been a provisions and stores provision for office buildings to go up in suburban areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for accommodation for those businesses we 're not saying that every single office based company has to be in a center in the future and in respect of temporary like a relocation there are some businesses that it relocated on pepper new road for instance there 's Metro cafe and shops beside it Midway up between here and Maribel and they 've recently been granted resource consent to stay there on a permanent basis so what 's tending to happen now is that businesses like that are applying for a source consent to stay there longer term and that perhaps reflects the investment that 's been put onto was that done on notified basis yes it was he supplies limited notified limited to what neighbors almost neighbors in the vicinity is and and it was supported by the local natives my memory of there was one neighbor and opposition number and support I went to an independent decision maker yeah yeah I mean it 's just you know I mean I know they are very well I sort of grew up in that area but it just I just know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepped my ears up when you use it as an example as we were discussing that yesterday and it is not a location where you would put a group of three or four shops that you wouldn 't because it 's right on each of a of a street coming off papanui road which is one of our main arterial routes and it 's a block away from the Miravalle shopping center which it used to be known as the San Auburn shopping center yeah I 'd be really interested to understand what our traffic assessment said about that because we can come back to you as ice tea rose about that particular consent if you like I think one of the concerns is that sometimes we don 't I mean it just seems really hard to understand how you could get evidence that would support there being a good permanent outcome in terms of experts and I think I think what we 're getting is is they 're actually the temporary becomes the permanent and and all of the advice that we 've received internationally tells us that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be careful around the temporary because it becomes the permanent you know and you know i mean it a slight you know sort of relaxation about this is the fact that it was wasn 't completely unnoticed ever stated me i think but but the fact that you know with one exception the neighbors are willing to accept it but it does put pressure on does on the transport network and you know you sort of you know I totally I mean I know the businesses in there you know one of the ones was whether it was a clothing shop you know that was destroyed and in the High Street you know and and you know and this tragedy associated with it with that destruction so you know I 'm totally supportive of the businesses that have relocated an established there but it does warn off the planning of fix the ongoing planning effects of the temporary becoming limited I certainly agree with what you 're saying which is why there is a need to have this process completed as soon as possible from post plan because it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these effects and issues come of a quick comment around that one because obviously it 's now patched there I think was pre this council being sworn and I remember when they were originally opening this up there there was a mess of ground so I think I basically had about every person Mirabel Lane emailing me reaming me three times under different suit names and everything probably two opposing it saying that it was just the worst thing that could possibly happen and you know there was going to be a license associated with Metro there and I think they 've sort of been visited up being like Aikens or something like that and I think actually now I 'm well yes I admit there are some places where they have an integrator there well probably around the airport business parks and everything I there and they 're probably you know not on Christmas card lists around there but the likes of me try I think about it one person I think a lot of people good you know what it clears a bit of video I quite like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think that it 's been generally pretty well it 's a year the partner could be better if theories are the places I 've it like working style for example in my view you know another one in our patch I think that adds value I think what we 've got there is better than what was there before and yes there might be the odd sort of vested interest neighbors on it might pipe up but for the greater good some of these things I would love them to be in the CBD but I actually think if they 're not it 's not the end of the world it 's like a week Parnell a new market and I think it adds so much value there I think you know that those Tim Priebe coming permanents are good for christchurch and otherwise and and what we 're hearing around the table is of course that it 's a business most butters business site by site decision and easy to be made on a consent which is why we have those rules in the strategic direction the ancients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes like that though I 'm just concerned to be other in what the incremental effects and like well one coffee shop might might not lead to major traffic disruption on pepper new erode that the tote that the total went gradual and incremental people get a customer there and then suddenly we 're in gridlock and so that 's where in terms of the link between this pattern and the transport chapter is going to be real i think really important yes yeah um term and then screen for that it it 's also what is partly killing our neighborhood shops because for instance of you take Colombo Sri to the bottom of the hill we 've got two sets of Nova chops one as the bottom of Kish Mahal the Islanders beacon them and then you got a small one throttle in the middle but if you go in between those you 've got little bits and pieces happening they 're getting resource to see couple were given prior to and prior to the earthquake we 're having concerns about places like the bitumen shops and others actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or whatever but I do think it 's the chipping away and allowing things feel a bit or for worse but we can 't have one without the other so you know we either do one or we don 't I mean it 's that 's yeah it also relates to the discussion we had with the deputy mayor yesterday when we were trying to talk about having a network in place of different sizes of centers and and there 's this issue about innovation and sort of freeing things up but they 're also the effects of that on other centers that are already established and and this is this is the issue that we discussed yesterday this is why marks going to talk through how he 's dealing with us out clean oh yes just a housing to a net respect the tenant protection association has wanted figures over changed use from debt which has now become a temporary relocation of the business given the loss of in a city housing the new inner city east in other areas and we talked about this you say so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I you know hear that over and against temporary becoming permanent and I apologize I 'm to get to you today the list of temper activities and where they located and that 's up my mind but I 'll follow that up today yep I 'm Andrew and then yummy thank you comparing the map on planning map draft playing map 52 with the map on page 154 of the draft commercial chapter referring to the banks peninsula commercial zone this area is reduced in size the area of the the south part of Norwich key is actually no longer included in the banks nila commercial zone whereas the the broad understanding was that the size of that zone would be remaining the same so my feeling is this one has gone under the radar a little bit it has been picked up people who own commercial buildings which are requiring repair in that existing banks peninsula commercial zone that will then fall outside of that area and the port have bought up some land there and clearly there 's an intention for them to start using that land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are still wanting to use that area in line with the the commercial zone a feeling very much squeezed out there are some comments that have been made by the port to those people around this whole issue which is suggesting that there may be some tactic on the part of the port that 's the sort of moving in this direction can you give us some background as to why this area has been removed from the banks peninsula commercial zone and and in as much as it 's covered by the Littleton master plan how that can have changed when one of the points in the Littleton master plan was the community saying that Norwich key should be as far as possible retained as a tenth street certainly we 've received them different perspectives on Elena cellphone are it 's key that obviously that the party the port have sought that consideration be given to resulting that town centre zone and the industrial zone that self of Norwich key to the pool report zone other landowners of sort that is retained as commercial and industrial and the pluses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the maps is that we need to look at it in a concrete that land south of Norwich Keith needs to be looked at comprehensively in terms of not just those sites stone town center and those sites zones industrial but rather how that relates to the land around it that 's own port and because of the two-phase process we 're going through with the review it 's proposed that we treat that area or in the review is one one area but not not necessarily one zone so an effect on my proposal was to defer consideration of what that zoning should be until phase two when we can look at the port zone as a around us and whether some of that land may be appropriate for presenting support uses but again a welcome your feedback on them yes certainly i mean the feedback from the owners of those sites that aren 't owned by the port is that they would like that to remain very very clearly they would like that to remain as part of the banks peninsula commercial zone and first signals that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two buildings down there both of which historic in nature which will need consents to be raised for repair and of course if this zoning change was to happen it would make those consents quite difficult to obtain because it would be a certainly wouldn 't be a complying activity as my understanding yeah so yeah I mean what we 're doing is essentially removing the the property rights of those people who have taken steps towards repairing their buildings and they 're going to find it quite difficult to do so Hank it 's really ensuring that it 's looked at a contraction want the surrounding land and avoiding it 's making a decision without these properties without first considering the wider context of the port which is obvious is coming in phase 2 so it 's by no means saying it should be poor zone but it 's deferring that decision to phase two","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"
NZ,NZ,Christchurch City Council,Christchurch City Council,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZETwErnCvvgbvBbnnHfyxA,09.04.14 - Item 2 - District Plan Review - Part 2,2e0QZfd1Ftc,20140408,1320.109,"Christchurch, New Zealand",3226,it 's good got means areas identified on the plumbing planning maps which are at risk of flooding and a major event no problem and we 're raised floor levels apply why is that a necessary part of the definition because some council in the future may infect decide that finished floor levels aren 't the only answer to the question around exposure to flood risk it doesn 't seem to me that there it 's a definition of flood management area it 's a definition of what happens after you 're in a flood management area yeah I agree with you we can we 'll do some further work on that and bring that back thank you I there were a lot of definitions in here like garden and patio supplier and various other things which I thought how come what why do we have to have definitions of these things why so well it 's it 's a it 's a bit like everything to do with plan it 's about finding the balance we have lawyers who argue the toss no disrespect to lawyers that 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and words that we use so that 's why they 're in there yeah but why I mean what is it in the wider plain that needs us to define what a guardian and patio supplier is for goodness sake why who cares do you want to have a guess their particular definition is actually one of the secondary definitions his it 's been brought through because that 's referred to as one of a number of activities within the primary definition of trade supplier which is a definition that 's been required by the industrial chapter so again it 's just endeavoring to provide some clarity clarity and some certainty around the extent of their initial primary condition so a garden and patio supplier wouldn 't be regarded as a trade supplier without this separate definition is that what you 're saying it 's currently considered consistent with a trade supplier by the current plane an hour an hour dr. alone bio-cop by way of context in the existing plan and proposed plan trade suppliers are provided for an hour general industrial zone it 's currently called a business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as running through to landscape suppliers and the current definition of trade suppliers lists lists of range of industries that fall within that way to scope of what a trade supplier is and that includes garden and garden and patio suppliers and with reference to those different elements of what a trade supplier is the plan at the moment subsequently defines what each of those elements means and so please like I now see there except for a catering supplier the catering equipment supplier or such farming and agriculture now I get farming and agriculture so it 's it 's um I 'm going to just struck me because I 'm at I look at a definition section as trying to limit so higher suppliers okayed are safe they don 't need a definition industrial clothing and safety equipment suppliers oh my god that could mean so many things Oh fortunately it doesn 't need a definition either so well I mean I 'm being slightly stuck here sit here but but not not not being detrimental to the people in the planning industry as opposed to the legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defines all of these things don 't we know what an automotive and marine spyros buildings prior and it 'll cut I totally accept your consumer business is what what we could do what we could do is is heavenly the ends at list of of what are considered trade suppliers yeah the difficulty comes and we you might have what is it landscape suppliers listed as a trade supplier and then you get a garden or patio supplier who actually doesn 't meet the definition under ends of water landscape suppliers so you know that 's that 's the kind of thing that we 're having to deal with here so we could potentially simplified it just means that when it comes to court they might need to be or if it goes to court or if these are concerned they might need to be more work on that at the time madam chair creaks like I can better add to that that these these provisions came out of a plan change which was focused on the council 's and seemed to facilitate retail activity happening that 's really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're looking at these images so the policy behind the need for this mission psychosis so identify what activity the clan wants to see in commercial areas and what activity would need resources center that wants to sit up in an industrial area so you 've got a context of saying okay we want to enable trade suppliers to set up an industrial areas because that doesn 't happen they 're busy becomes functioning of other commercial areas but we don 't want to open the floodgates to so everyone putting up their hand and say hey on the trade supply so so so that 's a need for all citizens even secular state commissions basically can try to simplify them but the simplification is still what the intent of being very clear what 's okay in an industrial area and what do we want to see in the commercial area yeah and I militias are raised through the plan change for the special purpose Airport zone about trade suppliers the same sort of arguments are arising there yeah yep African the definition of community and certain my apologies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community housing unit and social housing given that we may look at a an approach from Christchurch for affordable housing which doesn 't quite meet these definitions and what how will we ensure that the definition is wide enough to include that though social housing will be almost defined by the tenant after the middle of April this year under the government 's reforms so social housing is defined will not cover the whole of affordable housing I 'm still waiting on some suggested reading from the solicitors around that and it might be that they may have to inflate and recovered at a show or potentially either needs to be considered to be included within whatever definitions come out of there or teach Lea different as long as I 'm and so community housing unit and social housing that we put affordable housing in there as well that would be something we 'd have to consider yeah yep well I 'm just otherwise we 're going to be in the position where you come up in the residential chapter oh yeah he said we 'll do but they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the government even doesn 't have a consistent affordable housing definition so we just need to be careful what the implications are the year I think they 've got one in there loop and yes there is one in the loop but it 's very they 're saying they 're about to revise it and but I just want to flag that that definition will be problematic for us as a capsule so i 'm not sure but so we do need to address it in terms of affordable housing social housing and affordable housing more blue and it will be the tenant that defines whether it 's a social house or an affordable house yeah I think how the New Zealand have identified thus and their submission on this so on page 25 of the document you 've just circulated it 's got the definition is considered very limited in scope the definition draw any captures development of units by h MZ c and c CC and does not extend to other housing providers does not recognize contemporary approaches to funding and delivering social housing developments for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and private housing which might pick up the affordable housing side of it so but you say you 're working with the lawyers you 're working with housing New Zealand to come up with some well put it this way the definition that you having fun too was amended in response to what you 've just read out but obviously it still needs to be the work and as I see yeah I think that what 's missing as the there 's that private component that may be part of the final development and then you don 't have to deal with the issue around affordable housing Glenn thank you just on it definition just to clarify too is that definition and fearing that the council actually is a registered community hasn 't provided because this is another moot point in this whole conversation at the moment to know is it knowing that it makes me an option is it makes it an option but it also recognizes that there are others and next space other than the council and housing New Zealand so it says council housing New Zealand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be that we want to people cut those around a mixed developments yeah and some of these will limit some of these definitions or limit Andrew and two questions if I can the first one neighborhood centers on page 36 we 've got a corolla and littleton in the list but we define a neighborhood center as the commercial core zone and the commercial fringe them it looked as though we should have commercial banks peninsula zone in that list as well this is a point of detail that 's great will I mean that right thank you and then I just wanted to also ask a question about noise sensitive activities the first thing I notice that this was quite difficult to find because it 's not incorrect at alphabetical order and then the second point so noise sensitive activities Point C guest accommodation refers specifically to airport noise is guest accommodation not covered by the port noise overlay it present no it 's not if I can just give you a bit of background to this definition this definition effectively trying to combine three separate but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one required and was in relation to the commercial and industrial was owned by Mark there was the one and loop around the airport noise contours in the third one was the existing be exponentially definition and relationship report so I 've tried to can combine them but retain the pertinent bucks to H and the cause he which is the but specific to the port it includes everything that 's currently in the definition what 's not currently in the definition as East accommodation although it was one of the extra activities that has been asked for through public feedback and I have included that now but I excluded hotels which was also asked for because they get type of activity of its own nature his noise generation activities itself sounds good question okay so it 's the intention then the guest accommodation wouldn 't be covered by the port noise over later right at what it would be yeah despite there 's nothing so there 's a change which isn 't incorporated into what we 've got in front of us it 's right okay thank you so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's just a terrible mistake and if you think that people make up a little theory things that 's just you 've put habitable spaces and head of tape together until one until one definition of habitat that should start on the fifth third line means the area or environment where an organizer more ecological community loves not the residential unit or short term government accommodation establishment there 's just a start I have a panel that it 's Italy didn 't start out that way no I started reading and I thought how are they describing that as a habit yeah there 's been a few incidences where the Pierce is some sort of electronic corruption of staffers at pocket well I think I think what happens is they 're quite often if you put a you know beginning of a weird and then it just picks up what 's gone before if it 's another programs though yes is the type of thing will be picking up in their final reader he just grabbed it the noise sensitive activities one of the biggest problems we had with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town houses and damn penthouses and the stroke and the noise levels that we were taught were trying to keep to kind of killed any activity that you really wanted to do the central city so how are we going to balance that because my suggestion when I was asked or invited onto the council board or a group working party which are left was that the either have to soundproof the venues their own or soundproof the building of your building was in the patterns which would be the preferred because of outdoor activity and yet we were told that that wasn 't going to happen because of edit costs which would then prevent the development so it was like chicken or the egg with cat whatever they affect the matter wasn 't working so how are we going to make it work and with your leave if we could discuss it in more detail in the residential chapter and this is just the definition of what those words mean but but that matter is dealt with in the residential chapter degree of size needed for a I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of around educational facilities and health facilities and if people were creative they may seek to establish those such that there was no place for legal highs so when we define so you have to be more than a hundred meters from such a place if we were for example to limit them to the central city some real potential exists for people to establish an educational or health facility such that no stores could be there which is interesting and creative and will no doubt arise so when you define an educational activity how big does it need to be it 's not based on size right and though so in theory and educational activity which I see you need to systematic curriculum which is a nice 19th century view of education and and one that I really like take it out dometic cover curriculum but but if you were creating a daycare center for five children that would qualify as a education facility under this definition I police oh right and a health facilities such that one person was counseling from it facility would that be awed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this definition that 's here on page 25 yeah again neither of the education activity with the healthcare facility definitions and then we have a minimum or maximum size at present in any any size restrictions you 'll find come in the zone itself so size restrictions are specific rules and where you do definitions as you try and take out those standards or rules out of definitions and put them in the chapter that they apply so different residential zones might have different sizes of education facilities so that 's where you 'd like to find those sorts of restrictions what is the status of recovery plans under the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act is of the 16th of April 2016 because all of the orders and council expire as of that date so and the legislation does as well do they does the recovery strategy and recovery plans passed under that legislation have any legal standing beyond that date the changes that the recovery plans have made to the other statutory instruments such as the currently operatives district plan or the regional policy statement those changes that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 've been made to the document itself so referencing these documents at the back of the definition section might need to refer to the fact that they themselves expire if that is the legal position if they legally expire is of those dates I think we have to reference that and that the appendices here I don 't believe they do but we will check that and get back to because it is a good detail that you should be aware of or we do need to not only that they do and I also can 't go in here and and that means that at that point we could trigger another series of amendments to our district plan yes because those are they for 2016 there will no longer be the provision and the CER act that says only the minister can change the provisions in there right so for example if there were issues that were outstanding and the CBD is at that time we could infect signor a review of our district plan to deal with the CBD issues yes yeah very good right are there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glossary it 's been very helpful Jimmy chin general issues because you mentioned this one as some of them already have a definition solar government may be documented source a moment did it if it didn 't I 'm wondering if we have listed the definition for how our neighbor in the district council voiced and I go solving all the while made whether they recognize this one or not otherwise might be the confused if the self same same same body you know for a definitive nation within the meaning is my particular tassel check the other chapter leaders who were responsible for identifying what they needed in a way of definitions were also asked to liaise with the staff of the adjoining territory authorities to ensure some consistency also the UDS organizations head staff on tagged the collaborative advisory group so we 're there has been the opportunity to be consistent that has been worked through but for various reasons they may not always be consistency between the use of words and how they 're applied and it may also be that but because context is very important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on or why met give a definition for a certain word or phrase we don 't necessarily need data more and we don 't have one,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

1,RQA7eiNUMZI,20140408,1402.309,"Christchurch, New Zealand",3620,madam chair and thank you and good to see everyone back again just just a couple of notes before we start I have with me the presenters for today Janine so be mark over here Stephenson David Faulkner and I have two others with me mark rutte without the back and Peter Eamonn to assist Janine with issues or questions about the definitions of that 's needed I just like to go through the papers quickly on your desk so you should have the three section 30 tues on your desk one for the commercial chapter 14 the industrial chapter and one for the transport chapter there is not a section 32 for the definitions chapter because those definitions are covered in these three section 32 s not and there is a an overview of the few slides that we 'll be using today hopefully you have your draft chapters with you that you would have been given i believe on friday and the last thing I 'd like to bring to your attention in the middle of your desk should be this paper which has headed up covering comments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea jog or Christchurch joint officials group comments that we discussed yesterday in front of that is a two-page summary from me about the context and overview and brief responses they are brief responses because these issues we will discuss as we go through chapters and just at the back of my two-page notes to emails one as the covering email that came with the sea job comments and more importantly following that as an email from myself to verb who 's my equivalent over in Sarah planning manager I 'm not sure what her exact title as I beg your pardon but just to note that and the sea job comments on the second page it 's state that the council is to not be inconsistent with these see job comments that is incorrect care we the understanding is we must only have regard to and the email that i have attached there is to endorse that from birth to say that was a mistake so that 's for your benefit via in the comments so now just just before we start one other point unfortunately mark stevenson has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is still not very well so if after the commercial chapter we might go straight to transport and we might have to share jawl that second chapter in another day because I understand we have another full day now available on the calendar so we 'll just see how mark goes yeah thank you very much for taking the effort but we don 't want to we could want to hold you up and take you a kiss me a primary for examples or same term is real epidemic of flu yeah inches n kids so it 's a rich almighty Ellen 's been affected by it as well sorry well do we want to do has checked a first and then let him go he 'll say that to you but he 's still looking quite pale okay all right so well that 's an incentive for all of us to lies down on hard working this morning so thank you I thank you over to you getting right slide please erlend oh no big pardon no she doesn 't have a cell um this is the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it 's not want to go more substantive ones so our pets start with just a brief to racine sitting comments despite not being one of the substantive check does it does play an integral part of the overall package because obviously it 's very critical to the interpretation of the plan for enhancing the plans usability provider providing greater certainty to the meaning of objectives policies and particular rules and also ensuring consistency of application of rules in particular across the young the plan the definitions apply to all the rules and on a case-by-case basis to the objectives in policy then in this first priority phase of the district plan review what this chapter has endeavoured to achieve has been to identify what we 've between the primary difference I though is definitely required by each of the priority chapters but also an a limited number of cases approximately 30 I think there are what are two secondary decisions which are definitions on which the primary definitions rely an earful also needed to be brought through into the space of the district point of view iris lee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've also amalgamated Association associated definitions from about which the reputation and both the city plan and exponential a plan prior to starting the review and also undertaken amendments for correction purposes for example there 's a definition that was previously called Luca license obviously the localizer seemed that legislation has changed and it 's now more appropriate to refuge datos alcohol license so that 's an example of that the check the chapter is substantially yeah but it 's one that cannot be finalized completely until such time as all of the other substantive chapters have been finalized so to some extent it 's still a work in progress at the copy they 've got in front of you it has incorporated all of the public feedback the peer review feedback feedback from the joint central government officials what it doesn 't have at the moment in which I 'm still reading through is some legal review comments that I received yesterday just in summary what those are largely about is just to ensure that all definitions that we 've included in the check that being used within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ related definitions identified and included that that there are a number of Road related definitions and there that needs some refinement also there are two definitions around social housing one community housing in the second line social housing which also needs some refinement refinement to the glossary and also there 's a number of individual definitions that have some comments that need to be worked through just to ensure it a week ability and consistency to wrap the chapter in finally when we can they lock down the chip they will need to be a finally get to ensure that their secrete alphabetization definitions numbering cross-referencing that there 's no spelling mistakes etc are all being cheap so moving on to the actual feedback that received through the public engagement they were actually only three comics that I received that resulted in changes to or the additional for definitions which we 'll see in the summary table in front of you were given in more detail there were a number of definitions related to report in limits and this what journeys talked about the summary of comments would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a state single the first one was to define ancillary residential unit however and discussion with they shipped elite of condition are the industrial chapter that what they 're actually seeking via can actually be achieved through a bit of definition of an overlay area around that and then port so no change has been made in the street to date request the noise sensitive activities stiffener shown currently includes a part that are specific to the port and additional activities had been asked to be added to that part of the definition some of those were appropriately added some of them were not so I have amend a bit definition to the extent that i consider was appropriate a good one was to delete the reference to shipping containers from the definition of building again an association with mark we thought that the the better way of doing that as to leave it on the definition because then it is subject to certain controls particularly in relation to the interface interface with more sensitive zones but those can be where there is no need for control there can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shipping containers within the rules of the industrial chapter so that 's the way that 's going to be dealt with it was a crisp around adding a definition of apartment with a view to basically anticipating that any residential units that are built within the port influences overlay area would be apartments above ground floor level within commercial buildings that won 't necessarily be the case it 's possible that residential units within their area could be built for example to the rear of a commercial property the commercial use would still remain the primary use that would still make the purposes of design but let it necessarily be in apartment so again it 's something that can be dealt with in another way other than adding a definition of apartment there 's been a request to delete the definition of Port activities from this phase one and that 's also any comments come up in the legal review so at the moment it 's felonia if it was to stay in there could still potentially be changed through phase two but it may come out once I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second submitter and there were two points one was to add to secondhand goods suppliers to the definition of retail activity in hindsight that 's considered appropriate so that 's been added accordingly the second one was to define community facilities particularly to include the activities that were anticipated by the Environment Court and relation to the Belfast district centre so again I don 't mean to that definition and to the experience there was a request for a definition of places of assembly this murder was consumed there in the absence of such a definition a place of assembly if you were to base it on for example the law relating to unlawful a silly people it could be anything that had 300 people including you know for example someone 's living room in their house so again an appropriate definition of classy similar has been included so it 's a bit hard to follow because I don 't know what you 're reading from but my lust of amendments you know didn 't look as extensive as that and I can 't tell from the chapter which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and read so they 've been easy to identify yeah the way in which this chapter has been developed has been somewhat different to the other chapters designed by its very nature basically is each definition was identified in finalized and draft form it was imported directly into a play so of kepta created that could his highlights by way of trick changes but if you look at the summary sheet basically I 've just elaborated on the information and its summary sheet and if you look at the column on the far right-hand side you 'll see that the definitions that have been either added or reminded in response to those requests yeah but I mean dear like the mission of specific activities from definitions you start it you in with an amendment to retail activity but it doesn 't say that you added on the second here it was all I was just it was just difficult to follow it 's all not not criticizing at it it has been anyway just got running through them so not just the emitter all chapter I thought it 's unfortunate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't fit worth you know what the you know disabled community have have put up as you know sort of their definitions and when you think of all of the different you know building ratings you know around accessibility it 's unfortunate that it 's this definition that 's chosen for our city plane when we have an ambition to be an accessible City anything that we possibly do around there I think we can extend the definition we just have to be sure that where we use the word it 's appropriate yeah alternatively you know how one related building access one related to transport but it 11 related Lena timeliness around transport because this year yeah because I think that 's what this one is around the acceptability of the time you know go to get from one of those two other which is slightly different from I think what most people would assume accessibility was around district plane doesn 't really do with timeliness of transport it does deal with the modes of this means the ability to reach a vocational see this with an accessible amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort is a new definition really the way that I 've hearing up ball feeling now we 'll have a look at that yeah and I certainly take on board your comments about the disabled community and access to balanced ok now i 'm not going to pick you up on the spelling of the word principle but other expenditures an adjective other than al-amin de and i know that some adjectives have become youth teacher and principal some but we don 't need to do an education exercise around the council table but that 's the rule you know adjective al de la noun right so yeah that 's the noun because it 's they say principle but it 's it 's an adjective its principal teacher so it 's a very simple way to remember yeah thank you I just two questions on this chapter um one is in relation to the classification of arterial major terial mana terial roads and I understand the government through nzta are looking at a one road classification across New Zealand supposed to give effect to in terms of district plans so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking um yeah David Faulkner on the transport it later i 'm going to cover this more on the transfer chapter but i can 't speak to that now this is a GI with an initiative specification we 're looking at and seeing how we can use it but under the language recovery plan we have to be consistent with the classification and the christchurch transport strategic plan and it 's the statutory direction we 've got from the image recovery plans at the moment that 's the terminology and the hesitation is taken from it doctoring the council agreed to a couple years ago and and so that 's the first pageant recording district plan and once the new national education becomes final then we may need to make some updates in the future but it 's still very much a work in progress so we 're waiting to see ya time frame around that because what I 'm really worried about is we do a whole bunch of work then had to go through a whole new process to reclassify definitions and roads based on what government are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some and I know we pressure out we can probably discuss a small detail that transport chapter but if the government is going to have this been kind of thing happening around around New Zealand I think something can the definitions that says the reason we 're using these old road definitions is because what you 're pretty much just explained I think would be helpful the second question I had was around Olivia since housing and I was a little bit concerned that the definition now is an elderly person 's housing unit existing as of sex december two thousand thirteen may be covered may be converted to residential unit that they may be occupied by any persons without the need to be encumbered by a bond or other appropriate legal instrument so I mean basically I 'm trying to understand we have this big discussion that a few days ago but basically should we be even calling them ugly business housing minutes now and should we be thinking of another name to give to those ones that are basically free fall what anyone can live via place yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for a slightly different reason which was that I could understand that the existing definite talks about being encumbered by a bond or other appropriate legal instrument which ensures that the use of the integers can find two elderly persons then it talks about it may be converted without the need to be a cumberbund or other appropriate legal instrument so and my understanding was that the reason that the government left out the requirement that we had put in place around the around you know all of the people in the units agreeing to this change was that they would be protected by the appropriate legal intro instrument which in that particular case was a help me out here a covenant and I presume that 's what you mean by other legal instrument so so they can change it without any legal instrument and without recourse to any legal instrument perhaps it might be better to talk to this definition when we do the residential chapter so when we get into the residential chapter you 'll see that this is a provision that sort of a holding provision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your Henson 's quite correctly pointed out the residential chapter is looking to just provide for multi-unit development without this definition of making it specific to age group so it 's probably best to wait till the residential chapter and willing to accept that I would feel very very uncomfortable about writing and a definition that allows an existing unit to be converted without reference to the appropriate legal instrument so I think we can cover that often more explanation for that residential well I 'm signaling that an explanation won 't satisfy my concern which is that is not what we agreed to and that was not the advice that I received from government about why they lift out the requirement for people to agree to the change final point I 'm not really a question about just a request for an addition is when you look at the mayors and okay so into whatever page and you see what you 've got you know IG IH RS rmd but is I couldn 't see in here where there 's a cave that all those different letters so when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an industrial zone and I can kind of gather that from the word and I go over to industrial and all likely as industrial activity so I think there needs to be a key of what the different the different things mean and the definitions because if you go and dust your general it 's quite hard to see in here what that actually means that there is no reference to it if I could just speak to the madam chair the the letters were then the boxes right so in the painting zones of course are in the chapters and I did meet you yesterday that in the introduction chapter should we still keep it we thought we would have a less there of all of the zones it 's not really a definition as such it 's a zone name and the zones are discussed and because I mean if you feel it needs to be in definitions as well that 's fine it 's just that they are as own name they 're not a definition I 'd rather see less definitions if we possibly can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know description of what we 're talking about in the areas where that information is needed to be known the least cross-referencing backwards and forwards that people have to do I mean I kind of would like to think that this would be a plan where people could go to it and they wouldn 't have to actually be a lawyer or a planner or anyone like that they could actually see what it was that they had to do obviously they 'll be taking advice and you know from from technical experts but I 'm much rather that the that the document itself was accessible on this that 's it just like a one-page key or you know three pages of key that 's what solicitor and I actually personally think that 's a good idea because then straight up front you can see that this is how the city as its own decision how to use the plane so people will understand that immediately yeah thank you and apologies for being late I do have to also just record an apology for need to leave because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just before or just after ten-thirty I came back as soon as I can um the

7,3cc_qD8HgH8,20140408,1122.06,"Christchurch, New Zealand",3065,so moving on to the input point for which was a particular issue that I thought I should raise which is the prospect of Overland owned by Mary been able to be developed that 's an addition to the provision to allow Mario reserved land to be developed this was an issue that has been raised by NATO the provision at the moment in loop and in the regional policy statement is to allow development of Mario Reserve leaned so this development could be in the form of residential and to some degree commercial and other forms of activities but the suggestion is that let them be extended to other Maori land the proposed response to their is that we 've included it as an issue for consideration on page six and page 14 we 've added that in under three point four point one point one and three point five point two point three but that 's it 's probably a matter that is better dealt with it Stage two particularly in the Toyota vanilla and papa como housing chapter where we 're going to have a specific chapter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it would be i think in working through that chapter with night ahoo that we could develop this further and decide on an appropriate policy approach go and meet with no Tahu on some housing issues and the the first one of Mario reserves being used is that and a kind of communal ownership structure or is it is that being used for housing is that what you dog mat ah well a lot of it has been used for housing but there may be and my understanding is there is the desire for more housing but not just for housing it 's also for potentially some commercial and other activities in terms of the use of very resilient can you use your microphone that 's makes it easier under the resource management AG you know where we are required to give credence to you know historic heritage relation their ancestral lands of things so then we think you know if we 're starting to talk to tonight oh ho about using married reserved lands for housing we 're probably sort of coming up against some fairly strong arguments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 7 are we an area reserved land is land that was legally allocated to marry not as reserved as might be commonly used as an green parks and and so forth it was actually for Mary to use so in terms of living there working there and so forth so really what is being proposed here and this as I said comes directly through from directions that also in land use recovery plan and now in chapter 6 of the original policy statement as well which is that that sort of development should be allowed on Mary resume and so my interpretation is that we 're completely consistent both with the act and with those higher order statutory documents and this is not new this this is also an our current operative plan but what Peter 's talking about is some additional land other than mildly reserved land well complication when we start to is that what is what is Maryland what is Mary land that they can do with of their own accord and we start to get into these issues of ownership and the somehow father year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start to get the resource management position provisions coming in it 's it 's a very complex and tricky area to start a trend en ESA 's and I 'm not sure whether not i who have thought through exactly where they want to go with this it was an issue that they 've raised with us and obviously wandering through the dialogue with the ansel omelets and that 's why the suggestion is that the response here is not to put any policy direction about what is to happen to marry only and that is not marry or reserve but that we actually work through with my toy who what what they 're looking to do and respect of that and making decisions as part of our stage 2 what do they mean by Marty leaned because I mean Marty reserve I know but do they mean lean that 's been designators Maryland under the tattoo Delfino Amar 'e act or my picture from the sessions with in Katie was that there is something that 's still being clarified within night I who themselves as well it 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that thing you would have developers saying well how come they get one set of rules and everyone else gets something else it does raise all not what it means so that 's right i think if i might add to this and i 'm wondering whether this is the background talk because there 's this been raised with me before by and representatives if in katy and nighter who is for example the lender our puppy that was affected by rock roll boulder roll yum in some of some other land that 's been affected by some of the natural hazards that will be coming through you and the chapter they want to ensure that they had sufficiently and still for further growth all their people that 's one a shoo-in for example another issue is at it unakku on the peninsula where they 're confined by a very steep gully and that land is now being developed as much as it could and they feel they need more land for future generations so potentially that 's what 's behind this hmm okay no no I thought I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I 'm entirely comfortable with I don 't think anyone would regard that as setting up a one set of rules for one group at another set for another I think that that what that indicates is you know that when you 've got the natural you know sort of narrowing of the development opportunities because of the environment you know that I 've got no problems with that yeah so the first bullet point which is in relation to the council vision there 's quite a bit of discussion i 'll let previously so i 'm not sure whether there 's further further i can add to that discussion i think will tease that one out like I mean we 're going to go through the chapters and then I think come back to the strategic directions I think it has been incredibly helpful to to have this conversation at the outset but I think I think there is it 's not a vision it 's a statement about what what else city should you know look like feel like and and and that it is easy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement about what we 're trying to achieve with the district plan review recognizing that we are also a city and transition and with recovery needs that create an exceptional you know stress on the on the environment that we have in those stresses are kind of felt in many different places and I think some sort of articulation of that I think would be useful though and can I just and particularly being in redevelopment and recover and rebuild mode but also it 's not just like one of those trendy vision statements with you know that 's right and that 's what I didn 't want to you know when I sort of read there about the vision statement thing you know I thought that 's it 's not they 're not capturing us and I think that 's because you know we all think of vision statements as they 're sort of set of Airy fairy things that don 't really mean anything other than they look good on your in your report and I think we want something that is of substance and I think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you so I think it 's a great idea i also wonder if it 's helpful to you and we 're happy to sort of get a few writers on to it and see if we could come in with something in a sense it 's it 's the condensation of everything that 's in this chapter yeah into a statement and that statement may able to be used in other documents that we 've discussed today yep yani so I thought it 's part of our strategy retreat that or gathering that we should think about the vision because it 's really clear we have no idea what we want to be as a city going forward Oh wouldn 't go there dr. two different things different things happening the only reason that we left a blank and the long term plane at this stage or other annual planning process is because none of us like being described as a world-class boutiques city but that 's right to me trade-offs around the things we were talking about before localization business centralization sustainability this is the need affordability those are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around what is it in terms of going forward is the city got to look and feel like and I just feel like we need to do that work it 's really important we are going to be doing at work but they 're two separate things so we are really our strategy is kind of you know not really what I would say it 's been kind of the vision and neither would the UDS because the UDS was done before the earthquake and the recovery strategy was really done to us rather than with us so i think the resin need for a kind of with a process to look at a new version posted yeah but but we 've had that on the agenda since we decided that we didn 't want to be called a world-class boutique city which was what we inherited from the previous council can I just do so when you talk about affordable housing what what do you mean by that how do you think we can actually achieve her what I was talking about in relation to sustainability verse affordability was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are put back and the level for peers that are done versus the kind of modern sustainable so we might as part of our district plan for example we might make a minimum standard of sustained of environmental impacts on new roads that get put it but there 's a cost to that in terms of affordable housing and I think income versus rent as a good measure and I would take the quarter of of people 's income versus what they 're paying interns re but how do we get that affordable housing you can 't just magic it up no no I think why don 't we talk to admire there 's any airplay and we might I mean I 'd love us to say when we rezone learn from rural to residential for private developers they give something back to the community there 's a community benefit that should accrue from the developer getting a huge financial windfall in the city losing more of its green space there are processes should come back queenstown do go back into some sort of affordable land being we have people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we get do the individual chapters so queen they can quiz will be the most unaffordable place probably in new zealand ok in terms of the UM the discussion can happen afterwards excuse me but their whole council vision if for example the council vision were to encapsulate something like a place where anything is possible when innovation is valued or something like that what would we do differently in the district plan from what we 're currently doing this is what i 'm trying to avoid that is the discussion around the long-term plane it 's the vision for the city as a whole is a live breathing entity not as a bunch of news about what can happen we completely understand them I completely understand that but just if we were to focus on this as part of our overall vision would we do anything differently in the district plan then what you 're currently recommending I 'm going to be a matter of emphasis if certain aspects say and this is just an example if economic growth became the priority of the city now I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that by a number of mechanisms you could allow business development anywhere in the city for example again that 's an off-the-wall example but that might be one way that you might encourage economic growth the issue becomes obviously for the city how far do you want to go in that direction has compared to some of the implications of going moving in that direction there is usually a trade-off in virtually all the planning issues that are discussed both of us chapter and the other captors and so it becomes a matter of where you want to sit versity wants to sit in terms of those trade-offs we are in the range of possibilities only if we wanted to focus on encouraging innovation and people were doing things and thinking that if you came to Christchurch you put almost anything was possible here what would we do differently in the district plan I appreciate that a lot of its in there and your plan what would would we do anything differently in the district plan then what we are currently doing well is it I think in my replies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of controls you have on activities it would be changing those sorts of things that I could see the district plan potentially doing because that 's effectively what the district plan does it says we activities can occur he 's in what circumstances they can occur so if you wanted using that as an example if you wanted to progress along that way and on those lines and that there is a priority then it would be those sorts of things that the district plan could change I 'm sorry I need to add to that too we have to understand the planning hierarchy which district plan sets amongst you can 't it can 't ignore the stitch tree plans and the Resource Management Act in this so it 's not just what could we do I mean you can 't not have a district plan no no so if it would I think I think we 're confusing two things I said and in a way I didn 't want to go down the street for this very reason the strategic you know that the vision statement for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replace the one that was created in the past which was a world-class boutique city that is not what christ church was is or will be we need to we need to define what we are as a city and that is emerging from a range of different conversations that we 've been having over the last six months so I want to take that offline it 's got nothing to do with this debate this debate is about the that the legislative framework really for for planning and and it will fit within the version that we see it but I 'm thinking that what what the the joint group have really asked for is for that strategic vision which is more about the look and the feel of the place and Hera well it connects so that 's that 's that 's what the district plans about you know and end up you know the collocation of different activities and reverse sensitivities and all of those things but they are that that 's about where you 'd love where you work where you play and and the combination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place where anything is possible because everything is not possible under district with me to put it bluntly ones are visions too under the RM you might say you know there 's a vision statement under the local government debt which is a lot broader that 's right but we 'll we 'll get there i mean III think that there will be a statement emerged that that brings the district plan together in terms of what this council wants to achieve but it 's it 's not a reflection of what else 's individuals want to achieve it 's actually what we want for our city yeah but we will get there so so I think that 's us done and dusted for today and tomorrow we have the exciting chapters of what do we have tomorrow we 've got transport commercial industrial and the definitions and groceries am i right you are right here we go song and we have small section 32 documents here which will distribute before your go that 's all right yeah that 's great Oh fell just a thought I 'm definition see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be a good place to start for us you don 't understand all those two I don 't know how you going to I 'm happy either way if

6,_5TEqEWucuk,20140408,1210.679,"Christchurch, New Zealand",3134,we shall them I shall declare the meeting underway years again so thank you all very much and it 's moving on so is there anything do you want to carry on through because I think we 've got as far as the first point and and with it then sorry but I think what we 've taken from here as as perhaps if we could have perhaps identified some of the issues that there might be a conflict between the land use recovery plan and the central city recovery plan and also the issues that yannis raised around the so-called residential red zone again whether there 's some issues that we could clarify and you know build into that because I mean what we will be meeting with the minister you know during the course of this process and it might be with while having something to to raise so over to you thank you the suggestion was that we needed the skepta needed to be clear in terms or what was to happen to tempe recovery activities and what we 've proposed to do is add on page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point four you 'll see a and B under the error both and read and essentially because there are auditions essentially we 're saying that in most cases the policy direction is that activities move back into appropriate locations but and see recognizing that there will be some cases and I can think of that Monsieur it was raised earlier about the devil deeply for smaller businesses who really have very limited business opportunities in terms of locations for their business and that there that there will be limited opportunities I think until that progression of movement of businesses into new officers or whatever as the city central city develops begins and therefore the release of some perhaps lower level lower quality accommodation was available there will be situations like that we are some temporary activities need to remain in temporary locations for longer periods and provided that that isn 't causing and you 'll see over the page some providers about looking at what are the effects on the surrounding community and whether their applications wider implications for the district as a whole provided there are significant issues in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow them to continue for longer than they 're currently authorized yeah I think can i perhaps use an example of that so the youth hub you know and barbados street which would normally be residential but you know number of residential or houses taken up by the youth services youth health etc once they 've got a youth facility specifically designed around a range of services and potentially some accommodation as well then the designation goes back to residential yep but we would facilitate them remaining 44 where that kneaders there where the needs the aryan taking into account those other environmental impacts in and see Roy depicts very good Yanni I I think this can be a minefield so if you look down Mirabelle for example you see another businesses that have clearly gone in on a permanent basis I spent huge amounts of money outline retrofitting residential and commercial so I 'm really concerned about this because I think actually people need places to live and one of the problems again it comes back to that elec of affordable office commercial space and areas but is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the housing to enable people have places to love is more critical than providing cheap space for businesses to go into otherwise residential areas so you know I would really want to have something in here that talks about the need for housing has been critical I 'm a little bit more relaxed around we 've got either mixed-use signs or industrial zones those sorts of things but I just I 'm really concerned that this is being edited I don 't understand from a practical practical point of view how are you actually going to administer it by Ethan you need a whole bunch of resource consents coming back in or are you going to you know basically just roll things over the temporary activities resolved by April 2016 and by that time they either had to have sort a resource consent for permanent location there or they might choose to go to the minister to ask for an extension of that temporary activity timeframe except they won 't be able to beyond April 16 because the ordering councils expire but before then I mean that 's really all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know it kinda understand it yeah and it was something that I didn 't realize until he obviously looking stage April 2016 all the orders and counselors expire unless unless this council chooses to do something else to add on seats yes a changeup Romania so has there been any work done around the number of temporary consents which ones are in which Lazar yes there 's a lot of detailed work about their victim was it yeah I think it would be really useful to have that we so that would be is it a context here so can 't for context and because it 's both residential and commercial as enough because there are a lot of shops that are operating yeah and results and small businesses yeah then we don 't know did you want a bit just to be given to you for reference that that information um well get so but I mean I want a man fact so I know your life we 've got a thousand residential properties that now have to freakin scenes for officers in commercial I just think that someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work she we need housing and what was the temporary villagers and they look information could you could you do that yes get somebody to give us a that the numbers but could you break them down into areas so that you know there are there are 20 and mere avail you know there are so many in public and give it to you by the end of the week oh you know that 's fun yeah type int 0 and type of activities yeah it 's not just us on that there is a see a temporary shopping center down there pepin or erode put a pepper nary a mere agal lane and i was talking to one of the tenants who is also located and the tannery just to about a week or so back and she 's signing a new lease because they understand the attempt relicense has been extended for quiet years to longer that 's the understanding that this is what the owner is telling the lieutenant well unfortunately there isn 't always a lot of good understanding out there with real estate agents I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular consent to be able to confirm it falls under this category I think what you might be getting confused with if this is the Metro cafe counselor yep good yep yeah the problem with this is actually we need residential and we need business and you can 't just have houses if there 's no jobs where are people going to work so the reality is we have a huge squeeze in supply and that 's not going to go away but what I think is going to happen is I mean places like Metro good example is they may they may end up staying because people actually like them and I think it 's been very difficult to plan for all the outcomes that we 're going to see because some things actually you know what I mean some of the residential conversions yeah I think though that if you are applying a proper planning process you wouldn 't put a coffee shop on the middle of an papanui road with no supporting infrastructure and an entrance and an exit that 's almost impossible i was very designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a normal planning process that 's the point but but I think having I don 't think we 're the normal planning where 's no we 're not it was actually the point that I made before I was councillor mainly I was nothing councillor Agee I that call you I get some sleep so you 're in trouble now right clean living thank you I 've asked for this at the conceits committee we have been provided with a park break down into residential but so just if you want to check with we don 't have the infamous oh there 's no double up on you yeah yeah you can for commercial industrial too but we don 't know how low it goes in terms of them ya know too much in terms of housing by waters the cursor Andrew Tina thank you um yeah I think we need to be really careful what sort of message we send on this cause of course you 've got businesses out there that are in temporary premises at the moment that are very aware of that son clause in 2016 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that say something other than there we raised a level of expectation that perhaps things are going to be different and we 've already heard a couple of examples of how that could be the case and there 's an issue here about temporary becoming permanent and of course if something is established as a temporary activity that 's able to to make itself a complying activity then great but in allowing temporary to become permanent if there isn 't an actual need to do that we possibly actually give an incentive to prevent that business finding permanent accommodation for that landowner to build a permanent building because they 've got a rental stream coming in from a temporary activity may be running from a container and so on so I think before we could make a decision on this we would need to know how many displaced businesses there are where they are what types of activity so that we don 't actually end up thinking we 're doing the right thing by those businesses but we actually end up with a load of unintended outcomes even within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residential accommodation as well all right so mix 10 on that there are a lot of the temporary solutions are actually really cool so absolutely I 'm not keen that we just have one size fits all for whatever goes goes forward I think a lot of them have actually some of the kind of office use and residential areas works incredibly well and I really like it i think it 's shown us what 's actually possible and so i 'm just clear they just want us to be clear that there isn 't a set of rules that will necessarily work for all of them because some have worked in some heaven i think what i think we know that 's the difficulty what we 're proposing to provide here is an avenue to allow proposals to be considered for to memory recovery activities and if there are specific areas then that beam as a matter of okay do we actually if there are areas have developed that our appropriate then you can zone them yes that 's something you can do in detail but this this really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding alternative accommodation for their business and then they can this is the avenue that C is ok we will at least be able to consider that and make a decision on their case as to whether it 's appropriate they stay open longer one logical one is the epic center and which we will want to extend beyond the current five-year period because they 're certainly not like the rest of the city is now built out but it 's yeah i mean it 's it 's not a man the only event year it 's not affected by our plane it 's affected by the central city recovery plan which is again a consistency argument because i think that that I mean they were already underway before the rule came and around max use and and actually the only thing that they don 't comply what does the mixture so again I think that if I mean it 's another classic example of where we could look for developing some consistency through the the three planes or the three components and maybe that 's something we could raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unintended consequence that one go ahead okay well but sometimes there are and it 's what it 's about having a healthy review and a conversation about those things often resolves them I think they 'd April 2016 when you think of all the businesses who are out in temporary premises I mean who is going to be building stuff for them to move into my April 2016 I mean they could be there ages I just can 't say I can 't see it happening one because no one can build in the central city anyway even the basic stuff like hotels and what have you but who 's going to supply that whole range of kind of you know low to medium run businesses those are the ones who are out in the temporary accommodation that 's right they 're not going to have stopped to move into yeah yeah so that 's not that far away no no no no I 'm very mindful of it it will say you 're looking just about it in a bunch of my job is done right look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but if they wanted to stay on would they hit to apply for resource consent yes so being a lot of them not afford to do there it 's quite it is there any way we can you know facilitate that process to be not such an encumbrance on a small business I 've just impressed but it 's a huge thing for existing business to have to do yeah well I mean I mean that 's something that we need to take into account ourselves but in terms of clarifying what is intended to happen given that there is an end date I actually think we have to we have to address it you know whether we agree with that you know outcome that will be our decision to make but we have to clarify what is intended to happen so I totally agree with the advice and then our question will be how and then the implementation as a separate step again it would be publicly notified as well which is do you know no not necessarily and then all be prohibited wouldn 't it or not no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that if it 's if it 's a temporary use that 's been authorized then you would have plot you would look at the effects on the surrounding community and environment and the implications on the recovery of a district there 's a whole including the loss of housing so you 've got I mean it 's got a couple of tests there to apply and it will depend on each secret situation some may need no notification at all and maybe just a written approval by the neighbors and others of them might have limited notification yeah no that 's right yeah there are mm-hmm in some some office space and residential might be fine for the for the people that are working the answer that ain 't fine for the neighbors who have had to put up with tons of car parks being taken outside their homes yeah yep so so I you know I think that our our strong viewers is that we have to we have to clarify what is intended to happen and i think the feedback we 're getting is is that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is what the law would require but we do want to manage against the you know those unintended consequences end those flow-on effects to the neighbors which you have taken as the effects on the surrounding community and the environment and and and and maybe maybe some some reference to residential amenity but I mean I don 't know if that 's the right language but it 's it 's it 's we 've got what wouldn 't normally be allowed on a residential area that then impinges on on the you know the their environment that 's when i put i think yannis made a very good point which is they weren 't consulted about the original change in use all right okay so moving on to the third bullet point which relates to an otaku seeking stronger stronger recognition of matter who is malathi noah their relation trip with water land air and other values of significance 2nite ahoo there was quite appropriate and we have work through both in this chapter and with other chapters very closely with MKT and representatives of nato who it initially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so they 're actually quite a number of changes right throughout the document I mean some of them will be very obvious because we 've incorporated Mary names and things like that others perhaps once I particularly would refer to be on page 19 under objective three point six point one to emphasize a recognition of the relationship between NATO who and land then on page 20 objective 3.6 point to the importance of green links for biodiversity in page 23 is all be the retype your CV page 23 objective 3.6 point for now the importance of Springs lagoons hanging a chi and then the following policy on the three point six point four point one on page 24 emphasizing the cultural importance of not having storm water flowing directly into natural waterways,"(-43.5320214,

4,eWQFDr4KWUQ,20140408,1375.21,"Christchurch, New Zealand",3551,I think that you know the image that will have of the spray tan Lodge presentation you know didn 't touch exactly the rules that people would would have applied in terms of intensification but gosh it looks great and I you know it looks like the sort of place that I 'd love to love because it looks like a real community it looks like it 's taken into account the the natural hazards which are clearly you know that abuts the the area where we have natural ponding and the city and in yet it 's designed to to ensure that that becomes a feature rather than a detriment to thee to the whole design which would have been really welcomed on the East if they had been planned for a head of our Arab seismic events so you know that 's the sort of the sort of urban design that i 'm talking about it isn 't it doesn 't strict rules is about the feel of the thing and that 's what this document even though it 's a legal document designed to meet the implications @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that regard it is about the look and feel of the new Christchurch and you know and really giving people a lot of hope about what what that new environment will look like and feel like and be like and be easy to traverse you know so it 's all of that I know you can 't really write on their quote from the castle the fantastic film from Australia but is the vibe of the thing right so in order to move on can I just say thank you for all of that feedback they vary a list of your hot topics you 'll be pleased to know having read every single comment that came past my desk because I 've had to allocate them to various chapters i can tell you truthfully that every single one of the hot topics that you 've raised is covered by us and out and now workshops still to come and they are the more significant issues so that ones they 're the ones we would have focused on anyway but it 's good to have it backed up by what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass that on to each of the chapter leaders when they start their chapters exam and I don 't other than what I 've just said I won 't be commenting on them because they 'll be dealt with as the appropriate chapter comes up so at this point in time then I 'd like to hand to Peter aimin to take you through the strategic directions and the format that we see thank you clear how many sightings so what opposing to do is take you through some of the key issues have come up through consultation has appreciated with both public and organizations in groups like keg and so forth and then go more particularly through the chapter so just and before i do that perhaps just a reminder that the strategic directions chapter is a little bit different from some of the chapters that you 'll be looking at and that its its its strategic direction for the city as a whole so here 's fairly high order objectives and policies there 's no rules and sorry that 's a question query before we got on to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note any errors when the map is that where do we want to address those sort of things yes yes you should be addressing those as well you can address them anytime whether or not there were at stake is another issue yeah well the pages are numbered but I am sort of looking at the if you tell us the Met number that sees this way to do it it 's the map number I 'm at 33 yes he is showing residential land along and Zekk drive from houses that have been removed in the big city park area they 've been gone for a long time and in the corner of pages road and Bixley road I 'm under the impression correct me if I 'm wrong but that wedge of land both sides of pages road at the intersection is red zone they 're all coming down and the third that is why we got a yellow bit around the avon river and where I 'm whistles reserved in that red zone area okay while I said is there Yves you 've picked that up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time of the residential chapter and the red zoning shows sarah red zone and the actual what the caseiro red zone is not the same notation as a planning zone so the planning for that will come through in the next group of chapters yeah I think you 'll be surprised to find out that they didn 't red zone on the other side of ANZAC dryer well I probably didn 't but the province of my point is the property is out there and they 've been removed specifically and to be incorporated into the big c reserve and they don 't want any housing on fixed on that state highway so we will take this question back and we 'll make sure that it 's answered in the and the primary issues when we bring the residential chapter to you the same and i 'm not sure about pages road right of that intersection with angie dry weather the houses on both sides it 's my understanding that so really no I mean no God nope there was a very hotly contested decision but it helps the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not on the corner yeah let 's ask relevant to that um so given that we have to issue consent in the red zone why would we not why would we have this zoning overlay why wouldn 't we just have the district plans own but why are we showing on that red zone as opposed only an overlay to show you that that 's where the red zone is as I 've said before the red zone will be replaced by appropriate zoning and the second group of chapters so the maps will change when the second group of chapters come out and when the remaining elements come out of the district plan that red zone won 't we 're doing rigid or chill chapters as part of us yes worst aspects of residential are in the first tranche and that 's what 's called residential part and all of the information I 've been giving you for example port hills residential some of the that the rural residential and some other aspects are affected people running away if I was a resident who was committed to staying in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to know what zoning i had when i looked at these maps what would they tell me it would tell you that we haven 't yet given the land use zoning for that can for that Sarah red zone that that 's coming through in the second group and what I have quite a detailed list of everything that will be covered in the second phase but I can bring that tomorrow if you like but I was going to put that through and the report that comes to you so that you know exactly what 's in and what 's out I have been through this what I originally do it now as part of this process given that we 're looking at residential because sarah is all already doing some planning work on the red zone they want to get it to a certain stage before they share it with us and for us to consider it to put into the district plan it 's not to say we 're going to do everything that they say but they have wanted to spend some time on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our district plan in terms of what I 'll in week it just seems really odd that this mean they might be the owner but they 're not the planning authority where the planning authority and you doing the planning work and we 're not doing anything around it it just seems really odd no it 's just it 's just what it is I mean that 's the time that 's the adjustment that we have to make because they 've made decisions around the current offer that they 've made to people and that there will be a process that follows but they will be they will be directing that process so that doesn 't stop us from doing planning now so well you said I race that as a whole it does addiction resort it does our past from let him play I mean it would be was gone it would be a complete waste of everyone 's time that we would undertake a planning process specific to an area where the government has put in a voluntary offer to purchase of the land so it you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just think we have to accept that that 's the situation that we 're on is if I just continue on thing with the street directions chapter this is saying it 's a pretty high water chapter there are no rules in this chapter and and much of Watson 's chapter is actually driven by very specific requirements and other statutory gold documents national and regional level documents so moving on to the first issue which is relates to most of these issues who have only been raised by one person or one organization as Bridget said we had very few submissions or consultation responses on the strategic directions chapter but the first one relates to a proposal that thought that it 'd be made clear that in trying to support the central city as the principal Cena for Christchurch we would not impose restrictions on the development of suburban centers there was what was being sought how the recommended response to that is that that 's not appropriate well there was a comment that was contained in the Christchurch central recovery plan the more recent land use recovery plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovery plan and I think the current circumstances in terms of the recovery of the central city all suggests to us that there are good reasons for in some cases restricting suburban centers to ensure that the central city does recover as the prime Center yep sure one piece of feedback I had on that was the central city is clearly some way of being a center of activity if you like so are we negatively or how can we mitigate any slowing down of developmental growth or the actual need for these suburban centers to fill that gap in the meantime how can we deal with that while also not impinging on the central city to grow and do what it needs to do as well how do you manage that yeah yes the this is two aspects today one is that most of our centers have potential for a lot more on them then they 're anywhere near developed at the stage so there is actually potential already in most of our district centres and suburban centres sit for a very small ones but certainly our larger centers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV and of course there 's also the temporary recovery activity provisions that were introduced by the minister which allows activities and be an issue that I 'm about to get on to all your activities are allowed to locate and operate outside of areas where they would normally be committed so there are two mechanisms for that it was there something on the lenses recovery plan that kind of provide some direction in this regard yes the language recovery plan specifically see is in service chapter six of the regional policy statement that the sinful City is to be the primary center for Christchurch so we have the district plan has an obligation to implement their requirement from those higher order documents and just to add to that in the in my handouts that I gave you and the page that I gave you on relevant limp actions you can see if you look down there which parts of the lip it responds to your on here on and unfortunately in the summary lips that I gave you you haven 't got the various plan changes for instance the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you out the objective on urban form on settlement pattern that relates to this factor and it says reinforcing the role of the Christchurch central business district within the Greater Christchurch area as identified in the Christchurch central recovery plan and then it goes on to speak more specifically about about its role there are other objectives around support and maintaining existing network of centers below as the focal points for commercial community and service activities during the recovery period and at less the central city near are several other policies but the submission that we 've received I 'd only who is from the mind seeks clear statements that development and suburban centers will not be restricted to achieve the objective of the central city being the principal community focal point the Christchurch to reflect a comment contained in the crash at central recovery plan so what 's that referring to because what you 've just read out is the opposite of what they 're under to me that reads that they don 't want restrictions on suburban centers yes but then how does that reflect a comment contained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central recovery plan actually is kind of directive in that regard yes there is a comment in the crush essential recovery plan to the effect that at that point in time it was not seen that there was a need to restrict development in suburban centers to ensure that the central city would be the primary center but what 's happened since teen is that we 've now had language recovery plan this has happen sometime afterwards and that has a very clear directive seeker for us to make sure that the central city is the primary center and likewise there 's a some objective and policy in chapter 6 of the regional policy statement so with with those documents with that clear direction and with the the situation in terms of the rate of recovery of the central city as is at the moment it is considered appropriate well it 's not consider appropriate to have a policy direction as being sought but you 've just said that there is a nun consistency between the Christchurch central recovery plan and the man juice recovery plan and you have applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves and today but that 's not a legal test the legal test would be that our district plan cannot be an consistent with the christchurch central recovery plan because if it is unconcerned with that then their whole request to have it properly integrated onto our district plan cannot be met if you prefer the loop over the ccrp now I know that from a legal sense that you could argue that the the letter over rules the former but actually the specific overalls the generic so maybe the legal answer to that question I think you sick brent is right you 're welcome legal answer to my mind is and and they would burst will be debated legally but that the correct legal interpretation to my mind is that the statement that was made in the central city recovery plan was a statement that was correct on its facts on the instrument that was being dealt with them at the time that that statement was made that the same author the same minister at subsea created others other documents which impose are the constraints on the council 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minister made the central city recovery plan the minister decided in the context of that document that it wasn 't necessary then to impose further constraints officers locating in the suburbs because that then took a field of dreams type approach our blueprint is so good they 're going to come now since then the ministers you has presumably changed because we now have the land use recovery plan and the changes made to the regional policy statement that do require this council to turn a smile to the best way of encouraging the revitalization of the central city and that can this council decided the best way to achieve that as you can post and strengths on the ops activity and the suburban locations well the difficulty that I have with that entire explanation is the beginning phrase yes it will be subject to you know I we 're going to we 're going to have a fight on a legal sense about the two interpretations so an actual fact for this process to work it would be useful if the minister actually changed the central city recovery plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will be very useful right so that 's something we need to raise with him all right yani have you looked at to check out by the airport that 's that 's gone basically so there 's no point trying to scale back development there because it 's already been resigned so what are you told members but around the airport if you look at lincoln road for example through addington I mean that 's called there 's you know the developments happening it 's been resigned so have you looked at kind of areas where hasn 't been resigned or isn 't far enough through the process that you could actually say hang on a minute we don 't think this is where development should occur and then look at sites that we 've either rezone recently in the last few years or that have just had out of control development anyway and so well actually there 's no point putting restrictions on there because effectively the horse is bolted and we 're just spending a lot of energy trying to call something back that we actually we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by being a bit more site-specific rather than so but it is site support specific they 've gone through each one of them and said right that 's that 's what 's happened there so for what was written to show it show place and addington that 's all the salt on the plane that 's right and some of this unfortunately and being an overarching checked at eject directions chapter that the detail behind it is in each of these specific checkers so tomorrow when we talk about an industrial you 'll get that background that you 're seeking this is this is very highly of what Peter eamon 's doing and you might even wish to come back to this chapter once you 've had you know these particular points in you a once you 've had their discussion from a strategic point of view does that come through the strategic directions chapter that you 've it 's not that you 've just put a blanket band on suburban centers development at all across the board that you 've actually taken the strategic approach to yeah recognizing where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ versus greenfield site perhaps or lower level brownfield sites that were you know because development hasn 't occurred to the scarce occurred you are looking at some sort of restriction and if so how 's that expressed through here it 's it 's not expressed at that level in this chapter but the this chapter also does not say that other senses cannot grow or that areas that are already developed will largely developed for office development for example cannot remain what this chapter does is it sets out that hierarchy in this case of centers and says that there there will be a principal Center which is a central city there will be a lower level which is the key activity centers and then other neighborhood centers below that so this the strategic direction chapter isn 't imposing a restriction one way or the other in this chapter at all,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

time frame around that and that 's the residential chapter and as a part of that will have one hour on urban design principles and how they affect the plan as well that will be before the residential chapter then we start to get in the unk unto the unconfirmed dates but then we have another workshop on the remaining chapters to be notified hazards contaminated land and subdivision so then we have a full package after going through all of that to go to the ministers and you 'll see we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will again need delegated authority from the council for that phase one chapters will go to the ministers for comments they have 15 working days for to provide the comments to us then the comments need to be considered by this committee then the committee again needs to adopt the chapters with revisions as per minister 's comments should they choose to do that and then public notification sub time med this year although I 'm not sure that that data is confirmed or not yet as we speak just for assistance for the committee the order and council was not yet gazeta doesn 't know nice so for the league is eager today but I understand that that has been delayed so do you have any indication as to when it will be gazetted this is a matter that is in confidence but I believe it could be some weeks away eard I don 't have a seat dejan all right okay yep so the next slide I just want to go over hang on wait at the time of going through these I think it would be incredibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible given their issues around that but secondly when something arises from a raft of public submissions that we will have all had in our particular wards what is the process by which we actually seek to have that changed well it 's the process that we 're beginning today and we start with a strategic directions chapter and tomorrow we go through three chapters and that is in the slide and the process is that we will have a slide first off that talks about the most significant number or the most significant comments that have come through on that chapter we 'll have another slide that talks about if there are comments for and against that particular issue and give you some idea of how many and who they 've come from and then we 'll talk through what changes are being proposed from an officer level at least for you to consider in relation to those comments and then we can go through the rest of the chapter because you 'll all see that the draft chapters that you have had different colors and them and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example somebody 's not happy with a chunk of something and they 've had a whole lot of public submissions on it is do we just vote on that as a council or was the actual process my understanding is that these are workshops and it 's about discussing and giving your views and then there will be another committee meeting for you to actually sign off the chapters to go to the met the minister that 's that 's what 's in that process up there so when we get to the residential chapter for example there 's obviously been a number of submissions I 'm thinking generated around one particular area we if there was a desire among counselors to make an alteration to the plan we would indicate that affect meeting but we would vote on it at a separate meeting yes yes and and and we would also need to advise you about the proposed change that we would be putting forward and where that 's coming from because of course and this is all in my slides that I 'm about to go through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taken into consideration here but there is the hierarchy of planning documents a land use recovery plan the resource management and those types of things as well so um thank you we should end can I just point out two counts as I understand is that like a public workshop and yes being live-streamed and no something else I don 't think it 's something I 've screened there was it oh sorry no I didn 't realize that it was they all just I think he 's been yep okay thank you and the one thing I was just going to ask about this like in terms of maybe it 's also partly being a new counselor but my understanding of what now seems to be in the plane the draft plan is especially regarding Alou is somewhat different from what I understood in the earlier workshops so with that in mind should we raise it with you all you raised me yet with us as we go along because we can do but if I could just speak to that the first rush that you saw we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed and honed a lot more since we 've worked through section 32 meters since we finished our Susan investigative projects end and with comments that we 've had all the way along through our legal review and out we have an external peer reviewer up and wellington and through the keg and tagged process its technical advisory group and collaborative advisory group we haven 't just stood still since those first rough drafts have come to you so that 's why that 's why we 're bringing it to you now in a workshop in a sense so that you can understand the changes of being made and whether where they 've come from I don 't think you should worry that there 's been any mess of change of direction that 's not the case there 'd be more refinements and consistent seasoned just more thinking around them you 're welcome Joey but based on your you know the mention earlier I 'm in the lead because this document is early stage of 1230 splendid review document so if we they don 't matter today you know this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a teacher butyl its defender on the committee meeting whether all those community piece in a group or individual the repair they are still editable to make the some issues surah deputation by appointment even they have comments to learn start already oh absolutely this is this is the normal process for any district plan review despite any truncated process that might come later is that there 's always what I call informal consultation but pre-notification consultation albeit that the surround of consultation that we 've done has extended a heck of a lot wider than any other district plan I 've been involved in and has included government officials as well so yes anybody and everybody is still open to make submissions under the formal submission process once it 's notified um yani thank you an apology swing light you may have already covered this but do we have a copy of the order and councils we 've already covered that so the order and council was not yet gazetted and it may be some time away we don 't we don 't know we 've already asked officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be available and they don 't know that will it could be some time away so I guess there 's a wider question I have it yes which is a question I need to raise with the minister so I 'd like to take that offline it 's not something that the staff can actually do address right okay that 's fine thank you thank you Carrie I 'm Brigitte you madam chair just a nick slide please so just working through the material that hopefully you have in front of you and you should have the draft and production chapter the public engagement comments on that chapter sorry the public engagement comments on the draft strategic directions chapter and that draft chapter and you should also have a set of the maps in the draft section 32 for the strategic directions chapter you should have you won 't have it in front of you but I just want to bring to your attention that you will have if not in front of you they will they will be made available in your counselors offices the full text of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance public engagement process in which there about nine hundred and that 's just 900 comments but they can be subdivided and some of those comments are pages long and could be subdivided into any number of issues you will also have available to you if you haven 't already as the full text of analysis of the three online surveys and you should also have at least available to you on the tables the land use recovery plan for reference and I 'll bring those every time because there isn 't enough for each counselor unfortunately actually what I seem to be missing are the drive section 32 s okay you should have received those and if not I will make sure that you get them perhaps we can actually ask somebody to go back and track them down now please Ivan and I don 't intend to take you through those section 32 s village by the age well as got them but they are the basis every fundamental they are they are and and of course what will be when we when we 're having discussion with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those drive section 32 s and I apologize you 're supposed to have received them well we should have read them before we had the spiritual yeah so we 'll get those to you as soon as we can yep okay and if you have any further questions on them obviously we can come back to them and another workshop no there wasn 't any because it 's not a it 's not a rules-based chapter has no real thing i 'll talk about them so we so we are getting copies of the section 32 is now apologize the instruction was to get them to you in the bundle and but as I say we will be discussing them today and the information that you know the reasoning behind all of the rules objectives and policies are in that section 32 happy to come back to that another workshop fortunately it 's only one year so so that they well there 's two one for the introduction our strategy introduction when has no there are no objectors policies and rules it 's just an explanatory checked is no real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay except this just called section 32 introduction alison has I don 't think well um look I apologize for this okay I 'm so there 'll be other section 3 tues I beg your pardon what you have is the introductory section 32 that that overrides overrides oversees all of the other section 32 so it 's a it 's an introductory document all of the section 32 so we 'll be getting a separate section 32 for every chapter yes you were right okay and when will we have the ones that we 're going to discuss tomorrow well if you haven 't already got them and I whichever you haven 't okay well I 'll make sure you get them today as soon as possible hopefully by the end of this meeting yep there 's only one section 32 to today and that 's pecking at the strategic directions chapter okay so and just going through the actual chapter you 'll note that there are different colors and these green yellow and red the green highlights definitions just so that you 're aware when we come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sections of the chapter or other chapters and the read our proposed amendments that officers are proposing for your consideration on the basis of all the feedback we 've had okay just one one further thing before we get on with this and that is to say that you will also get a full copy of the Christchurch joint officials group it 's the whole of government group hopefully later today if not tomorrow with a a sort of summary contextual document from my selves on top of that and I think I 've already said you should have also received attachment 1 which is again a summary of the online survey and the Comets instead of having to read all of this but we want you to have it available in case you want to check that we 've got certain persons might have made comments to you you want to check that they 're in here that they had been concerned though the next slide um I have already mentioned this but the proposed amendments that were bringing to you today as a revision revision chapters are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large part of them of which they are about a thousand eight hundred nine hundred from the online surveys and nine hundred odd from comments but they also come from the collaborative process which includes the Christchurch joint officials group and they also come from the legal review these are note at the bottom there to say that in considering proposed amendments to the chapter we must also consider the confines within which we work in the directions that we 've already discussed with you in previous rounds and that is and the higher order planning documents such as the regional policy statement the land use recovery plan purpose and principles of the Resource Management Act and of course the plan needs to be able to be supported legally buy a good robust section 32 and be consistent with our ma clear relation to the process I 'm assuming that each of us have had quite major feedback from some about some issues in our wards yeah would it be helpful if we actually just went around the table and told you some of our thinking on that prior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that deputy mere coming up and I would like to hear that first to make sure that we do deal with the the hot spots is that where that you each have as well so this next slide is simply showing the relationship between the district plan in the land use recovery plan and and how we 're guided and given directions from the lenses recovery plan I won 't rest on that for too long but just to note that you also have land use recovery plans in front of you next slide here we do just to share reference documents pieces has everyone got one no there isn 't enough for everyone to have one unfortunately I 've got another one here people want it but it 's just if we want to fix it and things the next we can get some delivered to the down here couldn 't we we have we 've asked for a number of times for more copies and we haven 't yet received them from Sarah it is available to a mile but I mean I work at here I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ border he like hen 's teeth around area,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Phil selves nodding so they can 't intention that the process begins tomorrow is done in the soil is determined by Lilith of September okay so but won 't it come back to Council before then to make a decision I would imagine that would be the case right and just the other one is that you 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was allowing for the ability to co-locate a facility in either ward and or I 'm happy for it to be amended ended up over night when you and I talked we didn 't have the last but honor that I thought at the time when when we propose this motion last week that that that wording was actually going to be soon on us and keeping with an earlier part I think I don 't have the exact words that you and I had drafted and just tied the two together but I 'm heavy yeah I think that what I was trying to do and and what was to try and find a way of remedying a problem that existed in the previous recommendation which included a vote against having a a sport and Rec facility and the the sort of lynnwood summoner corridor so there was a there was a motion it could correct me if I 'm wrong John but I think that there was a motion that money be set aside and the budget for another facility and the Hagley fairy meat and the lynnwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that was voted down facility in the Northeast or suitable location yep the previous to that in the long term plan at the end of the plan can 't remember what year there was a sum of money set aside for a profit Center or similar in the lynnwood woolston area shows that the genes necessary I cancel right existing right so but but that 's got lost on the mixed hasn 't it so I thought that what yeah so so yeah so what we were trying to do was to I mean we 're going through a planning process now and I know that we 're going through a long-term planning process but it was kind of to signal that that that there will be a need I mean there is going to be an opportunity and that lynnwood whilst an area because of the new school builds and those areas that will enable the potential for a partnership arrangement to be developed and what we wanted to do was to signal to staff that to start to have those conversations it won 't be needed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don 't start thinking about it now and giving you the authority to go and talk about it with the Ministry of Education then we 'll lose the time we 'll lose the opportunity that might arise and the course of our next you know the next two years I 'm thinking 2017 they 'll be looking at some of these options so that the intention of that last one was to really look at that lynnwood Sumner corridor in terms of meeting a need that was missing yeah so but to make it very clear that the proposal and because you 've come up with a series of sites which are all in accordance with the resolution of the previous council but the problem has been is that you 've gone off onto the onto the lynnwood you know the Illinois end of town when in fact the need is in the north East because that 's where the growth and the population is but for for a new brighton not to be in competition for that i 'm in the sense that i got was that new brighton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the only game in town and so what we want to signal here is that the council itself go away and look at options for an anchor legacy project for new brighton and you know i mean it doesn 't matter what the the content of that is but to work with the local community working up options and looking at funding mechanism so that we 're not committing to the funding but we 're saying that that if we go down this path then it will be separate from the eastern sport and Rec Center so that the eastern sport and Rec Center can go ahead that the site can start to be looked for and finalized we need geotechnical reports on the qe2 site for example all of those issues that were raised this morning we need to work out what the options are you know in terms of a legacy for New Brighton which is really servicing the east and we need to give some reassurance that staffer engaging now with the Ministry of Education for the development of a of a pool a smaller pool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire school rebuild and that was the signal that we wanted to go rather than sign off on seven sites to go through a process that will just destroy their community yeah sorry thank you madam mayor in order to allow councils recreation sports unit to give effect to that summary it would be helpful to have a mandate for this from this council to proceed with a site selection process for a recreation sports center in North East Christchurch and get on with that quick smart yep it would be essential to have a mandate from this counsel to investigate options for a legacy project in New Brighton it would be useful for my unit to have a mandate from this counsel to investigate opportunities and options for an aquatic facility in the lynnwood woolston area possibly as a result of our collaboration with the Ministry of Education those last two would not in any way commit Council they would just give us a mandate to go out and examine and look really the only commitment would be councils pre-existing commitment to a recreation sports center and ideally in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the area of most proven need so that 's certainly my intention with a Yanni we could spend a lot of time today trying to come up with resolutions and processes and criteria I just want to put the facts on the table we heard from a number of deputations from the booooored pegasus board and they all said something different they all had different ideas about what we wanted to do the thing what they wanted to do or what they wanted us to do the thing they had in common was they were not happy with the selection process they had been identified by staff so moving an amendment to go back to a process that people had concerns worth I don 't think is the right way to go ahead XG there should be they need that the reason the committee wanted a workshop was that we need to work through these issues I appreciate we have a new council and it 's really important that we can come together discuss things in a more informal setting than the formal council meeting to work out what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective process to select the sites based on what we want to do as a council and that 's why the committee said there 's really three clear things that are happening and unfortunately they 'd all been put into one and that what was leading to the confusion the second point is that the criteria that are mentioned in the report I said as part of a aquatic facilities review under 3.3 aquatic facilities review has never been approved by the governance group of this council staff have done some work they haven 't finished that review that unable to bring it to the committee till next month and you know that is something that we need to sign off on at a governance level we have aquatic facilities throughout the city that we need to consider and so I think it 's incredibly important that in part of the reason for wanting the workshop was that so staff can give you some of the context to the other aquatic facilities issues that are that are happening around the city I 've tried to get that review bought and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're getting to a point where it 's nearly ready from staff so I think you know it 's just adopting a set of criteria that we haven 't signed offer the governance group with a strategy that the staff of review but that we haven 't as elected members doesn 't seem to me a very sensible way to go about it so so you saying these aren 't the criteria these are criteria that if you read what 's what 's put in here have been updated as a review of the aquatic facilities plan in june two thousand twelve in february2014 know they say councils criteria for the location scope of aquatic facilities and for the development of councils aquatic facility network since 2006 yeah so this might be the existing criteria from 2006 staff would have to answer whether that being changed in terms of 2014 review or 2012 of you the point I 'm making is that we haven 't actually had a governance level signed off on the strategic direction we want to go for aquatic facilities going forward I don 't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a qet for a medium-sized facility any longer than we need to I think we need to get that process underway and get but having a workshop I think there 's the most sensible thing so that we can all get that agreement and again approving a process that people were unanimous and expressing concern of having you know half of the community board from egloff aramid on to a committee with half the board from bill with Pegasus when you 're talking about a site that is actually envy with Pegasus and the people that are concerned seem to be the different and burgesses all have different ideas about what they want doesn 't seem a very good solution so I really support the legacy stuff for New Brighton again we seem to be letting some details let 's spend some time having a workshop refining what it is that we want to do and come up with some very clear recommendations unfortunately I cannot support these amendments I don 't believe it affects us forward I don 't know myself of the wording of the amendments captures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he said Glen thank you I 'd die yannis probably he 's not wrong but I don 't agree with them in this respect and because I actually feel in a sense we 've been workshopping this in full public view frawl to see for at least a couple of weeks it yes and our role for each of us is to represent our communities I 've concluded we need to get started we actually need to make a date because people don 't commit to things until a date is made which the the community needs to see a spade go in the ground at some point I think this is a very good way head the mere David myself we 're at some of the points with this and I think it 's very well done it avoids those either or arguments both within the ward in terms of possible competing locations and between the wards as well I think there 's a lot of goodwill and a determination to work together not only for the good of this ward and also hagley fearing me but for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the whole city sees this agreed on that they 'll be pleased for for bill would Pegasus and potentially also for heavy through me so I would urge that we support this right look we have an issue here in terms of timing so the the Environment Committee is due to run at four o 'clock so yeah yeah all right so you better delay the Environment Committee can we just can we stop for two minutes and just have a quick cup of tea and then we can work out how we might proceed from here yeah yeah,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

3,FGnBhSJx3MM,20140408,714.28,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1710,"yes so we have attempted to to find a resolution which which captured what John was saying because it seemed to capture what I was intending which was the to begin a site selection process for an Eastern recreational sports center in the northeast of Christchurch the final process to be signed off by the bill and Pegasus community board the chairperson of the community committee and the mayor and that enabled you know absolute hands-on with the single community board that was that was covered and the chair of the community committee in the mirror identify options for a legacy project a new brighton to be reported back by the end of May and that would enable us to look at what was on offering and what the costings might be and where we might find funding for there and then identify opportunities and options for an aquatic facility and the lynnwood woolston area possibly in conjunction with the Ministry of Education and that you know but I 've been unable to get agreement over over this over the previous amendment that was seconded by the two ward councillors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is going to be disappointing to people but I 'm going to do perhaps move an alternative which is that this matter go to be that this matter goes to the earthquake recovery committee of the whole next week for a final decision so for a decision on on the recommendation so that I mean I come it 's not going to be resolved here and now I was trying to look for a neat solution and I thought I we 'd managed to get one from John but jeez so when I look at that that looks quite sensible to me did you have to split these processes up and from my observations that these things Walter Scott he holds it together when in fact it 's quite simple the money has been allocated for a qe2 replacement yeah let 's get on with it they want to do some stuff in New Brighton let 's look at that yep they want to pull here let 's look at that but trying to put them all together creates huge problem so why are we doing that it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been it was structured from the outset so I think that inadvertently the previous council made it look as if half of the money from qe2 had been left in the East but actually it wasn 't like that the money from kira two had been allocated to the Metro sports facility in town that wasn 't the the one that the government 's decided on it was the earlier one and the draft central city plan and so the decision about the Metro facility being in town was was already decided but there was I mean desert there 's a jun 2012 resolution where they allocated 30.6 that 's right we r QE to replace me and that 's what it looked like yeah but it 's it 's it 's not a metro replacement but it is a there is no business case for it there 's no concept plan around the aricent any work on it so the next thing was to determine the process for determining the site by bringing the two community boards together all of us and what 's it got to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is why the the seven proposals that are in front of us are not acceptable because they 've gone on to lynnwood Park cuthbert screen even I don 't know he high school doesn 't quite meet the criteria that would be put in front of this community I mean it 's right on the boundary of booooored pegasus and higley fearing meet and miles away from the other end of the electorate where there is that the growth the growth is happening in the Northeast yeah I don 't just put it back of qe2 I mean what do you have an idea of what that is roughly just of remediating the land so that you could build a pool facility ish the western area are previously occupied by the rec center stadium the golf course app unbuildable the eastern part the fields they are existing good green is what we know has CC cream which is very very similar in property and properties to the rest of the east so for what any facility was absolutely committed to we got eyesight and we would expect remediation about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased strength and foundations how many do you want Vicky yeah yeah no nobody this is the problem asking these questions is it the trouble is is that we done I mean cliff Ontario the previous council set aside a sum of money they didn 't set aside any specifications so then there is a lot of work that needs to be done and there are sort of multiplying levels of expectation I had hope that these three simple proposals would have been able to move on I 'm privy to second that and I 'd like I just like to speak briefly though about a context and that that we actually have that aquatic facilities review in some form also available to us because I see this is like a plan available John and maybe you can help me but I 'm just wondering if we had that it seems it would resolve some of the issues especially in terms of of where other pools go in other parts of the city Phil if you have that plan in front of you you 'd have to make a decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan would tell you is the first priority to build something is northeast Christchurch the second priority is the is the Metro the third priority is the hornby area and possibly the fourth priority if council wished in time was an evaluation of the the lynnwood woolston area if you agreed with it so it 's an additional thousand square meter to build and let 's just assume the facility as 10,000 square meters are we talking about 10 million just to rebuild on that site before you actually get to through the pool be very very dangerous to make those assumptions here they are the costs of building and building the foundations for an aquatic facility per square meter will be consistent all the way through the east of Christchurch whether you build around qe2 park or around woolston park if you 're building on tc3 the conditions and the costs are going to be very very similar so it 's a level playing field and the playing fields are not to flash yeah I 'm really worried about the amount of time that we have so it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I would rather just deal with us that this matter be referred to the earthquake recovery committee of the whole next week for a decision so we 're giving the power to make a decision on these two amendments and the original resolution to the committee of the whole yani a scale as part of if that 's what we agree is it possible to get a high level analysis of the geotech and how how does it compare to the one and the Metro sports facility in the central city I can give you a high level analysis of qe2 park I can do that probably in terms of the metro center point is is that we are not going to be making a decision on the location we 've got an incredibly frustrated group of people out there who want the account cyl to commit to having a complex and the northeast of christchurch to replace the one that they lost it 's not going to be an exact replacement because the council has decided to put a meet the Metro part of the facility into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's well understood and that is weird that decision lies but this community is expecting us to get on with the job of actually allowing the process to determine the place where it will be located when when a obviously that the process is then established for it and then the council staff work with those with the process that 's been established whether it 's a working group or whatever and they get receive all of the information all of the reports they understand what all of the options mean what it means by way of limitation what it means by way of opportunity and then a decision is brought back here and I just think that that process needs to get underway but asking for all of this detail about geo technical reports for the center of town and for four options that may or may not be proceeded with I just think that we have to get on with the process of establishing it if at the end of the day the cost-benefit doesn 't stack up or the geotech doesn 't stack up we need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's no point having a high level perspective

New Zealand",1439,braden lodge medium density housing it simple a project which I 'm very happy to move I think this is a stunning project and exactly the sort of thing that we should be doing in terms of urban planning it provides a a community that that has thought through all of the issues and this also helps provide for the new key activity center and the Southwest which is desperately needed if any of you have tried to get into record and more on a Sunday afternoon that war along Rixon road so I loved the concept of what 's been designed Here I am delighted that we 're doing this as an exemplar project and I think that this takes some of the earliest subdivisions that have been approved and learns from the mistakes and it does something that will be exciting and wonderful so it was seconded counselor chin did you want to cheat the second it I just have one question for you yeah okay crazy you know I ask a staff is there any mitigation skin in dealing with the sea level rise in low-lying area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the handles and pacing the stormwater met the stormwater management will be dealt yeah i mean that that will be dealt with at the more detailed stage i mean this is a concept stage the infrastructure for the city environment team at this stage are satisfied with the progress of the screening to this point and more detail will follow through its consenting process though you 're already can 't concert can see that this issue already yeah i mean okay they 're already parts built in yes-mo medication I 'm clarification on page um 37 they 're just talking about in the table the dewatering program halfway down the commentary can you explain a little bit more about that the stormwater treatment in exchange of soils in silks between the site and Henderson base and what 's it mean debt during an event or during construction or no no it is during construction it 's it 's I think it 's taking material from the Hendersons basins wetland area and using some of that material on the development site to build up levels deal with some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so we building up the land because it 's in a flood plain it 'll be an exchange of material more that this good quality material and been affirmed poorer quality material right so you be improving the substrata but also deepening the Henderson Basin uh me to say some of that 's still a passage one ongoing discussion it 's fair to say but that 's part of this whole stormwater date which will come through in the detail consenting okay so we just were approving us in principle and is obviously more work to much much more so when we had the agenda-setting wedding for this committee we asked that we could have really clearly laid out what is the public process for the community to be involved in the decision do we have anything that shows what opportunities the public have of any to make submissions to be notified and if so where is that the likely route for this is through a notified resource consent application to which people will be made aware of that there will be submissions and probably hearings ending on the issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process on the back of that application really worried about then because I 'm glad that you 've said that that 's how you see it that on page 12 of the 455 of the agenda I think it says that Sarah and City Council facilitate the delivery around practicality of not being required to modify the resource consent for scheme pan and land use approvals an alternative fast-track process to enable early commencement of development on the site where necessary recommend to mercer to use any appropriate powers under the 2011 Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act so I 'm really concerned that there 's an expectation that 's being set and the incentives discussion that we would support the possibility of it being non notified or excuse the vernacular but lived as we previously had done to us today so I just you know I really like this project but I want to be really clear that we have some recommendation in there that this will be either if we can say formally publicly notified to enable public participation or whether that 's something that can come back through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identifies that the there is access to the serac powers to move schemes in this action along we will do some investigation with sarah and i think there are risks associated with not holding the right amount of public consultation so we 've discarded those and the non notified i sorry the fully notified pathway is what will go forward but that 's still subject to the applicants discussion I mean there are still two pathways available in us through the notified resource consent or it goes through the district plan which will be progressing along I think in the pro in the in the interest of getting this scheme moving more quickly than on no 25 sorry the notified route is the way that the applicants are currently looking at going and I can say that will involve submissions hearings and everything else so can I just just be very clear the council can 't ask more of this then the current district plan requires of it if it 's to go it under the current zoning and it 's the discussion that 's been had it will require @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land is part of the debate that 's been ongoing through the dish plan review and then obviously that will be subject to that I think the other the other aspect where we 've talked about the the council and Sarah and other parties facilitating it 's around ensuring that that time frames are met that discussions are carried out with with intent to reach resolution and those as you appreciate there 's a myriad of discussions technical discussions that go on well below the consenting process and it 's around ensuring a joint commitment to to getting those happening as quickly as possible yeah if we approve it in principle are we reducing the public 's ability to be notified or have any involvement because what we 're hearing out and even hid for example is want something you know lived that it makes it very hard for them to actually have any you know weight against it because so much so the approval in principle basically is a requirement we 're required to approve it as a under the loop action it is in principle because while we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a council that this meets the key objectives for an exemplar they 've obviously it doesn 't override their obligations to meet the statutory requirements of the district plan so those will those are not in any way compromised or or reduced by this decision today so I still have to meet all the tests they still have to go through all the processes that the plan outlines well and that 's they can do they can do it if the minister agrees to that and if they seek that that 's a power that 's enshrined in the loop that we that we don 't have control over at this stage our understanding is that they pursue it if they pursue the resource consent and if they pursue getting early consent they go through a resource consent process but just so I 'm clear if it 's approved as an exemplar under the loop it does give the possibility that a fast-tracked non-public process will we use by the minister if he chooses to make this change no no they look just being an exemplar of itself doesn 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I meant amending the loop to do that to do anything specifically different okay okay can I put the motion those in favor please say aye post carry thank you and moving on to the next course

Report,tUbc_8wdj4Y,20140402,1406.12,"Christchurch, New Zealand",3275,rapidly we 're on I think item number six natural environment recovery program internal progress report call any questions before we debate if not oh there is Yanni just on the page so the question that I had was related to what 's happening in regards to the flooding and this was the land drainage recovery program and says we 're progressing in on track and it says that you know we 're looking at issues being investigated in the Dudley Creek and long-term title and flood protection for low-lying parts of Christchurch my question is really struggling to see how skirt is aligned to what this program is trying to achieve and so the feedback I 'm getting is that skirt are not doing things to take into account of these issues because they 've been told to put back what we had on to timber fourth it seems like a huge gap I know this doesn 't have statutory effect and we can 't actually require anything because it 's just a program not a plan but can you just give me an understanding of what work staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these natural environment issues to be addressed as part of the skirt works as opposed to having to spend hundreds of millions of dollars later which we can 't afford to do have sex all old files and after counseling handsome as part of the asset network planning part of counsel my understanding is that they are closely working in with the skirt as far as I understand and and clearly we 're in a situation where do have a program but obviously they 're trying to anticipate where counsel may need to go so there is a is that there 's always a timing issue with some of that I 'm happy to go away and just give a bit more give it more detail on it for you and make sure that your we can report back can I suggest you nee that what would be sensible is one of the examples that you raised about skirt was because they were replacing like with like that they were actually replacing dish channels which was just silly and there 's no other word for it and we clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintaining them is huge and they need to go but beyond that I think we 've asked for that to happen already I 'm wondering if it would be helpful if staff report back on on how the council would work with skirt on flooding mitigation as works are done I think it 's wider than that because okay well why don 't you just because I 'm aware of time pressures why don 't you tell what you actually want to move and then your eyes to speak salute can I think we should be moving towards as that we instruct our representative on the skirt governance group to raise concerns that the skirt objective of putting back like-for-like fails to take into account yeah so but I think you have to identify the problem first if we can get to the positive which is its failing to take into account the natural environmental issues post-earthquake and we want to report back as to how we can get skirt works aligned with the natural environmental recovery program end up and the flood increased flood risk yes absolutely and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure and can I just say with this is time critical because we 've actually just had two more start notices around Humphries drive we 're building back low-lying roads that is acceptable to climate change and sea level rise though just because having roads are designed to be flood channels is it so just so I think the intent of what councillor Hansen is fine I mean ultimately that it 'll be a question of funding because council has set the parameters for skirt in terms of light for light with modern materia would you want me to maybe maybe the question should be then how do we change the parameters of skirt and can we have a report back as to how we do that that would put to align better with your environment recovery program and flood mitigation yeah yeah an environmental sustainability which I presume is part of this program okay just have it reflected to this program and yeah okay yeah Annie would you like to stand up and actually or just sit down I just moved exactly what we do that ' council asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parameters of skirt to instead of replacing light for like skirt take into account the natural environment recovery program well just how to change the parameters with actually spelt wrong but it might add of skirt to better align with the nature environment recovery program and flood in the increased risk great oh then in the end did you on speaker just to clarify I 'm 2.2 of the item the last point on to point to the new process report matched 2014 than internal report for the committee of the whole see attachment 1 page 28 item 8 so we 've gone on about the note measurement at citroen you 've got to go through a process yet item 8 act on opportunities to reduce surge overflow on their fix during rebuild improve wastewater infrastructure to reduce avoid wit with a sewage overflows directly to the waterways minimize the effects etc etc so does it bypass the betterment process or on a number but confused because I 've been told we 've got to go through the betterment process or else skirt we 'll just put light for like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to ask the question so that 's nothing open a page 28 it 's a number 8 act on opportunity the this program is a program across can debris or across the earthquake area and clearly it sits out some high level objectives they didn 't need to be tested for their feasibility for their affordability so i suppose what we have is yes this is aspirational and and skirts working within a deliberate decision of the council and the agencies that runs good I think yannis question or yannis resolution actually start to say okay if there is a desire to reconcile the ability to take these opportunities against just simply putting back what 's there how do we go about doing that so I think that the two aren 't inconsistent they 're simply reflecting the fact that one is s an aspirational document which this is versus the I suppose the very real constraints that skirts operating under in terms of actually its current mandate so and I think the resolution our staff report back on how we might explore you know changing that relationship so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ok Pauline mini I 've got a question unrelated to theater cetera and I 've got two questions on page 25 we talked about the flood management and staff are working with the Christchurch we smelt in zone committee now that 's at the bottom on 3.1 blasts the second to last bullet point um especially about some low impact urban design approaches so does it mean that any new subdivision plan would be run past the zone committee to oversee or check up on the storm water management plan and that we use the we work with the zone committee as a sounding board for engagement with the community as a whole an example that I 've stated here is that we are working on the avon stormwater management plan and the zone committee has helped facilitate several workshops with the community to get their input on objectives in goals for the for the SMP and hail storm water is managed and the zone committee really is a partnership between he can end the council and is there to be able to help facilitate engagement with the community and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a role where we would other than in may be providing information on development etc I don 't have statutory powers but I 'm more looking at you know when we building houses and particularly we 're in an intensification are we looking at really good responsible stormwater management design so that we 're not impacting any further on our our existing infrastructure I 'll give it to my so that that Kate yes that 's exactly what we do so fundamentally and under the regional plan we 're not allowed particularly in green fields areas to discharge more water than we previously discharged off greenfield area so all those issues around how we manage stormwater management are clearly there so that the fundamental issue is quantity management and then particularly around this is the quality management environment how we actually create a bit of quality stormwater environment that 's where the zone committees are fundamentally part of the work that the council does these would always be informed of any new development no not necessarily no it 's not their role to be informed of every new developments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as outlined to basically provide feedback into how we might manage that lot you know in an overarching sense okay but individual ones are consenting issues that the council 's okay and my second question if I may Vicki it 's just on the next part of go go on the next page and if we could explain me I 'm the eco sync tree um being investigated by doc Weir 's let and and what is it just quickly eco sentry is proposed for the Travis wetland area and part of potentially the red zone I 'm neighboring it and it 's a piece of work that as being lead as as I say by Department of Conservation to investigate the feasibility of that very quickly because I 've heard at several times already this comment about skirts obligation to return things to like for likened to the position they were run on sixteen or twenty ten unless I misunderstood recently it was quite clear that that is not happening in fact at a presentation we had at Shirley papanui there was a mention or it was communicated to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case in some places and that there will be patchwork on roads and roads etc will not be returned to the level of service that they were prior to September 2010 when I raised why was that it seems to be a funding issue so I 'm very wary of using phrases like scooters returning things to like for like because they 're not yes I did and yeah question yeah and Pauline may well a couple of sexy I think but it 's just that the whole integration going back to what I thought was a very good you take these with a grain of salt but I must say very good letter to the paper with regard to green fields what we 've done in the past future planning catchment set for the whole flockton questions so my question is how joined up is everything you know the loop with the note we 're looking at a an exemplar project today and just that whole joint upper approach when it comes to drainage catchment etc or is Pauline just covered in our stormwater management plans involve a extensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storm to storm event and flooding return periods it 's very detailed and it looks at the storm water detention facilities treatment facilities that we need to improve water quality and volumes of water that 's being released during a storm and clearly we are looking at a whole range of treatment options low-impact design is one of those which have stated in here such as swales rain gardens pervious surfaces and we do have to take a holistic approach because water whatever it touches is impacted by what it where it flows so we do look at the wider picture and take a holistic approach and try and interface with all parts of councils present us when we 're looking ATS water management can I just are there actual you know joined up meetings between the different parties or yes we 're egli meet as a stormwater management team we have technical experts from right across councils business as part of the team and we also work with ekn technical staff as well and we involve other interested parties in there in our technical meetings yes to very quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have up here scooter a government agency therefore any adjustments or negation negotiations with the parameters would have to be directly with the minister wouldn 't make good because dad can given at the ante no skirts an alliance which we 're at one theory that alliance so we can negotiate directly with them with regards to the parameters well that yes we can I mean but ultimately the government the other agencies are governed by their own funding parameters and if we 're moving beyond those in clearly the cost comes back to Council okay very quickly second one with regards to number 12 the support community gardens looking which would be the lead agency I would suspect wouldn 't it be the community garden Association if it 's the the driver I was just quite of interested and wondering which organization would be the lead agency on that I was just wondering they 're Christians behind it good question they would be party to it I know with the official nerp monthly meetings that a moment it is he can that are driving that engagement with non-government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that thank you very brief um can we get a report back on the special issue I 'm really concerned to see that there 's still a need for guidelines when so much constructor demolition has already been occurred I 'd also like to know if you 're doing any work around hydraulic fluid being put back in I can 't answer that question I would have to get further detail in so I don 't again I don 't know that we 're doing anything I mean those things will be covered presumably by mb but we can certainly come back and update you on where mb is at on both those issues interagency group so we are involved in that I had a meeting on the twenty-seventh of februari what we need I think there 's a report back on what given that you 've only it 's only now being identified there needs to be guidelines I think we need a report back on the issue of asbestos and hydraulic fluid being left on soils and what we as a council might like to do to address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the second one is is there any measure of sustainability in terms of the earthquake recovery are there any indicate sustainability indicators that that have been put into place to monitor you know when skirt do the presentation around how much road they 've fixed if you actually put it differently how much road have they made you know the new environmentally sustainable way or how much recycling heavily got or is it any sustainability measures and if not is that something that could be looked at in response to your question our sustainability I don 't think there is anything specific in the nerb but there is a monitoring program to be finalized for how we 're tracking against the various projects in newark you yep very briefly just wanted to make three points one is that I think we 're looking at one of the most unsustainable recoveries of all time when you look at actually what 's happening councillor Jones is absolutely right we 're now being told it 's actually not like for like it 's like for less so or less for like and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get a long-term gain what we 're seeing as a short short term financial savings that are going to have a long-term cost to us as a city and as a community and I 'm really concerned about this the roads that are being fixed should be taking into account sea level rise and climate change clearly they are not the other Fitzgerald have and what happens here when it floods it actually is a lifeline and lifeline roots and the flood events were cut off and that is clearly not acceptable in a modern day society and clearly the skirt repairs that are happening should be able to take into account they think so i strongly support that additional resolution and the final point I 'll make is that there 's actually a number of really good things in this in terms of the projects but where it 's not happening is we 're not seeing the way in which we 're making progress to getting that sustainable recovery and so I just think it 's incredibly important that we do send a signal as a council that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's being done because we keep getting told it 's a question of cost and in my view yes there is a short term costs are having a sustainable environmentally friendly recovery but there is a long huge long-term benefit that will more than our way that short term cost so I think what 's happening is we 've got it the other way around and we 're making as I said there 's been cost-cutting where we 're getting low quality infrastructure repairs that are going to leave a long-term legacy of a particularly nasty one going forward and we need to start addressing that now because the work is happening as we speak roads and their purpose and flooding actually so that there isn 't a misunderstanding about that Mike I think what what we need to understand and be very careful of that roads are actually designed as part of the flood management system so our roadway systems do form what are now in a secondary flow paths so when you get beyond either I think a one in ten year event some of the roads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from property so they actually provide a dual function they do provide a traffic function but we also provide a stormwater management function or a flood management function as well having said that we are moving to more as you 'll see on our bigger roads more softer ways of demonstrating that by using swales and planters green areas rather than hard channels that we have historically those post carried item number seven the approval,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"
NZ,NZ,Christchurch City Council,Christchurch City Council,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZETwErnCvvgbvBbnnHfyxA,03.04.14 - Item 11 - Process to Dertimine the Location of the Eastern Recreation and Sport Centre,r30oQmqj2n8,20140402,3010.71,"Christchurch, New Zealand",7833,"process to determine the location of the Eastern Rican SportsCenter and I 've done some changes to the to the motion that I had I had that the amendment that I had originally put up so if we could go to the amendment that I would like to move so this is what I moved at the end with some minor amendments what I moved at the end of the last council meeting so I 'm sorry counselor you 're handsome when you ask the question did we have anything else i hadn 't i don 't think that the council directed staff to actually alter the author of the paper it was simply too to enable us time to debate the emotion that had been moved I there wasn 't agreement around around this particular motion and there wasn 't time but we were under time constraint to debate it so this is the time to debate it so I 'd like to move this amendment and we 'll be looking for a seconder but basically it asks for three things one is that we get on with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the northeast of Christchurch so without defining North East particularly it 's the Northeast with the final decision on the process and that 's the the process including the site create criteria the criteria that will be applied and the Working Party membership being determined by the board Pegasus community board the chair of the community committee in the mere so that 's council you 're handsome myself working with the community board to sign off on a process not the decision but just the process and then completely separately request staff to identify options for a legacy project a new brighton and report this back to the council by the end of May 2014 so that 's a very tight timeframe but I know that the new brighton community have been working very hard on the proposals that they do want us to consider and that will be a time frame that I believe we can see a report back to council and then finally separately again completely separately from the other two requests staff to identify opportunities and options for an aquatic facility in the lynnwood woolston area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only reason that that is included here is that I went back and read the minutes of the meeting when the decision was made around the eastern Rican SportsCenter and a motion was path was was put to the council that there be a an aquatic facility in this area and the lynnwood woolston area at the same time it so the council passed the resolution about the Northeast sorry the eastern reckon SportsCenter and then and then declined the resolution on the other and I just think it left a gap and it 's a and it 's too big a gap to leave open because what it does is that says that we ignore the opportunity that building new schools in their area obviously provide and it 's it 's not going to be a major facility but if the school is providing a facility there can we leverage off that and get something in their area that would make a difference and you know that I mean I know that people have commented about the the sport and Rec Center and town that the Metro Center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ward well it 's right on the other side of hagley park other side of the city up against hagley park and this is an opportunity potentially for an option and I think that this council needs to commit to it this doesn 't commit us to the the different funding models but we have to we have to look at those funding models as part of the report back so so I would like to move that would somebody like to see conduct David East so let 's discuss that motion yani sorry I just he 's different the resolution that will the recommendation that that I saw from you um they are you saying that you 're using the existing site criteria and working padding membership as identified in the report no I think that needs to be really clear so begins a site selection process yeah so with the final decision on the process to be signed off so and that 's that 's why it describes including sites criterium working party membership so it 's the it 's the the booooored Pegasus community board was sign-off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Working Party membership so we 'll sign off on so the process will be determined by that so it can get underway that 's the that 's the driver of this is to get their Eastern Rican sportscenter process underway you know I understand that but I think there 's a kind of chicken and egg thing so who 's going to develop the criteria will develop that jointly because I originally thought always the chair of the community board it just seems that if you 're going to go through a formal decision making process of the board that 's going to take a lot longer it wasn 't intended to take longer I mean the booooored Pegasus Community Board meets every fortnight so the concern was that there 's been a number of do tations really concerned about the process in the criteria that are being used for the site selection so we need to relook at that personally I would have preferred a workshop so we can go through in detail but given their you know there 's a desire to get this going I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are looking at a new process a new criteria why because I would suggest that that clause all it does is say that you 're starting a site selection what I was sort of the gun a new science fiction okay alright so I think that this has got to get a move on and I think that that paragraph or that clauses absolutely fine and if there is a news site selection process then that can be communicated by the Burwood Pegasus community board and discussed in the community itself but I think we need to get on with it I don 't mind adding the word new if that helps clarify was always going to be September for the defense no sighs I see to it no it 's will eat noodles on we do want it sooner than that so known it would it 's the it 's the site selection process gets signed off the final decision will come back to Council you know well I don 't oh yeah how long is a piece of string I don 't know the answer to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we why don 't we why don 't we have a report back so so once the site selection process is as determined which will be in the next you know I would imagine it 'll be by the end of the mountain so so that so that there 's a an interim report to Council in May so that in May the community the community board can report to in fact that they 'll be on the first agenda of of the May when we found this group that our brother caught from the screen and may yeah so yeah so the report from the community board yeah and May and in the end then they can they can recommend to us the timeline that they want for the final decision is that all right that 's missing is the scale of the project so there 's been no clear understanding about the scale of the project so I think it 's really important that there gets defined in some way because actually until you know the scale quite hard to know what size site you might be looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give a fig to that because people have different ideas about what the replacement facility was going to be for qe2 it isn 't a replacement facility for curator and I think that people have to stop saying that it isn 't a replacement for qe2 qe2 was a metro facility and the Burwood Pegasus ward it wasn 't just a community facility by other community facilities they have yes there 's been a range of expectations that have been built up but until we know about the site the land you know the land will determine a lot about what is possible and wear it as possible so I 'd rather to get this process underway they 're going to have the power to call for reports on the land they 're going to be able to look at the costings and the potential impacts of decisions that are made we know that there are enormous challenges on the East especially with a large heavy facility as opposed to you know light residential so it you know there are going to be enormous challenges and a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come back to council because we haven 't had a report on the scale in fact it 's been one of my frustrations about this whole process that 's what I 'm not clear about is at what point so if I was building a car park I 'd need to know whether I 'm parking a hundred cars or whether on parking two before I decide what piece of land i would buy or whether it would be preferable so we done in parallel I mean look I don 't understand this where I 'm not critical of you Yanni but we have to get on with this and I think that this information that you 're talking about that I agree is necessary in the decision-making is information that the working party and were key group can collate and and work at the same time there 's pulling all the other information to you the reason I rates us is what I 'm really concerned as if you get a working product goes away and looks at a hundred million dollar project which is not something that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually going to make much progress at all so if we don 't define the scale early on they 'll put some parameters around the scale we run the risk of having what 's happened previously which has we spent a whole year during work that comes up with something that we don 't exceed I totally understand where you 're coming from and you 're expressing a frustration that I have had all the way through this process in a slightly different way but i i i would i would like it to be a parallel discussion and I don 't think that it needs to be included in the resolution because we 're going to have to you know work alongside the Working Party as they as they develop site criteria and site criteria are going to have to look at partly the scale but until we know about the the quality of the land and all of the different options that are available then I almost think that part of its going to be driven off another people 's expectations have been built off the amount that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not persuaded that that as a that I don 't know that that 's necessarily going to deliver what people think it 's going to deliver the booting party then also be charged with determining the scope of the project I think about things like that we 're going to have to work on scope earlier on it can be a parallel process I think people are going to be quite surprised by the by the challenges that different sites present so but I don 't know what the answer to the question is I I really want to have an undead investigation on sites that are in the Northeast I think what went wrong was that the previous process suddenly opened it up right across and to the other area and I I don 't think that that 's and I think that happened because the other resolution didn 't deal with the Hagley ferry meet ward and the way that it should have Dave thank you madam ear pardon my raspy voice today this has been a very long and protracted process and its really consumed my time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I really do hope that we can make some progress today staff were requested to produce a report to allow the process for selecting a site for the eastern suburbs sport and recreation facility to proceed and I believe they 've really done what they were asked and essentially i believe were here today to set this process on the way now the loss of qe2 has had a huge effect on the residence of booooored pegasus and indeed the whole city residents are king for a replacement facility and have signaled the need for something that is bigger and better than jelly park a budget of 30 point 1 million and subsequent addition of 6.5 billion from the earthquake appeal trust has been seen as a good signal for this project alongside the need for a new poll it was also the problem of a declining new brighton new brighton business area term sentence and i rightly or wrongly proposed an aquatic proposal to address both both issues the jury support of over 20,000 people the opportunity was seen to combine the eastern sport and Rec facility with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same area the investment in the coastal area of god- Ward has been minimal for decades and the pier was funded by 50% local funding due to the reticence really of council to invest in the project the coastal strip of crisis has been sighted the bexley dump who would landfill and the sewage treatment plant it seems the city 's keen is always happy to dispose of its rubbish and effluent in this part of town but has been reticent and having any other investment of apart from qe2 itself in 1974 which in itself was highly controversial at the time and cost the setting mere is see there 's still a stigma around the eastern suburbs where the i believe the area is still considered second-rate in the early 1900 's there was a saying now you 're married or do you live in brighton which was a reflection on the practice of the wealthy keeping their mistresses in the area so going forward a number of sites have been identified and it 's also encouraging to see a move to recognize the need for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I and many local people have been advocating for for a long time burning for this project can be public private enterprise with the possibility of earthquake appeal trust funding being applied as well we are staff for a way forward and their proposal met what I believe was a way forward I believe the resolution that we have before us today is also a way forward I 'm keen to avoid a hell of a lot more consultation and workshops as we be debated this issue endless leifer for a long time there so I would urge fellow councillors to support this amendment and let 's just get on and do something in that side of town thank you mice yeah yeah yeah okay yeah okay thank you thank you first one I regarding to the committee recommendation I reveal a start for the handle of the meeting agenda regarding to a three pointers three Eva based on those three-pointers three the staff original council criteria has been the detail in the aquatic facility plan 2006 and also have the couple times the amendment you know one time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in febrile 2014 i would like to ask a start in 2006 these are the council bacteria or distal detailed accredited facilitate weather has been presented to the council even previous counsel or just a staff or your idea Thank You counsel chain yet the the criteria on which council uses to locate its aquatic facilities was presented to the council and formally approved by the council in the 2006 aquatic facilities plan so there was a formal report the winter council quite explicitly and council signed it off and my sub question is how are powder in june two thousand twelve and also the in febrile 2014 these two times you have amendment weather presented to the council either in Council meeting or in a workshop the aquatic facilities plan has been reviewed a a couple of times since 2000 it 's been reviewed 3 times since 2006 there has been one adjustment to the criteria and that adjustment has been primarily around strengthening the criteria as it refers to the geological suitability of land to build a swimming pool upon and the possible effects on the economic development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not been formally ratified by the council I would expect any working party to look at all the criteria and apply them along with any others that they choose to do so in reaching a decision on the location of a year of a pool so this on the the two times in June 2010 fifa 2014 this kind of critique facility plan you are not presented to the council solar council HD today we have no any sufficient information whether we would like to go to the community or not is spatial reader i reviewed the migration migration yes because based on the three pointers three in this aquatic facility plan you emphasize the three facility you know in city y 1 is in a metro center second is the eastern the other is in the southwest but why now committee the recommendations of three in the eastern what is your point of view or not actually my up counselor chennai my point of view is that council have made a decision to build a recreation and sports center in the east at qe2 or another suitable location @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago and we haven 't begun the process yet my view is that we should begin a process to do just that as soon as possible yep whether that results in any other facilities that may or may not be considered that is our bodies are almost relevant in my view what is relevant is to embark on you know are delivering council 's decision and hopefully are a recreation sports center in the in the northeast on the eastern aquatic facilities the issue of whether there is a and when there is a new aquatic facility in the southwest is not under debate here there is no doubt that there will be a new aquatic facility in the southwest so we 're not residing from that at all so I have now I have Glenn so we 're actually I have we finished questions these are questions okay it fell and then Jamie well I am agree with counsel chin that besides proceeding with this as fast as we can that this council needs to have the overview so my question basically is Queen can this council see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a context for actually progressing some very important and developments I did the chair of community committee has asked for the March 2014 review the aquatic facilities plan to be presented to the april fifteenth meeting of the community committee and then on then onwards it 's our aim to do that we have a updated review and a report ready for sign off today and hopefully we 'll meet the deadline so 15th of April community committee thinks cheers john look my question around this is I 'm happy that you 've you 've got six point two point one six point two point two actually feeding it at the same date I think they 're makes a lot of sense just as a bit of a side thing you know whether with the council obviously has committed to a recreation and swimming or aquatic facility in the east Beckett not under debate how many that is like I don 't know I 'm not sure if that is through I haven 't any cost benefit analysis I haven 't seen a wider strategy I have reservations around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my question is could the site selection for the rig sport and Rec facility the yard line six point two point one potentially be the same one that 's a legacy project that 's eluded to in six point two point two counselor golf they are different beasts the facility envisaged under six point two point one is a community recreation sports center it 's not a legacy project are envisaged for for New Brighton are so I so know it would be a I would envisage a different process and we would certainly want to engage with the business community of New Brighton engage with our planners engage with the community board before coming back to the council in May on a process that looks looks forward to six point two point two okay in a quick so definitely I guess then too there so you 've got three pieces of work effectively there but anyone the council 's going to be looking at it and you weigh out the pros and cons and you can say yes to one no to some or and when you look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right directions to go or not whether that 's 13 of them or whatever I guess just to give me a bit of comfort here you 're coming back with options about how this may look really isn 't that the process exactly yeah yeah yes I 'm completely comfortable with it and it 's probably tired only my speech to so i can speak with my vote minds that equation i 'm just going to say i 'm going to support this i think it 's actually really really important notwithstanding that we have going to pressures all throughout the city as a city expands without a major shortage in the east with the loss of the qe2 facility but we 've got to start celebrating our coastline we 've got a beautiful coastline i think this is going to actually put some energy back into some areas that have been long forgotten and and hopefully help regenerate and actually help celebrate for the risks of Crozier 's come out and celebrate the beauty we have in our natural assets so i 'm going to supporting us i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just need to get on with it thank you I have a question for John just and light of issues around deferred maintenance on jelly part for example which hasn 't been able to close because it 's so well used issues around 40 million repairs required there well do we have to be careful in considering in these options and the process as well but in the options the money that we may I mean we don 't want our current facilities in any way to close really long periods of time or completely because we don 't hit the money to keep those going or to repair them in order to fund three new project gigs is that something that you will be considering and this should this go through councillor Jones the council has set aside resources to build operate and maintain one recreation sports center they are quite substantial resources they I would say it was I certainly a question that the council would want to consider when discussing you know all of the opportunities for all of the potential projects be they swimming pools in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could expect officers to come back with information on long-term cost implications and I 'm possibly priorities so I 'd say it was very much something you 'd want to look at and I just add to that quickly though and I just say this to my colleagues that this is a great place to start and I support where we 're at with us we 've got to get a move on and I 'm glad that these are happening in parallel however I will sound a word of warning with regards to other facilities around town and the money that will be required for three here when we had other parts of town that either don 't have facilities now or potentially won 't have facilities because of deferred maintenance and other issues with the earthquake damage a reasonably some maintenance on pioneer and one of the other pools reasonably soon madam deputy mayor the Vicki wait circumstances my name isn 't changed it yeah I was going to say now the the Aquatics review coming back to the community committee will will identify some cost pressures that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be reported to the community committee on the fifteenth of April and the very purpose of doing that is to ensure that council 's decision making in respective aquatic facilities and other facilities is done in context so that council knows what what liabilities are it faces they there is nothing in that review which in any way in my opinion prevents us going down this track the prevents us building owning and operating a recreational sport facility in the Northeast but there is information that the council will want to look at particular in its long-term planning process on the affordability of aquatic facilities citywide are over a period of 30 years ask is there a reason yani you might be able to help with this as well is there a reason why the information and the report that you 're bringing to our community committee can 't or shouldn 't in fact go to the full council or to the committee of the whole that 's because of the information that is in there I just wonder why you 're laughing this is something I don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about okay all right like why shouldn 't this come to committee the whole law or the committee to the council full council the report are that that accompanies the review of the aquatic facilities plan asks the community committee to refer it to the committee of the whole for council wide discussion so I don 't get that aren 't we just creating another loophole link in the chain why can 't it yeah yeah the the report excuse me though I 'd been dangerous and yannis yeah i just i don 't get there to be friends so the council has a whole bunch of strategies so Phil as chair of environment will have the crusher chance we 'll plan that doesn 't come to the committee of the whole so he 'll have a whole bunch of natural environment strategies biodiversity wastewater storm water doesn 't come to the committee of the whole so you know I think we need to be clear that you know like that we 've set our terms of reference part of the problem with us and I mean I tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that was rejected by the council they said they didn 't want that they wanted this to come ahead of the aquatic facilities review I 've always believed that this should have been done as part of that comprehensive review post-earthquake but there has been you know it hasn 't carried favor so you know we can I mean we may wish to have a workshop with councillors over it what previously happened is there was a workshop with councillors who expressed concerns about the aquatic facilities review generally out of workshops that would generate a report to the committee or to the council that hasn 't happened that hasn 't happened for two years so what we need to do is just close that loop so that the concerns that councils have and given now we 've got a new count so it may be that we actually wish to have a workshop with the four council over over it so that that report can reflect some of the issues and ideas that we have as counselors so I think the important thing is that it 's coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forecastle so we 'll get there but are there any other questions before i come to you injury know that case you can relax John thank you I 'm yeah I am so are you going to you 're not going to ask a question though right are you going to speak and then Andrew speaking yep I 'll stand up thank you madam deputy mere from New Brighton whose vote I 'm counting on but anyway I retract the first the first word look I 've or is I have a letter here from today today from KU Brown who 's who 's with us and his letter really reinforces what we 've heard through annual plans ever since qe2 I was lost in February 2011 and two of the main themes that have come through somewhere for children to learn to swim and somewhere for the lifeguards to train so that they can help their children when they need that assistance and of course helped the whole community we 've heard today through women 's voices the the longing for a sense of community a gathering point this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unfortunate social housing flat closure during this past week that the residents you know can reasonably withstand having to shift it 's actually the loss of the sense of community that will be a great loss for them in terms of these recommendations I like the signal that they send out that we 're actually getting on with the job and I think it 's time just to get on with it they signal some degree of certainty for a community that longs for it they signal hope in New Brighton the community expanded obviously in the the heyday of Saturday 's shopping when it virtually had a monopoly but it never contracted and that could be something we need to look at as part of this legacy project as well what i would say in relation to the aquatic facilities review i would say counselor you 're handsome isn 't wrong and that technically would be what you would do my argument counter to that and we can still do it would be that this is simply a replacement for something that was first lost so i yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wish my other in my final point on this is actually i think the city would like this this would help the city 's recovery if they could see that a facility as a substantial facility would go back and the yeast this would actually help the city hover and I 'd like in this term I tried to promote this than the previous two and when it comes to ward issues if we consider that attitude that my ward is your ward so that it 's difficult we 're constantly holding this tension between being a city councilor and award counselor and some and we have to find a way in which we can hold that tension together so please i encourage you to vote for this in to see this is good for the city thinking um yeah I 'm supporting the motion today we 've heard a lot of deputations from people in the community we 've had a lot of discussion ourselves as a council to put this in a sport and recreation context it 's a ball that we 've been kicking around for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around before we got it passed to us as well but the one thing that we 've heard loud and clear from all of the people who 've come to talk to us about this and from much of the discussion that we 've had internally as well if there 's a really strong urgent need for us to to get on with this and we need to find a process that allows us to get on with this and in my view here is that process the public the residents with all of their differing views want us in fact expect us to get on with this piece of work as urgently as we possibly cared and that 's certainly something that 's come through very clearly in many of the conversations that we 've had the needs is fair to say through our discussions are becoming increasingly clearly understood it 's reflected in the resolution today and it was reflected in the resolution for the recommendation from the community committee as well three separate projects a legacy project for New Brighton a northeastern aquatic facility and I hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I agree with the most comments that that raises an expectation around size and scale and we shouldn 't prejudice we shouldn 't show any prejudice around that we should just let that be a part of the process from the working group and any possible subsequent workshops and decisions and then the ongoing need for facility in the lynnwood Wilson area and I also make the point in relation to and what counselor Livingston has said that the residents of the CC don 't see themselves as defined by ward boundaries they see themselves as possibly communities of need and they know what they want in their local neighborhoods they know what they expect and need in their local neighborhoods but they perhaps don 't see themselves as defined by ward boundaries as we do so to be looking at this in the context of the needs of the east rather than the needs of burwood pegasus and had a fairy made is the way that we should be looking at it I just wanted to make some comments about the need for a legacy project in in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm very familiar with the need for urban regeneration design-led solutions catalyst for private investments in areas and so on and it 's very important when we consider the needs of New Brighton and when we consider what a legacy project for New Brighton might look like that the economic development and the social development of the area are the guiding principles for that and they 're quite different principles than we would be looking at for what the needs of recreation and aquatic recreation in particular are for the Northeast or the East in general and yeah what we need to come up with for new brighton is something that ticks those boxes that allows for that catalyst for private investment and that catalyst for for social interaction in new brighton for that redevelopment of new brighton to take place and these are some of the very same issues that we 've been wrestling with in littleton side I certainly understand the needs there and the challenges in fact as well so yeah I 'm supporting this motion because it gives us the ability to look at those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly two of which are very urgent and I just like to stress the absolute need and the expectation on the part of a community that will just get on with this work and it 'll happen as a matter of urgency I can add a sub police way the reason is very simple we heard from the staff because the key issue is the amendment of a creative facility plan the council you know amendment for two times first time in june two thousand twelve second time in the favorite 2014 park where is the document how come so make a decision today I think you find the uterus the committee recommendation a 6.1 my personal view that 's very reasonable why staff can have urging the presentation briefing to the council he comes overall picture over all the information then we make a decision then start mentioned on as 40 of this month where where make decision but up to now I have not yet released the information because this facility and is very crucial why they including the criteria including the process and also including the all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know gather the sufficient information lake of information as a counselor I cannot make a decision sorry I cannot make a decision until I Kayla all these leather information and also if we record this information how to prioritize why the six pointer to point 01 is higher than six pointer to pointer three I have no any idea if we reveal the structural information here actually the screening for many many location finally screen e to the seven possible heaven knows Easter Easter southeast sh 0 I don 't know we cannot assume you know this is the reasonable assume is not scientifically at another to them make the decision to support is worth all thank you well I I think this is an ideal because the aquatic facilities review hasn 't been done by the council we haven 't approved it but I do except there 's a need to get on and get things done and so this is a compromise and I 'm happy to support it I think it 's really important that we send a signal that we are looking at Linwood Boston area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new site selection process looking at working with the Ministry of Education in the Northeast as well there 's not to say that that 's the course of action will go down but we actually should be thinking about other opportunities there I did want to pick up on some comments that have been made by several councillors that for some somehow new brightens been forgotten about and lacked investment and that in that wider area I actually want to dispel that myth because actually what have we done we 've built a new library we 've built one in New Brighton we 've also got one more recently and aranui what have we done out what other things are we done in our annoying we 've committed to a new community center we 've put a temporary gem in parklands we 've got a parklands library that 's open so actually there has been a lot of consideration about facilities in that area by council there has been a big investment so I just think we need to put it into context because sometimes we hear these comments that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a huge amount of public investment but for whatever reason it 's had issues in the past and going forward post-earthquake it 's obviously got new issues to consider such as the loss of population in the red zone and the impact that that 's going to have so I welcome the opportunity to look at a legacy project for New Brighton in much the same way that we 've committed to the coastal pathway from sumner to the history edge I think a legacy project in New Brighton makes a lot of sense posted earthquake and we 've already heard some comment on that and regards to a little soon and I think it 's important to separate these two projects out the reason this is taking so long is that they all got put together and it created a divisive process that the key thing is to have a really clear straightforward process that people can under stand so that when people make submissions and you know sitting through the central study plan sitting through the annual plan sitting through the number of different processes that council had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Metro sports facility it was just ink like a just a complete maze of what not to do we never had a clearly defined process to determine what we did in regards to the issue of the future of qe2 and there were all sorts of stuff happening both by government and by council that meant things like centennial pole things like qe2 ended up being amateur sports facility in a location that the community never had a chance to make submissions on so I stress the clarity of process and that I idea that we would have a definition at least some sort of needs assessment in scale of project that we 're talking with people about is incredibly important so yeah that really just wanted to make those comments I also wanted to make the comment that actually there is a lot of aquatic facilities in the north there are a lot of aquatic facilities in the west and there is a lot in the south the big get is in the ACE and it is both over that Linwood Walston area and is over that towards the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so when you look at the map which you have and you see the ones that have shut you see the ones that are open you can see really clearly that actually it 's not about the East getting any more than the West it 's actually about addressing the gap and provision that exists both before the earthquake and post-earthquake so I really want to make that point thank you I think you 'll be brief because I agree with yanni this is actually don 't forget it 's replacing any asset that was here the facility set inside the aquatics facility strategy it was a strategic location pre-earthquake and I can 't see without having a crystal ball I can 't see that that would change in the up and coming review that we will get in April so I think that we can see this as a need that needs to be replaced out here this is not binding this is beginning a process and I agree that we have to get on and get it going and it looks like it 's an open process it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has a view so I 'm going to support this week indention thank you I 'm I 'm also very happy to support it I think actually what we 're dealing about with here is a process and part of what has come through very strongly from the community as the frustration at the process and actually allowing the community board to be the lead on this process is quite a major move for the council as well which I like I think it 's important that we actually use the community knowledge to the fall I 'm not sure about the term legacy project for Brighton it sounds as though brighteners somehow did and brighton is very far from dead it 's a it 's a very lively engaging community that has very strong opinions and probably always will have which is stunning and and has its own quite unique identity i think so i 'm not sure about that Tim but I 'm not worried about it at this stage what we want to do is get on with a process we have the whole review coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with that like Jimmy our support additional facilities in the southwest because although there are some facilities there at the moment the rate of growth in that area of the city is incredible and a lot of subdivisions are going in unlike the one that we 're about to do today without a lot of community facilities so I 'm happy that we do this I think it 's important that we actually get on and to find the process so that people can be engaged in this and work through it there are unspoken in this some potential major financial considerations which will come back to this council it 's not the subject today but there is implicit within this a major financial consideration at a time when this council has still some huge financial pressures so we need to be aware of those in the back of our mind as we as we vote but unless is anybody else I 'm going to put the motion now and as you 'll see at the top we 've changed it slightly because the council actually delegated this to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so with that amendment it 's moved and seconded I 'll put it those in favor please say aye those opposed or I declare it carried so moving on to the next item","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Agreement,nPuVRUtP50g,20140402,389.87,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1001,recovery plan plan internal progress I 'm just keeping an eye on the time because I 'm going to have to go at it happens to live in so I 'm just yeah I 'm just there might be things that we might have to juggle the order on an auditor yeah and also the approval to sign the Rockefeller Foundation 100 resilient cities initiative yep so we 'll come back to this all right so if we if we just do the approval to sign the Rockefeller Foundation 100 resilient cities fearsome sorry guys that 's not that 's not you I don 't know whether you want to join us at the table died just in case there are questions and I don 't should I be moving emotion about me signing a document or okay I 'd like to move that I be given the authority to to sign is it it 's a perfectly appropriate resolution for me to move is it for me to sign there is a yeah that 's all right Jamie Goff secant it are there any questions for died any discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really great to see that we are looking at participating in the resilient cities foundation network can I just make two very brief points one is that the former council did a review of our international relations and part of that highlighted the need for us to be much more proactive post-disaster and the international sphere of what happens in other places around the world to both share the knowledge that we 've learned but also to learn from what happens and to reciprocate the generosity and goodwill that we got from others at the time of our need to others when they have their time of need with that being said I have asked the acting chief to make contact with the appropriate people in regards to the event that happened in chile and my understanding is that we have made we are working through offering any support or assistance that we can through the appropriate channels as a city to recognize what they 're going through with the massive earthquake they had so just that I 'd place that on record I don 't know if the acting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do think it 's important to reflect on we are you know we have to not just sign these agreements but we actually have to give a meaningful effect to them by demonstrating through our behavior that we are prepared to work collaboratively it provides support clear its name yeah I was hoping that actually is mere that I would be writing to the city 's mayor you know the most affected area just to you know express you know solidarity and their time of need so we got so much support you know as a city better as appropriate that we take steps to support others and also make those offers I just on the learnings though you know I think that we have to be really open and upfront about some of the learnings so i 'll be bringing back some suggestions later in the year about how we as a map council might reflect on on what 's happened and the number of reviews and actually start to draw those together because i think we we probably as a council need to do a slightly better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was and you know in a full and frank way because if we are going to learn the lessons that was very much the feedback that I got when I met with the families of those who died that they really really really want the truth and the lessons to be a part of the legacy that you know that that loss of life you know represents and to provide some meaning for our city out of the tremendous sense of loss so i 'll put the motion oh I hadn 't realized until dough did a presentation the other week that you had volved in this pre your election as mere and just quite a persistent that you 've been on it which i think is stunning so I 'm delighted that this is now happening and I think I think your leadership on earth has been excellent I think it becomes incredibly important when we look at the fact that so much of the world now lives in cities and that actually the concept of governance will change quite dramatically in the next two decades from governmental control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world does so I think cities acting collectively is actually incredibly sensible in terms of the lessons that we can each learn and apply to each other obviously natural disasters will be with everybody always but we have now got a series of manmade disasters through climate change that will affect every practically every city in the world so we will see increased bush fires in Australia we will see increased flooding events will see increased extreme weather events and we know that that is going to happen the report of the IPCC last week this week and made that incredibly clear and so the whole issue of house that is survived when we have done when we live in a time of rapid climate change as well becomes incredibly important so the sharing of lessons and the practical steps of how you develop communities that can actually deal with that and and and live well and that is really important so I 'm very happy to support this excellent i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number,"(-43.5320214,

Update,75ccy7UyyC0,20140402,2542.85,"Christchurch, New Zealand",6917,on the agenda is am i doing sorry I managed to bury the agenda at that point mmm item 5 the land use recovery plan sorry the land use recovery plan our day and we 've got um Martin and Richard at the end of the table so has anyone got any questions that they 'd like to direct the staff on on the report that we 've got andrew tiernan thank you referring to a six point one point five can we find out please um who are our representatives on that steering group who actually turns that steering group of counsel certainly through you madam chair it as ron clark and the city environment group carolyn gallaher and community services myself and strategy and planning now also the chair and share on the thread will and the building services team thank you and Phil Clearwater I 'm just in relation to on page 5 6 foot 1 6 inches of your recommendation the work that 's ongoing explain the work to the community it just seems to me what while for example the district planners as being well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community but but the the part of the loop in there it just doesn 't seem to me to be there haven 't been specific I guess information often to the community and let 's come up and the workshops that I 've attended just wonder if you could explain it 's about well what we are doing but also how might be on enhancing this council through you madam chair you as your where the loop itself has been gazetted bottomless and it occurred on 6 of December last year and there were a couple rounds of consultation prior to that occurring so at the moment the work that we have done is really explaining it to the details of Watson up to professional Institute 's we 've done presentations to some of those thus far we 've created information see sheets to answer some of the questions that people have about the specific provisions within it but we 're not going through an active additional consultation plan because that was done in 2013 but they certainly still some ongoing work but nothing in comparison with what 's happening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just picking up I think on your sentiment council clearwater letters so i think i gather what you 're saying is so how do we get a connect what we 're talking about in the city plan to some of the loop drivers that are leading us down there so that 's something we can take up an hour in our consultation programs on the district plan and make sure those linkages are perhaps a bit more explicit because the loop along with the previous district plan and the you use our key drivers into the review so we can pick those up obviously the district plans one part of the loop say on so on the exemplar projects we 're having a lot of conversations as Richard said with those people who are involved in those specifically thank you Mike because I i think the the community reaction is that they had no idea really of the power of the powerful influence of the loop on I guess the Democratic opportunities to comment on the district Lane and Jimmy chin thank you here we got into the star accommodation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minor amendment as a testament one whether the council has been engaged with the Silver Star and a reporter too many they all agree these male amendment is spatially attachment wife so attachment 1 just indicate some minor amendments to the the statutory provisions that were introduced through the land use recovery plan and most of them are pretty minor issues I mean some of them are as small as capitals and that sort of thing the minister has indicated he would like a process to you know a single process to to make changes to those so councils one of those parties there 's probably some minor amendments that might need to be made in terms of why Mac selman district as well yes we 're not quite sure at the moment in terms of how that process is going to you know end up but basically those the ones that we have identified with uncounseled so it 'll be the minister 's decision as whether he makes them clean living stone in Eddie Jones thank you I have two questions if I may the first is around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the what has been struck out is the residential units are proposed where there would be a mix of at least two unit size times so I 'm just querying why in the in the bullet point at the beginning of the report it says that this flexibility which had if it went through would infect him to kind of suppress their I flexibility when it came to housing newzealand are you able to just tease this out of it does this a kind of it push towards modulator why isn 't me of this kind of flexibility in the typology I think I mean this is obviously a decision of the minister made it 's hard to know I mean it may be it may suggest more uniformity than we otherwise anticipated it may also be that the minister desire that he didn 't want to be bound by that level of prescription it doesn 't for clothes that mix happening but it doesn 't specify it either so you know it 's hard to know but I mean certainly when we look at what housing you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mix of housing types in their proposals but yeah I think you the second questions about the water key is proposing here and we can see if it right here at area representing the operative loop HRM and my question there is that the seems to me there are two quite different communities of interest that are being put together that distinctly laid out in the reading and then the blue you know the reasoning for this well i think that i think the perhaps the questions relevant to to all of those areas the minister as we understand it when he took the final agreed versions that the council had offered and to a significantly larger area of land incorporated I think at the end of the day the the blue line was a compromise that the minister was able to reach with his cabinet colleagues I can 't answer specifically why he chose that particular we certainly had some discussion with his officials around what we 're different things were going to change because they were there was a direction from cabinet to change how we would what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so the outcome for all those areas where there 's been some expansions been us I suppose a a sort of a solution it 's been derived based on cabinets and tension to grow the area 's slightly it did kind of look to me like it was it was it was just to create a an impression on the map that there was a big line you know but that you know that the line made seems yeah that 's what it looked like well Google something some of them are in some respects and I I don 't know the communities particularly well in that area but some of them are taking about potentially more logical boundaries more understandable edges but some of them but the fundamental driver was a reflection by cabinet they wanted to have a larger amount of land incorporated in that alley thank you i just i had a question around and I appreciate the finger better than men but I 've just a clarification around the elderly persons challenge because I understand that this was raised actually some weeks ago if not months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phone and I 'm sorry I 'll be with you on electronic and paper and then page numbers don 't seem to align I thought page nine that 's right attachment to thank you so the changes to the elderly person 's housing and it was pointy that was completely struck out which was the issue that counselors talked about was regards protecting those over 60 s who had brought him to an environment that they had assumed with romaine and all that did was essentially allow them to be a degree of democracy if you like around approval of removing those boundaries so that other people could come and live in li and now aren 't mine Durst and he was when this first became clear that this had been removed it was raised and take them back to the minister is I think it was the minister and it was suggested that they hadn 't been removed now I think I had a conversation with with Leanne and some stage on this and that and so I understood that they hadn 't been removed and now I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are no barriers to anyone moving into over-60s housing is that correct that this was say that this was a one of the issues that we wanted to discuss with the minister so we wanted to you know have a meeting to talk about the changes that had been made and and so with you know delays and getting that that meeting established it wasn 't possible to do so and so I spoke to sarah staff about what was behind this decision as you say it was gazetted that the position that they put to me was that it is unnecessary to brighten the requirement for written approval because all of these have what are they called the body core covenants covenants know they have covenants which are legally binding that you have to be over 60 to live there it does you don 't have to be over 62 own but you have to be over 60 to live there that is the the Covenant that goes with it so in actual fact this is where perhaps I don 't I don 't recall saying to you that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that this wording was unnecessary to provide the protection that the council wanted to place which gave me much more comfort than I had we 're not done this a serie 20 because it is a covenant that is an enforceable by the by the group and so they wouldn 't help the two point three point nine and occupancy of an elderly person 's housing does it make here 11 12 and loving 89 90 persons having you know it says the net etcetra etcetra may be converted to a residential unit that may be occupied by any persons well it doesn 't overall the Covenant that exists on the property and so they would have to agree that 's that that is what I 've been advised by Sarah but what would they let in here I don 't understand why you would have a paragraph that essentially opens it up to anyone living because at the moment they don 't have the power to do that they even they couldn 't they couldn 't use if they agree to let go of their covenant then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ units would disappear so they can 't legally do it until this was put on the district plan so they I mean even if every single person agrees in a unit now without this plane change they weren 't allowed to under the district plan it was only available for people who were over 60 I understand that what I don 't understand is the suggestion that it 's already there and as a protection and here two point three point nine there doesn 't appear to be that big protection Earl is the Covenant yea all I 'm telling you is all I 'm telling you is that that 's what I received by way of advice from Sarah so I 'll hand back to Mike and I mean he might say I totally disagree with no I think I think the key the key thing that we need to recognize as the the claws you 're talking to refers to the balance going forward e as was around protecting existing developments where people had bought him with the expectation that they weren 't going to be exposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as leanna 's rightly pointed out even new ones if a if a group of landowners decided through their body corporate to restrict their occupancy to older persons or two left-handed people they 're entitled still to do it so the protection was very much around what protects currently so people and that was the debate i think we headed around the table with counselors was about protecting existing people so that 's reliant on the existing body corporate the new rules for new development are more flexible but it doesn 't stop people establishing a body corporate covenant relationship that pertains as over 60 forgive me for sounding obtuse i still don 't understand what that who 's paragraph lee provides for i mean open at the moment you can 't have a development with residential units the size they aren 't elderly persons units that was the pre-existing one that 's what I 'm saying yeah so to have it available for others other then elderly persons we needed this rule change those ads more flips this is only about that the protection was only for pre existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I think that what I 'm hearing is it be useful to get Britain advice from Sarah to confirm their their position so and and there is actually something that i think would be useful so if you could make a note of that might that would be great on that point so for those units that are elderly persons housing now in terms of protecting them is there always a body corporate i mean i suppose the answer is there should be that there may be instances where they 're hidden thing but but in the majority of cases and and by intently should be so i should also point out that under the tempe oh i see there 's a current exclusion as well but that does expire okay so for those that exist they can still if they wish to really under their covenant keep whoever they want to within that community yes yes and not allow any one thing but for going forward for we see advertised you know suitable for for our liquid sins units or whatever those can be for now anybody 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enforce it again through some form of legal document to to create that same exclusion but for a developer taking a relatively small c option and putting forward units on they can now be for anyone 's to select what are you doing actually yani i just want to pick up on this point because when you read 2.2 3.9 it actually talks about existing units not nuanced it 's about converting to residential units existing units so i have no confidence um you know I just find that we know what the ministers and tension was we had discussion to them as we prepared the land use recovery plan we knew that Sarah and the minister did not like having any controls on what people people being able to love an elderly person 's housing we had that debate we had an agreement and when the report came to counsel I thought we 'd headed that the changes that we made were support so the fact that being changed after we had an agreement released us uncomfortable with me now we 've heard that this kind of bizarre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought it was unnecessary why wouldn 't they just leave it in and say well we didn 't think you needed to do it but if it gives you greater comfort then we 're happy to have it in there it was it was the specific wording which was the written approval and I don 't think it it 's bizarre when we haven 't received the advice and brightening said it 's get the advice and writing which we 've already agreed to do and in terms of the existing units i think that the point that has been made is that it would not be legally possible under our existing district plan to allow to allow them by consent to agree to this without without without a change to our district plan which is what the loop has done it 's changed the district plan to allow this to happen so in essence it 's to do with existing units what we 've been advised orally is that the the covenants that people enter into about who can live in these units and I know that this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me about you know a guy and he ratted his mother 's unit and one of these complexes after she died he wasn 't allowed to live there even though every single people person and the unit was more than happy and the set of unit was more than happy that he did yeah but he was under 16 we 've had this debate we had this debate is part of the loop being you know us giving support to the loop we were really clear as a council about what our bottom lines were and I just feel that it 's you know though that debt agreement that we had has been broken I was interested Michael in your comments that you were aware that cabinet were making changes to the wider area and I just was wondering why that never came back to us as elected members given that one of the major issues we discussed was the concern about the extent of the areas that removes effectively the right for the public to be involved and we had very detailed maps around the number of privately owned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those areas and I was really surprised to hear you say that you the staff were aware that you knew them cabinet was going to look at bigger areas and it never came back to us given that that 's fundamentally something that we decided again as agreeing to the loop I can 't be very clear I didn 't say we knew cabinet was considering it we were advised cabinet had made a decision and we were asked for our advice about how that those final boundaries would be drawn up so cabinet had made the decision to extend the areas well I 'm afraid that the process has been unsatisfactory so let 's just accept that it is it has been unsatisfactory to the extent that we agreed as a council that we would accept the loop we signed up to it we set up a smaller group of people to meet with the minister to negotiate the outstanding matters and in that meeting didn 't occur and it went to cabinet before a before any such meeting could occur we have met subsequently to discuss the order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not all aspects of the sui and unfortunately what has been missing has been a report generated out of a meeting with the minister on these particular matters and it just somebody hasn 't happened and I 'm going to accept you know my share of the responsibility for this there 's nothing I can do about it the meeting simply didn 't take place Connor calls into question a whole working relationship with government if we cannot have a meaningful good faith discussion and agreement on doing things where this is what happened with the cost year it 's what happened with the blueprint it 's now heaven with the land use recovery plan you know it 's just that I don 't accept it I think it 's completely unacceptable that we have constantly put in this position it is unfair to our communities who actually are losing democracy this is about doing things to communities rather than enabling them to be involved and I feel very strongly that at some stage we need to stand up and say we do not support these processes can I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council going to be made public so the community can see what the minister is intent on doing in terms of the district plan review because that is critical to the people we 've got hearings next week and we still don 't have any publicity around the process that government have decided we will have hep them to our communities so when will it be made public and what is the communications around it we don 't have a confirmed date yet from the crown next week well we may have to read the feelings just to be careful our meetings start next week yes you have to take into account community feedback yes in the community have no idea what the order in council the government hasn 't done says in light of that it may be that we have to revisit what we are doing next week so you know I 'm that that this is yeah there are enormously challenging issues is and I just want to kind of go back just a moment in time to last year when it became very clear that with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tension around residential intensification and the design leed proposal the uncertainly I had completely misunderstood what the government 's intention was that once we had had well their group of us had had a meeting with the minister I became much clearer and my own mind what the government was actually proposing and you might recall a meeting that we had with the minister we 're all of us were present and we we heard really what the alternative was and the explanation that I was able to make to the minister that the that the council was confronted with was that we couldn 't talk about what the government wanted to achieve in terms of completely rewriting the district plan for intensification virtually across the city as an alternative to us having some democratic input from the residents of Christchurch around specific intensification proposals that were as we said design lead you know to be sensitive to the environment particularly in those living zone one living one zones where people were going to be you know needed to have a buffer as that were between a more intense environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that and out of that meeting that the minister allowed us to talk publicly about the alternatives and I thought that was an incredible step forward and I believed that it was the beginning of a new relationship with central government something that I hadn 't observed as an outsider looking in between the elected members of this council and central government I thought it was a major breakthrough so I know that people were going to express you know sort of disappointment about some of the the detail of the of the changes that were made subsequently but when I reflect on if the government had not waited for the new council to be elected then we would have had the entire district plan rewritten and it would have included intensification right across the city and in fact would have even picked up areas where we would have had constraints on surgeon water delivery which would have had massive impacts on the capacity for our city and and no mechanism for resolving there so look I 'm not I 'm not sitting here being an apologist for anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was deep seated and we are in a process of moving the relationship forward and I think we 've made significant advances i would but it is clear that there are aspects of the the next phase which you know the fact that the order and council isn 't ready yet and that there possibly reasons sitting behind that that we may have to rethink the whole process on our district plan review because i think the question that fell clearwater raised before has really highlighted an issue which is the public don 't see the connection between the land use recovery plan and what the the government 's intentions are around intensification which we now see a bigger than them where we had agreed and and secondly there the district plan review and there is a high level of connection because one is driven off the other but what 's been difficult for me coming in from as an outsider coming in here is that my driver has been around the natural hazards chapter and i 'm not satisfied that the public truly understand the nature of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under district plan to address those risks and what the shared responsibility is between the populations that are exposed to those risks the wider community and the costs of addressing some of those and how on earth we get to a sort of almost like a shared learning and understanding of what their roles are as a city going forward and I you know it is a hugely challenging issue but I don 't think that we can do justice to it and the time frame that we now under because of the fast tracking process which I mean I 'd love to use the fast tracking at the end because I 'd really like to not go through five years of hearings and appeals and further hearings and further appeals I would really like to though spending a lot more time with community having unput and that 's now for me not just the natural hazards chapter but it 's the residential chapter and the commercial and the industrial and in fact a combination of them because I still think that there may be some sense and having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us is that all integrate and one in one place but I 'm sure that the xfit planners are looking at me rather suspiciously when I say they 're clean thank you just briefly an onion a keyword the mirror setters relationship we 're never going to have the perfect relationship with any government the thing is we 've just got to keep it going and the way they see the world of the ways we see the world won 't always fit but we we just have to keep it going that 's the important thing and it 's for the sake of the whole city we must do this Ellie thank you just to go back because she never help elderly person 's housing because I just wanted to clarify this what I 'm not following and I do when asking for clarification on is the covenants that are in there already that protect this can they be overridden by what the mood see this is what we will get you will get the Sun rationally yep yeah the recovery that the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the district plan there there are listed plans that cannot be unconcerned twith a recovery plan so that wouldn 't apply to private rights yeah I 've just got one other question for Mike it 's a relation 6.11 and my wallet the agreement was there we minor amendments it 's on page five of their report 611 man take minor amendments clearly these much some of these minor amendments actually end up having a major impact or can you comment on that and that 's our concern visions and the sir legislation I mean minor amendments are around correcting inconsistencies and the plan and we 're we 're given the speed that it was produced there are errors so minor amendments should be read in terms of the federal legislation provides for that and they shouldn 't fundamentally be changing the intent of the plan the provision there is a provision in the sewer legislation that allows the minister to amend a recovery pain and that 's where he would potentially be amending stuff that is material but that he does have to consult on that there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to go if he wishes to amend his recovery plan as opposed to correct his recovery plan just one other point to notice that there is a review of the loop in about a year 's time so much 2015 so some of these issues may be a dish through minor amendments they may be counsel may be able to do them as a minor amendment through the normal are made process or there may be things which the minister could change in the interim or they could be picked up through the review of the loop so I 'll move the motion do I have a seconder for it clean lovingston I 'm not counselor mangy sorry i just said i wasn 't counselor mange i just got written up as counsel me ND so is there any debate Yanni um thank you I appreciate that we 're just receiving this information this report for information and there 's no decisions being ourselves us today other than simply to receive it and if week we 're basically being told what governments done to our city and I don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said it 's already been gazetted it 's already been done to us and is really very little that we can change at the stage I do think what 's really important though is transparency around the process is going forward and I think you know the difference between us and government government do things in secret we do things in public and that is having a huge that is causing stress on our communities who do not simply understand what government are doing and how they 're making decisions because of the lack of transparency that exists so when you talk to people in the a van hit area around the you know increased industrialization out by the airport when you talk to people around some of these areas where huge intensification as housing is going to occur and the reality is that government have actually made many of these decisions without any public process so you know I 'm really concerned about the loop I 've had concerns from day one I did my bit of compromising so that the council could support it I 've learned my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the agreements we had with government and my view have been undermined the fact that they 've removed things like assessment criteria I think makes a mockery of the idea that somehow this is designed lead the reason that you would remove a sort of assessment criteria is to get away from design lead and think ironically and one of the reports we 've got on the agenda today actually around the meadow fields if you look at the best practice what I think is quite a stunning proposal around this practice of building neighborhoods and communities you have a mix of housing typology no more than three houses in a row in areas where you 've got a number of units and just think back to some of the housing New Zealand days of the parts we 've got entire neighborhoods that have the same type of character and housing stock that you know don 't certainly look very attractive but certainly create a huge area that looks all the same or monotonous why on earth would you take that rule out of the land use recovery plan to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovery I cannot understand that other than to say that seems pretty clear to me that the barriers that the government saw around having more Design Lead approach having a more community minded approach in terms of enabling us to discuss things with our community have been removed whether it 's the elderly person 's housing or the intensification or the wider maps that have been put in after we 'd already had an agreement to have bigger than what we accepted maps originally so you know I 'm really not happy about this I do think it 's a it 's a sad day for our city again things are being done to us democracy has been taken away people 's right to be involved in the future of their communities and of that city is being removed and I think it 's a really sad day for Christchurch but we have to accept this information and again the order and council needs to be released we need to be able to tell our community what the parameters are of the order in council I do not believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire city and in fact I believe that that was just something to scare us in fact they would have been judicially reviewed it would have been challenged all the way to the Supreme Court if they 'd tried to do something so outrageous the community would not have tolerated it and I think you know that we should not think that they 've done us a favor by you know not doing that because they would never have been able to do up in my view and Phil Clearwater i 'm basically support the recommendations i 'm just going to flag though an amendment and it 's us that i think a lot of concern has been expressed about councillors not having up to date information as this has progressed it just seems to me that and we 're clear now on who is involved with us an internal steering group and that 's mainly at management level and if some governance was part of that so certainly sitting alongside there so the fact if we have and it 's not I don 't think anyone committee a group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sure in fact the things that journey has concerns about an a lot of counselors have expressed concerns about so in fact we we get some traction on this rather than kind of let accepting it only as Jonnie has indicated so I 'm under splitting live in a minute well I mean I 'd be more than happy to incorporation amendment and to the unto the resolution with with the second to be happy with that so and at peps at the end can you can you go down at a new six point one point seven and put agree that a what a working group of counselors work with the council steering group what to to oversee the yeah to oversee the implementation madam chair just one thing I think to manage the implementation is our logo for 40 and yes but okay yeah exactly you know Anthony it 's just brings me to my slight uncomfortableness with us if you want to fellate you a bit of word I wasn 't bald stuff something up you find a way to mix government to manage with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and management coming at loggerheads and it does not does not lead to them to a better outcome I do think that that we need to be overseen as better and I so I don 't agree with you what you 're saying but perhaps just how we 're going about it I wonder if perhaps it 's a reporting process or something three days straight and planning yeah or even to all councillors because I actually think that this or a reporting process for the cheapest is happy the whole but a small a small number group of counselors you know I mean I just think it 's about building trust so agree with you I won 't like I quite like this idea it doesn 't interfere with the work of the council but it does provide a direct link point and I think gives people comfort both ways so I think announcers on steering group layer steering group is inherently a management management lead approach to well I don 't mind what the name of it is that um can I just comment that in fact it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ library to work with it 's a working group it 's a working group I said okay it sees a working group to work with the council steering group as long as you also can also comment that is all of a sudden we 're not you not having counselors on the management 's dear there was no knowledge in there and no and there isn 't the wedding isn 't that way can I just comment that unfortunate current committees in tune in terms of that the way air community see us are not cutting the mustard I 'm really suggesting there needs to be an overarching group to governance level to actually be involved with this whole issue rather than just receiving reports from time to time yeah I suit in the eye I don 't disagree with what you 're saying but I think it 's just about how you we need to be very very careful about how we go achieving that because we don 't want to undo good work yeah the this is you you can think this this can work with the steering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this flow there are lots of minor activities in the organization yeah that we could work with it certainly happening to work with a small steering group of council be useful if we could nominate who they were now so we could rather have any attention report back but I see this is basically being a sort of a touch point with a small group of councillors to keep a higher level of awareness of what 's happening and to and to get some some guidance weather weather issues that arise every busy so it looks like the people that you 've got on the air from straight caring community housing hey so I mean pet pets I mean you could either I honestly one originally the committee chief yeah you take the committee chairs of each of those committees so it 's Jamie golf Yanni johansson Phil Clearwater riffle so is it I 'm Aang clean living stone that 's the for relevant so just yeah suing group of community board chairs and I actually slightly to one side and sorry I 'm getting off track but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but later on to just to flag people just community board oh sorry can our committee chairs are you having a meeting in this might Morphin to there yes yeah I 've got a few ideas where they raise it like alright so I 'll so that narrow put the whole motion because we 've accepted that as part of the actual motion so i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried so I think that we 'll have a quick 10 minute break for morning tea and if people could be back here at its 1039 if they could be back here at 10 to 11,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Report,X30hUun2oeA,20140402,624.749,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1385,report and I 'll hand over to Jane Thank You cancels i 'll just take it as read and take any questions I don 't have anything to add the works for it man here read Benji I 'm just looking in here at the art gallery it says key dates here is now buh-buh-buh-buh base isolation completion jus late 2015 an overall project completed late 2016 early 2017 I was under the impression that was going to be completed late 2015 says that a change in plan and you asked that question last time as I did and I thought we had confirmed it was late and it came back confirmed it was late to 215 so this is a mistake on my part it hasn 't been corrected okay thank you ayana Johansson yeah I 'm puzzled by the town hall where you say report to Council on cost sharing options expected worse 2014 we 've already made that decision what what are you bringing back to us with made that decision I think twice now as a council that 's it yeah sorry it 's on page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vigilance at that 's right but the Tinder 's going out in May so it 's going up before we I mean I don 't quite follow that why the two nite no no sorry the year so so that people will come up with proposals and that case to come to counsel to get sign off okay it 's a way to bigger amount for it to be a delegated decision it comes to counsel for the decision we sign off on the project yeah but what what 's it got to do at the cost year well it 's part of the Performing Arts precinct which is subject to the kashi arrow Green no we sit we cigarette it 's two different things we might have the cost year agreement doesn 't you said yes it does oh ok believe it 's let 's have a debate about that at a time and then can I just ask in regards to the public realm I know but Anna Eastern North frames and also in the South realm there 's no mention of where council would have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage construction convincing so what page on page 127 um so I don 't have any understanding from weird count so I know Sarah are leading in some of this area but whether we have any chance to you know like that even remember for example whether we 'll actually have a chance to understand what the plans are before they 're made we seem to have stage as being done time by time and we don 't get any chance to have a say as a city that we 're inheriting the operational costs we 've got communities that want to engage and they can 't we can 't get copies of plans we 're simply told so I just want to understand is there any process by which we as a council will have any important to all the public realm space that 's being developed by Sarah this is the issue which has been raised with Syria and the minister about having some joint governance on these projects so we 're awaiting some more conversations on that to address the issues that you reason um and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in regards to the lincoln road headington traffic plan Lincoln Road corridor study the corridor study aims to develop on term options for the efficiency of the corridor as a call public transport wrote it I 'm not is that is that the resolution that was from three years ago is that giving a fit to that or is it is it something different because it just seems like again near the end of the year next year is kind of too late because developments happening now so is there any way to fast track that I 'm really concerned to see for example that developers are knocking over car parking buildings when there 's a chronic shortage of car parking and I kind of wonder how they 're getting consent for development you know when there 's a chronic need for car parking and they 're able to knock over car parking buildings and build new office buildings I 'll come back to you on that one yeah so I guess that 's really is anything we can do in the show to him to have a strategic look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ library in the service center when the initial site selection investigation completed for this facility when will it be yes follow up on that one so when the answer well I 've consultation and presented to the local community for a report will come to counsel I still have to advise exactly queen another one is my particular concern some other facility has been a proof in either the three year plan of any plan some of the n-type Hoefler project completion do Tate however summerlin didn 't have the completion er are to date what 's the rationale I 'd have to go back and look at exactly what the plans say but we haven 't changed anything from what 's in the annual plan or the three-year plan yeah because why I particular concern if council have particular kind of either strategic plan or have a summer project bacterial process we need all to go to these the criterion passes you know in a consistent way rather there may be some specific party of follow these criteria or crosses but some other projects is not a follower is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the options are coming to council soon I mean since the initial site selection investigation has been completed and that it is being reviewed to go to counsel to delete the projects and uses which could be reasonably and beneficially located on or abutting Denton park with the what Southwest as a Paul still on the new project max so yeah the problems this party my understanding has been taken it away peg to loose a temper 2012 up to now has been 19 month more than one year so a monster so just a cider selection is to slowly I can 't take it we will get back to you as soon as we can okay this weather or location is in the original Centennial is simple even I will come back and confirm last a while please turn to the page 136 the community facility available for use all these are found facility lanista how do we together this information where the source of these the information comes from oh and this came from canceled from our own information but we know traveling this is now the council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the community here that 's all flame already okay thank you yeah okay to two small things one thank you so much water list of the community facilities that are available for hire because it 's incredibly helpful and has been all really been pretty helpful to a number of groups and one small thing we have our policy now that we 're events are running we don 't dig the road up side there event and over the weekend the film 48 hour film festival is running and we are digging at lincoln road and so just good chance it 's not being resolved this morning it will come to you this afternoon Jay we just need to delay the digging of a rigging of lincoln road on friday night and sunday night by a couple of hours to enable it

Ian lockheed 's recent perspective on the majestic in the press which are on the twenty-fourth of februari which outline our case very well and again with the public know about the cause we were then made aware of a letter from Rob Hall of Historic Places Trust to Sarah in support of the retention of the majestic which we were very encouraged by and in response to that letter we sent a request to the Christchurch City Council team leader of the Heritage response team asking for a letter in support of the retention of the majestic to Sarah however at that stage we were made aware of the decision by work Isaac 's to issue a section 38 on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in serious jeopardy so in to that we staged our first March twentieth the mayor and councils were invited and we were very encouraged and grateful for our counselor Johansson 's expressing expressions of support and strong views to the media and then recently we staged our second protest rally on March the 29th the key difference of this was our own veiling of our nine metre long heritage banner showing the over 235 heritage buildings that have been demolished since the earthquake so we paraded this from our exhibition and sharp seven of cathedral junction to the majestic corner and our key speakers were dr. Ian Lockheed and emeritus professor Chris kisling who explained the viability of managing the road situation around the majestic thank you me and it 's a little long to drag out this morning here folks but here 's our nine metre rolled up role of heritage demolition and hopefully perhaps at some good morning tea it could be I 'm available for your viewing out on the floor I 'd like to go back to a couple of points that Greg 's just referred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the issuing of the section 38 clearly the issuing of this section 38 s by Sierra ccdu is the big not the elephant in the room but the the large weight that hangs over us and of heritage buildings and the whole question as to the the use of the season 38 is one that we feel needs serious scrutiny and we hope that that can ensue in the very near future sir point see what the City Council has done since they our deputation you 'll forgive me for writing this we are aware that actions undertaken include a meeting by Mayor gazelle and councillor Johansson with work Isaac 's with an undertaking by him to provide more information and then I interrupt and just say there doesn 't create it isn 't no so the whole of the council met with Warrick Isaacs as part of a briefing and relation to a number of measures where the majestic was one of the items that we raised with him where he undertook that he would get an engineering advice before making the decision so he did not at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so when you say provide okay that isn 't correct what he undertook to do was to obtain an engineering advice before making the decision thank you but not necessarily to provide it to the council all right thank you my apologies for getting that inquiry point d majestic group huge is the city council 21 reaffirm its commitment to seeking the retention and restoration of the majestic theater building for the benefit of Christchurch in Canterbury to to seek an undertaking by Sarah to order an immediate health to preparations to demolish the building which have already begun the preparations have already begun three to seek a formal meeting of the mayor and city councillors with the crce and the ccd you director to find a solution to the retention of the majestic theatre building and for most importantly I think the Sikh series cooperation to find an acceptable curved treatment of a widened Manchester Street in the area of the majestic theatre which will satisfy roading requirements but also enable the full retention of the of the building so we would like to thank you for the opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comments any questions Danny I find it really odd that um Sarah won 't meet with you to discuss it have you have you been given any reason why they simply will not engage and do you think council should be asking given that government way public these decisions whether we should be asking to have normal democratic decision-making over here to listed heritage buildings returned to us immediately well certainly I would I 'm sure we would support that council you 're handsome as to the reasons that Syria has for not meeting with us there are no reasons given I 'm sure they 're healthy reasons but they 're not ones that they prepared to to make clear to us and we find that that you know very frustrating obviously because we feel that we speaking face to face as people who have been very very involved with with heritage end with this building in particular we have a contribution to make which who knows may actually offer a solution Phil be able to thank you I 'm just your your point for about an acceptable curve treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of going straight that that street would have ever been or a curve could have been just going to be any that be incorporating the play and some years old in years of time and councillor Clearwater professor Chris kiessling at how second rarely spoke at some length about past and pointed out that you know not only can then relieve the the possible monotony of straight straight line roads but it can actually act as a traffic calming measures eight how much has been spent over the decades in Street charming dishes with protrusions of corners and curb interrupters and so on and the suburbs I don 't such a measure couldn 't work effectively on mentees the street so yes thank you yeah Paul encoder how much of the roading are they wanting Oh kensico today they wish to they wish to wine it by nine meters now at nine meters to the east which would chop off nine meters of the majestic and render it useless and that 's on top of a we pasted out the other day that the road at the moment is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pro and I don 't know if you 've seen in the accessible City plan but there is a sort of a generic cross-section pretty sure it 's got two buses down the middle some Cypress e-type things that next and then capital Karen either side as if it 's a possibly of parking a suggestion made an all seriously seriousness by someone recently was why not just have buses there and pedestrians and the road would not need to be widened much all right well that some comes to the end of the time I 'll sorry yet there comes the end of the time for the deputation so thank you very much for presenting to us and thank you whether we can move these resolutions um this is what happened that night when I 'm happy to move for what Watson here basically three of them basically are things that we 've already resolved as a council and we just basically reaffirming and the fourth one is a kind of new one around the road treatment which personally seems to be a sensible way forward if we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be in my view look I brother okay can we take some advice on this over morning tea and come back to it yep thank you I 'd liked it to our move to item,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

they evacuate to Nikki with her terrified sick and autistic son somehow got him and his medications in the car and left alia an Afghan refugee remembers I thought we are near the beach and New Brighton and I wanted to save my children from the water I thought there may be another is crate that came from the sea she and her family another Afghan refugees spent the whole day in the kashmir Hill without information or help Karen also fled through his open streets there were just people driving everywhere it was pitch black and some of the people had forgotten to put their headlights on so you were driving into the darkness and cars would suddenly be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to with the roads covered the nick perfection and full of potholes fleeing was dangerous but perhaps not as dangerous as saying some people found their cars stuck by falling walls or gems in the garage where could they find information about the risk of a tsunami when it comes to tsunami education knowledge and good information are the antidotes to fear and flights especially for potentially vulnerable populations such as such as refugees and the sick and elderly lots of all of us blase as octogenarian Helen who thought the earth plates were like living through the London Blitz and said if your numbers up the next I think we want to cover is Community Services we interviewed many women who were at the forefront of a student volunteer army the farming army and numerous Abbott initiatives for example Jane retro rahnee aura earthquake Express had access to a helicopter a pilot and wanted to fight fly and food she had some official snags my fears call on Thursday morning after peppery earthquake was to the chief a distance officer of Civil Defence about using a helicopter to carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it that civil defense doesn 't officially support us and he wished us good luck that day hot rainy or a fish and chips were being dropped in my nanny park Laura also under the street to working with the city councilors show me that there are rules and regulation you never dream they 'll be on your side but they 're more on the side of what the black and white paperwork says it was incredibly fuss and unsupportive women talked about networking with others to provide assistance or how they received help of course many spoke of both like nippy who signed up for some cross support eventually the army arrived and asked if they could help her she asked them to fix her front door so it would close properly the Kiwi boys couldn 't fix it the guys from the Philippines had had it fixed in about five minutes the local church was offering breakfast and lunch and me and my neighbors popped over there for coffee sometimes but nope he was also active in helping out other members of the elderly neighbors she knocked down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come over she also helped the old boy around the corner and another neighbor and her 90s the water was delivered to the local church but who was to get it from the church to the elderly good neighbors who else there was significant unevenness for participants and accessing and receiving information helped end or assistance we 've been doing it in a bucket we use the shed we cut out of a plastic picnic chair and had the bucket inside and inside that was a plastic bag other streets had got portaloos at this stage there were no quarter moves in our street at all we kept bringing up to ask when we were going to get a portaloo and then we thought we 'd drive around and see if other streets yes we saw that every house in some streets had a portaloo and then we realized we were going to be the last on the list women were at the forefront of both delivering and receiving help with our neighborhoods or on a larger scale with a carving roast meals at the back of the ute or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and old were there in numbers the next topic to be discussed is a crucial one housing our project found that people from all walks of life and all over the city have had housing issues since the quake whether they 're renting owning their own home in a retirement village like NCW in grace colander or inner Council in Council or state housing after being engulfed by liquefaction in her woolston rental Gina and her family went to stay with her mother in Bromley on 22nd februari the family moved into her mother 's garage she went back a week later when the flooding had receded in her street my landlord was there and he said right you need to sign this and get your bond back then he started cleaning the house out and I said hey it 's my stuff I 'm still living here the next day I was on the phone to the tenancy tribunal people on the third of March are afoot the returns have found finds my house absolutely empty gina has still not received her bond money and noticed a few weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been real it d Turner who 's over 80 was in council housing in sumner when the flats were red stickered she went into a sort of limbo eventually I was offered an upstairs flat and papanui at first I was lonely and felt like an eagle and an eagle 's nest but now I 'm grateful to be warm and safe I can much better off than families in New Brighton who were still living in cold then horrible conditions Emily lives with her granddaughter in housing New Zealand accommodation near why noni pop the whole area is owned by housing New Zealand and they have started pulling down houses all over here those two those two storied ones are going and the ones across the street are going but they haven 't told us what 's happening to us you 'd know he 's been around for the last two years actually Caroline owns her own home in New Brighton it 's a skyline cottage that she built on back section she 's experienced liquor faction flooding creeturs of water in her garden damage to her home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negotiations with Fletcher 's eqr and her insurance company I feel like I 've been trapped here I don 't want to live here I just want to get on with other things I am very very angry about places being run especially for delays and the lack of professionalism most of the participants in the study had stories to tell of economic loss loss of community sadness loneliness and long long waits for repairs rebuilds or payouts common themes included black mold living in one room as others were uninhabitable poor quality housing but also of the kindness of strangers and those who are close to them the final area we 've chosen to outline today is the crucial one of water can 't live weather can 't live without her these are our main themes for the many stories we were told about water many people in the eastern suburbs lost water for long periods of time and had to make do as best they could several clever people turned off these cylinders and drained the water into the bath others relied on delivered water like Murray rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of rocking horse road with a water tanker every day at twelve o 'clock he was a typical Kiwi bloke and he was marvelous he was kind of our lifeline with this lovely fresh water every day Helen King aged 92 had both power and water and had visits from her son 's mother in law and me for showers they took a lot of water away because I had no trouble with water another neighbor came with her children they lived in another area and she gave her two boys and they had showers two of our participants had access to water whippin artesian source and doesn 't have to stand in line for water tankers for Michelle a new brighton resident that took 10 days for a man to stop by the truck at the end of the driveway he had a van full of water and asked her that they needed any she said that they did and asked why he had not been there before he said the street did not look or so there was any damage it was so good to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son he was wrecked we heard many stories of too much water many of the woman like earlier could not get home absolutely peppery quake because the street where I live was just filled with water several residents and prior boy were inundated after September earthquake as the tomb liquefaction first entered the vocabulary of Christchurch residents the next thing the water started coming through the floor the concrete floor so we were running around like idiots trying to lift everything up off the floor and the next thing that was up to our ankles that 's all we have time to tell you today that just scratches the surface of some of these stories and some of the links that can be made between them are stories of more than 100 Christchurch women 's experience of the quakes will live on via web sites particularly the UC seismic website audio recordings videos photographs and hopefully in a legacy of policy improvements in disaster management our reports cover a much wider range of issues than we 've been able to look at today they include woman 's hopes for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long waits infrastructure problems and so on perhaps in the Sten of democratic politics we can leave you with the words of an era muy resident Emily who said I won 't vote for somebody that doesn 't even know you 're here they won 't even come in their cars to see you see how your houses are all see how your street is or even bother to go to the schools to see how the schools are coping I 'm only interested and people that actually come here to conclude we would like to thank you for your grant it made possible a very first work on this project thank you for your time your attention and we wish you well in your and our continued struggles to rebuild the city thank you thank you very much from who from I said I 'll declare my interest to my photograph is there at the bottom of the picture so I was one of the ones interviewed and actually I know some of the name I know some of the women that that you 've interviewed obviously and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar with them representing the east at the time but I kind of wanted to to try and tease out why it is important to have this information or that the woman 's stories because for me there was a moment where I open the paper and had all of the leaders speaking about the recovery of Christchurch and they will all mean you know it was just on this particular occasion it was that there were there was not one single woman 's voice so I want what I want to tease out is why is it important to have women 's voices you know when those who you know a leaders and I certainly can represent why is it important that woman 's voice has come through as well what is it about these stories that the heck differentiate the experience of others and their contribution to what we need to learn and understand from so that we can actually do a better job in the future most of the people you 'd have before this committee are men they 're people who are developers are people doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sky and they have their own experiences they were often the people who went round looking for the families after the earthquakes who had to negotiate the roads to get their kids to schools and all sorts of areas of the city you know women had different experiences a certain evil literature on disaster management emphasizes the different experiences that women had two men and of course we 've had the opportunity now to document some of those differences some of them are exactly the same you know but but there 's a different there 's a different focus in many areas we do have women in our Annie who were involved in putting people out from our various buildings after the earthquake we were involved everywhere but but one particular domain they 're involved in was the home the family for children and those things that they tend to take responsibility for and as you can tell they 've got some great stories to tell so that 's another really good reason I think the other thing that is quite unique about our stories when you read the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are in positions of decision-making who were working with dogs to try and find people in liq buildings after the quake people who are heritage expand responsible for our looking after our tonga or treasures in the city they all have their personal stories as well and it 's not often you can go to one place where you can find the stories of people 's involvement in their community their attempts to contribute whether it 's the level of their elderly 90 year old neighbor getting water for them in the period after the quake or whether it is actually making crucial decisions or getting large amounts of food from rainy aura into new brighton wine ' owning they all have an and in half of those stories as well but they 're often less prepared to tell them and it 's very important for our thinking about the quake to have an understanding of the big things the community things for connection things and what got done in that period of immediate response but it 's also important to know the people who did it as people and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community and neighborhood lives their family lives and other aspects of their life you can read that if you go to our stories yeah I 'm Ellie thank you very much i say that took me back to listening to under milk wood by Dylan Thomas and I wonder whether you might be doing something audio wise Rio with those stories he 's going to be lovely to listen to and I had to declare to I 've worked with the College of Madras the last 12 years and i have to say that i think what the midwives did with women both pregnant and newborns over those immediate days was quite sensational and you know they didn 't skip a beat when i came to the care of women but I 'm word to from several people working with work people still struggling with the aftermath primarily you see and insurance issues and in fact there 's news today that the number of children who are still dealing with us and seeking support and psychological help is growing I wonder whether you know many women who are still managing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies and the conversations you had with women and it dope you 're actually factories did you see an indication that it is the woman perhaps in a relationship who is picking up that stressful part of the aftermath it 's not a competition but you know men are working men and perhaps more involved in the development and on the ground rebuild staff was that something that came through a dead how does that benefit the family unit and the relationship that some they have with the apartment in terms of answering their remember we 've spoken only to women there 's there 's there are other oral history projects which talk to men as well and some of those look at some of the emotional impacts on men and what they do to keep their families going but we 've interviewed a whole series that when particularly women women who are on benefits women who are on the lowest incomes in the city are often women who are the sole people so adults in their households so they have assumed a huge amount of responsibility over this period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I think you would find in our stories and we hope that we 'll be able to show this from we put together our overall report and do some more detailed analysis that the things that the City Council and other agencies do in terms of community building in terms of neighborhood support in terms of community development are absolutely crucial as well because we have stories of the woman who were the most heavily pressed with respect to responsibilities in their family who would mention in very positive terms actions of social workers people involved in NGOs you know various organizations have been absolutely crucial for seeing them through the very worst times but there are also situations where there are women living in totally inadequate housing and find it very difficult to find anything else there are women who are attempting desperately to maintain their pay work and beyond working for families rather than go back on the benefit and they 're doing that under extraordinarily physically difficult conditions in terms of care of their children and those children are often in the parts of the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schooling has been most disrupted and least facilities available to in terms of activities and that can be part of their development of people in this city thank you I 'm afraid that 's the 20 minutes so look I really appreciate the time that you put on to us that if it that you 've undertaken end the presentation that you 've made today I think it 's been very compelling and we appreciate you know the really the opportunity you 've given us to see you know what what a grant has actually been an investment and an incredible resource that will go on producing I think a lot of quality information as we learn what that were what the lessons are from the experience that we 've had an order that we can prepare others in the future for similar experiences but also share that knowledge with the world so thank you very very very much thank you for your time thank you so could i am call on Ross gray,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

recommendation I do I have a seconder for it and Paul lonsdale um we got stuff yep thanks Alan are there any questions of stuff that people would like to ask Andrew then cookie the committee meeting and there was some conversation about the likelihood of legal challenge and we talked about a number of options we talked about the option that 's in the committee recommendation which extends out to the suburban areas and town centres we talked about the staff recommendation which was the central city core and Central City mixed use areas and there was also some conversation about the about the central city core only can we just get some comment from staff please on the likelihood of legal legal challenge and the rationale for looking at in the staff recommendation the central city core plus the mixed use areas well we did consult with moh basically sent the draft policy truly my wage and ask for the earth I 'm opinion on whether they felt was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it would pass and we did seek legal advice and the comment was that given that we have to go out for wide community consultation on this draft policy the assumption is it that would certainly minimize the risk to a legal challenge yeah because you know you would have a policy which reflected the community okay just in terms of the sensitive sides inland for example the central city or affecting where else but particularly in relation to the simple city because there 's so little developed and Mia yet and there are for example at least one new school to go in there one new child care center and probably a number of other sensitive sites does any rule that we create if there is a shop fear and then the skald establishes how does it work in relation to that yes we 've RC my way to clarify that particular issue um obviously the current retailers at the on interim licenses and this policy suggest you have a clause which exempts interim licenses you know from the policy from applying to anyone with an interim license @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ax fall regulate the full license because that 's about when Ministry of Health expect to have the regulations in place so at that point they will have to apply for full licenses now that license could be for three years but it could be for five years and obviously at that point that 's when the trigger of this of this local policy if it was adopted would come into play so unless there was a sensitive site within the hundred meter buffer zone as we 're suggesting when that full application for a license is made they could remain where they were now that issue becomes what if someone comes in after you know in three years later or five years later they go for the fall they go to you know get another license or to renew their license what what is the position earlier and that 's the point that we have asked Ministry of helps to clarify for us what could that what was it mean I mean our assumption as I said existing you saw would take precedence but we want we have asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the central city if we limit it to the central city say there are playing new schools and planned new preschool centers for the central city they may not be well they won 't be completed by 2015 right if the site is known then do they count as a sensitive site yes sorry I don 't know the answer to that when I would have to get cheek with moh around years those sorts of details I think they 're still working through some of those things with these regulations that they 've got my be as I suspect not in the way that that we have drafted the policy at the moment it is maybe something that could could be something that comes up through submissions and the council decided to amend the policy at that the next stage we are if we end up going with just the central city and so little of it has developed it will become a serious issue I mean we know there are these things growing in here there are presumably new mental health facilities and all sorts of things going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would we allow something to go in an area we are establishing a sensitive site yeah yeah I mean so to tilt two off two options either we go back and we do some further work on the policy to address that issue and bring it back through to the council or the other watch the other option sized is to come put out the policy end yeah yeah and you know if you kind of got a kind of hope that it comes up in submissions to a leg give you the open the door for you to change the policy at the next stage but obviously does have to be reviewed every five years no I don 't think no I get it when we good at West nation illegal here but I don 't think it does but I think we wouldn 't need a submission to open the door Jimmy two questions first one a moment layer have the eight retail premises operating under the intranet licenses to in the central city the restart and also in the south ctsh but the other six are square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the residence complain you know the structure have any the difference on a number have any difference I 'm sorry I mean that because a moment a to retail shop around in the this candle in order to sell is kinda party pues si to whether have any information regarding to the complaint of every complaint area campaign how many complain how about what kind of country in the campaign and also have any difference between central city and suburban center well like is the complaints that we all the comments that we received when we were doing you know some early consultation was largely focused around the suburban Europe the suburban retail outlets rather than the central city retail outlets and in particular where those retail outlets were located anywhere near a school or a mental health facility and I don 't know if you 're aware but there was a street protest held around one of the locations probably late last year I think I think there was a representation later displayed in his community borders as well that I don 't know with it well at one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm so check out so it 's taking questioning now that that was certainly a very strong silent protest on Lincoln Road the question do oh yes i am sorry near the second question sent to me yeah second question sir is the location no these the sack active policy has been a thought in the central city area by a moment they have a sixth retail shop running their business around the suburban center whether they are editable to use the existing right the ones there in the suburban areas if we appoint bring a simple to be any policy today that have existing newswise and well no they won 't once they apply for full week if the full license while while the interim license regime is in place to about 30 2015 yes because the policy that we 're suggesting exempts interim licenses to allow our people time to adapt or respond depending on how it goes but no once they applied for the full license the local alcohol policy comes into force well I don 't prove to try that 's policy sorry yo help Phil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that your work on the slope I just wanted to clarify that following the report to strategy and planning committee just what your the staffs original recommendation had been in my understanding was that that would have been and that this is this is an option clearly for us as council today to that your recommendation was what 's on the map within that sort of green he colored area so it would include the central city mixed you used so was that the area which you included in your original staff recommendation yes it was the central city core in Central City mixed business which is effectively with the area within the for evidence right and you 've got that in one of it the Mets and puzzles yes oh thank you that clarifies it and so the the what the strategy and planning committee will recommend them is it include the district centres and that they 're the areas marked and purple area map so for example it would include areas like Eddington and he 'll water and then record it great thank you for clarifying that dude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avenues area if these have to be a certain distance apart is how many at worst could you fit in the central city well I mean we did sort of that 's why we sort of did the maps in a way was to look at how realistic the policy was end engine oil on a good day you could fit another you could fit eight in there certainly a 50 meter apart certainly you can fill Asia even with the 100 meter buffer zone around sensitive site it 's still possible to fit eight within it central city core area quiz yes of the investee without taking into account what buildings owned in those spaces and whether there are retail premises in those little words of the questions to purely on a space-available known sensitive sites and treat them as though they are sensitive sites account the county for the name specific sensitive sites of it will push to do something the policy gallantly injury so I 'd like to move an amendment I provided some wording already and that in fact addresses the question or the point that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay is there a seconder for that Phil Clearwater the effect of this would be to go back to the original staff recommendation so central city core and City mixed use zones only and would exclude the suburbs in town centres yeah so now we 're going to debate the amendment all right so David east and then poor lonsdale oh sorry oh yeah okay it 's more procedural one then look obviously yeah heavy with us in our Andrew spoke well my English but it 's a heavy for it we put I just wonder from a procedural to the point of view what it make more sense for it to be a foreshadowed motion that you would effectively if you voted against the committee recommendation and this will be the next I 'm in your hands vibe I think that I think councils I mean the sense that i 'm getting is that people would rather boat this up or down and if that 's the case I mean then they can go back to the original resolution rather than drop it out and then have people really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an amendment David east and the importance tell I think you met a mirror originally I did support this this notion but I went with the motion that is on the books at the moment their substantive motion and my reasoning for doing that was that I thought that really two things one concentrating all your outlets in the central city was going to create a huge problem in terms of just focusing everything there I mean we 've got other issues in the city and we tend to try and concentrate them you know prostitutions all in the city and we 're getting other at least desirable activities and no one wants them and the suburbs let 's put them in the city so I also was encouraged by the discussion we had the other day that if we are clear enough with our sensitive areas we effectively rule out most of the suburban district centres most of them are pretty small you 've only got to have a school a church a kindergarten or some other activity that is wrong a sensitive activity and in fact I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away where we to adopt a policy that had the sensitive areas so I 'm in favor of the original motion and I think of anything we need to be more proactive in defining what we call a sensitive area and really sort of nailing down where these areas can establish so I will be voting against this amendment and going to the original motion that the strategy and planning committee passed the other day Paul just like to say that the central city as we know has been extremely bad again as we 're trying to rebuild this thing we are wanting 30,000 people residents living on the central city residents our suburban people they they will treat this as a suburban area with a city core attached to it much like record has a far bigger developed area of the knee to the central city currently so I support the original amendment I think it 's important that we we do actually develop a really clear policy around the sensitive sites we have unfortunately been lumbered with this whole thing as this as the government is legalized these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by adopting this policy doesn 't mean we endorse this the substance sales it means that we 've got to try and manage it as best as we can and also concentrating in a small area and I 've seen the chain myself personally with the restart mall or seeing the change since the r18 has come in it has shrunk the outfits considerably two down to eight and there was plenty more they used to sell it so you 've seen a concentration of the problems and around these sites if you put it all in one area that problem is going to be huge and that is my concern for the sea center which is trying to get itself back on its feet with 30,000 residents in that area in the coming years we want to make sure that we provide a place that people will want to rebuild them and they want to live it notwithstanding we 've got to actually fix this problem and it is a big problem much like alcohol but as I say I ask you to support the First Amendment let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sensitive sites and as David pointed out and will eliminate currently under the sensitive sites we 've seen here three of them out of the eight and if we include a few more that we define as sensitive sites we microfiber restrict us down to a very small amount of places but these things can go Andrew thank you this is clearly a debate where there are some very differing views and certainly we 've heard from the people that came to talk to us this morning and we 've talked about protests in the community and so on and clearly it 's an area which is quite contentious and I think it 's absolutely important that we we get this right and the reason I raised this amendment today is that I want the ability for the council to the full council to take a position on this that may in fact end up being different than the committee 's position and this is all about of course what we go out in a draft policy for consultation to the community with and I think I 'm getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly from what was said in the committee that our intention is to restrict this so that it 's manageable from an enforcement and policing point of view in my view having the activity concentrated in the one place makes enforcement and policing much easier from a point of view of effects on our communities permitting this activity in low socio-economic areas areas where the commercial situation is perhaps a little bit different there are shopping areas that are perhaps in need of revitalization that this sort of activity won 't help the rents of course are cheaper in the suburban areas and the town centres than they are in the city center and my belief is that the higher rents and the the better policing and the type of development there 's going to be in the city center may in fact preclude some of this activity from my own point of view the town centres of littleton and a corolla would be included in this and I know that the communities in my ward would not be comfortable with this type of activity going on there and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar views of the activity going on in suburban centres in their ward my belief is that this is the last type of thing we need to be we need to be allowing in the suburban areas now there have been comments about the exclusion zones and of course there are considerations around whether this is likely to happen or not would such a business actually open up in a corolla and chances are it probably wouldn 't but that 's not in fact a reason for permitting it to and letting market forces run their course and I also don 't believe that we should be saying well we should allow this in in the suburban areas because there are sufficient exclusion zones that there would only be very few places where it could happen if if our communities are not comfortable with this activity in the suburban areas if we don 't believe there could be sufficient control in the suburban areas then I believe that this is our opportunity to go out with a draft policy that reflects that I 'm very concerned about the effect and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that came to talk to us of these particular substances my own motivation is to minimize that as much as possible and I think by restricting to the central city areas only that 's that 's one way we can do that very effectively and just as a point of clarification I would refer councillors to the two maps attachment 3 option 2 is the one that shows the the suburban areas which in fact are quite widespread around the city and attachment 5 option one the central city core and the areas in yellow which by their very nature particularly when you take the exclusion areas into account really quite restrictive so the reason I I put up the amendment today is purely and simply to allow us to to do the minimum that we need to do to avoid legal challenge in the face of quite a difficult situation we 've been placed in as a result of legislation I certainly wouldn 't want to see the proliferation of these stores be any anyone more widespread than they need to be Jamie I to I will extend this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debate on us we had an interesting debate on this ed at my committee last week and we obviously reached a recommendation that was the committee review motion that you see so I 'm going to speak to this as a whole because I think that makes sense they will be speaking to saying why I don 't support the amendment and while I support the committee recommendation that we we reached last week I 'm going to make this really really clear I want to reduce harm with psychoactive substances in my view they are really really insidious things it 's taking a real toll on our community so please do understand where I 'm coming from with us I wanted to reduce harm around the psychoactive substances I 've learned a few things in my baptism by fire on council and I some the hard way and one of them has been that if you want to reduce harm around something I have seens heaven time and time again and it is from experience that I 've come to this position which I 'm hoping that I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think we all want the same outcome we all do want to reduce harm around the sand city of stuff but I have found that you have two options you can concentrate something or you can water something down and watering it down is what i have found in my experience to reduce the harm so i see with something like this as we think or just plan demand and that 's not going to change you 've got eight places that can have a viable business by selling the stuff whatever the size of the area is irrelevant if you stop it and say you can 't do it in the suburban centers it 'll still probably go on you 'll just push it underground you won 't be able to have your checks and balances you won 't be able to place it it 's going to be sold effectively on the black market there because they 're not going to necessary stop but if you if you if you water it down and have it wyd those eight can either be on a pinhead or those eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is by far the better option you 're looking confused leave a quien no I 'm just saying that simple supply and demand they can go wherever they like right now and you 've got supply and demand saying that eight places will have sprouted up there are eight places that sell this right now so if you say you can operate in a small to find area you 'll put those eight into that small defined area and i believe it is far more visible and it becomes far more of a problem if you have a wider area which i think i think there are benefits around because it does water this down you have those eight spread across a far far wider area by i support going down this route because i think watering it down is by far the biz rolling because i wanted to reduce the harm around this i think the other point around this too is that a little thing called legal challenge and I hate going down this road and I 'll make a prediction with you but Hamilton have taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry it just can 't go on here in my opinion my prediction is that that 'll get quashed I think that will be challenged and I think how much are more lose and it will cost a lot of time and a lot of money you have to be reasonable about this I don 't necessary back this but the government has said it 's legal ok and then they 've given us a series of tools to try and police it so from us to be able to regulate this I think having a wider area basically says you know what not everyone actually does do all their business in the central city there are suburban areas and this recognizes that you can operate there but there are a number of checks and balances which you have to adhere to and by doing that I believe that significantly reduces the chance of successful legal challenge where is it because currently you 've got six of the eight places outside of the central city the vast majority are not actually willing to be there anyway they 're operating in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by far the better option I think watering it down is what is better for our community because it reduces the visibility of it and spreads it spreads it well out which i think is a peripheral way to go and I think that it significantly reduces the chance of a successful legal challenge so I 'm going to be voting against the amendment there because I believe it in my experience that its way in all honesty hand on heart to reduce the harm caused by this in cydia this insidious product so we voting against the own the amendment and going with my Committee 's recommendation thanks Bill well I 'm certainly strongly supporting the amendment I agree with counsel lonsdale regarding the government legislation but and unfortunately it 's clearly just what is aimed to solve the drug problem it 's totally backfired and it certainly has in many of the area of our areas but and I cannot agree though with Council lonsdale and councilor golf regarding watering down or kind of like dispersing the problem as if that 's going to dilute it quite frankly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue and and police enforcement has been referred to including it 's easier to put 2 and force a limited area than to have it count the stuff covering the whole city I 'm particularly concerned because in our report is very clear evidence from the healthy experience of the huge problem problems are synthetic cannabis causes and like in my own area and the irony is that it would be pets purple on the map where we 've got three mental health organizations hillmorton hospital and calm care we 've also got the south day the bridge center of the Salvation Army who all intervene with drug problems and right beside kaam kiya we 've got one of these shots right now selling the staff and the community development advisor in the area certainly tells me that what literally happens is adults are buying the stuff he is over 18 taken to their cars and they 're giving it to their kids now we do not want that happening in their sub groups along site on lincoln road too we 're not far from it we 've got hagley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housing and in the area and and we 've got an early childhood childhood center so I just think that and there was a very strong silent protest in Eddington and there 's no way that I 'm going to go back to the people who elected me and say look it 's okay to trial or stuff or or set up shops in our area so I 'm certainly strongly supporting the amendment clean it 's clean and then gratitude thank you i wish to support this all right by jumping yeah no no no you have a good time right I wish to support this amendment we 've hit a lot today about community and we kind of still we 're going to continue hearing a lot about today in community today and how we threw our decisions can help to build up our communities which need building up is 50 at this time I think about you brighten I think about what it in fact actually is a playground in my view where I 've seen little children play outside the store in the mall that place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central location we all know where it is in my view it is undermining our sense of community the very thing which we are endeavouring to build in a barely hit part of the city lose our uthan and if anyone can give me a an hour and answer to how do these stores add value to building up our communities you will have won me over I support this amendment that these stores are better able to be managed in the CBD and I 'm actually quite confident and going out with this position yes all right I don 't support this amendment and again life don 't assess I mean these are filthy products but unfortunately the government has legalized them there 's not a lot we can do about that the problem with the supporters of this is their logic is flawed because if you think that putting a couple of shops into into the central is going to solve the problem it isn 't it would be a little bit like saying there 's only going to be two pubs in the whole of Christchurch and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city to have it so if we look at the amount of harm in our community a lot of it is coming from alcohol and we have pubs and wine bars everywhere you can buy alcohol everywhere around the city now I 'm not seeing any proposals to shut that down I think as one of the deputies came in today and said I mean this is ultimately an issue of parenting it 's an office an issue of education that is the only way you 're ever going to solve these types of problems at the moment we 've got eight stores here there 's lots of regulations around where stores can go it 's very unlikely that there 's going to be a huge increase in stores around the city and I think actually we need to be focusing much more on education parental education to stop these types of things happening I mean we know that kids can get alcohol very easily under 18 it 's probably a lot harder for them to get this stuff so I think you know trying to shovel it all into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem okay Jimmy yeah I don 't want to talk but I have to you know just want to need you know yeah because of these the drafter the policy actually is respond to the government 's at the psychoactive substances actor 2013 and this actor has been commenced on a team of July last year and the main purpose we are all aware a jury is to protect the health also minimize the harm to individuals who use psychoactive product if council you know in this the special conservative procedure in the initial stage to open the space to the citywide my particular concern public to mislead miss understand for a community for the people especially puppy for almost teenagers whether they thought all council encourage rather than discourage then would lie to assist these premises to use more the party fuels more the energy pills on a purple the height etc and also I was told no in New Zealand even we have only 4.2 million dollars but addictive drugs addicted is this candle of the platypus is high percentage in worldwide the use the teenage of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the new New Zealand now we need to be aware to protect their individual health to minimize you know this time to learn in the everyone this next most most of the important here if you open the white under space you just give them the opportunity to assess because even you home the area i live in home the area for 18 years even home the area one of the shop we know my understanding a long can period the community the local MP individual strong against to set up a shop in the area but in daytime because the actor is not yet commenced canal so why we counsel need to tellus opportunity to in conjunction with the caramel actor to minimize this time to lowes the teenagers so my personal view start floor original recommend recommendation is where we were with a reasonable you know being restrict you to a central city hall and also central city mix the used area and also i ask a staff in the one question whether there 's any difference between current entry license to in central city and suburban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suburban area more complain but neighborhood in central city so this is the second on instant messaging no give us the the tragical reference so i urge you all those who like to support committee recommendation please rethink about changing your word thank you okay the issue I have with this is that these are unknown untested substances that we are allowing to be put into the young adolescent brains and I find that scary actually I don 't buy the argument at all that somehow by putting it in for the suburbs we dilute the problem if you look at the map here there are potentially 30 suburban sites that would support one of these things the fact that there are eight at the moment does not mean that the industry will be limited to eight sites because it is a very profitable industry so there are potentially 30 sites if you look at the map and then another potential eight in the central city so the choice for us is that we have eight in the central city or 38 and the city and if I have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to the central city to try to diminish the number of sites i would very happily take a test case on this and try and diminish it much further but I appreciate the amendment that is there before us I do not buy the argument that parental education will solve this problem part of these problems are design problems if you put these things in the way people will use untested untried harmful substances that they really don 't know the impact of in their particular brain particularly in an adolescent brain it 's dangerous we have a sinking lid on get on gaming machines because we recognize the social han we do have we are going to have a local alcohol policy because we recognize home we recognize that these substances create and can create perhaps differently for everyone social time we don 't know the impact of these things and therefore I want a clear policy that attempts no matter what to limit that social harm I would actually go further than the newer amendment and but i 'm fine with what 's put up there because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think we have to as a community it is not it is never true to say that just parents raise children a whole village raises the chill the children in this village and we absolutely need to be clear about what we 're doing and by way of social path to members of our community so I 'm very happy to support this amendment right well i will put the amendment all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and councillor golf and mangie with the only n david s so there 's 30 and four and paul lonsdale so the four to be recorded thank you sorry oh okay sorry sorry okay yep yep counselor team could you vote on the amendment yes can you you need to vote so the are declared the motion carried so just before you move on we 're probably then need to bring the correct statement of proposal back to the next council meeting write the statement proposing we 've got now it 's the wrong one yeah we 'll do that through the next meetings known potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the central city area Thanks okay so so that the the whole motion now can 't be caught because it would require some wording to be changed on them okay so could I have a motion to refer it to the next council meeting refer the metaphor the next council meeting where the updated policy statement or proposal will be addressed so that 's filled clear water green lovingston I just this is perfectly normal so what I can 't understand is can we not just delegate this to the acting chief exec you have to finalize the statement of proposal based on the amendment I just I just can 't say you look at the agenda today we 've got so many things on energy it 's just adding something seems crazy what is they can I just say that we 're entering into a legal process it now has to go out for public submission I don 't want to get tripped up on a legal process issue at this stage so I 'd like to trust the advice that I 'm getting from the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have moved by Councillor Clearwater seconded by Councillor Livingston that this matter be referred to the next council meeting where an amended statement of proposal will be addressed I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried the last item of business on this agenda is the committee and on this particular committee as the relation to freedom camping and","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

placeholder long because then I think Donnie email is just that it was produced same time as the meeting was actually progress so you 've been draft seat of minutes in there but wash machine is creeped in the supplementary that you got solid ages read but if you have any questions or clarification I 'm hoping to answer okay so Part A as the residential land availability in Christchurch City okay good timing right you 're on strategy and planning first one I muffin know that we 're all about fifteen ones that you wanted from 12-2 fresh okay so we 're we up so we 're in like I guess like the report okay who 's gonna SiC undercount slug off Council Minji thank you right there any any discussion on that as a question how many sections are they available on the market that have got zoning in infrastructure that that you know that are available is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff member that can assess okay no yeah its remit sees that there are three thousand nine hundred nine sections that are consented so everyone keeps saying we just need to free the previous one yeah sorry what is your full sunshine as we 're that she got a huge supply of land but what we 're not saying as houses being built which is really consuming so the whole idea behind the land use recovery plan was to rezone land and make it more available for people to redevelop we don 't actually have our existing landis currently zoned things developed for hours as a strategy planning committee board of what else they might do you know to deal with this issue but I sectional listen they don 't have anything on it sorry which which part of the reporter you looking in sections are there available to be built and so we 're referring to that sections consented page 6 10 sections consent or subject to application for subdivision in lower greenville areas 4,600 sections so it 'd be fair to say they are going to be developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wanted yeah like do we have quite I guess I 'm interested in as just quite an hour enabling more land to be resigned there 's not providing the housing that we need so comparing the sections available to the demands that we have this seems to be a huge gap let 's correct the council can 't force developers to build houses up consents and to do that that 's correct do we have a figure for how many sections are actually on the market so that so once we resign out and has consented and got the infrastructure I presume that people can you know fire them so the key thing really is how much land is being land being this is how much is actually available on the market people are able to access um through you madam chair on page 5 501 and a 4.1 there 's the figure of the year of potential sections and greenfield areas so thats been planned for greenfield residential nineteen thousand eight hundred and nineteen sections available sections that have either been consented or are subject to an application @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a perception out there that we have not zoned enough land for development now from this report it says potential sections in Greenfield areas so this is not inner city residential in terms of intensity so pure greenfield sites nearly 20,000 sections that 's kind so that 's a big number it is ok so that needs to be communicated out there because there 's an impression that we 're not saving enough land so if you want it to go and buy one today well there 's 4600 which has got consents on but that doesn 't mean that on the market no Tom 's got to build on the first but they 're consented for building so you want to just take us through that process so they 've got can sense on how long before they go a house on it I can 't really answer that I 'm sorry I mean it could be we in the development is it just depends on the developer it 's not a good business from to heaven not develop it makes no see they see if they 're shorts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay okay you neva know when to muscular building can see it doesn 't mean to say the other people yeah just say this even when they get a building consent doesn 't mean to say that song is gonna build a house straight away either that is the key thing that this report indicates there are many many sections available and before development was water please but this this has been reported many times better than an appropriate communication Council of Angie 's we do all the media for me yeah well I think this whole idea of the loop is to try and encourage more development we know there 's lots of land every people may or may not develop the loops there to try and Su stimulate the market to get more people to start building and here is it maybe they can 't count yeah i think that i think what counts the yeah your hands on saying though is that there 's a difference between enabling and the work actually being undertaken and there will still be a perception that although this land has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hands of somebody who can see a reason for land banking for a bit longer then that you know if property prices get more and more stretch then there 's no reason for them to to proceed now but I think that there there was some thought been given to whether there were other measures that could be taken to push people along as it were and not land bank is that right or well we can 't do that through the district plan no no or the city there were there were a couple of memorandums of understanding undertaken with fulton hogan and prestons that were there for the purpose of trying to get a number of sections out there within a certain amount of time one could argue how successful they were and actually jogging that along the there was in the intention at some stage by Sarah to continue that process I couldn 't tell you whether that 's continued or not I don 't think so but that 's a field of inquiry that perhaps strategy and planning poker because I think you know people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know I 'm not saying that it 's necessarily our role to meet the gap but I think that once the public have a full appreciation of what the facts are it 's much easier to see what the you know what the holdups are and in perhaps look for potential solutions yep the point that was made was that you know we 're doing developers a benefit in our citizens our benefit by rezoning rural residential or enabling them to develop in areas they couldn 't otherwise develop them that the commitment that we need to get back from them is that those developments will actually be available for the public to to buy into and we had these mo use that haven 't worked we you know I think we should be putting in place what we can so that when we resign we get a firm legal component if we need to that these sections will come on the market within a certain timeframe otherwise we 're spending a huge amount of money on infrastructure that we actually might as well just be putting into housing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost to us of providing infrastructure ahead of the demand or the uptake and these sections I think the strategy and planning picking up an item that work here like not counselor mangi did you want to add to that all yeah we 're like the i5 any directions we immediate there are ways that we can deal with it or maybe we 'll just take it on as a piece of work we do certainly looking at issues like land value tax or looking at ways of stimulating developers to actually build on these sections and who knows maybe we should actually be rezoning a lot more so that we can actually start to bring prices of sections down as well at the same time so yeah maybe we 'll we 'll have a look I think an item and work out a strategy and planning would be extremely useful so thank you for that the recommendation is that report we received an a doctored all those in favor say hi those opposed say no that 's carried item 2 is really no item tours Runa moves it move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right people to answer questions on this one very good okay um Jimmy did you have a queen no no okay okay um Yanni um oh yes yes you are just the experience I 've learned from loving earth is that it 's really bad practice to have potentially one of the parties providing the Secretariat and the administration that should actually be independent so under three point 11 I just think we should actually be signaling that that should be there needs to be an independent Secretariat if possible because it actually gives confidence to both sides that so we done feely which i think is really important in this environment so can I just ask staff if they 've considered I you know why they 've supported the car club being the Secretariat and whether they have considered that there may be other options that would be rea you volunteering to secure 25 minutes for them sure you know I 'm just I 'm just I know with the community layers and stuff around living earth it hasn 't been a good process and I just want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same issues with hid in the car yeah I think I understand where come see your handsome is coming from I think the intent or two points about this one is that the terms of reference and details are yet to actually be worked through on this so that as a point that could be raised at that then if you like the second point is that the attention could well be to rotate though that function between between the two parties one could do it for six months my group of six months but the idea of this is to put the onus back on the on the community and the car club to maintain or monitor the situation themselves with minimum cost and minimum intervention from the council to make it a community effort now who does a sit we could we could look at that as to whether the parties involved want an independent Secretariat or whether they 're quite happy to proceed along the lines of what 's written there but we could certainly raise that with them I think discussing it with them would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy that the car club meets the costs of the Secretariat services it 's not actually setting the agenda that 's what the independent chair pointed by the council does and it a slightly different function then they 're lowering youth one yeah are there any other comments on it I 'll put the motion oh sorry oh sorry did the people want to debate the motion yes yes because I was second-team counselor in also local council fully understand Lisa kinda of the e you know in the past several years if to establish these the community razon committee that 's where we deported if we compare two maybe three years ago we organized this committee public issue already has been resolved but rhinos they are not too late because weather right now these the issue have been in the stage or mid Asian appears so post-party even mean a tour they ever thought probably stablish this the committee listen where Bill are the most are effective etc and also establish this the committee the members first purpose we need to be aware actually is to establish to noise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other issue relay controller speed away so let 's the important soul is the noise management and we can address the noise issues no not only solar regulatory the process HR is too long regulatory process and also can reduce in the lowest measures to be identified so that 's very important also I would like to turn our puppy independent these chairpersons very important impartial energy but a pooper actually have a community individual affected or residence in the car crap in the race waiter must be well etc parameter council staff or maybe I recommend maybe the committee ball member no one can on behalf of the community so to make the least the kind of committee more kind of effective is my expectation so I urge all councillors and mayor fully supported this issue thank you um Yanni I I think it 's you know we 're just basically giving a pretty broad recommendation that we support the establishment of a community community liaison committee I have no problem with that I think it 's really good I know that the report back that we a report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as part of that process you can look at that and the pendant Secretariat it always sounds a good idea when they sense get set up and its really welcomed the car club you know offering to do this that the problems often don 't happen at the start they happen further on down the track and you know I just think again learning from lessons we 've had if we can just at least have the consideration of a different option I was also concerned to see that the car club would be selecting membership of the committee through advertising and local newspapers again I would say the appointments should be as independent as possible so that they maintain as much integrity and I hope that when you come back maybe just a little bit more explanation around how the processes for selecting the members enter an option for perhaps a slightly different way of doing it but I support and principal the idea that you would set up this group I think it makes a lot of sense the more people from work together to resolve the differences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think the better approach that is then the legal approach but sorry i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye there 's a post they know carried and did us now return back to item 12","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Board - Part 1,zd48_etajE4,20140327,936.15,"Christchurch, New Zealand",2154,simply an adoption and our board also had heard the most of the deputations that have been here today as well on the coastal pathway and we have recommended that the council adopts the amended coastal cafe concept plan as you doubt an attachment to of the report and also we would like to request that a list of areas we move more detailed design will be consulted on be compiled and publicly available and the one area that will be included a speech will rotate neck area arrest and end can you can you just explain that this the difference between the two positions on scott park and and why in which one of the two this supports in and why the current the current coastal pathway concept plan has the coastal pathway adjacent to the road along Scott Park the coastal event is the position that the wind sports association and the yacht club would like it to stay in so that 's in the original bets know that once a plan no that was amended there were men amendment to the original and the coastal pathway group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pack discussed and more detail and to have a highly experienced landscape architect do more work on that to try and find a solution that suits both groups so which one does the community board support what would you like to talk to that yeah we supported the plan but and we 'd like to actually recommend a slight amendment to our recommendation you have conferred with theatre other colleagues and sub that was told it endorsed the concept plan noting that the adoption of the concept plan does not preclude or constrain the ability to improve through detail design on the specific areas of reckless park and scott park that just allows for opportunities that we may not even know about yet they may come about through detailed design and I 've conferred with the the both parties were presented today and they 're happy with that amendment so but I hope you 're bored they 're looking at the pictures is hard to work out where the current concept plane is off scott park or whether it go through the middle of scott part it currently goes along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road the the point is that this is a high level concept plan with more detailed work to be done and at this stage the visitor need to get the plan adopted so that they can trigger work that can happen in other areas and there is more detailed work to be done and I think the coastal pathway group just like to make sure that one of the areas as Scott park that there 's more work to be done on right the pawls amendment probably just makes the intent of that that the more this but this doesn 't say that it moves back into the center of Scott no it doesn 't it just means it more workers to be done more with more consultation and a more detailed planning the original motion I I think we would cover it but so that the parties can be sure that there is more scapes if we support the original motion we 're supporting the community board stance and the Yacht Club stance that 's great so but but with the community board have any objection to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more okay jaani the actual board us that um that in ariat list of areas where more detail design would be consulted on will be compiled and made publicly available because this has come a cheers report there hasn 't been time for that information to come back but it was always the understanding of the community board that on certain detailed design elements on the pathway there would be further community engagement and consultation and that 's assigned you know I think this is pretty much in line with where the community board thinking was it 's just being a little bit more explicit based on the concerns that with who identify that these are two areas in particular that we do think there may be opportunities to come up with a better result so we required to come back to Council for a final decision on Scott back or do we landlords that a delegate a decision now so so what we hit the community board is that is Scott path would probably won 't in the overall concept for Scott part probably wouldn 't be built for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time to work work through there is some urgency in regards to what 's good are doing around the three the three lining of the main road so the idea that you would approve the concept so you could start to think about what synergies you might get was embraced but again um pulse and I have tried to come up with a compromise that tries to recognize that there 's potential future opportunities my understanding Paul 's talked to both the girls so you might like to just reflect on their feedback I think it would he recognizes that we 've seen a original concept plan which it caused a number of issues for the a 17 club in the Yacht Club we 've seen another design which is actually taking away some of the potential loss potential for a really understanding coastal pathway through that initial gateway there may be opportunities that we don 't know yet that through a detailed design of that park could come up with and we just don 't want to lose that opportunity by locking it down where we can 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allows through the detailed design with both parties agreeing that it 's you know now they would agree that this is a best way for look at my end up in the same spot but it may not and I think that 's we just need to recognize it when you come and do detailed designs things can change and you can find opportunities that can really make this an outstanding sort of pathway for for Christchurch okay so we 'll should we deal with the amendment first thin so that the amendments obviously or should we just know we just deal with it as a total one because we 've got councillor lonsdale council Johansson moving and seeking doing the whole motion journey through the discussion on their of one question yeah I 'm concerned Eva to Baylor we adopt at least amend amend the Costa pastor the concept design no because we received another group the summation for instant like the there 's sport pack this kind of different concept why is preferred to a long the law the other one is as possible you know lien pitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether the samhitas still have opportunity to make their summation expresses concern in a click your cursor okay I 'm totally fine with the what 's up here because it seems to me that what 's under way in the coastal pathway the key thing is getting it going this is stunning stunning yes you 're not a fantastic that the memorandum of understanding has been signed this is awesome there will always be places and slightly some differences of opinion and I think this allows for those to be sorted out without standing in the way of actually getting this coastal pathway it rolled out its sorted and really just becoming an amazing asset for the city so I 'm totally fine motion that 's before us yeah Yanni I know to the deep under employees having insurgency the concept we 're being one is a loner aborted also necessary go all around water sports which should be available in each speed marks and you would think that in special areas where there 's high activity for water sports at that result of that study our detail design as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open based on the information that we in the firefighters listen episode is time I know the community they 're being super science as a general conversation fuge support and this is the legacy project meeting one day and rock it gold brighton legacy project ideas of this morning as well and yeah you can see medical communities be able to see out of the disaster opportunity for transformation for projects that actually the city in a better place there was criticism for that seven or six years i 've been on the community board and first few years of the counselor we 've been swimming IPS waiting for an elastic wayne from the settings of the sea along the coast and that one excited to see so it 's amazing opportunity amazing to see this action actually immunity and Jean Kyra support for those areas is always covered David Thank You Metta mirror I 'm I 'm just mindful of the fact that we seem to had a degree of consultation and then start have come to this point now and we 've heard earlier that this concern that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will you can actually aquatic recreation can actually interface with the history so I personally think that we seem to have gone down that pup and come to a recommendation so I 'm having a little bit of difficulty solution I believe that we 've done the thing and I suppose the question I 'm asking now if we go down this path other the coastal pathway people and the aquatic recreation people happy to engage and further consultation or are we just re litigating something that 's already been discussed Paul just respond to David look like they are happy to work together they are actually working together there is this a slight conflict and next to the outcome all this is actually doing is allowing when they do the detailed design you know there 's a concept plan they haven 't done the detailed design basically three years before they finish this area so we just don 't want to lose opportunities that we don 't even know about yet that 's really what this is actually addressing and I think it 's important that we allow that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outcome for all of the community probably just mindful of the fact of that very cute statement that I heard earlier on we 've got a six point five kilometre pathway and this is virtually the only area that has direct access to the to the to the history itself so in my mind we have a pathways that for six point three meters kilometres over as totally available for Rick Rios for all users to traverse the walkway where we 're only talking at two or three hundred meter section at best that aquatic users can actually have a decent access to the history so from that point of view i 'm really i 'm going to vote against this motion i think i think the needs of the aquatic people for a small portion of the walkway need to be accommodated I think I mean I 've certainly had my concerns allayed in that regard because I I must have met that I was a little confused by two groups that seem to be saying something different but it didn 't quite match what the recommendation was and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd actually be voting against what the sports people want they want on set plan is a set out an attachment to is what they want what they don 't want to do is to go through a renegotiation and what I 've heard is that there isn 't a renegotiation it is the sign on the specific areas which means we don 't close down conversations based on the aquatic for the review of the users of the ester II and other information that may come to pass there may be solutions that people come up with that actually people were comfortable worth we 've heard we 've heard that people feel any innocent between the two groups so so I 'm quite comfortable with it but i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and the next item is the mainland,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

February 2014,GPn_6sgCIsI,20140327,829.0889999999999,"Christchurch, New Zealand",2328,what you might as well deal with that one quickly there only to par-tay reports and that and I think that Sarah you were going to deal with the eastern sport and Rec Center that 's right I have them as well sex pate items over to meetings he and a two-minute speech on that easton rican short okay well it 's the why don 't we get the eastern sport and Rec out of the way if you just write a boost area to nuts yep and so the heck no pyramid community ball would like to support the community committee 's recommendation to Council regarding the eastern aquatic facility the process proposed by staff to determine the location of the eastern aquatic facility was in response to a council decision to only fund one facility and a desire to involve the two eastern community boards while involving the two boards of the decision-making process would have been a nice idea it was not practicable community boards are elected and sweetie edification represented the awards alone not the city as a whole as counselors do so division and disagreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however both Ward 's have been hard hit by the earthquakes and neither have easy access to aquatic facilities the community committee 's recommendation acknowledges us once the Metro sports facility has felt there will be four fabulous and or aquatic facilities in Christchurch always learn to swim and recreational space but all will be west of Colombo street the Eagle athira me community board has long advocated for an indoor aquatic facility in the limo door woolston area it has central within the ward and has two main arterial roads fury road and then wood avenue running through it for easy access from the hill and coastal suburbs the lynnwood woolston area is generally lower socio-economic and less active and the ward has the highest percentage of households without access to a car both linwood and phillips tanner areas proposed for urban intensification and are struggling through education changes the opportunity exists to work collaboratively with the ministry of education on one or more of the aquatic facilities in the east and to look at areas as a whole and how both central and local government can integrate services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of the discussion on community facilities post-quake and christchurch has been focused on loss but we need to remember those areas that had nothing to start with and the opportunity that we have to change us and with this in mind the higley theory me community board support the community Committee 's recommendation and would like to be part of any workshop in ongoing process that the council decide on thank you that I 've just in terms of that the items the partay items there are actually only for Part A items I mean whatever them two of them come to another council meeting that 's right I have to hear from the negative seabury got flood danger and local alcohol policy yes that 's right and then the second one is the coastal pathway concept plan and the master road master plan and the comics they reserved in replacement of some surf lifesaving club public toilets know that I was to born under the Tampa Bay home I sorry so would you like to deal with the flood danger and local local yeah yeah thank you so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a recommendation that we asked council to recruit to urgently convene a flood risk symposium with to which appropriate experts are invited to speak and just two weeks later we had our excessive rainfall in flooding with in Christchurch and it seems like a really good opportunity to take advantage of us to have a much wider spread of information and sharing information with the community so they can be a part of the process as well given that there 's a given that there 's a obviously the the natural hazards chapter and everything else going on I mean sir I just wonder whether we could we could say that I mean whether we could we will whether I could move that the the council convene a flood breath symposium I mean it might be an all-hazards symposium I might actually be personally it 's been overtaken by the Brazilians and to date more community consultation and community engagement in the process of looking at flood risk has started occurring in different communities but there it involved other things as well because while there is the immediate flood risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look at some betterment and resilience building within the systems as well ok so or how about something along the lines that the council convene a symposium is just a difficult word you know convener forum rather than a week or maybe a workshop maybe we should have something but no no no we 'll have it why don 't we have a a flood forum as part of the consideration of the natural hazards chapter in the district plan review yani I think um certainly the the community board was really mindful that the international speakers that council board over after the earthquake were really really successful and it was really good to get the international context so they were kind of looking for something a little bit more than just a workshop or the same voices talking though they were really looking for something that kind of would bring around international understanding or perspectives around some of these challenges to really engage with the community so Oh in heavy labor as you 're recommending but I just wanted to emphasize that the community board was thinking more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've done in the past do you know how many people came to those international speakers series not off top of my head when I do cuz I went to it was half empty yeah or half full depending on what sort of it was the quality not the quantity and it was the quality of the ideas in the thoughts yeah i understand it aimed whether they were able to influence as another question as well the point is is that we actually have international expertise and New Zealand focused on this issue because there are some very much that in fact we had people from from Auckland Canterbury University Lincoln who have incredible expertise and genus of course as well so we 've got crown research institutes etc so when I 'm saying convene a flood forum it 's bigger than a council workshop and if it is necessary to bring an external assistance with that then I think we should do that I have a feeling that it 's too narrow because I 'd rather look at risk around all natural hazards but and other hazards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this as a as a way of sort of giving respect really to the head grief ferryman community boards recommendation so I 'd like to move that the council convene a flood form as part of the consideration the natural hazard chapter and the district plan review term scandrett second oh I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye Rose opposed say no Carrie thank you and the next one thank you met Amir the local alcohol policy I know that councillors are very very busy with whole pile of issues at the moment but this is something that has been brought to attention and not just by the Victoria Neighborhood Association but by others as well and their communities under quite a lot of stress residential areas that are really looking for some more direction from Council over local alcohol policy and we would like to request their council urgently progress the adoption of a local help local policy so I mean I can probably just respond to this just quickly and that is that the council has been considering the local alcohol policy unfortunately it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council and so the incoming council has been given a policy that we either notify or we sit back and observe the outcome of some of the early cases that will be taken on other local alcohol plans that have similar provisions and from my perspective the last thing that Christchurch City Council has time for as a legal battle where we have to engage lawyers to represent the interests of the city on a local alcohol plan that hasn 't really hasn 't really responded to the fact that we 're in a transition environment and that could pose a risk to the success of the implementation so this I wouldn 't support a motion to eagle vision a production of a local alcohol clan we 're taking from my perspective a bit of a wait and see approach and then we will make a decision as soon as we 've got some direction some clear direction to the community over that would be really useful in that case yeah so that the community in the reasons for the delay and maybe some sort of time frame over when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases have been appealed right yeah I think that 's five that 's a certain lead to an art Waimakariri District Council our our neighbors are one of the first off the block so I mean having that communication with the community over that would be really useful I think that would be useful to thank you very much so that 's that but I take I 'm gonna do well I have a recommendation in front of me so it could fail for the want of a mover and a seconder so is anyone prepared to move it okay no I wonder if we just receive it you know I hear what they 're saying you summarized actually my notes perfectly what you say and what you just said before and I 'm totally into us where you say the other people play for a bit why McPake sign for changed with relations of you quotes today to be the guinea pigs there does stream actually is mad but yes we just receive it what we hear that we hear what you know what you 're saying serum and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm happy to move it because um I I just think well I don 't know hang on so we have a seconder Paul on tail okay so no matter what we do in the space in my view there 's people that are not gonna be happy and his people that are going to appeal and so I personally can 't see the sense in waiting we tried really hard to see what we could do in terms of the transition and I think you know that I didn 't agree with everything that was in the policy which there was a huge amount of work that went into it in terms of submissions committee meetings hearings and I just think we should actually just get it to a point where it gets notified and then there 'll be an appeals process that people raise concerns and that will be worked through but you know that issue for some people in the community is that publishing local licenses and in some neighborhoods they were really quite supportive of the work that we were doing also we heard from people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impacts that post-earthquake alcohol is having in some areas so you know I just think the sooner we get this work complete the better and no matter what we do it will always be challenged I don 't believe that 's a reason to wait all right i 'll put the motion oh Jenny just a brief count they 're totally appreciate that everything that yannis said and what 's coming from the board here at a degree but you know from my perspective it 's always weighing the pros and cons and well I understand and appreciate it we are a city in transition we have a huge amount that we are doing right now and that 's on our plate and it will end up in court battles and it will be challenged for a long for a long time and I the way I look at it is i would prefer someone else to go through that and they can pay for it and we can learn from the lessons that they that they learn we go through we can learn from them so I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they get wrong so my preference is to probably just push push pause on that let the others go through through the process and then um perhaps have a bit of a way to go forward at the conclusion of that so I 'm sorry I just can 't support it but I appreciate lycée okay i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no no that 's lost so thank you but thank you for the sentiment and we will put out a statement just explaining where things are on hold thank you for thank you oh absolutely well we yeah what the support Thank You Metta me we now move on to 19th of March and we here because,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

committee process to determine the location of the eastern 's recreation and sports centre and i 'd like to invite paul zannan and landowners association to the table uh good morning firstly thank you for allowing us with our deputation today um i 'll just give a little brief background on the new brighton business landowners association we started 14 months ago with a basic agenda to finally sort out new brighton it 's obviously been in a state for a long period of time and it was also in response to the council 's draft master plan uh to that end we 've engaged with sam martin from a line jason mill from zeno and pivnish and we 've also been working very closely with eastern visions aventacarro network tony josephs and associates and in partnership with christchurch city council for the master plan um we got involved quite early on in the conversations regarding the water park and i 'm assuming everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so from that obvious the whole work stream along with it and the location of the eastern reckon sports facility we challenge all linking in with suburban planning land use recovery plans um so we designed a facility that would incorporate the surf club similar to the miraway concept up in auckland where 85 percent of schools go for beach education to a facility there we were looking at saltwater hot pools which have been discussed in new brighton since 1928 i believe and still hasn 't been done um so this was the concept that originally got drawn up by jason mill and sam martin and looking at the linkages to suburban planning for the area um obviously things have been discussed the legacy project um look this is something that we fully fully embrace it 's it 's something that 's been eastern recent sports has been such a long conversation and it 's it 's very heated in the eastern communities and there are needs other than new brighton and we 're fully supportive of it as well when we 're exploring the option of legacy project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what legacy project entails and what the purpose and point of this facility would be for new brighton as well what 's it actually going to achieve what is the purpose of it it 's not a recon sports facility it 's something to breathe life back in but also to stimulate investor confidence christchurch city council must look at this development process for new brighton as well we have a very very unique opportunity at the moment in new brighton um we have obviously engaged the services sam martin and jason mill to re-address the master the ability to actually i guess have an anchor or a legacy project that links in with the enablement of a master plan as well also driven from private industry and it 's very opportunity that we 're looking forward to um when we originally started looking at legacy project which is obviously very very recently we 're trying to see what sort of linkages we can have in place we 've already talked with surf lifesaving new zealand who have a very very high ambition to join in with this project um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the oldest club in the country the first one established that 's a legacy in itself they 're in need of a new surf club so this is where we start looking at those linkages and partnerships going in we believe that the legacy project must be substantial enough to actually do what it needs to do but this obviously has to go through several different work streams from business cases feasibility studies to start identifying the scope and the scale of this facility and the potential partnerships into it so the next steps for us is starting to look into feasibility business cases scope and scale and the potential partnerships into this as well and we 're very much looking forward to working with christchurch city council on this today we 've been working very closely with south shore residents association central brighton residents association south brighton resident association renew brighton brighton project whale brighton obviously tim and dave is the original proponents of the water park as well and we 're very much looking forward to making this move very very quickly from here on in excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and can i just acknowledge the work that you 've um you 've you 've done um both personally but also on behalf of and the the capture assistance with the development of a proposal do you want to flick back to this that you see when you see that perhaps there are flow-on benefits from the type of proposal that you 've got as opposed to an eastern sport and rec centre there are secondary benefits that maybe don 't come from an east from a sport and rec center so i mean leave the word eastern out but a sport and rec center does that have this sort of flow-on benefit in terms of investment or is it the point of different i mean i guess what i 've been saying is about hot salt water pools are a point of difference it 'd be the only place in christchurch that would have that well this is this is what we started exploring obviously with the water park proposal the reports that came in from sgs and sgl if you haven 't read the sgs report it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a city etc etc but one of those things that popped out was was the direct impact of metro sports as a regional facility and what that meant for the water park proposal hence we started looking at points of difference as well we did pursue eastern recon sports because we matched all the criteria we actually had a rationale behind it from transportation networks et cetera but we do acknowledge that there are much bigger needs on the east of it that one problem isn 't going to fix the east one pot of money isn 't going to answer everyone 's needs and requirements moving forward let alone the wants and the expectations of the community either so you would support a separation for a separate pool of um support for a well as pull the right word under these circumstances um for um for a legacy project for new brighton separate from the eastern sport and rec center 100 and uh we 've had an emergency board meeting as well to discuss this in our ways forward we are 100 behind this we think this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any questions uh yani do you have a a image of what the actual maybe was just before this one the i thought you had a kind of thing about the um the surf life saving club and what you might be able to do there uh the partnerships of it or the actual pictures of it yeah the kind of pictures of the new uh yep that 's um that one there so you can see what we originally designed was to reposition it where the surf life saving club said um since then we have been in negotiations with several other key groups and this plan has adapted and changed from what the original proposal was so this was uh 10 months ago i believe that this was originally drawn up and since then it has drastically changed we do have the appetite to move this closer towards the cbd to enable the linkages back to the commercial planning and also to reinforce that legacy link for the surf life saving club their original position was basically where the toilet block is which is close to the whale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry sorry can i just oh sorry yeah carry on so um so so the idea is that you you 'd build basically hot saltwater pools uh you 'd possibly build a swimming pool we think there is a need for a swimming pool in that surf lifesaver new zealand has committed to bringing a hundred percent of christchurch schools for year-round beach education to this facility as long as it is designed along their specifications as well saltwater hot pools quite frankly has been talked about for 85 years and it 's still a really good idea um and then the extra add-ons is what we 'd look at after that but it must be something of substance something that complements the library the library has an international reputation for its architecture and the impact that it has that 's something we want to reinforce on the coast any idea in terms of budget until we can actually start putting the business case the feasibility and the scope and scale the basic thing that 's been put through from tony josephs and associates to explore the hot pools had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot pool development surf lifesaving new zealand was going through jazz max i believe to start looking at the proposal for what building they were looking at independently of this and that was pre-budgeted at around the two two and a half million dollar mark just for the building not inclusive of pools just for the building of the surf lifesaving club not inclusive of pools or anything else attached to it jermaine thank you thank you one question because you are aware a moment regarding to the eastern recreation sports a credit center budget 30 and a half million dollars put in the three-year plan but it based on a new brighton water park your idea the public private partnership etc whether you still prefer to pull a part of these 30 million dollars part of them aside to provide at least the new brighton uh water pack or just a total difference i think from other source of the funding i think what the mayor has proposed as well is something completely different there 's a lot of emotion attached with the replacement of qe2 that loss is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a lot of the communities are demanding for that facility to be kept as whole so it 's one of those things people don 't want to have a ground condon replacing what was qe2 the ambitions for that facility that 30 and a half preliminary budget in our opinion should be kept together and we should be discussing a legacy project for brighton um glenn thank you as has been pointed out uh paul obviously new brighton expanded during their heyday when officially had a monopoly over uh saturday shopping so if you were going to configure uh the mall now how how would you do that um this is something where we need to get back to the original purpose of engaging with our external consultants as well we have been dragged into this conversation about a legacy project obviously going back to the commercial district through the draft master plan of christchurch city council you 're already starting to look at taking it from 11 hectares down to four and retreating off the west end of new brighton which is in the flood plain as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shrinking it um we have several key developments and proposals for the commercial district of mixed use buildings throughout the area as well but it does need to be condensed we 're not going to have the heyday of new brighton return but it doesn 't mean we have to live in a slum we can return it to being a very iconic area for christchurch city as a whole if not canterbury but the the condensing of the commercial district does make sense david uh thank you and thank you paul for your presentation and certainly very encouraging the work that is going on and new brighton at the moment um i 'd probably just like to to clarify more than a question anyway with regard to the surf lifesaving aspect of it i 'm a life member of locally and nationally observed life-saving the important ingredient in this proposal would be the beach education concept of surf lifesaving and being able to utilize some of that in the new brighton area and particularly in conjunction with a saltwater pool complex the surf club itself relocating is another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don 't have the financial capacity to engage in that but we are talking more along the beach education process and and i certainly concur with paul that relocating the legacy project the hot salt water pools that sort of concept close to the business district is the first step in in a process of rejuvenation for for new brighton so i just like to commend the work that the business association and other groups are doing and even in this morning 's paper you 'll see a further investment group starting to surface as well so there are some very positive aspects starting to evolve and when we come to making resolutions i do have a few amendments to make i think on that front as well councilor east um this isn 't the end of the process either gaining one facility is not the end of the process for new brighton we 're going to be slugging it out for years yet to reconfigure redevelop the commercial district so as long as public opinion is also aware that this isn 't the be or end or of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had that conversation before on other subjects ref uh thanks paul so from what you 're saying you 're quite happy for that 30 million plus the six for the eastern sport and wreck to be separate so what exactly are you looking for from council uh this is something where we would actually need to have a lot more than ten minutes to discuss obviously i can 't put a dollar in figure cents on this dollar so you 're looking for money but potentially a partnership with private partners i think it would be naive to think that we shouldn 't look at that right so judging from those numbers you 'd be looking for what 10 million from the council it 's probably unfair but i mean no because if you 're coming here with a proposal there must be some idea of what you want otherwise it 's just more talking there seems to be a huge amount of talking about what 's going on in the east at the moment the problem is is that this came up on a extraordinary meeting of the community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for legacy in new brighton so i 've created the problem and i feel like protecting paul from from from questions about how much i think that if we get to um the actual issue on the eye on the item on the agenda that we can we can give some direction to staff to put a report together around legacy options for new brighton which would be separate from the eastern sport and rec center but with some proposals around some numbers and we 'd expect staff to engage closely with the local community about that yeah i mean the reason why i raise it is i mean just my observation is that there 's intense frustration and confusion about what is going on out there i certainly look at it and think well what is the proposition what is the proposal so unless there 's some clear proposals and propositions you can 't make a decision on it no it seems like people are going round and round we 're not expecting a decision today on a proposal what we 're expecting today is to actually authorise staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff presented a report that they were asked to present they were told uh here are the criteria for the aquatics facility in the east and and go and look for sites that match those criteria and bring back a process for determining what what site it would be that has ended up with proposals across burwood pegasus and hegleigh ferrymeet and it has created enormous stress in both communities and that 's why it 's important to start being specific and also we are doing a lot of work around budgets and funding yeah and now is the time for people to be quite clear about what they want yeah the the complicating factor is that we were originally looking at the eastern reckon sports budget so all the preliminary work up until this monday has been focused on a budget of 30 to 37 million dollars obviously that 's not going to happen i do understand the council 's financial constraints as well but i 've been warned against putting a dollar figure on what we don 't understand quite yet right paul it 's probably more a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all i know the difficulty in the job you do being the association manager for central city and i believe you 're right on the right track it 's about differentiation you 're not going to get the shopping back there like you used to have in the past so you 've got to find things that actually define new brighton as different to other areas that will encourage people to come back i think the hot saltwater pools is a fantastic idea if you can join up other parties like your surf club to that i think you 're actually on the right track to actually having a bit of a winner especially if you can drag all the school kids out there for uh beach safety water safety i think that 's actually a way of bringing the rest of christchurch out to see what brighton is all about thank you right thank you very much paul and uh we 'll now invite um joe zervos and chris cole alrighty good morning everyone can you hear me like this yes but you can sit down if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah um i 'm jose vos vote smith person for the qe2 group and chris cole from the oregondale residents association he 's representing several associations who support our group and they 've attended our last meeting so they all know what 's going on hopefully you 've all read our notes we 're not going to go through all of the notes because they 're quite thorough but we really hope that you take the time to go through them this is one of the most important issues in the whole of our ward earthquake recovery should be a priority it is over three years since we lost qe2 in june it is two years since 35 a 30.5 million was awarded for a replacement better than jelly park the generous donation of the 6.5 million has excited all of our population we are so grateful for this as it will ensure a very special facility catering for our children who have endured so much especially in the east it is essential that the entirety of this money is invested into a single asset to give the east something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rebuild and the opportunity for many of us to get our lives back on track again it would not only be an asset for the east it would be an important inclusion into the sport and recreation unit of the council and and it is an asset for the entire city we 've got economic reasons on note 7 of the big one and i really appreciate if you go through that without me talking about it the land we realized there was uncertainty about the land this is one of the initial reasons why other sites were considered we now know that qe2 the east of qe2 is an option although we have not seen reports from the east of the site we have seen the geotech reports from the stadium site if the east side was not a viable option the surrounding houses would have been red-zoned if qe2 is not chosen as a site we expect a full and transparent geotech process as to why in a comparison geotech of the other sites of the site chosen consultation we have been waiting for the consultation process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results by the end of last year we have preparing ourselves of how we will approach it now it looks like it may not happen due to another complete change in direction further delaying process of progress we are confident that any consultation process will show that qe2 is the preferred site we have done our own small facebook survey on paper the press have an online poll which confirms our results and we have started collecting signatures to replace kirito on the qe2 site the majority of comments on relating staff articles and on other media tend to favor the site many people have mentioned that they only signed support for the water park as there was no other option given most of them prefer kiwi too if you turn the page you will see the stuff poll the staff poll asked where would you like to see the new pool close to 2 000 people voted on that so far the first choice was kirito at 52.2 the next highest was none of the above obviously westerners 16.3 all other sites are well below eight percent the key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locations and we also asked how often do you use the facility or did you use it 650 responses so fast the first choice qe2 70.6 next highest new brighton 16.9 all other sites under five percent some people voted for the same location first second and third most varied it curie 2 was the top second location 33.5 and the third choice at 21.5 also 74 of the respondents used qe2 more than weekly the majority of the public support the kirito location the sgl report done for the water park suggests the location should be north of the oven west of bahrain and east of martian road which qe2 is you could save more time and money and put it towards another pool by selecting qe2 now if not we 're requesting a fair and prompt proceed consultation process asap please and i 'll pass over to chris he 'll go through some of the other points in our deputation thank you thanks joe good morning i 'm here for the keep qe2 and the east group it has been mandated by community meetings facebook and emails with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parklands residents wider carey residents apartments recovery group and the burwood east residents associations we wish to see an aquatic facility the likes of jelly park or better built on or near the former qe2 site why do we want this the east has lost so much it needs to heal the health well-being and mental alertness of the community what do we need the core needs 25 metre pool 35 meter lap pool toddler area jimmy exercise rooms we 've learned to swim facility aqua gym for the elderly a training facility for the young and old deep pools for sports and therapy and of course companionship with health issues arthritis etc it has to be in close proximity to all the schools the schools have lost their swimming pools and qe2 is central to a large number of these schools save time transporting children to the facility instead of wasting half a day commuting to the far side of town to smaller pools that have difficulty accommodating the increased usage we need to keep the children and teenagers busy particularly during holidays i do have a supporting letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that at the moment we need to bring people back to the east there is an expanding population growth to the north with the prestons and the wider kerry subdivisions qe2 was very heavily used by the local communities it was always well used was always busy it will bring hope and spirit back to the community it 's easy parking readily available plenty of space there transport qe2 park is currently on or near to four bus routes and the buses are scheduled at 15 and 30 minute intervals readily accessible there there is also expressway connections to the hagley fairy mead and the papua new shirley wards great access again a great sporting facility is needed back in the east the northeast is a furthest from existing surviving and planned facilities wide open spaces surrounding the facility can only enhance the well-being of the users of the area with this replaced facility it will enhance the eastern suburbs for a great future making it a great recreational playground for the whole of the city there 's now more than three years without swimming practice causing loss of skills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've lost a heart and there is urgency in this other matters the interest services are already there with the power the gas wastewater business case why is this a commercial business venture or is it for the benefit of the communities within christchurch economics must not take priority over the physical and mental health and the water safety needs of the communities the new brighton water park this is a good concept actually it 's a great concept particularly with a heated saltwater pool it is seen as a business venture to assist with the regrowth of the central new brighton area it 's a point of difference it 's an attraction it however does not assist the whole of the world as such this is a totally separate issue funding for this should come from a different source not from the insurance package for the replacement of the qe2 facility now three smaller pools yes your communities could do with these types of pools the ground content style pools this type of pool is great for fun and entertainment but it does not meet the needs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communities this facility will not be in conflict with the proposed central metro center it will be an enhancement is an area that is easy to get to city wide it is the heart of what will become the great recreation area of christchurch the 30 million plus budget must be used for the replacement of the facility lost best use points to one facility to benefit all there is only one site suitable for this type of facility for on behalf of and for the benefit of the whole of the christchurch communities replace what was heavily patronized and was lost close to where it was lost surely this is a critical factor qe2 worked because of its location and strong community support please keep qe2 in the east thank you thank you very much and we 've come to the end of time so there isn 't time for questions i do apologize for that thank you very much for your presentation thank you eleanor bodger oh wow um thank you very much for the opportunity to speak to the council today i 'm from wow brighton um @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and environmental revitalization of new brighton a large number of our members are long-standing new brighton residents many of them multi-generational so we have long invested interests in the area i 'm aware that what we 're speaking to today is really a change of process from what we were anticipating when we spoke to the committee meeting um but i 'm also very pleased that it 's also given us some different options the legacy project thrills us in that it gives us the recognition that we think the residents of new brighton very desperately need at say it 's a area an extended area where a large number of people are feeling very unsupported uh very mindful of the loss of some wonderful facilities in the area and principally the pool and we are keen that the legacy project be adequately funded by the council because we believe that um the the nature of the relationship that a community has with a facility that 's owned by the city council is quite different to that that 's owned by private business however we are very very supportive of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pyrium is here to read a letter that was written by dr john cook prior to his um departure overseas so it was written prior to mayor dalzell 's announcement about the legacy project so please bear that in mind but we think it may make some very salient points the letter is entitled bring qe2 in from the wilderness i would like to thank the council excuse me for the opportunity to share my thoughts about health and community a successful community creates an environment that is enriching for all its members health enhancing and safe a community brought together by adversity can grasp the opportunity to develop new linkages and support mechanisms to the long-term benefit of the community we have all experienced this our community my community has been like many others devastated over the last three years however i have been privileged to be one of ten doctors working at new brighton healthcare and also a part of the community not only as a medic but as a community member as was my father and his mother and father and my wife sally 's mother and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assets not least the one we shared with the rest of christchurch qe2 sporting and recreational facility many a time i 've been told by wide-eyed youngsters and wise wrinkly oldies how many lengths they have done and how they have loved it who they met there and how they were looking forward to their next encounter and challenge sadly for many people kirito was in the wilderness difficult to access and often a long walk especially for the elderly from their car parks and with a limited number of social options close by good community is about clusters clusters of people families schools clusters of shops both curio cafe and essential services such as legal dental medical accounting banking post library arts and recreational facilities by clustering a community can provide options and opportunity in a continuum for its members our own children and our children 's children it is about successfully passing on of the betten we need each other and we need things to do things to achieve things to be proud of we need to be seen with each other to provide role models and options @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a resident i and others find it uplifting to see the support from other areas of christchurch for kite day sandcastle day the travelling fairs the fireworks display the buskers to name a few that come to mind we enjoy sharing our suburb 's seaside uniqueness by bringing an equivalent to qe2 near our commercial area we will enhance our ability to flourish as one of the seaside suburbs that christchurch is blessed with we are not an edge we are not surrounded by half a saucer we have lateral spread with a long eastern border which we as a medical facility service our commercial area is best considered as the centre of a long axis of an oval bringing qe2 out of the wilderness and into new brighton will obviously not be without difficulties especially those we manufacture ourselves we have the opportunity to link with rafati bexley and with a bit of imagination the avon river complex with many exciting prospects for wildlife and flora enhancement increased water recreational areas and access to a scientific wonderland for our children and their families i believe the residents of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in their quest to replace their facilities lost in the earthquake let us choose the site that achieves as many of the community enhancing qualities we can do with this opportunity reinvigoration new brighton has been a long reinvigoration of new brighton has been a long goal for the city saturday shopping has gone forever let 's do it thank you dr john cook thank you very much um is that are there any questions ref um so have you done any on sorry have you done any work on what this facility might look like or are you supportive of what paul was talking about before we 're supportive of new brighton business and landowners yes so you 're saying that actually instead of building at qe2 we should build the whole thing at new brighton that 's the very difficult question i think for council and it 's about what money might be available and how that can be wisely spent well there 's 37 million available so we know that yes so what 's the specific proposal or isn 't that one i think this project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brighton area needs to be substantial i don 't believe that a single saltwater pool for example will be sufficient to provide the type of um community interaction that dr cook 's talking about so there need to be several options and how that might be funded i think as paul said we need to go away do some feasibility studies business plans concept plans that sort of thing but it does require more than just a single salt water pool pauline thank you it is a little bit of a chicken and an egg thing isn 't it though because it 's hard to do any work until you know the site is hard to know the site you 've done the consultation do you basically support dr cook 's letter absolutely so you agree that qet was a difficult site to get to we do even though it was very well populated it was very well used i think qe2 correct me if i 'm wrong was built in 1974 i think things have changed significantly since then we have

around all of us um in the east uh to some degree surrounded by red zoned areas so i would think that that 's even less accessible um in today 's environment i do like the way he 's described brighton as rather we look at most places as a circle but it 's actually a long axis of an oval would you see that the the christchurch other new brighton business area was in the center of that axis of open

Options,KTzftIV4nTI,20140326,2286.23,"Christchurch, New Zealand",6220,Dudley Creek proposals Dudley Creek post-earthquake remediation options case I 'll invite some Mike Gillooly who 's become very well known to us over the last few months and I 'd invite you to take us through the report I would like to though just to place on record just the enormous gratitude of counselors for the effort that you and the team have put on it 's been an extraordinary effort we placed a totally unreasonable demand on you to bring a report to us basically within a couple of weeks and but I know that I know that the team has worked night and day and I want you to know that it was thoroughly appreciated and although we 're just a further step ahead and there 's still a long way to go just wanted to place that on the record we really appreciate how hard everyone his work to bring this to the table so now I 'll invite you to say sir thank you very much and it is a pleasure to be here and have you know reached I think a significant milestone and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this particular catchment it is just 11 catchment within the city there is a wider you know investigation going on throughout the city and here 's an understanding of postage paper cutting risk but we 've always identified this as one of our priority areas so will step through quickly through the background of the of the issue to the issue I 'll talk quickly about the options that that we 're pretending to to the council today and then the issues that are associated with those options and then we 'll add this a number of recommendations of staff that we we believe that they that you could you could adopt so in terms of background to the to the issue flood risks have changed for a number of localities with in Christchurch they have been caused by land settlement and a reduction in the hydraulic capacity of the waterways and in particular Dudley Creek it 's very complex issue to deal with across the city this is our biggest priority and we are we have a land drainage recovery program in place that looks at the other catchments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper Avon and the title flood protection needs of the rest of the city around south shore and summer so I would stress that we are not looking at this in isolation but recognize the importance of this particular catchment we 're also engaging at officer level very very closely with our key stakeholders and Sarah Environment Canterbury Earthquake Commission and the New Zealand insurance council so we 've been pursuing the process of Investigation and assessment and assessment of this waterway in November 2013 we received an issues and options report that looked at a whole lot of options for the recovery of this waterway that investigation had a very very tight brief it was purely focused on the earthquake effects associated with the flood risk for our waterways at thought to present technical solutions that would solve that preliminary costs and repair strategies and looking at issues around resilience and future resilience for for those solutions that has been detailed more there to see it out in much more detail and the technical report that has been delivered to that twist today by s came and you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ options were at chosen in November 2013 a result as a result of work shopping in internal caucusing those options that were produced progressed to feasibility were a gravity option which would see a major upgrade of the deadly Creek waterway from what we know as the flopped interior down through richmond saint albans motor how to the confluence with the avon that option that gravity option also sees a significant upgrading required of key structures relating to a number of bridges and culverts and also private access bridges as well probably the most complex will be the hills road surely Road intersection where there 's a major upgrade of the bridge required there but all those bridges will require some upgrading the gravity option does require major upgrading in terms of the waterway in terms of its width and also its depth so currently there 's a channel capacity of around at channel width of around to probably maybe three meters in some places that will increase to maybe five to eight meters in some places the increase in depth that we 're looking at for the would waive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's the sort of the scale of the works within the waterway that we 're talking about with the gravity option with the with option one we 're also looking at that one of the issues associated with it will be it has the potential to impact on the streetscape and the look and the feel of that community out there so it will change the way it looks it will mean a wider waterway it will mean a narrower street it will mean a different streetscape in terms of the trees and the way that that were all that works it does have the potential to deliver multiple benefits in that regard so that 's option one the second option that 's been presented to the council today to solve that the the risk flood risk to floor levels is a pump station and a gravity by pass system that will lower the water levels and flopped and basin by putting a pump station in the last point of the other of the of the basin that will draw the water levels down and have pumped the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into at the lower part of the Dudley Creek that will require a big bypass pipe along warden streets that pipe his dimensions of around three and a half meters wide by one and a half meters deep so it 's a major significant sort of engineering asset that we 're looking at constructing as well as a significant pump station with its ongoing operational and maintenance costs it does have less complexity around it in terms of comparing option one and option two option two deals with has less impact and private private property ownership option one has an impact on private properties option one sees we had 115 private properties that will be affected to some degree probably nine quite significantly option to see 70 properties affected to some degree probably about to quite significantly so the complexity around working with the community and working with those people is probably less for option two and there are issues they with option to its terms of its ongoing and resilience to over-design events so option two is a very engineered pump station and gravity solution in a pipe so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've designed for that won 't cope as well as the gravity solution so the gravity solution does have the the ability to to cope with the over design events more however the gravity solution because it 's a widening and a deepening of a channel does have resilience issues in terms of designing for future seismic activity so you can design these things they 're not ampang durables or unable to be to be managed but they are risks an issue so option one ongoing seismic risks around seismic activity in terms of lateral spreading and what we know about that an ongoing settlement sure you can engineer your way out of it but we need to do more work around how much is that going to cost for the benefit that you 're going going to get more work needs to be done there option 2 doesn 't have that risk but in terms of the over design event that the sort of storm that perhaps you could have got two or three where we did get two or three weeks ago and how that would perform possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I plenty to think about in terms of comparing the options so that 's that sort of summarizes the options the rest of the report talks about their construction costs the I know that she does one aspect of the second option that I haven 't covered it does also require some upgrading of that waterway as well so option two does require some upgrading of the ward way from floxin street down to the warden Street bypass but it doesn 't have the in the upgrading required through private property there will be upgrading required notch and two along banks avenue in north parade but those largely within the the road corridor so there is a limited amount of upgrading to the waterway required an option to write costs that the money is expensive both options are coming in at 50 in 53 million dollars for option one and two with confidences of minus 10 and plus 30 and minus 20 + + 44 both both options that sort of reflects the stage we 're at in terms of feasibility design the contingency that you have to allow for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make to get to this point of an engineering investigation so we 've got work to do through the detailed design phase in terms of getting their confidence that range narrow down one of the risks I suppose of making getting this delivered to you quite quickly is there 's always the ability to look for options within options and in the normal course of events me quite often talked about you know in peacetime perhaps we would have been able to spend a bit more time refining these options and driving some you know that value engineering that would would refine those costs down that work still needs to happen it can happen and parallel to engage with the community but we do need to look harder for the options within those options so that we can make sure that we 're delivering you know the optimal solution but what you 've got here today hydraulically will work but some more certainty or some more clarity around refining those options will be done so those costs 50 and 53 million cost confidence as with those we have allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land XS and the startup costs in order to get through detailed design insight investigations and whatever you say those are that 's sort of where the cost of sitting land ownership there 's a section in the report around around land ownership and I 've sort of I 've already touched on that briefly so option one will require a lot of a lot more interaction with landowners than option two and we 'll be working with them over the next few weeks 22 to work out just exactly how they feel about that at this stage we 're not going out with a lot of detail on individuals how individuals might be protected we very keen to to talk to people first terms of consenting the next section and the reporters about consenting this does come with a a requirement for the council to comply with the within the regulatory framework that 's its own regulatory framework in terms of the city plan but also the regional plan and consents for Environment Canterbury we had a very good offer of support from Environment Canterbury to work with us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of tools in the toolbox for consenting so we can apply with we all already hold a number of global consents for works within our waterways we can use some of those and we need to do a bit more work around the applicability of some of those consents to the work we are trying to do but they do exist we can apply for project specific resource consents we can use what they call within the resource manager net to the notice of requirement process which effectively I 'll use the word sterilized but it does it does set aside that corridor for specific works deemed necessary under that act we can use that part of the Act we can also use the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Act order in council which allows stream more streamlined processes to fast-track resource consents number of tools in the toolbox there our recommendation is that we do more work around refining the strategy around consenting but there is a does come with a timeframe so getting through the consenting could take six to nine months and there 's more detail on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us through the procurement issues a very very important part of this will be of this project will be implementation not the least of which will be how you or how we as an organization manage that buyer supplier interface getting the commercial relationships right getting the right model of contract that suits us we 've done risk and risks and issues workshops around procurement there 's probably nine ways in which we could engage commercially on this three or four of which stand out as as as preferred ways of of getting the commercial relationships right our feeling on that is that we need to probably choose the option that we would that we would want to go with and then we would work through as a priority what the procurement process is on there so there is a separate piece of work not in the ischium technical report around procurement around in the commercial reality of that the next phase the next part of the report deals with consultation and its consultation as well as community engagement so we have a lot of work to do with our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we want to explain what the options are and understand what they feel about those those two options we 're planning to do that over the next 22 weeks and that 's that 's it 's a program that we look really looking forward to engaging and we 're also working very closely with our other stakeholders environment vironment Canterbury the earthquake commission Syria and the insurance council and it is a program in place for that as well funding so it 's probably with teary we 'll just probably talk through the funding issues this is a complex funding issue it 's part of the cost year and it 's got a tone the zone so we do have some funding set aside to cover some storm water works for the city that 's covered in the horizontal infrastructure funding agreement particularly centered around the non skirt element of that funding so there 's already an agreed funding arrangement between the city and the crown on that some of these works will qualify in that in that package of funding some other works won 't so again we need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly how the funding would work and that 's a just a piece of work that we need to get done in a nutshell that 's this that 's the reporting with the recommendations at need thank you very much up just I 'll get kick off the questions just in terms of before the earthquakes happen I mean there 's been a lot of public discussion about whether the earthquakes have made a difference in the area and I think that often the focus is on those finished floor levels because there it 's the it 's whether the house floods or not I mean of course it 's you know horrible to stand on your your doorstep and and look out of a sea of water but it 's worse to have a the sea of water flooding into your house to greet you when you get out of bed so I think that the the question I 've got us how many of the houses in this area actually had their floor levels you know breached and and flood events before the earthquake and and I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is to flood all the time and the 70s but the division kind of address that and then how many how many floor levels are breached now actually in those those smaller events the one in ten year I 'm reluctant to use these descriptions now but so so say in a moderate event that the one on 50 year which i will use because it 's the building eight level and the end perhaps the more extreme weather events such as we head sure and actually that 's that 's probably the key issue for the community out there is what 's what 's the rest to my house as you say most people would understand it and big storms you 're going to get some sort of surface water within the roads and roads are designed to to take it and sometimes sometimes it does get onto your property so prior to the earthquake in this area we had nine floor levels that were at risk of flooding and a ten year event as a result of the earthquakes the risk to floor levels and the 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a bullet we have confidence around that number as a result of our modeling of that June storm the actual event versus the modeled event in the June storm we had 26 floor levels that were inundated actually an undated and the model predicted 30 so it 's very good correlation between the model outputs and the reality and that 's one of all levels always one of the concerns with your models how do they reflect reality the benefits are the options in terms of the reducing that risk to floor levels and that was one of the key objectives of the project was to reduce the address to bacteria levels so in the 10-year event we go from 30 post-quake floor levels being in a risk I think down to 3 and an option one and down to five and option two so in the more frequent events you know there is a significant benefit even in the 50-year events enchilada can operate at copied reports that good you 've got it actually open on the right page you know yeah so the leaves can report has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protecting the protections of audibles and in the 50 year event pride the youth crepe there were 32 floor levels at risk after the earthquake and the 50 year event there were up 280 floor levels at risk as a result of option one if you were to implement option one that risk would go from 80 down to 15 and from 80 down to 19 for option two so you 're seeing an improvement in the post earthquake situation for this community but you 're actually also seeing an improvement in the pre earthquake solution for this community in terms of rest of floor levels but but because these these are fairly large engineering solutions we 've got to be careful that we don 't get fixed on an actual number and it 's still only a model so we 're just trying to give you an indication and a feel for for the changes that we 're trying to make so we 're desperately trying to get back to a situation that we 're getting back to a sin level of protection to what we had clear before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our website soon as I walk out of here that 'll be all thank you I 'm pulling thanks for the work that you 're doing here women talk timelines we 're talking of who 'd 18 months to two years has that timeline be done or is that timeline from when the construction of whichever option yeah it 's likely and it depends on the options and the complexities of what we chose but really that 's probably the construction period there might be some things we can do in parallel to try and speed some of that those issues up but it depends on the options that we finalize will then be able to give us a really good feel for that the time frames yeah although you haven 't done all the work was the option C is there any is one option going to be significantly quicker or slower than another you know it 's difficult this day if you challenge me wanted an answer today option two because it 's more just a lot of it 's just pure engineering and it 's a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then my field would be that that 's probably a solution that we could move slightly quicker on it 's not so complex from a liaison land access talking with the community okay in another difficult question you might not be able to answer but the work that 's going on in here how much of this group can carry forward to other areas of how much of it can be as a model information use over later I think we learned in a number of things to this and one of the things that we 've created is a working group between ourselves there are and other key agencies that we do get that learning we actually I 'm try and unravel these problems once and not 25 times across the city so we 're trying to look at holistically and try and get as much of the principles and the key processes in place so that we can then roll that out to other parts right so this will help the entire city absolutely Paul just with regard to option to the only thing that probably hasn 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pair relativity saw ash in the last event how would that affect yes it would make sense really wait wait we thought about that clearly you can plug it into the normal mains electricity is probably but if it 's a storm event and the power goes off it 's not really available for you so we would have to look at some standby generation potentially that would actually be there to actually be able to run this through an emergency which is when you want it to happen so we would look at all those aspects to ensure that it was ready and available in Dennis reflected and editors were figure than the costings as well yeah Tim Tim thank you and 4.4 you say the option one provides greater resilience to storm events but provides less resilience against the impact of future earthquakes now considering option to as a pump station pipe diversion and option one goes to a major upgrade to the waterways we 've hit in the earthquake we horizontal in that stretch got pretty well shattered so how I mean just from a layman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resilient in an earthquake seeing that we 've seen a horizontal run that stretched pretty or shattered yeah can you explain anything helpful in I think you got two different aspects and it is our experiences of the earthquake both the streams and the underground infrastructure got damaged we can engineer at some of those things with the underground infrastructure but I look in the way it 's designed the types of materials we use so we can actually make those more robust it is much more difficult to actually do that for open channels where you have a lot of lateral spreading and growing movement so I think what Mike saluda to the report is it is far more difficult to protect against that land sort of that land movement that lateral spreading without making it really a very complicated engineering solution so we 've probably got more confidence that we can engineer act so we 'll put more resilience into the into the pipeline system than we can the waterways yeah and that 's even less funny not just 6.5 just very young places you 're looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for one of a better term first cab off the block but thank you very much that 's very appreciated thank you hi Jimmy a first equation that will ask a lady second question they got into the two options the how about a time frame the consent in procurement or consultation estates or exact same or dif time thing it is probably similar option one is likely to be slightly more complicated the obvious mum would be more complicated but the their still consenting issues with option two as well because with option two you 've got a lot of upgrading of that board away from flopped and basin downs of Stapleton 's road and then the lower part of the Dudley so you 're not going to get away with consenting but it would be less complex yeah yani um thank you and thank you for the work you 've done it is really great to the graphics in the detail and I do agree that you know really it as a model for how we approach some of the other areas so and i know that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residents around identifying their concerns and its really appreciated first question is are you looking at things like opportunities for the cycleways program to align with us if you were going through the option one we will do it whatever options we come up with we will look at what other works that we might require in those facilities great second question as just just trying to understand in terms of the the working party that 's been set up which I think it 's great that you 've got Sarah EQC insurer 's now working together on these issues but i just wanted to intern that probably it 's a question for the acting chief executive could we have like the chair of our environment committee put onto that working party so that we 've got some governance representation because I do i do think that there are it 's really good that you 're working together but I do think that we should be thinking about how we can have governance representation on that group so that we can get a feel as elected members if we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it we actually saw governance groups sitting above the work in broker party so we can work through that with you and then decide together what 's the best overall structure is just important to get the staff on to it quickly but you know within the next week or so a couple of weeks we can talk to you about how the government 's sits over the top or with them yeah I think I think it might have a certain view about here about yeah but I think I 'm but it 'd be really useful because I I 've now got other resonance and other localities don 't want to particularly around the eqc land remediation or the rebuilding of their houses they 're now starting to see the benefit of a cluster wide approach yeah but the gap that 's missing is there 's nowhere for them to go to talk to oh it feels definitely going on in the background and it has to form part of where we get to but we still got a weird way to go I 'm Glenn thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so I 'm interested in the accumulation of all the trivia trees and you 've identified obviously the confluence of Dudley creek with the avin thinking also about the issues and water effects for Avondale so in a high in a big event and everything is running high including the asian itself of course if you 've got some sort of projections of once it gets to that confluence that the effective yeah yeah yeahs that the avon river is an old Waimakariri you 've sort of breakout channel so it 's it 's got plenty or you know quite a lot of capacity and it 's lower reaches and as high reaches I think you would have seen a mat we 're getting a break out through here if its peak but down in the lower reaches below the confluence of doublespeak by and large there is sufficient capacity to deal with with the storm flies so in the stop being the point a whole point about the stop banks and that part of the river is to keep the tide out not too nice you know not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flows yeah reasonable confidence that yes you know we have capacity yep i think the context to the extra flows that we can get down to this channels it is quite small compared to well it 's actually when you 're down the river itself yeah okay and thank you and it 's awesome to see such detailed reports so quickly I think it 's done amazingly and just one question in relation to option two which is the more engineering type solution is that big investment under the ground actually insurable at prison while we would do we 'd go through our normal insurance processes and I 'm sure I talk to my colleague Peter to actually make sure that we do get all of those sort of things insured in the correct way yeah we will get some insurance we 're working with insurance yeah Andrew and Karen 6.2 refers to an appropriate level of engagement with the community and I appreciate this is work that we want to progress quickly and I certainly reiterate the comments made by the mayor and other councillors we really appreciate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really appreciate the work that you 've done clearly some of the information in the report and some of the information that needs to be presented to the community is quite technical in its nature and the implications certainly for some owners a significant can you just give us a little bit of information on how you 'll go about that community engagement what methods will be used yep so we 've got the next week we 've got to community even explained at Shirley boys high school there will be information sessions so wipe follow the same format exactly as our engagement with that community last year and that we came and listened and talk we will now be presenting this information to them will be having information areas within the hall so they 'll come in they 'll receive a presentation there 'll be parts of that all they can go to to talk to look at and talk to experts about the various components so option one option to what as a pump station look like what does you know so those those um so those aspects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that 's why we try to put some of those visuals in to the report because I think that 's a way of trying to get over what does this look like because we can talk in engineering speak and actually you 're right people won 't understand what we 're trying to say so pictures is usually a better way to try and get the messages over and I think that 's what we 're trying the line am I feeling is that you know if they want more than that they 'll get it so if we have two evenings and they say we need you back next week well we 'll go back next week yeah so whatever they knew they 'll get any other questions I 'll open the item up for debate yani okay Oh make just a very few points um sorry I should get a move on a second Pauline kata moves clean Livingston see Ian sorry okay I 'll just make a few points first is just to acknowledge the hard work that staff have put in to the significant issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by my colleagues but we do really appreciate it I think it 's really exciting to see finally a holistic joint up approach to dealing with some of the issues that have emerged post-earthquake and I I just can 't stress enough how important it is to take that illustrate view with local communities around what we need to do to get that the better outcomes going forward both from an environmental point of view but also from a resilience and a disaster reduction point of view so this is really exciting because for you know it feels like it 's a model going forward of joint up thinking joint up discussions and a joint up solution to the significant issues that these areas are facing and while this is the first year I know that there 's many other areas in this areas in the central city areas and some de Walter Linwood heath get there also will look forward to that joint up approach because that is how we get the best outcome for our community and ferocity going forward so really happy to support this going through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has has had a lot of positive feedback I 'm sure that when you look at the plans that have been presented today the community will also appreciate the level of detail that you 're going to take out to them and let them have a discussion about which options they see as being first so this is as I said I just think this is a great way forward and really supportive of this joint up approach thank you very much Paul in kata thank you in dump I agree with everything up yannis sit here the huge amount of that you 've done here and I know that the implementation is going to be enormous as well but I think we all realize that we live here in a swamp we never going to critique everybody from every single event every time but this will really help give the people in flopped in areas some surety and in your community engagement as well I mean that 's been exemplary there flopped on people who have nothing but the highest of regard and I think that 's really important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striving to achieve that people feel that they can speak they can be heard and this says we agreed will become a model that can overlay on the other areas that are also suffering and if the other neighborhoods can take heart from what the flockton people have done they have got together they 're smart they 're now missing data that they 're supporting each other they 're sharing experiences and information and they 're helping the staff to understand the issues it 's a two-way street so that would be a proactive way for them to get started and they can expedia at their own remediations so once again the city needs to know that we have teams here willing to work with people and in and we welcome in that community engagement so I 'll be supporting the recommendation thank you thank you i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very very much I 've just realized that I 've over Brian Makai he wasn 't on my list of

Brian Smith who 's a member of the committee baptism Yacht Club and I 'm Richard Michaela Commodore of the mouth isn 't Yacht Club and yes we were like yeah so you not Brian McCoy right you 're Brian and Mr McKay right thank you so so yes with your consent we do wishing to hark back to the previous discussion that we 've heard about most particularly the spot Park part of where the coastal pathway is likely to be going mothers in yacht club has had a 75 78 year actually residency of Scott park we are the lease holders of the south western half of the park and the coastal pathway must necessarily go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lease which runs for another 10 years or so in doing so I wanted to endorse the words that you 've heard from alan taylor from windsurf sorry wind sports association and therefore what i can say is emphatic and you 'll be relieved to learn commendably brief we are delighted that the postal pathway will go through skype park for the advantages that will bring to the citizens of christchurch and of course to ourselves and we support the alignment of the pathway that is shown on the main road master plan which has the crystal pathway running parallel and adjacent to the new main road and that is simply because we consider that to be by far the most safer option you have heard suggestions of an alternative option where the pathway would meander through the middle of Scott Park and we 're talking about a four meter pathway through the middle of a possibly perhaps a hundred meter wide Park and in doing so and the enduring pathway through the middle would create multiple points with a pathway and sport vehicular and pedestrian traffic would intersect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yacht Club will include cars towing trailers or suvs towing trailers some of the trailers will be likely to be trailer sailer size and there will be smaller dynnys on trailers and smaller dinghies rigging on one or other side of the pathway Scott park is a park for all water-related activities and club use will be supplemented to five public use particularly of the south ramp and the projected pontoon of a self rent which will be public facilities once the parkers landscaped we anticipate the use of the path to increase markedly and it is already used extensively at high tides during weekdays so the hazards I 'm outlining about the intersection of the traffic and the potential coastal pathway are an addition to those that were outlined to you by wins in sports association the main road draft master-planned acknowledges that the pathway can be expected to be used by walkers and i quote cyclist of all ages and abilities including people with mobility and sensory impairment or in the words of one respondent to the public consultation bikes trikes scooters prams strollers elderly and roller bladers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture of an adult on a bike with two children all with crash helmets on on the back of the bike and that is what we are concerned about we are not concerned about walkers walking through the pathway they are at liberty to roam through the park as they will and we welcome them what we are concerned are those strikes bikes scooters prams with one or more people on them after considering over two years civil options to improve safety the safest safest one is outlined in the draft in road the master plan and you have seen that and I won 't mention neck more main road master plan comments a balance needs to be struck between the various Park uses to make sure that the alignment of the pathway is safe and avoids conflict this is a view supported by map pleasant Yacht Club and our side of the bargain is there as least holders of the southern south western half of the park we would have pleasure in negotiating a variation to our deed at least that allows a coastal path way to travel parallel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an extensive public consultation that mr. Taylor has spoken about on the plan including the Scott Park adjustments a consultation that expressed an opinion amongst those who offered an opinion overwhelmingly favored published plan and therefore Mount Pleasant Yacht Club requests the council to ratify that published plan as it stands with the Scott Park part both in concept and in route and it is our limited view that sending the park planned by the coastal pathway plan and all the draft main road master plan to further hearings as recommended by the community board will do much to consume time but will do little to improve the consultative process thank you there any questions no questions ref mangie in terms of the the concern about cyclists coming through is there any way that we could just put up signs saying either if there is some activity boating activity going on let Sarah Saturday afternoon that cyclists dismount and walk the cycles through because it seems that most of the time there isn 't going to be activity going on there so at the times where there is activity why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismount certainly being widely discussed that that signs be erected or supplemented in fact by barriers and speed humps and so on and so forth which will probably do very little about the bike strikes and prams and seems to defy the concept of a coastal pathway which is a an open through route and I personally cannot see with the ability to for people to break out from the coast or pathway into the park at leisure where they will be extremely welcome why there is any particular issue with running the through route adjacent to the road what I mean wants to stop people cycling across there now just experience they don 't this grass there 's a variety of shingle they don 't please we use the same experience to know when they should be riding through full and and there will be no inhibition of course there will be no inhibition for people cycling across that that 's what they want to do but the temptation to do so and having to dodge your way around cars trucks but and boats and so on and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not actually congenial for cycling purposes okay but should I comment I mean the if you 've seen the park at the moment that is a post-earthquake demolition site and so we 're starting from scratch basically and so that 's why the the pathway is part of the land of final landscaping designed for the park needs to be built now thank you very much thank you and we 'll adjourn for morning tea and be back here at five minutes past eleven,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

but over to you Ellen thank you good morning I 'm here Vicky reputation will be half of the cannery win sports association we represent the windsurfing kitesurfing and standard paddle boards for Christ 's Church in Canterbury we 're here to basically endorse and fully support the coastal pathway planets authority and the main road plan we what I should like to thank the council for this ability to actually say thanks for allowing to speak here and by we 'd also like to thank them for their input in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan totally takes into account the green space allows us full access to the water for water sports users we believe that as a plan stands it 's effectively utilizes the whole area it allows us to safely enter a next to the water as windsurfers kiteboarders static paddleboarders it also allows full part to be accessed as a green space for any other community group the what we are a little bit concerned about as a group is the putting a pathway through the green space at the moment the plan is entirety as you can see you 've got in front of you is actually allows a massive grass green space it 's probably the only green space that has full water access to the history and we believe this should stand as it is what we 're concerned about is the laughing running through it cuts the park in half it will actually detract from the tractability of the path for the park we have been given examples on the country where the where parks were parts have gone through the sub of recreational reserves close with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handed to you that example was having used if you look carefully to the left hand side you 'll see that little 200s about 20 meters triple coastline if you look back to the left there 's another 400 meter strip of coastline that 's totally unhindered so there is an option for two areas with the coastal pathway the only uninhibited access to the water is Scott heart there is only place where we will have pure unadulterated grass excess of the beach where this concerns we turn over the page you will see that even a mission bay where there 's the path runs in and out to the beach and back what we 'd like to see is a pure unadulterated coastline that if we get the place like Maui where with surfing as a massive kite as a massive water sports we see the s3 in the future as being almost at nationally recognized water sports facility it 's a great water resource and by putting my maximize in the grass space we can actually maximize the potential to use the water with craft whether it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grass watching and if you look in place like Maui there is uninhibited grass as trees there 's something lovely shot at environment without pathways if you look straight out of this you can see the scott park on a busy day there is a lot of boats cars wind surfers and when you mix wind in with that you have a lot of equipment flying around having a pathway running through this will encourage non-educated users into the area which could hinder and inject safety concerns when you have a windsurfing rig a yacht sitting on the grass flapping away people respect their walk around if you put a pathway through that you 're suddenly giving the pedestrian the mental capacity they have right and if they trip over a windsurf board then we 're liable and what we want to do is just a lot access to part for everyone whether you 're walking or not but when it 's windy people will realize that it is still an area that you need to take care putting a pathway through their respective barriers the pedestrian will always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it could cause conflict which we have experienced in the past basic submission I mean as far as safety concern we are we to be safety conscious but we don 't want to take on the responsibility of having public people walking through the area and you know dealing with equipment and obviously as far as a community-based area we feel grass best service community you can have picnics you can kick the ball on it between dealing using windsurfing a pathway we 've measured it it 's 800 square meters of asphalt in the middle of a park to me that 's personally is not a very green or effective use of green space and as the solutions have shown that we 've already had that majority that people actually agree with the current plan in place and a very small percentage of objected to it so I believe in a moment the plan should go through its entirety and they should not lead to be any more hearings over this matter thank you thank you very much um any questions the question ok thank thank you very very much and let 's stir them Oh,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Tim Lindley chair of the Christchurch coastal pathway group and then start on project coordinator nothing thank you i right good morning mayor and councillors today is a very special day because today in front of you is the revised concept plan for the coast to its coastal pathway revised after extensive community consultation we wish to encourage council to endorse and accept the revised concept coastal coastal pathway plan because doing so will allow the project to move on to procurement and maintain the momentum that we already have in place with the city changing project it 's been a pretty exciting eight months it 's been a pretty exciting eight months for the coastal pathway project we 've had the opening of the first street to the pathway and that was a lot of fun wasn 't it was great we 've had the signing of the Memorandum of Understanding between council the Christ coastal pathway group and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Council that that MOU is working very effectively it 's a living document we are having weekly meetings with the project called project manager and and it 's it 's just fantastic how well it 's going and we are also working on how the structures in the future will work for managing and governance of the project as it moves forward we also wish to commend council for the appointment of Erik henna path as the manager of the coastal pathway project we 've found working with Eric to be truly inspirational and he has so much to offer and bring so much to the project in terms of his wisdom in how to manage these projects well but also in terms of his ability to keep the project moving forward without anju waste of time or of money now the coastal pathway as you know is a is aimed to be a multi-user facility and we expect that during most of daylight hours along the pathway there will be things happening there will be people out enjoying themselves like these youngsters here but there will also we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do things classrooms coming to the pathway and lots of stuff happening we expect that the pathway will indeed be a very busy place as it becomes a major attraction for the region we 're also very interested in its potential for assisting movement of people now this may be as simple as lists dead taking kids to go and visit granny but if the coastal pathway is properly connected to the envisaged to the envisaged cycleways we may even see a return of teenagers from our suburbs being able to bike to school safely and that would be a fantastic advantage in terms of this this particular plan the concept plan that 's being presented there are a couple of issues which have have drawn special attention and I want to talk briefly on both of those because the first stage of procurement will be the for us will be the appointment the seeking an appointment of an experienced landscape architect skilled in multi user pathways and familiar with international best practice the first of these two areas is at Red Cliffs park now if you notice these these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original concept planned in it and the big one on the left you see bird-watching as a major activity the history has changed since the earthquake I 'm a regular history user and one of the things that 's happened is that with the uplifting of the coastal pathway end of the estuary there seems to be much more activity from wading birds and since the consultation it 's being drawn to our attention that birds are using the costal margin especially around ricklefs Park and so what we would like is that the the landscape architect who will be appointed following procurement is able to further enhance the amenity values of this area and to work on the design to maximize the ability of pathway users to enjoy bird-watching and I suspect that doesn 't mean just sitting in hides watching it means walking past and enjoying the waiting and also to ensure that the birds themselves are not unduly disturbed the other area that 's drawn particular focus during this the consultation process is Scott Parker and you 've heard one deputation on that already now I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is strongly in favor of watersports we wished the we wish to help people encouraged be encouraged to take up water sports and yachting and when serving and I myself was a windsurfer in the 1970s and 80s and I know full well the buzz that that sport gets however the impression that 's been created is that there is going to be necessarily a conflict of interest and a potential safety risk if the path meanders through Scott park and intrudes on to the grass area and I think it 's worth we 're thinking that when surfing and water sports happen mostly during the weekends as the busy time and only happens during high tide and in fact if you observe the st you you will find that more than ninety percent of the time during the week with a coastal pathway will be being used there is no water sports activity happening and and of course during the winter months it 's more or less one hundred percent we 're also concerned that locating the coastal pathway directly alongside the road and between the road and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pathway will be confronted with vehicles coming into the into scott spark off a busy road now I don 't propose to suggest what your solutions to those might be but I would very much like when our landscape athletic disappointed that they have the ability to look at both the ricklefs area and Scott Park and consider whether amenity values be improved by designs that perhaps nobody yet has built off so in winding up we do strongly commend the endorsement to you and you 'll notice that that is also supported by no Tahu there is a letter that counselors will have received from MKT in support of the coastal pathway and we do ask that the acceptance is the adoption of the concept plan is such that our landscape architect will have some ability to further improve the amenity values for all users at Red Cliffs beach and it 's got paid thank you we 've got another minute so there any questions no questions okay thank you very much for your Russian 880 10 urbanus group or ATT memnos group Melinda it 's the minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard back that the deputation had been approved so she 's no longer gonna be making a deputation but that she had seen an email round with some concerns okay dinky oh I 'll get a copy of that print it off and circulated run it would be great thank you so Topsy rule nope so that could also be the same all right I 'll move on to Clause 13 item to report of community committee supply of services agreement world buskers festival trust gotcha Franco cheapest and world buskers festival trust try to come forward good morning my name is sir chief Franco I 'm the chair of the world buskers festival trust in to my left is stephen hester who has been on the buskers festival trust or involved with the festival for the last 14 years we 're representing the other trustees there 's six of us in total and I think you 'll find that we will reasonably experienced and have a fairly good understanding of festivals and the funding requirements that go forward what I would like to say is this paper that presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Jodi right who was the founder of the world buskers festival and we 've had thanked in general she supports all of those clear the key points that around mind the fundamental structure and rationale for this paper is to look at the approach and the way the festival has run what we 're looking for is to have a single clear line of responsibility to deliver a festival for Christchurch that continues to rank is the highest satisfaction festival in Christchurch and we want to make sure that we put the structures in place to ensure that that continues to happen in the future obviously since the earthquakes just by way of kind of background the festival used to be around about a million dollars to run just over a million dollars and currently last this year 's festival 2014 was just over 2.4 million dollars so the impact of the earthquakes has been substantial and we 've had to create an entire environment in the park this enables those 300,000 visitors in the 650 shows that put on each festival so the reason for the paper is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clear single line of responsibility against a robust in fairly clear statement of intent as well we 're seeking some extra funding in terms of assisting in their transition from the park structure taken back into a street festival as well as ensuring that we have got all of the appropriate transfer of knowledge in building and some extra redundancy around the creative direction and the support the other supporting services so any questions please it 's right any questions refugee yeah hi there and so why should the counts will be supporting this festival you own it it 's been running for the last 21 years it 's as I said before the most successful and most well-liked festival of the city puts on I think your investment on a per person visitor basis is under a dollar so it 's probably one of your best returning festivals in terms of satisfaction as well a good return on investment I think you 'd say really okay and so why should we be giving you an extra hundred thousand dollars to ensure that the festival continues to rate as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well recognized globally if we have something like about 50 different buskers coming of which I think about 15 20 of them are from overseas we recognized globally as being a very good festival and throughout New Zealanders recognized as the very best festival so we want to maintain it and continue to develop it and evolve it I mean do you think council should be involved in only and delivering festivals that 's outside of my mandate you made the decision several years ago to buy the festival if you want to disinherit that 's fine that 's outside of my mandate I 'm sorry thanks part of the funding for the hundred thousand is for moving moving it back from the park into the central city and that 's going to be a complicated process and we 're looking for a transition manager to work with a current staff so that that can go as seamlessly as we possibly can do and it 's a changing environment the city you know what 's open in the city and months from now is uncertain and we have to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do that we have to we need additional funds very good thank you very much thank you very much for for bringing your dictation here we 'll deal with that item when we when we get to the committee report thank you very much thank you in on that basis I will now move on to item 23 the","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Turner that they are significantly in seriously unsafe causing serious injury and death John Higgins and as I said we 're involved right from the start they allowed the race be built illegally we alluded to them at the very outset when we noticed the curves being built too narrow for ever since then they have been fighting against the residents to allow these roads to be built retrospectively consented not a notified without any public notification of all of the non-compliances and dangers and then they have tried to vest these dangerous roads to the council to the ratepayers they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done nothing wrong all the way through they shouldn 't be handling this matter they 're conflicted they cause the dangers still linda 's matter they are telling you that everything is normal and it 's normal all these dangers and roads that they were trying to vest with the ratepayers why I noticed that councillor johansson arts questions that 's some quick at 22 the acting chief executive and to Terry house the manager they were actually in the room which is off roading at the time these roads were being built there conflicted as well I noticed that the acting chief executive there in refuted the fact that the road run safe so effectively denied our dr. Turner 's so suggest to the council or the elected members that it 's the staff that are conflicted and this they 've created this problem think that you basically are just accept that this is a problem they say at three point one four of the year our recommendations to you that it is not correct or plausible they 're independent people were involved with coerced to support the position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence on that the first document I am I believe that 's fine for me my apologies that 's right it would cost you five dollars in the informal meeting these these documents here are documents to so-called independent are planners etc you 'll see the names and these are all the dress the likes of that John Gibson Sean would John Higgins 's and the these as well as we go through of highlighted them in yellow basically John Gibson he was he was advocating for the illegal constructions of the roads he was then out there getting independent planners to agree what had already happened so this is just to show you that these exist these are invoices from the independent people to the content of John Gibson etc traffic engineers and planners there I 'll go to the next document which is just a further detail of how these things happen this is an email between Mike Mora and a traffic engineer Tim right Tim Wright was approached by John Gibson in John Higgins visited and he wasn 't asked if he could do a safety audit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased traffic he they both went to see Tim right they said can you review this road network here but do not review this safe

rating me what I 'm trying to be all that you can but aren 't you conflicted in terms of the recommendation of the castle is about paying money to you personally no I 've actually made my artist an application to make a deputation here as a concerned member of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're debating today I actually asked to have two deputations today one as a as an affected resident and also asked to have a deputation as a general member of the public as a concerned citizen so what Klaus are you making a deputation on well it would be appear to be the second one very which is the second one what school is are you making a digital me and may I carry off a deputation I find us is just quite distracting and it 's not really helping anybody I want to get to the bottom of what 's happening here I think that what I think what the deputy mirrors raising is because we 're going to be focused on a recommendation that comes through from the record and what Graham community board to reimburse you personally for costs and so this that that 's the issue that we 're debating today and I am still in through this is a relevant to it I can 't understand why I 've been interrupted here I wasn 't doing anything wrong here apart from and we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there it 's just that what you 're going into now appears to be detail around the issue rather than why you should be reimbursed cop well this is why I should be reimbursed costarred heaven teaching Lee cost us this money can I warn you just again please be very cautious about what you 're saying about staff yes because you are not protected against the laws of deformation in this environment yes so just I 'm please be very good and I thank you for that i have no consumer wants to because everything i can say i can prove i have been in front of the council before and called some of the lawyers that they 've had commissioned in I read I really you know caution you not use I will rule you out of all if you use language which is an appropriate for this environment suit thank you I appreciate that thanks very much so this this is an email to two muy macho just grim late and had copies but he theory this is an email from Mike Moore to to Tim right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what has briefed was Tim rights tells Mike thanks for your email we were commissioned by the environment policy and unit approval unit melbourne ash was the planner and my point of contact but we did have an earlier meeting with both john higgins and john gibson where the scope of my review assessment was agreed yes there we could actually good thanks now the scope that was agreed was that he would review the roads but not that particular narrow section of the spine ray which we all know is dangerous he wasn 't going to be given the commission unless he agreed to do this we agreed the scope beforehand and then he was later phoned by mel nash to take it on these are matters that are very very concerning obviously if those roads were vested and that dangerous statement was found that the council had intentionally not reviewed them and then you 've got to remember after this they actually advised the commissioner they that he had reviewed these roads now if people had died on those roads because they weren 't safe the council could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they knew the roads didn 't comply and they made sure that the the evidence of the non-compliance didn 't come through specifically by getting the the engineer not to review them now I I was very concerned about this I phoned the traffic engineer Tim term right and had a discussion with about it because there was gaps in the review that i read that came through the Environment Court decision are very concerned that the specific bit of Road had not been reviewed it just didn 't show up in the in the review at all what 's her right had done he had reviewed every road around the commercial application including in a decision one kilometer away and he hid it referred specifically to what they call a rat run which was a run road running to the east of the commercial development because traffic comes through that to get there so creates what the corner retro well the spine road going to the south as a far bigger rep run it 's got a whole lot more traffic on it there 's a hole bigger commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the the rat runs the south is a lot bigger and he completely didn 't talk about that so I 'll just read a weave it from the conversation I had with them I stated to I see you 've got seven thousand three hundred vehicles on an eleven point five meter carriageway void of cycle lanes etc that 's obviously considering two people living in here I noticed you didn 't comment too much further in there other than to say that they the cycle lane should be there Tim right responded sure are you talking about the missing link between delaware and delamayn i can 't remember sorry the subdivision to the south and the commercial area I said yes that 's right Tim Wright says I was specifically told basically not to go there in terms of the scope that I was able to advise I says right he said yep I said so you were told directly because it seemed like you were specifically told that from reading at the review they 'll talk about because you sort of mentioned it should be there cycling but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says here you must have read between the lines year no year a year I was told specifically to keep my car it 's only in relation to the subdivision before the commercial part with gear right through the commercial part so I that goes on there just another couple of paragraphs down there Tim responds to me again after I 've said to him we 've got some concerning issues there because we don 't know who 's going to be liable for any future injuries and deaths like the timothy drive one that type of thing tim says years sure year hey I 've read some of your stuff Cologne I have to say this off record I do agree with a lot of the things you 've said and I was asked obviously only to provide advice that I saw fit for the specific area for the that specific section of the road through the newly consented commercial development but I do share your concerns etc that is confirmation from Tim right that he specifically was told not to review those that 's dangerous piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just to confirm what I 'm talking about there this is a google map of the subdivision and if it comes up there what we 're talking about is that that road that 's running from the middle top slightly down to the left to the bottom he 's talking about ninety percent of that road there was not reviewed the only but that was reviewed was a little bit at the top which is y oldest road the top to the first road going off to the right all the rest of that road going down to where it gets a bit brighter white and to delamayn that wasn 't reviewed but yet the Commissioner was told it had been reviewed in terms of traffic loads etc these are the types of things that I 've been fighting for for years which is what its cost the residence ni a lot of money it 's fighting against staff members like this that just ignore everything that we say and then they come up with these what they call independent views to say they 've done nothing wrong I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of Tokay I 'll make it very quick just for another example this is this is certain the Simpson grace and review that 's referred to once again this is a voice from them you will see in here that the people referred to in this John Gibson Brent pezzi you see Peter Mitchell 's no Navin these effectively what happened Simpson grace and gets the briefing from staff and he 'll do a draft review they 'll get it back it 'll be given to Peter Mitchell and the like and they will decide whether it 's going on the right track then they 'll ask him to add things to suit what they want effectively this review Simpson Grayson was done to defend what the staff had done the very staff that were defending themselves for allowing these roads to be built were Peter Mitchell and John Gibson n bread pudding and John Higgins the very people that created these mistakes other ones soliciting these reviews to defend themselves it 's they 're completely conflicted yet they are the ones that are actually getting legal reused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime you get a lawyer to defend you he 's only representing you and that 's what 's happened so that 's why we 've got to the situation now where we 've got these dangerous roads that that Peter matures told the last council don 't get a safety audit done on these that 's the staff recommendation now we know if we hadn 't got that done would have had dangerous roads vested with the council so I think that 's probably enough now okay well what would overthrown up the disabled as far as the costco head the council notified us as they had to under resource management at because we 're affected parties dangerous roads that cause death do have adverse effects we 're affected by these they 're trying to close our excess off so we drive through these dangerous roads the council staff refused to bring us into the Resource Management Act process so we were never parties its season here that we work we are not parties you 're not reimbursing someone that was party to the resource monette we were denied we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get hurt and we weren 't and that 's why we have had these costs because council staff refused to now if your vote is to not reimburse the residents that have gone through this hole if this terrible experience with the staff if you vote to not reimburse us it 's a vote to to basically tell the staff spend hundreds of thousands of dollars trying to cover up your mistakes and oppressing the public so you 're by not voting to reinvest you 're saying what they 've done is absolutely right do it again and that 's not the message we want ratepayers want their council elected members to represent the ratepayers not to protect the staff or particular bureaucracy you know if the theft unroll they need to admit it and fix it they shouldn 't put people like us through this this miss for four years thank you lose their lives Thank You mr. state 's thank you we 'll move on to the next item on the agenda which is petitions","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Boards,5fFI-rq0n7Y,20140312,515.7090000000001,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1494,"the twenty-fourth of februari now we 've actually dealt with that report we 've moved and cigna with it 's all been dealt with oh yes we 're just moving on to that so I 'm just gonna I was going to invite andrea to speak to it and and then we 'll get a mover and a seconder for it Oh so um yes it 's just regarding that intersection emotions Road Marie how Road you probably know it can be quite an early little piece of road we we meet and we 're very happy with the the plane that they have put forward can 't see what page it 's on but it 's in your report however we did have a deputation from Phillip keys and aus key and he owns the Vigilant shop and murray hill road and the proposed site of the where they were going to relocate the buses to was was literally right at his entrance way to his premises he was very concerned about the impact that that a that would help on his parking for his excuse me for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming in and out of the of his car parking area because they would then have to also never get past the bus to be able to see clearly down the road we got advice though that he can are currently reviewing the buses forgive you because there was in one direction there was only an average of one point nine passengers a day I think we were using that stop in in the other direction with a 3 point something they won 't with very very small number of people were actually using their bus stop so it can we 're going to do a review as to whether they even need the bus stop and whether that bus route can be realigned up to with the new Preston 's subdivisions going to be yeah so so we made the decision after quite some debate to approve the rest of the proposal but to hold off on those bus stops until he can have done their their review down on each side of the road I thought it was the I got all confused at the airport so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the combined forward I was just idea was get the northern side of the military so would someone like to move there so we 've got people on offer and Glenn Livingston so that covers both both wards is there any discussion on that Jonnie Johansson I know what you 're going to say yeah just a question of stuff well we 've got a t-intersection we were putting in more traffic lights do we have any criteria for doing anything other than just putting traffic lights and when things get developed because I mean I have to say I 'm just I mean I 'm just over the fact that every time this is development the only solution is traffic lights and again i invite you to drive down blenheim road drive down at lincoln road it 's not a solution so I think this one isn 't cool to it particularly subdivisions around that area it 's a long-standing problem with that intersection of safety there 's been the significant people turning right into Mary how right off Martians road take an extraordinary amount of risk crossing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back on to marshalls road but my understanding is it 's not real in relation to development so so again is there any wider strategic traffic planning that 's been done in this area so that we don 't get Martians road turning into the blenheim rate of the north what did I have a concern as well that we 're doing this section of Martians road quite piecemeal so this is Mari high road then we 're doing Preston 's and then next off the block is slower sticks which we 're giving a joint meeting about next week or so and I don 't know why hasn 't all come together being because they 're so close in time to being developed why can 't they all come together and give us more of a global view of the block an answer something quick in terms of paul bailey probably help me out here but in terms of options for particular intersections yeah there are a range of options that we we look at in terms of design for those intersections and in a sense traffic lights becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to both the safety as the ball chair said and also the capacity and the movement of vehicles and in this particular case lights is the most appropriate solution for this intersection you look at roundabouts you look at all sorts of things but in this particular case the lights and the lights is the most appropriate in this particular location in terms of that wider aspect of the network we look at the much wider Network we have a we have a transport model a traffic model which actually looks at the whole city and therefore looks at all of the intersections and we plug in all of the new subdivisions that are coming along into that model to an order that we get the right network and the right approach in terms of the capital projects there are a number of projects along Martians road which been identified in the long-term plan for many years that needed to be upgrade so the lower sticks road is actually looking at renewing the bridge as well as redoing the intersection there so there are a number of things but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ route and the most appropriate solutions are being put forward for each of the locations tab it yes I can concur with Terry 's analysis about traffic lights being the best solution for this particular intersection it 's a major egress for people out of tomorrow park in parklands and at times and peak hour traffic in the morning you could have traffic bank right back to to the pier at hospital trying to get out onto Martians roads so I don 't see any other solution other than traffic lights that would cure that problem and ultimately perhaps the the northern motorway extension through to full pots Road area and qe2 drive will take the pressure off Martians Road but we 're taking the pressure off Martians road with that but then we are also in a position where traffic is increasing with the the oncoming people in prisons development particularly we 're going to have another 2,000 old homes in there and people will be coming out of but Murray Hill Road and Preston 's road onto Martin 's road and we 're in the process at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Road Martin 's Road which was a huge huge source of congestion and a bottleneck for traffic coming into the city so I actually think that the traffic lights at prestons road and Murray Hill Road well if anything actually benefit the flow of traffic through that area and that I me know that I kind of know the area really really well so I think the issue with both my toe end with lower sticks or the lack of alignment across the across Martian Road which actually makes it often particularly challenging for people who come you know from down mighty high road turn left and then right onto my deho road again you know you can get the the banking up at that level as well so and it is having it yeah in a way that the whole flow is going to change once the northern arterial comes down so yeah I think we need to reflect that what 's happening there is happening very quickly the growth and development it wasn 't part of our long-term plan a number of years ago in essence we would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were in a very rural type of location but since the earthquake that 's changed things dramatically and therefore there is a big change happening on that Network yeah and it 's the speed of the change as well all right i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you thank you very much thank you and then we move on to item number oh we need to go back to item number 14 just to address the

Board,09_u5d1LTTE,20140312,1211.8,"Christchurch, New Zealand",3084,board meetings we 've got three of those through the februari 17 februari and we have a joint meeting of the board Pegasus and sharing company community boards of the 24th of fear februari which in itself contains a part a report so let 's deal with the dude and the 17th of every together and i 'll invite andrea to give us a snapshot of what 's happening and be with Pegasus cool great thank you so the third was just a pretty standard media wasn 't really anything that I can see in there that 's particularly relevant to bring up today on the seventeenth probably the one thing that is when I raise would be the maintenance of public owned s it 's in new brighton seems to be a ongoing year after year thing the community board ask the council to improve its levels of service they agree verily but then after month that 's back to the same old so we 're we 're working on that one i think that that was really that I 'm we 've got the community advisory group has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first meeting in about a week and a half will be probably seeing better that they can learn the papers to following the media following it quite closely yep I 'm clean lovingston if I may offer just by way of coming with actually asked for we want to know what the specific levels of service are with you brighten in comparison with other suburbs we were dealing with perception and or reality so we want to know that the actual facts so we 've requested this through the community board advisor this information from staff over whether a new brighton is receiving actual you know this the levels of service it sure is but to deal with it that 's yeah it 's it could be that we do look to improve but at the moment we 're seeking their information okay jaani given that there was nearly a month ago have you received that information okay all right though because I think it 's a really important point and at the Finance Committee we are getting levels of service being failed to be mere around some of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can I just can we ask the acting see just to chase up that real quest and circulate it to all elected members because I think that 'd be really useful for us to know I think it 's two issues there 's levels of service that we 've said there 's a levels of service that we 're not meeting and then there 's actually they 're monitoring to ensure that what 's happening is being done and I suspect that some of the work that we have set as levels of service isn 't happening so it 's not it 's not a case of the levels of students being different it 's a case of how we 're monitoring those contracts and might also be that that circumstances have changed so if there are circumstances that have changed we need to know what they are because I remember I can 't remember his name who used to go around and collect all the rubbish on a monday morning who had a you know part-time contract with i think through the new brighton business association so you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are not not your usual sort of external contractor but very much an internal local community group taking care of themselves but was council support and that i really like that option david s in something just to it to alert members that say and something i 've attended in this morning 's paper there was an issue of regarding our fishing on the pier and particularly crab potting now that 's an issue just drawing people 's attention it was probably going to raise its ugly head a bit more as we go on there 's probably a commercial activity that 's happening down there and I 'm thinking that we 'll have to address that issue in some fashion or other and in the coming months yep there any other issues because I 've got one I was slightly annoyed to read the alpine view living village having to come back years again for another crack at the council to extend the speed limitation outside the alpine view living village we have known about this extension this requirement to extend the protection of the 50k area for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait for a for april 2014 we we we should be progressing this as a matter of urgency we 've got Preston 's development coming in and it 's just nonsense that we 've got people tuning and 280 page record from two areas the Alpine view subdivision well their retirement village which is now extended across the road and also the small subdivision which is called know yet way to Kerry 's whytekear he 's still in the 50k eerie area it 's that one on the left as you 're going out of do it yeah it 's a smoke here come on starts worth sounds like but you know the one that I mean local councillors yes anyway no that 's right I 've got quite brain to so but but the point is is that there are two exits on to the ATK area and this could be easily it 's just note that that it 's but people are speeding up when they get to when by the time they get to their intersection or that T intersection they are they are speeding so so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I read this I thought it would be a good idea that we get an urgent report on this the public consultation I you know understand that we have to go through a public consultation to change speed limits but this one has been on the radar for more then two and a half years so it 's just got to get done as a matter of urgency yeah I mean April 27 we 're ready set the agenda for our next meeting april 2014 is only a month away all this is for this just to prove that undertale consultation I don 't know me my query that do we have to consult fit this meeting yeah we do if there 's a legal requirement around changing the speed limits yeah so the other thing I want to raise toe is that we 've had advice from staff that it only qualifies as a 60k area we asked them to go back and try and go that I think there 's enough of a special case to make it a 50 but we 're not sure how we got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up I did slow it down slow it I 'd like to speed up the slowing down can i seduce that we actually do that I mean this is an issue here it 's an issue wherever there are new subdivisions because they come from 800 k zones and suddenly there is a residential subdivision and the slowing down of the roads around them is way way too slow I asked him to TA about this and apparently we have the power to set the speed limit because I had wrongly been blaming them but I think that what local roads but not not NZTA highway right su so that I think we just ask that counts will start the process of lowering the speed limit yes fastest but as soon as possible yep yep I agree so yep so do we need a resolution of counsel I think if we get a resolution of council then so I would like to move that the that council staff are approved to undertake public consultation on a speed limit change and the area described in 1.1 so 250k per hour and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that zone to include the Preston 's bigger subdivision yeah I mean it may be the rest of Preston 's road needs to be as well but this this area is urgent we are lucky we haven 't had you know a significant crash yeah I 'm supporting the intention i 'm just think it will be helpful for us as a council to get some comment though from the traffic engineers over here that we are on the right track in terms of clarifying what we want don 't know if any all right oh my lord yep Paul Paul bearden welcome yes a forbidden Road corridor operations manager um so it 's big reviews are speed limits are reviewed every two years because it 's quite a laborious process to capture everyone 's requests and review them all in accordance with the very strict guidelines that are placed before us why is ETA so part of that process requires us to look at a number of different factors that affect people 's speeds one of the key things to keep in mind when setting speed limits is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're setting speed limits that deemed by the general motoring public to be inappropriate for that particular zone then the police have very big difficulty trying to keep speeds down to that lower limit when the surrounding Road environment is telling the motorist perhaps they should be going faster so you can imagine the analogy of putting a 50k sign up in a very rural road it 's unlikely that most motorists would reduce 250k they 'd keep going at this they felt comfortable with so 50 very careful that we set of proprietary Minh sand that 's why we take quite considerable time working out looking at all the factors to see yes the slower speed limit is in fact appropriate for this particular zone so when was the last time you consulted about this area I 'm not sure when we 've consulted about it was more than two years ago wasn 't it I don 't know okay well then maybe we do need a report on it David and then Glenn subdivision is the limes sorry the socket lines the lines but I mean really this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an athlete in a rural area is not really even appropriate because you come around pass barrel at hospital plus the landfill road to pass the lime subdivision first the alpine view residential area white a kiri subdivision on the other side of the road it is all urban built-up area until you go past those things I could imagine you know some consternation of having the 50 month 50k sign well past that but these areas are all substantially built-up areas and have been now for the last two or three years all these people want to do is to shift the 50-meter sign from halfway around the bend in the middle of nowhere by the lines to about 100 meters past the alpine view but now we also have pressed and subdivision coming online there will be people moving into those houses within the next few weeks I 'd imagine so the whole of Preston 's road we 've got traffic lights going in at marcin 's road I can 't OSU them is frustration I can 't see why we have to wait such a long time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existing development and a whole lot of new houses some of them to no it houses hundreds of which are being built now and we 're going to have to wait another year ridiculously clean thank you while I might normally support Phil 's push for a report I think in this case there 's a unique case given that different dynamics coming together it 's one of the main feeder routes for demolition in the city so all the city 's demolition that goes here and not to Cape fairly goes past these roads elderly people live here Davis just mentioned that so we 've got both demolition and construction I think it 's a strong case actually to make an exception and to do what the message is ting and cut through some red tape or the other question that we could ask as as could the could the signpost for the for the limit be moved further up the road so it is beyond the Alpine view entrance and and matching on the other side so that we 've got cars not speeding up until their past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other side that 's slowing down as they enter their area if we could have that on a temporary basis because we 've got temporary 30k areas all round the city that we are not subject to the same rules as nzta in terms of consultation around even temporary changes put those in place and start the consultation on the whole of preston 's right I mean is that possible that 's certainly possible but i 'm not advocating that we do that I 'm advocating that and I 'm not disagreeing with what you 're saying about it it not being timely that we get on to this and look at it quicker all I 'm saying is that there 's a process to follow and processes don 't necessarily have to take two years if we agree it 's timely to do that now that we can look at that particular instance now we can see what we can do to get that moving as quickly as possible what I 'm strongly advising against as is suggesting that it should be 50 and it should be there and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me would undermine the process that we 've set in place making sure that we 're getting appropriate speed limits so what about that that council staff report back to report to council so we 're going to lift up here so to really send the message that we we want this to be resolved on options for both temporary and permanent speed limit she speed limit changes to the ear you know so yeah speed limit changes to the areas to the area described yeah so take all those words out leaving the word described yeah um yeah what yeah on options yeah and then that that puts us within our thing now we went we need a deadline date that the suggestion is that that be that comes straight here on the tenth of April which means that as a community board Andrea you could you could get an update prior to the meeting but we 've already got it on our agenda as a as I recommend as a report with a recommendation great is that right yes so that that staff report to Council on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area described in item 18 point 1 point 1 on page 115 of the agenda and and just to make that crystal clear that means the option of moving the the signs on a temporary basis to the to the you know the outer reaches of the of the what do you called the entrance and exit of the you know that the yeah the egress of the is egress and ingress oh but anyway to the to the big he 's which is why I 've said temporary and permanent I mean temporary changes they could do this tomorrow they could pick up those signs and move them tomorrow I mean I I have got some background on this because I made this request and I know I made this request more than two years ago so it is it was a degree of frustration that led me to read that in fact it has still not been resolved and I was told the reason it couldn 't be dealt with more than two years ago was that they had just consulted on the on the area that on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasn 't necessary to make the changes but the area has been significantly built up since then the traffic has significantly built up since then and in fact what has built up since then is exactly what Glen lovingston identified which is the the waste that has been taken unto the and to the bottle Lake area so so i 'll put know somebody would like to seek in there David East I 'll pop the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you so that turned out to be not a bully party so did we put the motion on the on the whole thing did we all right okay right so we 've dealt with it so think now we move on to the like

Committee,SpOYE9GkhxU,20140312,587.079,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1566,or if we need do we need Peter 's Peter not sure at all there might be some assistance required but we 've got canceled a ref man G who I assume is going to move this and I 'll second dirt I think that the dignity mirror very fun okay that 's good all right so has anyone got any questions of of Peter I might have invited you for no reason and did we sort the other matter can we scroll up it was that it was I know that you went here early but I flipped through a note on it that I thought that Phil clear water is going to move in ammendment too but I 'll just fled what I was going to move I mean I was going to be in 35 it was just that it just seems to me that if the whole committee are involved in the appointment of the independent additional committee members that that involves everybody in the committee just seemed to me that besides the mere and Rev that in fact the whole committee be involved sit because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one of them will be the chair neither earth nor I will chair the meeting what you 're saying is you 'd like the other committee members to just approve the independent appoint appointments what what are the other independent what are the other members think is that something they want to the day I don 't really care either way yeah the the committee will be formed from the day of the council passes resolution because you 've got the commit dekalb regulation is to appoint the committee you 've got council all members when did on to the committee so and there are enough people that the committee can formally meet if it wish to do so okay you 've then got the issue of the three externals including the appointment of so technically the committee could meet and councillor clear would have proposed to choose if the council wish to do okay so so that so that the mirror and counsel them mangy propose propose three independent persons as members of the committee including one of those independent pieces as the chairperson of the committee or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just this is like when we did the ordering councillors just quick or your point certain members of the committee to carry out some function if the other members of the committee are happy to do so if the other members of the committee feel like they want to have a say in that process then I 'm fine I 'm time with it that 's not an issue is just to save time REE I me ultimately the mayor 's got the powers to a point any committees she sees fit so it 's yeah that 's fine I mean I think the other the other committee members will be quite happy with the way things up but I 'm happy to have them formally approved the independent members at the same time okay so that the that the council report point point ease be authorized boards it 's really a point I mean I mean it 's just an animal layer of well can I speak I just certain if the other committee members are fine okay with the way it is right understood it in fact there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I don 't mind whatever works if there 's no strong wish to change it I 'm okay with how it does they do thank you although can we take out the second batch and the 3.5 right at the beginning yep yani yeah I 'm kind of sorry I think it 's I think counselor maggie has done a really good work around getting a new audit and risk structure that is going to be a lot more hopefully significant there in the past but I do think it 's important because this is doing a really critical role for the that council that we all have confidence and they 're independent people that are appointed so I you know I 'm happy for the mayor and council made you to go and do the work and identify people I do think it 's important that we as a collective have the opportunity to confirm those people they are actually doing an incredibly important job for us as a collective and I just you know I do think it 's important that we endorse those people in some way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it the first meeting of the well I mean it 's just the setting up them setting up a meeting so that we can confirm people to join the meeting I mean it 's just yeah we can have to remember that the people that we 're talking to these are highly special specialized roles yeah people from the commercial sector and you know the reality is there 's very few people around the counsel table you 've got the experience to even investigate the process so it 's a it is a highly specialized committee I 'm happy for the rest of the committee to approve it but we 'll do that anyway because we 'll sit down and talk about who we r planning to a point so I 'm happy with the way it is now I think that 's fine no I think what 's really important to remember is that we had to have a high degree of trust and confidence in our colleagues and these roles and I you have to be able to delegate as well there is just no way that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do so I support what Rafe is saying as well and I have total confidence in the mirror and ref and others involved in making the right decision so um I mean do you want to move air no I 'm not going moving the other I just reiterate yannis point the whole thing about this is this is one of the most important committees as council hears and it 's just that we make sure we have the process is right I 'm okay the counselor okay with this process and i certainly thank you for the work you 've done to date we have what i would say again I mean this is going to be a work in progress so at any time if councillors feel like they want to come along and want to you know propose any amendments the committee they 're free to do that yeah I think I think that I mean the debate that I wanted to have on this as Herot how great it was that that the council was finally taking ownership of the audit and risk responsibilities that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a governance perspective this is an excellent move and I too want to congratulate counselor managing for the work that he 's put onto this but the idea that we will have not just the financial risks on our radar at all times it 's all of the risks that any council would be identifying as something that we need to be alert and aware of our response to so I 'm really keen on this and you know think that it 's a really really good move forward and i think that the response publicly will be that this council was taking responsibility for the role that it has to play in a governor sense so we had the auditor-general down last week and we 're actually ahead of the curve in terms of what they 're looking at so you know this is an opportunity for us to kind of prepare the next model for how risk management is managed at the local government level I think others will look to our Council and see the way forward this is not a subcommittee this is a committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'll put the motion just saying it if you 're well if you 're saying that as a committee it just is that it 's a subcommittee of the air are you saying that it 's no longer going to be a subcommittee it 's just in the obits a mistake 3.1 as a mistake just makes it I don 't know we were sunday shows wow you 're a services subcommittee sorry yeah yeah we are we 're setting up which is why the reporters in the National atopica should be a pepper because we 're ascending a previous motion than reporters in the name of the acting chief executive lately and I think it 's a great model so welcoming out and looking for right okay thank you i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you the ocurro of water treatment and supply designation the report that you should refer to,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Programme,olCLjV7PasQ,20140305,573.63,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1375,executives report I just say that I 'm really liking how that 's at reporting 's now going so we 're getting we actually getting a grip on that the proper governance role of a council to be mapping the work of the council and in such a way I think it 's a huge improvement on where things we 're we 're giving the total elapsed time to so we 've got the stash three times but if it goes beyond that yeah it 's something we didn 't have before so it 's great day of those it was figures Nick now so thank you very much John much appreciated move on to item number nine the heritage buildings and places recovery programs submission would somebody like to move the recommendation that we refer this to the submission panel on time for a decision to meet the 14th of March deadline Pauline Cotter seconded Eddie Jones there any comments on that council Johansson um I think the idea was that it would come back to Council on the 13th of marks we have a council meeting so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to make counts as aware that a heritage recovery program is a bit of an oxymoron because basically it 's got two objectives one is to enable the destruction of heritage as quick as possible and the other is to try and save heritage so it doesn 't I mean it there 's a fundamental issue with this that I think the council should be to any submission starting off as a collective so that so that you we do get a collective by them to the comments that may wish to be made I also would like to just have an additional resolution that we repeat the request for the minister of culture and heritage to meet with us as a governance body to discuss our issues around heritage recovery we have repeatedly written to both hum in the minister fourth coat recovery attempting to get a face-to-face dialogue you 'll note that this program was scoped in 2012 jun it 's nearly two years on and in the meantime much of a many heritage buildings have actually being knocked knocked over so i just think given this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an example it 's really great when we can get sit around and discuss things of interest with the appropriate minister and i just think the minister of culture and heritage you know has rely has previously not it not meet with us he first said it was the earthquake recovery ministers responsibility density was too busy I do think actually because of the significant heritage issues facing our city terms of recovery it would be great to have a meeting so you must be speaking historically because I 've spoken to the Minister for arts culture and heritage and it you know informally at an event that we were both each I certainly felt that there was a strong willingness to to meet with us over this particular issue though the program I didn 't raise that with him so you know that may be something that we can talk to him about I understood this program had been transferred to the leadership role Sarah rather than the ministry of culture and heritage don 't don 't know and actually don 't care that the effect is this program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministers to get quicker progress on it and find out what the barriers were at the end of the day I mean it was only in September last year for october last year that the minister of culture and heritage sent us a letter saying he 's not available to meet as he 's traveling to europe has a full schedule and he 's just asked the officials to meet this is a governance issue in terms of a programmer work that was supposed to be done is longer the g and in the meantime we 're losing here at the officials did meet with us so it was fine what he offered he delivered so you know I just you know I don 't I 'm really happy to go back to the minister and ask him if he would meet with us grow I think with ya not asking him to come and appear in front of the committee on I 'm going to ask him to come and meet with us to talk about heritage they can we just have it noted you could just yeah how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write to the minister of as he culture and heritage or arts culture and agriculture hats culture and heritage to invite him to meet with counsel and formally to discuss matters related to heritage yeah but and then that gets us around the fact that he may not be in terms of the leadership of this program so that 's generic see general heritage and it may also be some of the culture issues facing the city as well okay culture and heritage then it is related to culture and heritage no no it 's arts oh yeah that 's cool yeah to the minister of arts culture and heritage and in matters related to coach take out the width up and replace it with cultural and to add culture and take out with that cool and I think we just know that that 's having like this kind of urgent yep it is also just a min ago um a number of other outstanding issues around very specific things like Bill Sutton 's house in Richmond around the garden that we had previously I did wonder whether we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sarah around those previous requests just to find out what 's where things are at yes okay so um and I think we should note that as well so that that will get picked up on Jane 's reporter so sweet 33 specific items yet the retention of Bill Southern 's house that they lost and chief executive follow up with the chief executive of sarah or what 's the role of lauric Isaacs he 's the ccd you manager or general manager or deputy deputy chief executive ccd you in relation to the following matters previously raised with them and then colon and then the the majestic theatre the retention of Bill something 's house and Templar street yep and the but let 's say I working with the heritage garden proposal yep too yeah I think just the irritation the heritage garden proposal was sufficient I think people know what that is all right and look I would I would like to give us a little bit of flexibility there are only four working days between now in the council meeting on the 38 so I just think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't have time to have a submission ready to come to counsel so this report is referred to council submission panel and time for a decision to meet the 14th of March submission deadline if it can be if it can be submitted to the council meeting on the on the thirteenth of March it will be it can be endorsed in but can you just put that button bracket so that it 's clear that that doesn 't stop the submission from going here if the deadline is not met that 's great things will hang on if it can be submitted to the council maybe if you make better a full stop after deadline and then make it a capital F then and then after 13th of march then it can be confirmed by that by the council been otherwise retrospectively on the twentieth of March is that all right oh I would put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried

whole be adopted will not dealt with that only that matter but the ego honored and so terms Kendra cleared for clearwater i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those at host say no that 's carried so parking delegations extension who have we got here to assist earth hello given you introduce yourselves it 's probably the better idea is is that you because we 're all lives streamed at the moment people that might be streaming and specifically to hear about parking delegations might not know who you are so if you could introduce yourself thank you keyboard on the parking business manager excellent so we 've got a resolution in front of us so we would like to move the resolution Phil Clearwater sickened by Jimmy chin as there are there any questions to staff Ellie Jones what are the boundaries if you like as far as setting the I see that it 's up to 25 wasn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limit you to go there 's nothing else that takes how big the percentage increases could be i 'm just wondering whether there are other controls or boundaries within the policy around increasing parking costs no there are no a 3d membership madam mayor there were no no other boundaries that would limit the increases percentage increases or decreases ok thanks yep I 'm Phil clear water but fix the report and it makes it makes sense into the recommendation I 'm supporting it I 've just wondering too and because this it 's always the parking charges that especially in a sottero is debatable among the public if would it be onerous at all for a report on occasions to come back to the environmental committee so we know how the delegations are working would that be on whenever you see you made me absolutely that 's something that we would support totally by flagging amendment that way that we we ask for that could you just quickly drop it down Jamie golfing Yanni yeah I 'm thanks to the report look I appreciate what you 're doing here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as high as perhaps what it should be I tell you from reading between the lines that given that all of this is based on supply and demand that I 'm reading it you correct me if I 'm wrong prices are probably higher than what they should be as a staffs intention to look at lowering parking prices and if that is the case then is the current three-team per hour as that blanket across the city and inside the area that stopped you later than attachment 1 and would you be looking then at potentially changing prices on a street-by-street basis or what it remain is a blanket price-setting exercise is through you met Emir year service about occupancy certainly we have a limited parking resource at the moment and we want to maximize the efficiency of that was also the way we can do that is by getting more people to use the spaces that are available rather than creating new spaces so pricing has a big part to play and then currently there is a blanket three dollars 10 per hour across every single on street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be arriving at a situation ultimately where we want to change packing in precincts so you have different parking pricing and different precincts to match what the supply and demand ratio is in that precinct and that would drive higher frequencies and better efficiencies in those precincts in the last part of that question in terms of prices coming down yes in the short term that that would be the outcome in almost every situation in fact I thoroughly killed all situations yep the initial the initial electric implementation would probably include it yeah a lot of price reductions across the city and that 's really just to try and move some of the traffic around from the overcrowded areas into using some of the lesser lesser used areas for more efficiently quick follow-up and thanks for that um playing devil 's advocate are only suit to secure with the intent of us and it all seems to make sense you want to be more responsive more efficient back that that 's good what 's what 's the impediment or why would why could there not effectively just come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because parking prices are tend to be saying that stop of top of people 's minds and we obviously understand that parking the central city is a really serious priority for this council at the moment well I don 't me too i miss petticott Rafael Jeremy but it 's partly a practical saying in terms of being more responsive and slicker but also got a bear in mind that every time we generated that cost money for council as well and it ties up these guys doing stuff that they could be otherwise doing so it 's just form a practicality in terms of getting things done yani then Paul yep yeah I think one of the concerns I have is that every time you change the phase you have to do a whole bunch of new signage her there could be a cost wouldn 't there to what you 're doing we told know the those fees are generally covered within a group of pretty standard generic silence so the fees were that you see you 're generally on the machine itself so they 're not on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signage costs okay so interchange um we 've had this before that the cost of changing the machines the four remaining prices is a download of a program overnight which costs approximately I think it 's about two hundred dollars at a time machine no software right of minute downloads overnight so that you heard last time it was about sixteen thousand dollars so you 're saying it 's a lot cheaper than Anna yeah the new technology allows us to be able to do this great and um just I think it 's some stage you should talk to the local community board as well it just seems there are some residential properties and the map and I think one of the areas i can see with every tension would be around local residents having access to parking so you know i can understand the need for flexibility and you know you were in a dynamic environment think one of the real important things is to keep the community board and the environment committee and fault there are resident spirits up there there are they need to go through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean i guess you guys will now have the delegation just to issue those on a case-by-case basis of there were special circumstance through you madam mayor no we 're not not proposing to change anything to do with residents parking permits we are proposing to go to the heck we fear amid community board to seek similar delegations for the areas within the central city where there are parking meters but where the council has delegated the authority to sit pricing to the eboard so that 's an outside of the areas in the plan thats painted to this report so you know this is a this is the first step so after after this the outcome of this first meeting we will then be at the agri-food community board meeting one of the issues for inner-city residents is that s scoop comes in and takes away all the car parking you get more vehicle parking and less space is available so there might be a need on case-by-case basis to savings in a certain area residents parking only for the duration of the skirt works do you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't I think personally I think it would make a lot of sense if you did but you know how else do we interest that that issue through you met Amir the current delegations to staff include changing of parking restrictions within the area that 's described in this report not not outside so we could we could accommodate those sorts of requests a pool parking is as we all know one of the hot topics for the central city and I am pleased to senior management around it we 've been told there is an oversupply of parking I think that 's incorrect I think their parking is all the wrong spots so while some people some parks are currently utilize the full extent that 's because they 're in the wrong placement so I want to convene you fresh you try to push some of those all day Parker 's back out some of those areas my concern would be the areas where you have all day parking we have businesses and I know there 's been a couple in the past where you 've had all day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their customers in there and you got someone there parking all day so I just want to raise as a concern that try and avoid all day parking where you have commercial activity happening where they do in the short term stay parking yep Ellie sort of to you no no we can see what the amendments are so we 've got the weathered added the chair end or deputy chair of the environmental committee so that the decision-making processes clearly lint to you know the governance role here and that a report on parking charges and use of existing parking spaces be presented on a quarterly basis to the environmental committee so I think that 's resolved all of those issues so i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no Carrie thank you very much team the appointment of the audit and risk management committee,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

have any part a matter than us so is there anything you 'd like to raise their just that the measure of barrington wall is coming up again and the parking issues and bus issues continue to be a bit of a problem so I just like to draw councillors attention to that you know I think we 're continuing to follow up on that one so you 'd like to move that Phil Clearwater so you can determine scandrett is there any discussion on the first of these reports i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no carried then we 'll move on to 21st of februari which does have the party meta metas required for decision making so I am so this is this prefab New Zealand corporate lease extension and i just want to point out that that the proof Ebony 's young have been really good tenants have abided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're seeking a two-year extension with the exception of the period which the A&P showgrounds needs it for show week and i think that the reason why the ANP Showgrounds have objected so strongly as i see it is encroachment upon further upon the area that they use but Manya this is this is council own land and there 's some concern around the no pune way that the plans for an opponent way and i think would be really good if the council would meet with the MP showgrounds board there 's an ear board and see if things can be improved yeah I think it 's a very good idea and I just wonder I presumed that the two counselors would like to move and second the motion so clearwater scandrett but i just wonder whether you want to pick up in the original motion the idea that the that the council meet as a matter of urgency what the Canterbury agricultural and pastoral Association I maybe to support that I think because this par the land is right in the at the edge of that the spine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any other counselors who was on an up been away area reckon and Wigram but protecting our area to discuss the issues with the new a MP board is poor man 's ears yeah David ease yes I also support their notion at the last A&P show I did have the opportunity to speak to the president of the amt Association and he was quite keen to have some dialogue with counsel for some of the ideas that they want to put forward as well so I think it 's a good idea to to certainly include them and so my discussion on the development of any room I just no wonder if whether it was limited to ward councillors did they want to meet with representatives of the council they haven 't suggested this it was right he was suggesting it but I mean I think that we all agree that we need to but I just don 't think it should be restricted to the walkout so there 's no absolutely i mean i did Leach and Rick and we 're done but um it all councillors who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can actually think it 's a matter for the full council um there 's actually sort of like three different issues going on here one is about the lace and prefab New Zealand one is about the future development of the canterbury park and the third is really around what 's happening in terms of the association so you know I think it should be we should as a full council meet and talk through some of those issues I am concerned that there 's a requirement to vacate the area during the ANP license to if you actually think about it you 've got a prefab village so I don 't quite understand that resolution of its intention that they just move all the houses and then put them back after 32 days it seems of it well I believe it 's the legal requirement of the lease it 's a legal requirement if they have to do that then it 's probably not going to be economic for them to return yeah and so they really need to come to some resolution with the ANP showgrounds people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess the cushion I 'm putting is why would you sign off on a list that you know that they actually had already been signed well why would you cry on it Nelson sure we 're asking for an extension for prefab New Zealand to remained you the pre existing lease with the inp show is there any use of that land as I understand it sorry timken skander it might be able to help okay but his run smoothly from its inception so I guess one of the issues that may be the mp 's show heavy and this is really why we need a meeting with them as worth now this ajit or the the looking at night pune Wyatt cetera and if the RP show are concerned with regards to encroachment on the ability to operate and deliver through cup and show week etc and your other events that they do with regards to live stock options etc so I think the best way to go forward is organized a meeting with them find out any concerns and try and probably waylay them or better understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to raise is that you 're agreeing to extend a lease for something which is simply not practical that the préfet New Zealand are not going to pick up all the houses that are there off their foundations in modem for 32 days and that 's what you 're basically saying as they have so yeah so sorry can I get a clarification from staff as to whether it is a legal requirement under the lease but that we have with the ANP Association is that their lease that actually requires the making available the site clear for those 32 days what that 's my understanding of it madam you yeah so why don 't we take out with a requirement to vacate the area input subject to discussions with the Canterbury agricultural and pastoral Association yeah yep okay all right so the council except the least these requests for a two-year lease extension which will allow prefab New Zealand to continue to lease the site until 31 January to 216 and will meet with the cat with representatives of the Canterbury a MP Association as soon as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting here too we it legally okay we 're going to get some legal advice so we 're going to leave this one sitting I don 't know at 4.2 of the comment the council does not need approval from a MP to ground to fear the least of prefab New Zealand outside of the MP license to however a MPs approval is required before pre fab new zealand can remain on their list site during the period that they have excused them yeah she 's right that 's what i thought was the case and i 'm going to i read this on sunday so i just i I didn 't have the actual lease in front of me but can we get some legal advice before we frame the resolution and we can come back to it and deal with it accordingly I was a little concerned that that the actual email that that accompanied thus as attachment 3 actually states and their formal response that the Canterbury a MP Association is weary at may lose use of a significant portion of land + na hoona way and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and can 't react cultural pipes the running up the count annual Canterbury a MP showed the purpose for which the park was originally established and and that to me seems to be the nub of the problem so instead of focusing on the hub and enough I actually thought the hive brother I thought there was actually just part of incorporated into a part of the MP shola they did paste all fear they were stall it at the last day and patient yeah but they didn 't have to mobile their houses no that 's correct and the helicopters were over the other side before hand so I yeah it doesn 't seem like there 's a dire need to move the helicopters yeah okay so we 'll come back to that with a suggested resolution so thank you very much and thank you for move on can we can we deal with the report as a whole that the reporters a whole be a doctor or no we 'll deal with that at the time as well okay we 'll come back to it all together and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community board to come to the table,"(-43.5320214,

Board,IV-z0sPjdKk,20140312,556.17,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1407,what the a MP and they leased to the hive and this is Robert O 'Connor and Terry house who we do now would you like to help us out with with the situation is it that is it the provision and the iamp license with us that they that they can sorry that yeah so am peas agreement with us that they have that 32 days clear around there that the use of the site for the A&P show correct correct so it 's their requirement and so we couldn 't we couldn 't pass a resolution that overturns that it 's a legal requirement of the arrangement yet I 'm not the author of this report but yeah what you 're saying is absolutely correct EMP have a license to occupy the most most of the site during november to operate the show that gives them the exclusive right to occupy that 's in conflict with the lease to the prefab people during their period so i am p have that right that 's a license i think from memory from a hundred years it 's a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couldn 't over to in today by a council resolution so but i think that we want to indicate to the amt association that we would like to find a resolution to this because we can see from prefab new zealand 's position that they they they couldn 't uplift and put bank i mean it wouldn 't be financially viable so the way there 's the way this is drafted it it 's asking Council to give approval to the to the to the proposed lease I guess in principle and subject to the two parties agreeing amongst themselves as to whether it 's possible or not yeah i would also comment because this this is the first time I 've seen this report I think the recommendation has been put to you is actually wrong and incorrect and as a little preemptory because the body of the report talks about the need to consult under section 138 the local government eggs and that consultation hasn 't for reading the report hasn 't taken place yet to consult with well publicly yeah yeah when council deals worth will grants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health community or recreational purposes it has to consult with the public under 138 of the LGA the report suggests to me that it hasn 't happened to my mind what you should be asked to do is pass a resolution similar to paragraph 4 15 1 and girls in bed simply authorized staff to initiate that consultation it means report back to you now that well the reports is not know nobody feelin what I I 'm coming to this a free shot not I 'm not the author of this report I 've only read at five minutes ago the report says that in relation to the ground of this lease over this piece of land the consulate the required consultation and a section 138 hasn 't yet occurred see so my said she said she would be the originally week granted the lace from two 2014 oh no yeah the lease was granted in 2013 23 2011 for sale in it for three years right that has now expired they 're asking for a new lease a new decision for another two years that new lease needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you will be there do you ask you direct the staff to commence them the the consultation under section 138 well but they may not accept the lease if that means the extension that would that would give a MP the opportunity to input into that process well except yeah yes it 's probably around the wrong way so I just wonder whether if we should just say the council accept and principal the lessee 's request for a two-year lease extension which will allow prefab New Zealand to to work with the Canterbury A&P Association and for the council to consult yeah well the point I 'm making is I think that 's premature because the consultation hasn 't happened OIC so we can 't even approve it on Prince no I think they 're I think the recommendation is wrong okay and so what what I 'm suggesting is that you you you asked to count staff to go out and do the consultation and report back to you with the results of their consultation yeah okay and Tim info the consultation with regards to pre fared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renewal of the pre-existing it 's not a renewal listen it 's a new lease but technically that I mean that has been established for a couple at some time so no know why but shall think I understand is getting close to being able to go out public it 's a work in progress as i understand it but there 's a separate issue because it says I understand the Canberra cultural park do not have a lease on the land or it that is proposed for no penalize it namun ways a completely decision yeah so so this is co mentioned both but we should keep them separate is really separate issues yeah okay yep yep okay are you say I just want to make the point that the clearly there 's potential for confusion here because if that if the wider consultation around our printer was underway and i agree with tim that 's my understanding too vespa tea and then council start a further consultation on this part of it there 's clearly potential confusion i 'm just wondering in fact if we should put this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this right yeah i think that i think that the mistake that 's been made here is that there 's been an assumption that it 's an extension to an existing lease and it doesn 't trigger some of the normal provisions but i actually having looked at this again and that light agree with you that it 's actually talking about a further lease term which is actually a new lease and under these circumstances it is so that we the council commands consultation under section 138 of the local government act on there is a very new lease on on the proposal to grant on the proposal to grant a further two year lease to a prefab New Zealand yeah yeah yeah it 's very helpful experienced after and staff to report back in some country and staff to report back to council and inform inform previous about what we 're doing I think we should still meet with representing the Canterbury A&P Association so and that council meet with represents the can yes I just move that and to the as soon as it can be arranged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to advise a potential conflict of interest for this matter the New Zealand prefabs CEO is my cousin 's daughter your cousin 's daughter it was at your first cousins daughter well that makes her your first cousin once removed what are you going thank you very much I actually don 't think that 's a conflict of interest but there you go you snow and it 's always good it 's better to be safe than sorry as we are all learning over the time ok so the resolution now reads and I assume that counselors clear water and scanned at a hippie with us now that we 've received advice so that the council commence consultation under section 138 of the local government act on the proposal to grant a further two year lease to prefab New Zealand and staff to report to council that the council meet with representatives of Canterbury MP Association as soon as it can be arranged alright i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no thank you and thank you very very much right so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters and we move to item number,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Appointment,uEmmU8jLKTU,20140305,1061.95,"Christchurch, New Zealand",2714,fiona macdonald and andrea newman to come forward thank you sorry to keep you waiting but I thought it was important to start the meeting with a summary of where we 've got to need to come to this meeting or to put up my carpets so I was quite pleased to see this handle this morning yes oh good morning my name is Andrea Newman this is fiona macdonald we both own land and the residential red zone and the port hills on the twenty-second of februari in 2011 having sold my home a week earlier I was preparing to deliver my documentation to the Christchurch City Council for building consent the earthquake and the government 's decision to red zone our land halted my plan to build my family at home like 50 other families in my position I do not three years on heaven offer from the government to purchase my property our treatment by the national government has been appalling our treatment from our council has not been much better these families feel they are being forced to lose a large chunk of their equity for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owners and the port hills the reason our land is red zones is not because our land is damaged but because our neighbors unstable land threatens to released rocks on two hours the government who always intended to offer to make low ball offers to the port hills vacant land owners as they did with the flatland deliberately ensured that our group could not join any legal challenge such as that mounted by the quake outcasts by delaying announcement of an offer the quake outcasts went on to successfully won both a high court challenge on the legality of the d offer and subsequently at the court of appeal yet despite the judges clearly calling for a new offer to be devised none has materialized for this group nor has one been announced for the port hills in my case and in the majority of cases it is my neighbors neighbors neighbors neighbor the Christchurch City Council their own the unstable rocks above in Morgan CLE Morgan 's Valley has 13 vacant sections in the red zone at the time the subdivision was under development installation of Rock protection works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order for the subdivision to get approval as a prospective buyer there were no there was no rock fall hazard identified on the limb and purchases were led to believe any that existed had been mitigated by the council a full maintenance plan was to be put in place to maintain the rock for protection structures after doing research that is very disturbing to learn the other quotes for more elaborate rock for protection and Morgan 's Valley were rejected and the least expensive option was accepted alarmingly the option chosen was designed specifically for a subdivision of seven sections not the 60 sections that eventuated the geotechnical engineer contracted by the council to design and stall and sign off the mitigation recommended several of the lots have hazard notices placed on the limbs but the council failed to comply the council can provide no documentation in regards to the regular maintenance procedures or a schedule of regularly completed maintenance since the earthquake no attempt has been made to fully reinstate the protection interestingly the council deny all knowledge of the other more robust designs that were quoted by respectable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the file held at the Council on Robbins Valley has been lost in June of 2013 one red-zoned homeowner in Morgan 's Valley successfully had two s124 notice tuned by determination at mbie in the documentation it was strongly recommended that the Christchurch City Council urgently reinstate and bring up to standards the rock for protection measures that were still a requirement of the resource management consent a formal request was made to the council by this homeowner and it was the council 's acting CEO who acknowledged that the council would not endeavor to repair the rock for protection works because it was not yet known if it would continue to be a requirement for the subdivision as the central government read zoning process could well result an affected land being owned by the crown using my words thus offering the council a get-out-of-jail-free card in regard to their obligations to repair the structure if the question City Council were to meet its obligations in mullins Valley and elsewhere and the port hills vacant land owners would quite likely choose not to accept a lowball offer from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation which is not conducive to recovery for the landowners and quite frankly borders on being corrupt the vacant land owners and the port hills have legal advice from three independent sources that confirm the council has a case to answer for in regards to nuisance it is not okay for one landowner to cause nuisance to its neighbor if my retaining wall collectors on my neighbor 's house it 's my problem rockfall is the same problem a recent article and the priest sadly highlighted the preventable death of 87 year old wife on Lao at 54 ricura place and reckless and the importance of the council taking responsibility for its consenting decisions and regard to rock for prone areas what is clear to me today as I represent 52 vacant land owners is that a 50-percent offer to vacant land owners and the portholes will be rejected the financial losses involved are just too great for these families to beer the question I wish to put to this council is does this council wish to play a role in resolving the situation for these families or will it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this council to actively take responsibility for what is legally the council 's problem the red zone vacant land owners and the port hills are looking to move on with their lives preferably without the need to take legal action it is time for the Christchurch City Council to come to the party to sensibly discuss mitigation options and or compensation where applicable thank you for your time thank you very much questions yani so are you aware that with our staff to do a look at area-wide mitigation and have staff given you have they talked to you about what they 're looking at waiting if you 've been given any information about what they considering terms of more bins of elements valley or any other areas that we only needed yeah okay i 'm seeking question through them here um do have you got any sense of a timeframe from government over when they may make an offer no I and um yeah like I mean thank you for making the deputation I know piercing I tried to get it as cover the cost share agreement that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time with we 've had a briefing memo but it doesn 't refer to the fact that the previous council didn 't want government to do that I voted against doing that and you know I really feel for what you 're going through so hopefully we can get I mean it 's a question of the chief executive really where is the report into area-wide mitigation we I thought we were having it today but we don 't seem to have had it is it coming can we talk to the people that are in these areas as part of that report that they feel included in the process yes the report is coming I 'm not quite sure how far away it is but it 's a look I haven 't got anybody here who can give me a definitive answer but two to four weeks sits on the agenda for today so if we don 't have it for today and we 're told another two to four weeks we 've also got I mean I welcome what the minister that started meeting around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually another issue that has been much longer apps a much longer outstanding issue where we should actually be able to been working with Sarah and government over getting a reasonable solution for what what these people are going through I 'll work on that report make sure what Steve quickly Oh Ally James hi thanks for coming in um you mentioned the overturning of the section 124 that in be overturned had there been a request of the City Council to do the same for that section 124 I believe so and that clearly wasn 't accepted by the council do you know the reasons why it wasn 't except difference of opinion of what rescue actually was presented to their home right so the council did not agree that the risk in abled them to lift the one to fall that the risk right butter in be dead embedded had a one step above yes you thank you ref maji I guess to open the door to have discussions with this group and they 're not unreasonable people that suffered a lot they 're involved in you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking to me wrong and the problem being that central government doesn 't seem to want us to move on and that a geese forces us to come here today and be in a position where we don 't feel we have much choice but to explore the legal options open to us as lean as Jonnie see it last year you know he put forward a motion to try and encourage the council to at least seek one hundred percent offer and the rest of the council voted against them that sends a signal to a thing you know we 're just not not considered um you by this council at all but I 'm hoping the new council with the patient for Christchurch and that 's people will listen if you could get a hundred percent would would people accept that even like what we 've always been looking for as a group is just to have a fair treatment and to see that a large group of people in the same situation have been offered a hundred percent and then for reasons that were completely out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haven 't even been offered but those people in the red residential flat land have been offered fifty percent it 's just not fair so we 've always been looking for a fear offer originally when I asked the question of all the members of this group over eighty percent of them at that point in time seed if I had an offer of a hundred percent they would cut their losses and they would leave but it will always be some it or not there any other questions about thank you for coming can I just get a sense of the value of the sections the 50-odd sections I 'm referring to him about 10 million dollars rateable value in total the other questions but thank you very much I mean thank you very much for coming and making the deputation to the council and as you 've heard from the acting chief executive will endeavor to get that measure in front of the committee when the next month yep good thank you thank you thank you are you mixed lien sorry can I just ask do it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any discussion about what our response could be other than just waiting for the report which you know we 've been patiently doing since December last year but is there any opportunity for us some stage to have a conversation possibly with government around wind are likely to make the offer because that seems to be one of the key phone the matter has been referred to the Supreme Court has been appealed to the Supreme Court so I know that the government won 't discuss matters relating to the offer while the measures in front of the court that was why they I mean it is essentially as you pointed out that that 's why these people don 't have an offer so I mean I think that I mean we can we can raise the the fact that this was raised here today I don 't think we need to have a discussion and resolution about that but I think that we have to look to our issue which is the issue that has been raised with respect to the to the area wide mitigation so we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government 's and I think we should look to our own responsibilities first so that 's what I propose that we do yeah I understand that it is actually very much part of government because fifty percent so no no I 'm sorry we 're talking about the the land mitigation issue and I know that the government had you know as part of the cost sharing agreement here fifty percent contribution and that regard but I would like us to deal with that issue a separate from the cost of the offer that has been made because it is as it is and it is not but it hasn 't been made to this an individual landowners for the reason that we 've here today so I 'd like to take that one separately because and certainly at the right time we obviously will but I believe that yeah anyway so then the second question I had was I 'm for the acting chief executive can we get some a legal opinion or a staff response to the concerns that were raised around the consenting around movements Valley that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a legal issue I think we didn 't need an update on the on the whole issue around the history of the consenting and how that how the subdivision was commenced without well whether the level of rock protection that was put in place was appropriate I mean the reference to rocky or terrace as as episode in that case the consent wasn 't made subject to rock protection at a later stage Rock protection was required as a result of a court decision what happened in the februari event though wasn 't or as you might have been the June event for that one it was but it was not it was not it was not rock protection that could have protected even the courts requirements in terms of rock protection weren 't sufficient to protect against Cliff clips so it was a but but it does raise issues around what is confronted with exactly and I think one of the quiz the reason for asking the question that 's given that we 're going into a natural hazards chapter review registry and understanding our existing practices it worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their community about what we 're proposing absolutely and I think what happened in littleton is today also helps inform you know that the the very you know challenging decisions that we have to make and that regard so thank you very much and I 'll up on the lost file I didn 't know about that no I don 't know about that either thank you this issue was one this question with the loss file if we could find it interesting to see what 's in it ya know we will we will certainly okay I was to achieve it for that thank you very much and we have a presentation,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

19 December 2013,_l08VUpA9T0,20140312,633.06,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1582,that infects you are not paying Richard something I fell now I apologized I am as unable dendogram Thank You London so would you like to would you like to address yes oh you 've got parte when the second one so we 'll deal with the 19th of December report first so would you like to speak to that yes as you said there 's no parties and I 'm headed out as a question states any difficulty stairs pretty straightforward Pam that asked me to remind you at the start that there was a two hour period on last Wednesday morning with a one and forty year return period rainfall intensity 36.5 millimeters in two hours which and in total over 150 millimeters it 's a lot of rain that 's a lot of rain yeah I 'm a reporter no but it 's if it 's right I 'm sure it will be pardoned Ethan Andrew would you like to move the report seeking the David East so is there any discussion on that i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acro warrior community board where we do care some parte matters to deal with so would you like to go through them we 'll start with the connection of existing dwellings to water and wastewater services on banks peninsula this there 's been a added part to the board read from the board recommendation there but the staff be requested to work with the banks peninsula rugby club and the wiry room Mariah to resolve quantity issues with their connections to the Little River water supply they it 's a temporary it 's a use that 's not constant of the water and it has a restrictor on it which and they have a small tank so they 're unable to use it properly when there 's a fixture so that 's the reason for them right so what Andrew would you like to move the motion so we can cut that Pauline cutter seconded so are there any questions or discussion around it seems to be generally agreed up their stuff very happy with the with the you know continuing to work with the two club yeah I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know carried ok it was very successful next one the lycoi terminal waste water pumping station site options like to talk about those three so here we the board lines up with the staff recommendation around an acre or the site and the Aqua of boat parking area so a number of sites were considered and comparisons made and the selection of site five as the preferred one and in having the ogre or design an appearance advisory committee to discuss options for the external appearance of the pumping station seems to make good sense as well yes let 's start recommend a recommended so who would like to move their change of tuna seconded by Phil Clearwater any comments Jana your Henson I 'll just my fault you 're building quite significant structures it 's probably more to staff but deep doo-doo we ever consider the need for having like sort of a multi-purpose use for these facilities additional toilets I know we 've got the issue of freedom camping for example whether there 's any connection to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we minimize the disruption I mean I don 't know but this is yeah it just seemed to me when we 're building big structure whether we look at that opportunity Terry you just walked on the door yes sir grab a seat um I 'll just grab you while you were walking about and the question that 's been raised by Councillor Johansson this is on the recommendation around the site proposal for the approach a man or waste water pumping station the question is as as there is there an opportunity while building that for other facilities to be included as well so for example if you 're building a pumping station near you no could it be an opportunity to build some more toilets or something like that public toilets that would be available for use in their area the example of freedom camping is raised its head again so yeah I mean is it an opportunity to look to see with that there are other facilities that could be D I mean I know that pumping stations probably aren 't the most ideal expect you couldn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a community hall around it but because there are some safety requirements around access to facilities like that so it couldn 't be part of that structure in any shape or form yeah so what we 'd have to look at it may be impractical I 'm not quite sure exactly what area we 've got there but I think I think the general point that 's being raised is that when we are investing and significant infrastructure it probably is a good idea to have a look around to see whether at that time there is something else that you know that fits worth there toward you know and I presume you do in terms of sytan you know the fact that you 're going to that occur or design an appearance Advisory Committee on a pumping station I 'm sure that wouldn 't have happened you know sort of even 20 years ago so so it 's yeah it 's all about probably stitching up together at long-term plans on because at the moment there 's nothing in the long-term plan to fund anything else so it also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think this is that this is what we 've identified as problematic in terms of for example scoot when they identify projects that they want to present to counsel for the betterment fund they 're looking underground instead of looking around and we think that having more of a focus on waters around might actually enable the council to get a better steer on what the options are for that betterment fund this isn 't an earthquake related issue it 's a pre-existing need and and it will be great when it 's up and running but yeah I mean I think that the community board is now hearing that the council 's generally interested and and these measures and I 'm sure that they can discuss that with staff as they go through this process of considering the design options well we 're happy to talk with me that 's great all right so we 've got that moved and seconded I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and then we move to the deedub least on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak to that yes that we agree with the staff recommendation there very good so Andrew Turner would like to move that and somebody would like to second up term scandrett is there any discussion I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and finally for a very busy community board we have the recommendation on the deed of assignment of lease on the akaroa money goal and again would you like to address that you sneaky the the stuff I 'm proposing to deal with the with the lessee unilaterally rather than advertising for expressions of interest to recognize his invest and in the property it would be safe to say there 's no reserve management planned for this area and the board would not probably not support a 15-year too but it 's all dependent on the proposed activity that is coming up there and that 's really why that second part is there it is so that we can get details of what is proposed before considering that full fifteen year too so that would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some it doesn 't have sort of financial ramifications other then well no it doesn 't have any ramifications but it does enable for that oversight to be given and for the for the actual use to be restricted to the to the money golf yes we were under the impression that the least provided for the use of mini golf only again it 's the advice Rosie okay Andrew to know you 'd like to move the board recommendation and Tim Scandrick second i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no carried so that 's the i mean that 's that 's the staff recommendation plus the board addition yep to get up and one and now I 'll look for Andrew tuna to move and somebody to second that the report as a whole we adopted and Tim scandrett second did that and I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no Carrie thank you very much you and now we move on to the Burwood Pegasus,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Stokes instead embrace this opportunity to learn change the process so this never happens again to ensure that our new sub sub divisions which we 've got a lot of coming out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at our meeting last week up and learn elected members lounge we could adopt a similar process as many cows City Council as part of any subdivision plane at the expense of the developer is to have this independent road safety report done prior to any Camille of subdivisions Bruce Conahan now works for ghd but was a member of the Christ Church of the manukau city council for many years this was part of the district plan review we are seeking recompense and good faith and which has been brought to light by Colin Stokes intervention here and in summary hindsight is a wonderful thing how much would we have appreciated this private intervention and the CTV debacle thank you and thanks dev I feel very similar but it 's a moral obligation I think and that precedent can be addressed by what dibs just referred to as the change in the district plan that requires a sub divider a developer to have this audited safety report as part of their resource consent application or their plane change so when we fearing precedent I think a plan could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing I 'm bored me act sorry councillors is that the staff have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on this issue as well to try and retain the unsafe roads to the point in time when the traffic safety audit came out and and said that there are significant and serious issues to do with that roading layout so elected members to my knowledge wouldn 't have had any idea of the amount of ratepayers money that has gone into trying to defend an unsafe a dangerous road hundreds of thousands of dollars what we 're asking for you to consider today is sixty thousand dollars to recompense out-of-pocket expenses by concerned res to try and bring this matter to the council 's attention which it has done now and thankfully a lot of these safety issues are being being addressed and looked at as a way to move forward but what we 've got to be really thankful for I think as ratepayers of Christchurch is that we haven 't allowed the road to be built as per the original plan the residents and all other concerned parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very significant change when you go from a 25-metre road to a 12-meter road that is significant when the cycle lanes finish off the face of the earth that 's that 's significant when the median strip to allow right hand turns and a busy part of a road has taken out that significant there 's a lot of stuff there that as a community board irrespective of mr. Stokes we would have been really concerned about it when I first went there and seen the road being constructed before the tarsi it was late I thought this is an absolute no-brainer hack and this happens so it was apparently mr. Stokes it was us as a community board as well but we find it difficult to actually raise funds that engaged and engaged experts to counter something that the staff are there okay we find it very difficult to do that in fact it 's impossible so we 've got to rely on members of the public to actually take up that banner for us we have to because we are limited in what we can spend their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today I don 't want to take up any more time but just the site that just think about this why should you penalize a very active community that has people 's lives as they concern their safety why should we penalize them and say well that 's okay you can pay the bill but thanks very much for the work you 've done on our behalf I think that we are obliged as a city cow so to honor that and pay that route back and when I say a group I say it 's more than one individual one individuals got his name on the bill but I 've seen documents that had gotten many people 's names are so that 's not only just calm Stokes I just want to put that to you today as well be bounded incorporate society but anyway all the rest my case there madam mirroring councils and just plea for don 't be were too worried about the precedent but just think about it morally morally I would do we as a city appreciate the fact that we 're heading toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that rather than ask questions will go straight to debating the matter so I 'll move that the council resolved not to pay the sum of sixty thousand dollars to mr. Stokes do I have a second to that position Vicki back is there any debate on the meter Jimmy chin in councillors after though we listened to the stops and also the community board chair in the members I 'm not a supporter stop recommendation because I have a reason as follows the first one coming aboard last time to reward to support to reimburse coastal 260 thousand dollars to the mr. stock in Somalia affected a party owners and residents yes the 522 majority the second is based on the staff recommendation we review even the other this the case you know is not a joke statutory obligation to meet stops the poster under a resource management at and also the formal legal review by the law August of simps and grease and dr. Sommer will to see her identify no passes issue while in any payment through mr. Spock however as the Kami birthday the now raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time that this builder issue is not happy in this council but happened in the previous council even further purest the cube is the council the nation if not is not a legal the application but whether consider is the mall order consideration and also in the last turn the cancer I was taught from the star presentation it was about a nine month when star received an information from the sam meters and similar affected residents they have lived on the table for the nine-month had no take any reporter and a smooth way to persistent this issue i believe that if we packed a computer in the council previous council taker putin in a smooth way happen this issue has been already resolved and also the my understanding the in a lot in the pasta the council still have a reimbursable toaster over a Resource Management Act issue for instant like to reimbursement the coaster Tula are our capital issue there 's a part of the Resource Management Act issue Tula avatar resident and Association and also like a communal members shield particular mention earlier in the independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still you know to release the ten the are significant and serious that traffic safety concerns they start refactor but there 's a factor no one can have any excuse so we need to face the respect try to work together to do with the this issue so this my platoon your concern you all those the the item so that 's why I cannot support this one thank you any other people pretty back and I find their difficulty here outlined on page 257 of the council agenda and 3.11 if the council would pay and individual one basic solution then the admission of breach could expose the council to further claims by other parties such as noble and business limited as it would be wrongly accepting that there has been a breach of councils legal duties the admission could nullify insurance cover for these claims and I can imagine totally that if we pay this that we will have action from other parties in relation to this subdivision this subdivision has costs the council a great deal and since the time I 've been on the community board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to what some of the other community board members have expressed that the staff and the work that 's been done on this through initially by shane turner and an independent safety audit and then a very comprehensive process of resolving each of those teen issues which we took through a combined environment and community board meeting last week to the point that each of those issues have now been resolved and there is a process forward or there is a process for resolving each of those issues to have been incredibly thorough and the presentation I thought last week was actually excellent than the work that had been done was also example so the difficulty I have is that this is an individual I 'm not worried about which individual it is made no comment on that whatsoever just the precedent that this creates for public monies to be given to individuals to challenge all sorts of issues around the council is precedent that I am not willing to create for this council it will create for us another flood gate one that we haven 't yet met on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am really really keen to open in any way shape or form and this has been a particularly litigious subdivision and there is no way that if open this gate a little bit that it stops at a little bit there will be a major consequence of opening this gate Jamie golf Ben Ali Jones at the end of the day the counselors the ratepayer the counselors an organization that administers ratepayer funds I think we 're going into a very very dangerous land when we have the organization that represents the right by allocating rate payer money to another rape play that has challenged the ratepayer it is used as it just sounded right then and there I think that it there are serious issues that have arisen from that night I 'm not actually questioning it I 'm not getting into it I heard Mike earlier during as deputy Shinsei don 't worry about the precedent here but I would urge you to be very very cognizant of the precedent I think that when it comes to decision making the decision itself isn 't the important air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dawn and the domino effect that I see from this is very very worrying so for the ratepayer to allocate rate payer money to another ratepayer as actual I 'm just going round in circles and we have got a policy where the council doesn 't allocate community grants to organizations that are legally challenging the council because it 's just simply going and money go around for the council to pay people to fight the council and it is exactly what 's happening here and I just repeat we were told not to worry about the precedent please worry about the Preston because that 's top of mine and every decision that I make yes can I answer can I just know I 'm sorry no you can 't and Ellie james i have just i have a couple of questions actually can i do that well we 're debating their emotions all right well I 'd like to race the issue of yahwah carpet and I cannot recall how the money for that was paid was it paid to an individual or to an organization okay and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual that this is in fact an incorporated society so I 'm confused by there tomorrow it 's no not rated society okay thank you yep Kelly poorly you just briefly and I do appreciate all the effort that has gone into this and the volunteer hours and I know that but I also know that there are a lot of community groups around christchurch that actually do this sort of thing and they raise the money themselves to do this and they get themselves organized and incorporated will gain charitable status because you have to in order to access council funding and I say I agree with 50 this is a very dangerous precedent if we break that ruling and and in the Fleck I would come back from those groups who get out there and we 're really hard to raise money for this very sort of thing in a myriad of ways and for a myriad of reasons and that concerns me any other contribution to the debate Ali Jones I would support what paulina sem vicki has said as well however i think it 's really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerns or issues about something in your community that you should be able to challenge those now if the systems have not been set up or the organization all the way that this has been done has not been set up as I 'm hearing from Pauline then that is an issue for the individual or the group who has done this but if the council does decide not to reimburse mr. Stokes today I don 't want in any way that to send a message that the council doesn 't support people challenging and getting the information and the experts in order to be able to challenge decisions where they feel that 's necessary clean Livingston thank you obviously very complex collection of issues but two main issues stand out for me we know about the roads staff have admitted that we know about that whole process it wasn 't good in this case my response to it would as a council would it be good governance to to pay 60,000 thought to pay any amount 20 person in this in this context so I can 't go think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he bucks said in relation to the the concern that we would have around admissions of breaches I think in a in a situation where the council is in fact legally challenged about decisions that it has made then it is perfectly open for the council to accept a resolution of that of that claim with a negotiated settlement that is perfectly in order this is not an order and the reason that I would take it even further as that in this particular case the council appointed an independent Commissioner to hear the sand actually to make the decision whether it would be notified or not so that that decision was taken on our behalf as a consenting authority by mr. David Kirkpatrick and the question then becomes whether that decision was challengeable and the advice that we have received is that it would not be open to judicial review because of the the reality that he made a decision that a reasonable person could make and it may not be one that that others would have made and different traffic experts can have different opinions which is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presenting this to counsel to pay that is why I 've moved the staff recommendation so on that note I 'll put the recommendation all those in favor say aye those opposed say no would you like to have your opposition recorder please Jimmy chin opposes thank you and we 'll move on to your second item which is the shands road edmonton road installation of give way and traffic signal controls do you like to address that night that 's just pretty straightforward down meta mirren counselors I can 't see any issue around that at all the net should matter of safety I moved by Jimmy chin Vicki back seconded any discussion yani Johansson the question of the chair of the board or mode to the acting CA I 'm just mindful that one of the issues we have is that every time we have development the traffic solution is put in a traffic light so if you go off Eddington lincoln road through Eddington or linen road we just put traffic light up the traffic light houston traffic light which has a negative community of effect on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a lot of benefit so has anyone done any strategic trip at work around this area and what the best solutions are for the coombs of effects that are coming from all the different types of subdivision and no that hasn 't and I think you 're raising a legitimate concern and it would be the intention to move traffic up and down change road and with minimum disruption so the more lights we get in there we 've just had some put it at the intersection of parker street and scenes right now so you can go and then there 's a motorway soaked with in a very very short section of sparks road I springs and shans rate at least from from the main south road within a kilometer you 've got three sets of lights then what we 're doing now but fear the south is installing yet another set of lights so it is it is a concern that there is a flood gate opening with lights but like I mean I you know I just looked at the resolution then with I think three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lincoln road headington area that still hasn 't been done but this is not a Lincoln race it 's not I 'd say can I just ask a question of staff is anyone looking at the strategic traffic implications of all these different subdivisions in the in the way in which they 're all linked apparently seem to be done in isolation yep because I know we 've had environment called cases like in fairy made for high court cases where the critical judgment was that we were not taking into account community of traffic offence of allowing development to occur but we we don 't have anybody here who can specifically talk to this one here but in fact you 've raised that before cancel your handsome and I think it 's in the list of questions through the acting CEO report and if it 's not I 'll make sure that something goes in there it 's pretty fun to me to it yes sort of overage long overdue so you 're gonna you want to pose this motion all know no okay I just buy candy counselors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a briefing and and workshop on the overall Christchurch strategic transport plan which will include these issues the problem is that the strategic transport plan doesn 't align to the district way and it doesn 't align to the subdivision consents and developments that are accurate and we 're doing it just we 're doing a district plan review at the moment as well and I think that it 's a very valid point to raise in the context of where we 're going at the moment so we 'll get an update through the acting chief executives report but I think that you know I think that might be something that counselor Clearwater could raise at his committee than need to provide that link with the development of new subdivisions because I think council Johansson is absolutely bright that we 've got to make sure that these these well it 's the flow-on effects you know from from from one set of decision after the other and then you end up with a road that 's virtually non traversable so i 'll put the motion all those in favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think that 's the end of that particular one odd so we 'll move so the facts they can do counselor chin that the report as a whole be adopted those in favor say aye those opposed say no carried thank you Mike very much and Debbie for appearing as well and will now adjourn for morning tea and we 'll be back here at ten past eleven","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

February 2014,tGSofF0THlk,20140312,638.86,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1665,inder is the record on Wigram community board and we have two reports from that the first report has no plan a so we 'll just we 'll deal with the deal with that first so Mike is there anything that you want to speak to on the on the the first report of the fourth of februari meeting which has no part a messes now I was just going to to mention the effect oh thank you meta mirren councils the under elected members of information exchange the issues around the the University of Canterbury dub dub dial campus accommodation issue is just something I think we need to be aware of there are um there are issues around there then there probably be coming back to the council possibly and then the issue of 22 288 springs road that 's the young for those who don 't know that addresses for the next stage of the southern arterial motorway which will go from Springs Road under section then through through new land on that area of land is owned by NZTA yeah but it has got a operation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of enforcement is concerned and there 's a lot of issues coming out of there for example the qe2 track we found there just recently track from qe2 and and you know the liquefaction all of those issues the asbestos issues to do with them here we to a lot of that stuff just been dumped on that site and which is an issue that we 're working through with them within z ta city council enforcement team but they seem to be making much traction on it sorry I 'm sure that will come to to counsel if it is required to Ronnie hang on i 'ma you 're saying that council aerials and being dumped yet yes illegally well I don 't think it 's a sort of material you 'll be using as a as a base for a motorway when you 've got sponge rubber sections of could we know I 'm really we just not do this I 'd really like to ask for a rapport you know I mean it 's just been raised yeah and i must say that i didn 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would be raised it says meetings are being held with staff and what the New Zealand Transport Agency regarding activities on the side the reason I mentioned that they met a mirror and council orders just to give you an idea of the location of 22 88 springs road and its significance and them yes a tree just arising from us perhaps I 'd like to move that staff be asked to prepare a report on all of the issues relating to the springs road sites site that is to be utilized for the next stage of the southern motorway i am doing dressy areas of non-compliance will be very helpful meta me and two and and yeah and the end any areas of suggestive non-compliance because i just want to leave it as not not proven at the stage so your second that Jimmy chin so I don 't really want to have a debate about what the report is going to contain you know can I just say though I 'm really happy for that resolution to go through there is a wider issue and for councils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas that tend to tend to get found out after the fact so there was some work done around setting up some sort of joint system with a can around monitoring aware waste was being despised it clearly isn 't working if we 've still got these issues so I do think we need a wider report around the types of materials that have been dumped and we are and what we 're actually doing to be proactive particularly when it 's considering our own facilities so I 'd maybe want to expand this into a wider debate I 'm happy for this recommendation say that that star prepare a report on all issues regarding 288 Springs grow together with any issues relating to non-compliance and whether there are any whether there are any additional concerns I mean I don 't want to hold this up additional concerns re disposal of waste from the from you know demolition waste I mean yeah excuse me I just did i do I want to avoid debate to obviously but wonder whether we could just now let a little bit more over our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovery park and Kate belly know well this day I really don 't because I 'm arriving this is a rising out of a report that sees meetings are being held with staff and what the New Zealand Transport Agency regarding activities on the side I 've added in a different different Perry an additional phrase that enables staff to include in it a report that that gives that it gives them the opportunity to raise concerns if there are concerns so if there are going to be concerns over the order and council and the relationship with the with the booooored part process there then we will deal with that as a separate measure and we 'll get it on to the agenda of the committee of the whole I just don 't want to sidetrack what is a brief statement and a report and to a major inquiry across all oh she 's so can I can I put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried so can we move on to the yeah there any update on the Riccarton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold up from the Rickett and bush trust as far is the cycleway it 's just the routing of it that was some pattern but we 're quite happy for this local way to go through Rickett and bush it 's just that we want it 's the trust that 's holding it up those the only progress is you 've got the borders working with the trust here too I 'm just asking us in kroger since the support i 'm not aware that there is in he holed up at the stage who is on the trust ahme chain yes thank you mayor explained a last month the llama committee meeting stop make a presentation to the environment environmental committee and we got into this the new cycle way possible victim booster the facility issue and I have asked a stop you know because the victim boost the trust in the know when November December the presentation the council Star Maker presentation full entry cut into the council original facility their plan but as trust their particular concern the original the counselor plan of the day racer kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of safety issue so they have a different view feedback to the stock so the last month of the committee meeting staff answer they were bring a new device the plan to la communipaw they would like to engage with the trust again try to resolve that is problems so this is the status it is actually holding up the cycleway if it doesn 't go through the Rick and bush we have degree if the effort doesn 't go through the it doesn 't get resolved the staff have to reroute it rather much longer distance around so it 's quite crucial to getting this cycle if you 're going it 's a fairly simple matter what was proposed by staff with the root of the cycleway was to bring it out by the recycle wait pedestrian way out by the bridge by the river the bush trust didn 't want their extra opening in the gate because traditionally the cycleway has been using the main entrance and an ANA Rickett and Bush trust which the gate is locked at that and seven o 'clock at night eight o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we don 't have two entrances and exits into the end to the end of the facility so that 's its this quite a simple thing it 's a matter of about 60 or 70 meters what we 're saying as a trust is we want we 're happy with the cycleway but we we want it to go in and out there where it 's already gone in and out onto unto them the main road hairy keister e so that 's um that 's that 's where it 's at so really the ballers and staff sport actually to accept that recommendation from the trust and to and to allow for this local way to proceed along the two preferred route by the trust so I can 't see that it 's a big issue as far as that the trust holding things up as consumed I think that actually we 've got another meeting coming up Vicki and I 'll see what we can get shorter before there yeah um Yanni can I just say I 'm I asked for a memo on this for the community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff over the issues heavy to circulate that round accounts was to get ya the loader stopped right that 'll be good all right so we 'll move on to I 'll put the motion oh no that 's been carried so we did that the second the second meeting that 18th of februari meeting of the record and bookworm community board and the first,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

February 2014,bWZgictkKRQ,20140312,601.48,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1591,"Putin and I 'd like to call deputy chairperson jo daviess up to the table and he will be presenting the that I think there are two parties aren 't there and all right there 's just one just the one anyway I proud to represent the community board and people of hagley fair amitabh over 50,000 constituents in the sea to the city and it also like to acknowledge the absence of Sarah Templeton our Board Chair and Sharon giving our thoughts to her as she supports her family this week so the recommendation part a is to do with the free meat bridge replacement in the bridle-path road intersections fairly straightforward the people of here Scott wanted to be able to turn right from bridal pass road towards amna and yeah staff had recommended they want to amend yeah really that it 's recommended that the heavy fermi community would recommend to the Council of the pyramid roading that be amended to include a right turn and bridle path road to blend of some yep so you 're of one mind the staff on the community board yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you like to move and second the motion yeah before you do I just had a slight amendment which was an additional resolution and that was just to ask that the I think we I can remember the exact name of the group the group account spoke to us that art in public places group investigate an artwork for the theremin bridge sighs Public Arts advisory group yeah it was just a additional resolution yeah I think it 's yeah be invited to I don 't think that we can require them to do it although they they get funded from us and they do get external funding as well but they say that they take up their direction from us and previously we were lead to believe that they would only focus on the central city we 've now heard that they actually do look at gateways yeah and very mObridge is an incredibly important gateway and that part of the city so I think they really do need some direction from us over what they look at that 's the impression I got from when they talk to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reason for the be invited is that they are they do prioritize and the Gateway that they were referring to was little tongue and that was in relation to both tourism and the local people I understand that just the logic behind putting this now is we 're spending a huge amount of capital expenditure on this bridge now so obviously there 's a lot of savings to be made if you can incorporate something in it that does construction phase as opposed to coming in and rich or fitting something later on and I know yeah i 'm certainly not trying to take away from the other work that they 're doing but we 've got major capital expenditure happening yes i do understand that but it may not be possible given the the time frame that they operate on in terms of public artworks pool just add further it is actually to do with tourism because we 've got a postal pathway you know i 'm not i 'm not saying oh yeah this what i read it okay i 'll put the motion all those in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you and and then we have a recommendation the second recommendation and relation to to take 30 ruins of presentation and i think there was another deputation on the same subject so um but would you like to speak to the oh yeah what I can The Residents Association in the area of Lynwood just made a presentation in regards to the issue of homeless kind of alcoholism and they were saying that they were causing a nuisance in the area and the board yeah dissolves us right ok so again Yanni and Paul you 're quite happy to move and second there yep yeah do you want to speak to it yep um just briefly I think it 's just fair to reflect the discussion at the board was that we accepted that there was a issue typing in this area but we also thought it was really important to look at what other options there were available for addressing it because it 's not just about people drinking in a public place it 's actually to do with things like housing to do with things like access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design so i think that the board resolution that 's fairly blunt but actually there was a lot of discussion and I think we have undertaken probably as a pathway to do some other work around bringing the different agencies together the different people together talking to the people that are creating the nuisance and actually trying to get to the core of what some of the issues are because there are many issues tied up other than just an alcohol ban so you 'll do that in the context of your community board you don 't need an additional know it 's already been I think recruited through the community board throughout be so but I think it 's important to give counts as just some understanding it 's not just about placing an alcohol been solving this problem because that won 't in itself actually work no that is about understanding why this behavior is happening in this area it 's excellent good i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried i did have one question just arising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minister Canterbury Earthquake Recovery and response to the board 's correspondence requesting consideration be given to an exception for compensation to port those property owners as there then are you able to provide a copy of yep I will yep i will get the commutable advisor Joe Daly to hold your copy of this document thank you very much great and there are any other items that you just like to meet

just looking at attachment 1 to Clause 1 a number of just going back every winter the first one for me before and other than get a chance to say that a number of new signs and the in the area of the Hagley fear amid new bridge and sign number two just mentions new brighton where all the others talk about new brighton see a bit of a typo area there like new brighton not bright side to it all sign tuned that 's right we can 't have that definitely not yeah okay so um who would like to move there are you moving it how I actually thank you David for raising that one of the things that come up with the community board was to seek from staff and understanding of yourself electronic science yeah and we we actually felt given the risk for a lot of clutter of signage in this area and it ties an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area location is perfect for some sort of new modern technology about a sensing city or a smart city and actually being able to give people real-time information about what 's happening so I guess we 'll just pursue that with the acting chief executive away from these resolutions which are quite specific but it does seem like it 's a wonderful opportunity to try out some of the new technologies oh I totally agree because this is an area that could potentially be cut off and so to have you know sort of signage that can be kept up to date in real time with progress and also scoot activity it 's going to be ongoing for quite some time I think it 's a very very good idea all right i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no and thank you period so thank you Joe for your first appearance in front of the council it 's obviously sparked a lot of interests I think very much deserving and pass on our regards to Sarah as well so now we have

Mitchell the only thing I would add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes a little bit oh no mr. Mitchell I think the the issue about the voting numbers which is not from memory one of the changes that 's been nice not forward anyway it is obviously very styro court would have been discussed heavily after the amalgamations in 1989 because fundamentally that there 's been little change since since that time and again all I can suggest is that if the council was wish to pursue that then a we could get you background information as to how did that come about secondly the council would have the opportunity if it was concerned as a result with some information to put forward a remap through design process in terms of going to the annual conferences normally the process to get changed like that but at this stage it 's a historical reasons and I think the only change would have been with with the amalgamation and Auckland that 's been significant obviously but apart from that it you have this concept of the Metro councils and I think which derives from going back a hundred years the four largest cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other ones are grindr Hamilton 's of this sort of thing so I don 't think it 's going to be a viable option and to not for this discussion today and not in terms with this particular request the amendments are being identified in the back around the senior managers the term of the president and the other change and so it 's not something to be available four loko he 's going to discuss so do you want to run us through the actual amendments that have all pose there 's the National Council composition which is where it is proposed that for additional members selected by each of the four sectors join the National Council and those additional members will be required to be either a chief executive of holding office of similar seniority and a local authority for example chief of staff to Amir it 's all right it 's the hear that well the definition the chief executive or Pearson holding a senior management position in a council when I read that I took that as a tear to manager yeah typically that 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of chief of staff to a mere as well that that 's that 's in the definition of the resolution on page 10 so so what it 's how many how many members of National Council are there before this change 14 I understand 14 so it goes from 14 to 18 yes and up and those four members come from one from metropolitan one from provincial one from regional and one from rule and they are at the chief executive or tear to level years right it 's the way it 's supposed to work yep like that time that that 's one of the changes the other one of course is the removing the the term level of two terms on the president local government yeah so so there 's no effectively no term limits at all the third one is bringing the concept of associate members of local New Zealand without voting rights and that seems to be aimed at reading the papers having CCOs energy companies port companies in other words with some connection to territorial authorities but qualifiers associate members of local companies under and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what they refer to as efficiency change tweaking that obviously need to occur if the other changes are put in place but I understand the senior managers changes and because the papers refer to the fact this has been discussed at his own meetings previously but I understand there 's been some discussions between LG and Z and the Society of local government managers last year with the view to potentially a joining together but those didn 't come to fruition so I 'm not sure what that rationale behind the change heroes so this could potentially be a step towards an amalgamation between their senior local government I mean could lead to but society of local government meant solver yeah yeah all right Yanni I just wondered because there are some quite I mean the background information behind it was pretty weak to understand why for example while they 're proposing to remove a term limit on the president why when the issue was sold them seems to have fallen through with Davey pointing to their board and what are they doing in terms of appointing to solve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have a submissions panel for that heritage showing whether this should be part of bad so that counselors can really get a chance to understand a little bit more around what these things are I mean I gotta be pretty short not be very happy to refer it to the hearings panel it sounds a submissions panel so I think they would make sense and if accounts us any questions we could resolve to get those answers from LG and z yeah writer there so that we could be better informed so but we 're going to have to if we are going to submit on time and if we are going to have a proxy vote then we have to if we 're going to have a proxy vote then we have to submit by the 11th so do we have to do we have to tell our proxy how we want to vote by the 11th or just that we will submit the details I think it maybe we could file the proxy vote getter dip but then reserve the right until LG and Z that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and five o 'clock which way to vote but the issue is going to go into raise them as who are we going to give the proxy vote too well the other option is to send someone I man i can 't i can 't go so yeah so so yeah so we 've got a number of questions what I mean one is that I 'm very happy for this not to be made a decision of right now but to refer it to the hearings panel a submissions panel and but I think we we then have to decide whether I mean well we probably have to decide beforehand because if we 're not going to vote then it 's probably pointless wasting our time at the submissions panel so presumably that by referring it to the submissions panel people were saying that we do actually want to exercise our boat do we exercise that in person with somebody available to go and speak to it or do we exercise a property or ask a proxy to exercise our boat can I suggest it I appreciate it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly give the counts or greater flexibility if we had a counselor rained probably from a zone 5 wreck yeah because there 's a connection there who 's the person going and then they could work with the submissions panel get a steer as to what the nature of the council 's position dinners yep and we get booked the flights now for that five o 'clock meeting only online nity the submission that the members of the of the Joint Committee the zone zone five joint committee are Glenn lemmings turn yani Johansson Jimmy chin and David East so there 's just Jimmy chin yani Johanson and glean Livingston the are the three yannis probably got the longest history of involvement in this committee he 's our most seen he 's our most senior counselor else wants to go thank you I take that as a year so that Jonnie Johansson represent the Christchurch City Council at the special general meeting of the new zealand local government association yeah yep yeah that 's right all right so um now yeah it 's it 's LG n seed but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zealand Local Government Association yeah but anyway the LG n seeds or take out the word association because we know what we mean by LG and zia to exercise our vote I think it would be worth making the point though that we should be actually given that this is LG indeed they should know how local councils work giving us two weeks notice of a meeting to make constitutional changes there 's pretty not-okay not really acceptable in my view so Isis peak that there was earlier notice because the cause of the zone committee discussion about I don 't recall this being raised particularly I did not mean to last so in meeting but the one before certainly but it 's just getting the papers and having a child I can see the papers we should at least get four weeks notice so we can tell you through yeah more process yeah okay so I 'm actually going to say that the proposed amendments to the local government you zealand rules be discussed by the submissions panel before the 13th of march in order to decide how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have to endorse those on the day i mean we can actually we can actually endorse them on the day because that we 've got a council meeting on the 13 so so in order to recommend how the christchurch city council vote be exercised but then then we might hit a real litigation of it at the council meeting so i just think that we 're just going to say that the submissions committee will report to us but but they will decide how the crotchet City Council will vote will be exercised and we will endorse that at the council meeting will endorse us up or down so yeah Paul what I sort of Meghan oh do you think be prudent that we have a chat to a unitary partners to see what their feelings are so if we come at a more combined front for our zone yeah we might actually get a better outcome yeah I think that 's a very good idea so how do we action nation here well it can and the the two local councils Glenn and I and that zone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see with whether it 's been discussed whether they 've got a position yeah and we 'll make sure we try and report that back to you in time for the submission spin also that yeah it can be aware that would be great thank you right so i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no it 's carried thank you very much and I think we 're done I think we 're done so others to clear the meeting closed thank you all very very much","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Meeting,VquNUam_duw,20140226,1345.04,"Christchurch, New Zealand",3441,item number team League first the first item is the protocol with Eastern vision i I 'm sorry I should have actually declared my own interest in this right from the start and two counselors are a member of it as well so can we just note that the interest and their counselors Livingston counselor and east and myself are involved with Eastern vision it 's not a membership body as such and so yeah so that just needs to be recorded for the record so therefore none of us will move this motion would somebody else like to move the motion for us Pauline kata and Andrew tuna and I 'll open that up for yes Paul I just think that it 's actually incredibly important that this protocol of Eastern Division has joined up with the Hagley fearing we their boundary that 's right up to our our our ward but there 's also other word going on with other organizations like the coastal pathway and it just seems really logical that whatever they 're trying to achieve on that side of the Easter that actually connects to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think it 's really important that any in any decision making processes are joined up with the Hagley ferret mood board I 'm just I 'm not i don 't think that have we got anyone here to advise on it I mean I can I can answer the question because as part of the discussion you know that occurred I wasn 't at the earthquake committee of the whole but it seemed that the yeah that the the issue has been addressed in the 7.2 was that the the community board so we invite the two community board chairs to join Eastern verza vision wealth join but be part of that the the steering group that has coordinating it and and that would provide the direct and put onto both wards that the truth is is that most of the eastern vision area as as the beer would Pegasus ward but it is true that with the corridor along the x avin site etc through to the s tiaras and the Hagley fury me Ward so it is right that both are involved and we thought that with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two councillors so that it doesn 't create you know a sort of a view that the that the counselors on one side of being involved but not the other but but still engage in a very open way the whole point of eastern version is not to be an organization but to be it was intended to be a conversation the way of engaging people when a discussion about the future of the yeast and the way that so many other bodies are trying to achieve but anyway a counselor East just a further point of order i suppose the area that east envisage eastern vision works and also in court compasses a fair chunk of chili pepper know as well well there 's a view that we should not do that so and you 're referring to the area on the north side of the Styx River and there is a view that we should stop at the Styx River because there hasn 't been any and community engagement beyond the structure of us so it would seem to be you know sort of picking up that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the Waimakariri river I mean it was more in in relation to what looked like the boundary of the east and it is the boundary for the christchurch easter literate but it 's as you say it 's not the boundary for the ward and it seemed to be taking on an area where most of the land and that pitch was actually read zoned in the brooklands decision yani i don 't know a lot of other eastern vision but i but I am concerned that you 've now got a myriad of planning processes the ish around there 's a process around the group the edge of the history there 's a process around the master plans and New Brighton and in theory road is at some stage I presumed some strategic work around red zone and adjacent green zone areas there 's the coastal pathway so it just the phrase eastern vision i think is quite miss misleading because it just you know i think what would be really helpful as a map of the area and you know what i look at what the purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader master plan process that provide a roadmap for a community regeneration and i think that 's a very laudable vision and gold but actually what it sees is much more than just a very defined geographic area and boo but Pegasus and i think you know i am worried when we 're hearing that is not resourcing to do things like the coast from the history edge cleaning process that we 're committing resource to this and it would be really good actually there one joint up process whether it 's this one or whether it 's another one so that people can plead in and not have to be spending all this time and duplicating meetings and resources which I don 't think we can afford to do so um eastern version happy with the two community boards or it might be the three community awards setting up that joint can unscrew is that something that will work for them and is that something that can be developed the the way that it was established was simply the coming together of all of the groups that were involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was to enable a grassroots approach to planning which would enable them to war yea enable them or yea enable them to well people that lived in the eastern area and and work through organizations like the Trevis Wetlands Trust the avin Heathcott who tired history trust the that avan OU de carro network you know so it actually does bring all of those together with individuals and I 've just seen Paul cotton come in the room and he might like to join us at the end of the table we 're just discussing the eastern vision MOU and I think there 's some concern from those and the Hagley fairy Meade ward that that this requires more of a governance approach but I think that the the idea of eastern vision was to be more of a way of bringing the existing groups together that in a way that enables people to to unput onto our planning process it and also to explain things so we knew that when it was when we were originally talking about bringing people together that if we didn 't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we felt that there is a local community we could be building on our our ability to connect with so many different communities in those areas about things like like flooding and all of those things so so that 's that 's the work that we 've been going but recognizing that within that there are proposals around Trevis wetlands around the the residential red zone there are all the master planning they 're all joined in as well renew Brighton and the and the new bright and mass people everything 's all joined up can I just intercede here this is a great idea but it 's it to me it looks like committee creep it 's where you just have groups upon groups upon groups coming together having more meetings and more interaction and actually you end up creating the spider web of people actually we 're trying to do the same thing though isn 't this what community boards are for I mean what I 've noticed having been involved in a lot of different groups post-earthquake is that some of them have a natural lifespan and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that you 've probably got the same bunch of people who are involved in all these different things do you need to set up more and more structures when people actually just want stuff to get done why can 't the community this already exists they want an MoU with your about salt to do what I have more meetings no to have a relationship with the council don 't read it what they want to do is come up with half the council 's on it already so what I did I mean I just think fine I don 't care but you know these things tend to get bigger and bigger and bigger and nothing ever happened so if you want to do it fine we 're not having a Western vision I can say eastern eastern version of the Division Eastern vision has an emo yos with the but what we developed an MoU with know that it 's sorry with one of the other was it Sarah but but we haven 't got one with the council um it gleam do you want to yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's been an evolving conversation that 's always been its intent I guess the other two if we used the what used to be the four-wheel beings as part of the LGA but incidentally which sarah still promotes as part of the strategy recovery that really if you applied those to the impact of the wider east community and communities I my own views that the script ref it reflects the profundity of the impacts of the earthquakes on those areas in all those dimensions you know whether it 's been done by a mental demographic etc so that 's how I see it it 's a huge big picture recovery own personal slant is when the East is recovered the city is recovered as well I 'm really moving into it debate mode now but it 's it 's our seat yani I mean there 's two ish there 's two fundamental questions that come up for me what is the purpose of this group and when you read through what the background information we have is to develop a spatial plan for the eastern suburbs yeah so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we 've got so it 's a master plan or a spatial plan whether you want to call it which is actually work that is or even done in some way by council and I 'm not saying to you know that this process shouldn 't happen but the background information around it provides a much wider thing than just a conversation and you know I come back to reps point there actually a vision for the city is probably what we need and then within that you might have processes in certain areas to develop what that looks like and this was the New Orleans experience where you know they had it they had a big vision for the city but they actually got local communities to feed into it which i think is a really good way of doing it and you know I 'm just really concerned that when we hear you know what council Livingston says that this is about the generic eastern area not a discrete booooored Pegasus or crush at east electro and the connotation is that there 's this process under way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas I mean I want to find a solution for this to proceed but I do wonder whether what they want is a committee of counsel to report to and council staff to assist and that really seems to be what they 're asking for so having a joint community board group that does that seems to be that sensible way but also having a discussion about is it too narrow or as it doesn 't need to be wider or should it be smaller there 's probably a sensible conversation to have yeah I I think Paul would you like to comment on the process so far yeah sure I yep the mic switched on this as usual councillors probably be aware eastern vision has self defined itself if you like they 've come together as a group of people representing also a group of entities that make it up so Ava not Ricardo renew Brighton to name to name a few so they have to find themselves in their own way seem to carry out a range of community planning projects and initiatives they have some earthquake recovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operating Spath presently through me up until now anyway from council and as well as from Sarah have been invited to the meetings to act in a advisory typewriter to share and exchange information we can and we offer advice where appropriate recognizing that it 's their group and its new entity from a governance point of view I mean clearly they they have some elected members from from aboard Pegasus area one way for if I may suggested as their Eastern vision may want to invite someone from Heatley Fiorina largely group could be could be a very straightforward way of dealing with this so I hope that answers your question was chair yeah i think that there 's there 's a a view that councils being asked to endorse the the organizational structure that has emerged from the organizations themselves where is there not what the the organization exists eastern version exists as and a entity it 's not an incorporated society although it probably will incorporate at some point and what they 're asking for is what they have with Sarah which is a memorandum of understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of governance from the council but what they are looking for is a a method for being on councils radar and the way that they are with on Sarah and also to ensure that there is a a proper process in terms of the planning that they are doing be they have had access to that you know that the idea is to develop a map and the maps developed I mean the works been done as community coming together to do there and to take it out to the community so they can envision for themselves what what their assets and their community are going to be like in the future and to contribute to their but we also need people to understand what the what the flooding areas are we need people to understand what the technical issues are on that so an actual fact they 've been working very closely with council but they want to have a link point the previous link point was was facilitated through the the was rigged and planning but now that we 've changed the structure there isn 't there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee so the idea was to leave it open as to who it was following on which committee it would be and my suggestion would be that you know if people have a general interest we could make it the committee of the whole but also make it to I mean I don 't know but invite burwood Pegasus and hagley fearing me community board chairs to join Eastern vision which I know as an offer that they 've made and to pick up on yannis pointer you know to report to the joint boards on a regular basis as well then I think that would be that would be a worthwhile addition but I presume the joint boards meet on a on a quarterly basis project by project but that could be that could be organized between the two boards yeah i 'm sure it could i I thought that this committee saw Ethan vision that the thing that they want a specific committee of counsel to work with and that 's why I thought it should be the two local community boards so that they do want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that they would be disappointed if it was if it was one or the other I mean I 'm suggesting that it could be both so that they report to the committee of the whole so that all councillors are aware of it because the eastern vision is important for the whole city as you 've just identified but it is specific to the two wards yeah I mean yeah I 'm just getting more and more concerned that but because you know as a council as a council law I think we need to be involved in the discussions I agree around the red zone retreat or whatever is happening in the red zone we don 't seem to have any ability to have any strategic conversation about what we 're doing there in terms of services being provided we 've got bridges that are you know being proposed by skirt is a number of things that we 're doing that the local community board is making decisions on in the absence of any strategic response as eastern version going to be doing that strategic work they haven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to do that no so ideally what we 're doing is I didn 't find all the opportunities that I 've got around collaboration so things like cycleways histories rivers they are an organization of organizations who 've actually decided to bring themselves together of their own volition and they want to have an MoU with counsel so look I 'm going to put the motion and people can vote it down if they want to okay no I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no it 's carried thank you I 'll move on to the occupancy of council own commercial builders thank you for the recommendation is that we change the policy so that the council approved the staff recommendation with the following addition to recommendation 6.2 and I 'll move that do I have a seconder yarny johansson does anyone want to speak to it Yanni just very quickly I believe this is the right thing to do this is really about being a lot more strategic about how we are closing buildings and opening buildings and its really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite prone in terms of the MBS but actually haven 't had a lot of earthquake damage and a relatively safe makes no sense at all so this is a much more smarter approach to enabling our buildings through getting top quality professional engineering advice and an avin staff the delegation to make sure that they can respond accordingly so I strongly support this this was something that was raised last term of council that wasn 't agreed to as a result we 've had a number of buildings that were shut and of course shutting building says a lot of harm to local communities particularly in some areas where there 's not a lot of other options and so this is as I said a very much more clever and smart approach to dealing with what I think is a really important issue of keeping community for this is open where we 've got good engineering advice that says that it 's relatively low-risk to do so so I strongly support it thank you to staff the way they 've done around it any other comments I 'll put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they know that 's carried and I 'll move and Tim scandrett will second that the report is a whole be adopted I 'll put the emotion all those in favor say aye we 're zappos they know that 's carried,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

around the right the proposals for deferring a project or project a project or projects within the and the capital works plan is up what okay took to UM to what Peter can you help with us to offset thank you the reinstatement yes yeah you want let me bang was it the whole project I mean it 's a with a preference for four banks bunch of it so that it 's match with them this it nice but I don 't think I mean if something 's obvious because it can 't proceed it might be better not be something that may be as you say it and remember we 've only be talking a few months specific for one calendar year to another but that 's not necessarily 12 months it going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet so in who seconded it was did someone see connect Yanni that 's right yeah needed all right so did you want to debate there or can we just put blue like right okay so well we 'll i 'll put the resolution all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried what do we want to have a vote on that could we record the vote those in favor press yes those opposed say no see beyond boaters are pulling Cotters not on the room sorry oh oh dear just goes back to where it was but I think there 's a there 's a clear message and there about what council latinas going to to move and the is it right so it the report stays as it is ok so the right so so I think yeah there 's a clear message so that to the community about you know there 's a level of support for the for the proposal and I think that many people weren 't supportive because of the process so that I think that seasonally they should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we hear those submissions so the next question is there is there any more debate on the on the annual plan itself otherwise I 'll go back to the resolution staff have highlighted the need to make a amendment and I 've counseled a mangie and goth would would please just simply adopt the extra resolution can we scroll up and this extra one is to say that note that we are any proposal contained in the draft annual plan has the potential to have an impact on staff final approval is conditional upon consultation with the teacher Lee affected employees and I think that 's a proper process surf counselor nangi and gough accept that that 's acceptable to the resolution the resolution is as its stated yani sorry I just don 't quite understand how you can put that into a draft when it 's not the final decision so I signaling that you 're going to go through a staff process ahead of the final decision surely this is something you add to the final plan not the drug you 've got a hit or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Peter on in order to observe the process will we can 't consult with people when it 's a final decision we need to consult before it is a final decision it 's just a fair practice good employer kind of thing to do we have held our legal view on this and it was very clear that we need to consult with staff before the decision is made so we basically hear public submissions and then we 'll get some sort of presentation around what the staff employment process and I thought it 's not part of our process it 's part of a legal process so this would be in relation to the Pioneer Stadium childcare center which we already know that the Union intends to make a presentation to the council on the meter in front of council what we 're expecting a submission on the Pioneer Stadium but in order to make a absolutely clear that final approval around a process is conditional upon consultation with potentially affect employees I think that 's the legal position under their employment agreement is that I mean yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just pioneer it 's also any staff whose rosters are affected so it 's libraries and reckon sport okay so it 's it 's just been fair as an employer to those people okay so so I think your question was around the timing I 'm worried that we might go through a process of stressing all these people out they know need to come up with a different decision that they end the process and then an invader situation where we of course all this unnecessary worry but I mean you know obviously you 've taken advice I can appreciate that we 've had two sets of legal advice on it and it 's the good practice way to go I think in future we really got to get legal advice prior to the meeting so we can actually see it as counselors right all that that is in fact the Batum the legal advice will receive all right so there being no further amendments and no further discussion i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no no no no no no I made a mistake I made a mistake oh god it 's unfair I don 't declare the meeting closed I needed to first of all that oh sorry i meant to sorry what I mean to do was the supplementary meters need to be moved and adopted first and being caused to pot for adoption so sorry i thought i had a resolution around the supplementary meters but ok so i 'll move the supplementary reports be received and considered at the council meeting today yep okay does somebody would like to second that full clear water I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and now I have to put the final resolution no somebody will be rights of all of these things boy watch what is the motion so the recommendations here okay put them in and they don 't okay so all right well I 'll move the the amendments would somebody like to sicken those amendments we 'll need view of the resolution to reinstate the community grants that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs to be reword reworded is it redundant dying after the earlier resolution no it still needs to be there right okay yep are there any other questions on that I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no carried the item number six which is the draft and your pen contributions for community and for structure I 'll move the staff recommendation do I have a seconder ionio handsome okay you have a question um so I did raise this you know I don 't think I 've had a response there 's a number of actions that the previous council asked for as part of a three-year plan a number of outstanding matters reports possible costs one of those was it a bit i believe a development contributions working party so i just want to understand whether that 's been established whether that 's fit into this process and when we 're likely to understand what we 're doing I I am concerned about this report and yeah I do want to have some understanding of what council privacy has raised you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there would be a list of community infrastructure that that should be in our policy that appears now under 3.3 not to have happened and i do want to understand what we 've got to have previous resolutions of counsel in terms of it establishing the working party l on fire water short answer is that that working poly has not has not been formed and so it hasn 't there has been no input from that sort of body to what you 've got in front of you i guess our thinking preliminary thing we had been to to make this sort of adjustment in terms of adding V community infrastructure vector I think to the 215 LTP I think it was a realization of the risk of lost income and certainly the local government Amendment Act Cullinan meant that we have advanced that now into the to the draft annual plant that it done it more quickly there 's only that 's not allow us the opportunity to set up that working party and have a conversation with in doing that so this has been put together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I don 't want to sit through another year of submissions from people upset about DC 's with council passing resolutions to establish working parties and work with developers and others around it to just basically go go round and round in circles so you know can we get a clear timeframe for window squeaking party will be established who 's in charge of it and what the reporting mechanism is and does it tie into this process that we 're going through at the moment so that possibly we could be informed at the end can we capture counselor your hansen 's questions and I 'll come and just the second thing is I um why was the community infrastructure taken out of last year 's three-year plan when I thought the expectation was that it would be in there not my understanding and is is that it wasn 't included in the three-year plan because they 're there was a lot of uncertainty at that point around the capital program which you all seem lead to them to establish three the DC all right so was that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is my understanding I wasn 't close to that process last time threesome thank you do we need a statement to establish a development contributions we can party to a report and by the end of May I mean do we need to have it as part of the annual plan process and sounds to me like Yanni thinks there was a working party set up already it is a number of things that happened last year through the annual plan process we heard submissions from people in the community we made resolutions we agreed that things would happen there 's a number of outstanding matters and I think this will be one of those it may it may have been through a different process but certainly the issue of dc 's has been around and people have been concerned that it was originally the policy was developed a commitment to establishing a working party and I think we do need to kind of get some clarity around what 's happening there well I mean I 'm just wondering whether we should invite the chair of strategy and planning committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the annual planning process by the end of May my understanding was and I might tell anything 's here but my understanding was that we had development contributions basically a full review of that effectively coming to the counts or to the strategy and planning committee it is on the upcoming agendas it 's going to be coming to strategy and planning there 's going to be a big piece of work done around that so i don 't know if that 's effectively what yo knees touching on us is probably in the works and i can find we can get more details around there and report back to the council so they 're kept fully in the loop if that helps yeah what I 'm worried about sometimes is that is that if timeframes haven 't been see it then you know people lose sight of you know who 's doing what when how and why and this is kind of one that I think that what I 'm hearing from cancer johansson and actually I share this is that we ought to be driving as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you offline to to report back to to counsel and maybe if your if you could place on the agenda an update of where things are up to and Affairs part of that process you would like to establish a working party through your through strategy and planning I have a feeling there might be probably we were going to go with us as well anyway but I just take this opportunity now then while we 're doing that seeing as we 've got James here I know Mike 's not but if we can just request as right now coming from the chair for strategy and planning an update to all of the council on we 're at with the deep development contributions review yeah things like opening hours of templeton hall Wi-Fi in the central city there 's there 's a whole bunch of outstanding things that we just need to close that loophole yes it is that 's not really a little contribution policy so yeah so I don 't think we need to amend the resolution with now it 's been it 's in the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that we need to really have that rapport and time for when we 're reflecting on the on the you know on the submissions that have been received because I 'm sure development contributions will come up and the public submission process so it would be very useful if you took that end of May deadline is as a deadline for reporting back to the full council as well thank you all right i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's scary I 'm allowed to declare the missing perfect yeah no I know","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

that motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and we 'll move to the first of those which is the acting chief executives report and I 'll hand over to Jane perfect thank you and as usual I 'll take this is red just a few comments on the way through Leanne summarized yesterday 's events really well and the way forward for us they sort of make the executive summary ancient history and in some ways and but it 's timely to remember that the ellerslie Flower Show was actually put forward a week had we not done that what might have been even worse never thought of it and now so that 's the only comments on the executive summary and updates are shown and read in terms of the answers to the questions your motors there 's still a couple of outstanding things one around the pedestrian safety and barrington mall and secondly it 's a question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that building consents issued by suburb next report arose from a question that counselors asked about mapping where the building consents we 're going but we 'll get to that one next so other little bit as i see i 'll just take it as we can take any further questions would somebody like to move the report receiving the report so that we can yes but i 'll get a resolution fierce Obrecht mangie second term scandrett refugee yeah thanks Jane page to the Christchurch art gallery it 's I thought this was supposed to be open next year and it says be completed late 16 2017 that a typo okay I 'll follow up and just confirm back to you by email this sorry what was that but it looks like it 's been updated late 15 the basic completion was supposed to be jus I think April 2015 but now it 's got that extra bit in there saying and being completed late 2016 I 'll follow up yonex oh thank you right okay I 'm a gleam Livingston and then felt Clearwater cute I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jane is in relation to now plena why there that that reads as if the possible location is up for debate is that that 's what it says our sorry page to where it says athletic straight replacement report to council eminently replacement projects should precede it first location so that 's the preferred location the master plan of preliminary investigation that the master plan that proposed will come back to Council so we 've yet to make a decision on I go that 's going to be the proposal that 's right ok and the if you got a date for the Eastern Rican sports into the Suffolk discussing the data was going to be much I 'll come back to you on that you 're right i need a date I haven 't been given a date yep but it 's my expectation that it will be in March um will way to do it next week at a committee if we can if we can 't we 'll call a special committee meeting to consider it but you know it 's my expectation that we will discuss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much thank you I 'm sorry Phil and Jane think if you report in the questions I just want to ask about the questions on page seven starting with the Colombo Street distribution center I just take your point that the the construction of the distribution center isn 't this an ideal for office space for use by community groups or not not n not-for-profits but I just wonder if in fact in the as a temporary solution if we might be to progress that somehow like for example in the last year the the upper mezzanine floor was quite empty and I 'm just wondering if in fact we still might at a progress I 'd be happy to to meet with some staff and I 'm sure Kansas Kendra would too and most of the community board chair to look at how we could even utilize that space on a temporary basis that 's my first point oh thank you i 'll pick that helped me set up in Thank You Jane and I was also just going to call me to be out the barrington more safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it it just concerns me there and I understand the point that the more owners might be concerned about what might be the best solution and I 'd certainly just hope that omit that you know that sort of approach doesn 't influence a decision that might give us at least than best practice for safety but I know that so I 'm interested in the outcome of those further discussions and the just on the traffic issues for generally but that 's the third bullet point particularly for lincoln road beside it think and thinks the staff for the work that 's been done on there but in addition i just wonder if like one thing that has been done there 's been some other parking improvements have been made which have assisted but at one stage there was the possibility of a worker 's bus heading to trying to resolve the traffic congestion then that was it Environment Canterbury we 're going to be looking at that with council staff so just wonder if that is another option that might still be able to be exported via the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their art gallery given the expected completion date late 2015 now opening according to this eerie 2017 whether it I 'm hoping like hell that 's wrong but I 'm just wondering if you could maybe find out a 20 or something and they just know during the course of this meeting because if it is 2017 our suspect it is a whole raft of other implications in relation to a raft of things which I won 't go into you yep um Yanni you 're handsome yeah thank you um just just in regards to the Commerce Street distribution center and I 'm not sure what 's happening with respect hard hub and Eddington and what the time frames are for that building but it just seemed to me that a lightweight structure like that that possibly at some stage needs to get relocated because its consent expires and you know we expect comes back into the central so there would be an ideal thing to be thinking about so much which so yeah the Commerce Street distribution center so I was just really wanting to know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for community groups in the city because of what 's happened in the central city and the cost of moving into other places like an addington for example which has gone through the roof so there 's a real need for affordable space for community groups that this was trying to address which doesn 't you know it doesn 't look like it 's going to i 'm just wondering whether we 've considered transitional uses for other lightweight structures for example to go on the site obviously when the build permanent thing here but some sort of transitional lightweight temporary structure like but we suspect hard with soon to be you know maybe a possible solution so there 's a bit of land ok clear course that I think that 's what yannis strongly above so we could take that into conversation you know I do wonder whether we actually need a report around what what we can do in terms of as a council around affordable community group space and probably good time to what 's happening with the Community House coming back at some stage across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survey of you know what people 's needs and expectations and plans are and I think costs the council social services will have done a lot of that work yeah and community house will have been doing some of that work with its groups but I think they had it you know I 'm not sure whether it fits under CDC but it isn 't a it 's an issue for us as a city and I think when you come to the grants round you 'll see a lot more applications for increased costs of rent which I just don 't think we have the capacity as a council to afford but actually thinking about how we may provide some that space is probably a more logical okay so why don 't we ask Jane to report back to the next meeting with you know basically a summary of what what the community or the commune canceled of Council of Social Services has by way of information about that that need across the the community sector and then perhaps with a recommended way forward for the council recognizing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on what they 're going to be seeking from the council anyway so yeah and we 've got things like schools that are empty there could be possibly heavy we have got ya he needs to be a kind of joint up strategy with central government which still trying to get a meeting exactly but but there is there is absolutely a willingness to meet with the Ministry of Education so you know we had a direct approach from the minister of education that it has been approved that we will meet with the Ministry of Education but best laid plans we haven 't actually been able to a structure that meeting to suit the honestly yet so we will get their hands up and that that is obviously a considerable priority and just that the second question was around the traffic issue is is there a discrete traffic plan being developed for Eddington because that 's what was asked for what 's happening is all the private plan changes have been going through the system they all look at localized traffic affects they don 't look at community of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic rather than qu cumulative traffic effects and so what you 're getting is all these consents being approved on the basis that people can either put in traffic lights and actually clog up the system no one seems to be looking at the wider strategic traffic affects for all the q 's of traffic affects in this area and from the response I 'm not clear that there 's any discrete piece of work that 's been done in this regard so can you just follow that our question and I think it would be good to understand what is the discrete piece of work if it 's happening when is it expected by and how does this relate to consents that it currently been granted yeah are there any other questions Jimmy chin one question where is the information in heart is the updated status regarding to the southwest home be the new service in turn in the library facility to replace the sack ponder service center because my understanding the staff will try to seek the powerful location and the site prefer site for almost 18 months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facility but why not disappear so I don 't know why so where is this on the report not here before you not here oh I can i call the sacral service center that 's one of the you know are you at your facility yeah and also pull a budget in the three year plan but he 'll I didn 't see what you 're saying is that this list of central city and major facilities is not definitive and you want to have added to that list originally here I understand it is a one of the major facility same as like that Eastern equation is for center yeah put it on yep sorry that probably an oversight but yes it will go on there any other questions I just had one of my own well it 's not really question it 's just a statement about how weather might have made a difference to the ellerslie Flower Show but it didn 't make a difference to our attempt to liberate the National Memorial to women 's suffrage on the 8th of March which is international women 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were going to for a relatively small investment be able to take the fencing away from it permanently until until the building 's fully repaired and I was very excited to be able to inform the women 's group who then excitedly sent out sent our breaking news about how we were going to do that on on saturday morning and unfortunately they 've now just seemed out some unbreaking news who are heartbreaking news which is that we will have to wait so I will be consulting with the National Council of women and other women 's organizations about whether they want to undertake a liberation ceremony before the 19th of September but it certainly will be will be able to be done in time and until them until the building itself as fully repaired so I 'd actually like to place on recalled my thanks to the staff that especially Terry house who works so hard to deliver a good result in unfortunately the weather diverted his attention and many others to to that that the last thing that I wanted to mention was the end you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was unfortunate that the headline indicated that the council was not proceeding or that up the eastern recreation sports center was on hold it 's not on hold we are going through a process of determining now a process for determining the site but i think that the point that i was attempting to make was simply that you know we can sit around this table and vote an extra million dollars here and extra million dollars they 're on different projects it all makes an impact on the ability of this council to meet the obligations that have been made and yes we do have to revisit things and i just have to say that there is there is something not quite right with a process that says we will set aside 30 point five million dollars when we don 't actually know what the cost of building a facility will be and and so the level of expectation that 's driven up and the community as that as the amount that will be spent I know that I 've been talking to a number of people around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legacy around the approach that 's been proposed there by local community groups coming together and I think the master planning process has started to look far more joined-up over recent months and I think that 's a really good outcome so you know I 'm just saying that despite the the headline I think that this has enabled the communities to think actually a little bit more broadly about what we could achieve across the East because the East has you know suffered so much and there is so much that we are going to have to do in order to restore a sense of vibrancy and opportunity over there so that will be and I 'm really pleased to hear from both counselor Livingston and councillor Johansson that we will be dealing with this next month so that will give people the certainty that they 're looking for thank you so I won 't put the motion i 'm going to thank ya not on the eastern sea sorry but just in relation to their Colombo Sri distribution center and the need for community groups and two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not sure what happens when that use runs out or in fact how much usage that building is getting at the moment and it would just be really helpful and I could include that and thank you very much Olivia so I 'm not going to put the motion on this because while we break for morning tea Jane will find the answer to the question that 's concerning everyone around the art gallery and we 'll deal with that when we return so it 's 1040 so if we could be back here at five to 11 that would be fine will restart the meeting,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"
NZ,NZ,Christchurch City Council,Christchurch City Council,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZETwErnCvvgbvBbnnHfyxA,06.03.14 - Item 4 - Presentations,jtRx2jSyLuw,20140305,2573.2,"Christchurch, New Zealand",8018,"from liann Watson general manager from the Canterbury employers Chamber of Commerce giving us an update on your work and your role and welcome thank you very much and can assist you just say thank you for the opportunity in seeking the council apologies from our chief executive Peter Townsend who 's currently in Auckland with the Sierra Roadshow so it 's the reason we 've got the B team here today no you 're not became at all if you do tell me to say the end we might call you the a+ 10 other lately thank you just don 't tell Peter he did tell me to save you on CH FFF anyway I just wanted to start off by giving you a little bit of a brief overview of who we are and I appreciate that many of you will already know this but just as a wee bit of an update I suppose so we have two thousand eight hundred members then we 're a not-for-profit organization who are owned by our members the we 're the principal business support agency in the South Island and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business capability ensuring our members can operate in a business-friendly environment and recognizing and rewarding success and can 't agree to make a positive case for sustainable profitable business in our community so when I was asked to presented as a little bit around the Chamber 's role I guess post-earthquake ang and what we 're currently doing now but I think it 's really important to understand the scale of what we 're heading into and what we find is that many businesses and agencies certainly don 't understand the scale so I just wanted to spend a little bit of time talking a little bit about some of that scale so we 've all heard about the 40 billion and before and that 's 40 billion before we add on any betterment which most repairs been undertaken include so it 's significantly bigger than the 40 billion and that equates to around three years of fonterra 's total export revenue landing on our population of 500,000 three years three years of Fonterra 's export earnings yeah so it 's a pretty significant figure there 145,000 houses with damages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fletcher 's EQC is just over half completed there are approximately 25,000 homes with over hundred thousand dollars worth of damage of what journey 2630 have been or under appear approximately 8,000 homes have been destroyed or written off and we 've only just started the commercial rebuild so we 're about ten percent under the total rebuild but more importantly of ninety percent to go and many of you will have heard Peter Townsend talk about the urban myths and I just wanted to see me know what I 'm talking about those because important that was you know these are the sorts of must set the rest of the country head around around our city so the first one is that we you know we well advanced in our recovery phase and recovery yeast but rebuild we 've we 've only just started with ninety percent to go and the second is that we 've lost a lot of people from our city we 've all heard stories of teams of thousands of people vacating the city since the earthquakes which is simply not true the reality is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving from one part of crushes to another but the overall population of Greater Christchurch has increased markedly since the last census by about 13,000 people and in fact greater than it was prior to the fort at Sabine between e team the third urban legend is around the issue of capital flight the spectrum of large amounts of money flying out of Christchurch is a method simply has to be dispelled it is not where the money flies but we 're at lands and that 's what we need to ensure we need to create an environment here in Christchurch that will encourage capital to lend there is plenty of capital sloshing around christchurch looking for a place to land and it 's up to us to ensure that it does indeed find a home here in our city and the fourth is that we 've suffered segen a significant economic downturn which we haven 't the current growth in our region is around seven percent of GDP and that is unprecedented and we 've really got to take that into account that the reconstruction of the city as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big the growth in this economy will be over the next 12 months this is survival in the post earthquake environment has been extraordinary the normal churn rate for businesses in our community so that 's business has got that go out of business for one reason or another as around was around eleven point four percent before the earthquakes post-earthquake sitting at around eleven point six need we 've had excuse me 17,000 new businesses or new business registrations with 11,000 of those being new companies since for 13 2010 unemployment is two percent below the national average consumer spending has grown as fast as anywhere in New Zealand business confidence and business and tensions are high and we 've had a twenty-four percent increase in it exports through the port of Littleton those are statistics that clearly illustrate a strong economy in one that is world poised to take advantage of a positive economic challenges ahead one of the critical issues in coping with the scale of the rebuild is forming collaborative models where companies and side Christchurch can unlock economic opportunities with companies outside of the region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're starting to be seeing more and more in the context of the rebill around christchurch so how the business community meet the challenges I think this is really important to understand just the the resiliency of the business community that I 've just mentioned if you look at disasters elsewhere in the world it 's not uncommon to have a 30-percent depression and business activity and Christchurch that certainly didn 't happen and there are four fundamentals reasons and our opinion as to why and what we can learn from the food 's been the government 's earthquake support subsidy on the success of timber Peter Townsend was interviewed on morning report stating that if we didn 't do something to support our business community there would be significant business collapse and within weeks with most businesses particularly small reliant on cash flow to pay their staff if the business wasn 't able to operate they simply couldn 't pay his staff and then would be no business Bill English she was listening ring Peter and see what do we want us to do our response was tricked Christchurch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with no business the result was the earthquake subsidy support support subsidy which post-september resulted in two thousand three hundred businesses in eleven thousand seven hundred employees receiving team point to a million and it was done on a very high trust basis and implemented very quickly and it was a crucial component of the scheme following 22nd of febuary Bell English ringers and told us we would he be up in the employment earthquake support subsidy from 350 a week to 500 per week for employees and it would apply to all companies not just small companies this resulted in two hundred million dollars being put under support approximately 15,000 companies and their employees and we still receive feedback today and had one yesterday on a survey that we completed saying that if it wasn 't for that that scheme many businesses were just not have survived the second reason for the business survival being so high was the behavior of many of our support institutions and particularly places like Inland Revenue in the banks and Lynn revenue at were instrumental in delaying tax payments and the banks were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cash flow and increasing 5,000 lots to help working capital and delay payment of loans the third reason was the formation of recover Canterbury joint venture between the Canterbury Development Corporation and the Chamber to support all businesses who are impacted by the youthquake this included taking the mandate for business support posts for the September so obviously quick drink it also included co-locating the CDC with the chamber for a few weeks but given the burden was in the redzone post-september and we set up a business support course into a dedicated website and were in the process in fact on the twenty-second of febuary the morning of the twenty-second februari our first two business recovery coordinators started with the CDC and with ourselves post-september obviously that recover cantore model was put on steroids and we we begin that whole process again at its peak which included sacani and staff from local government agencies such as and then living new in SD etc we had 30 business recovery coordinators and we also set up a trust fund with seed funding of 200,000 from the government and at its peak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that fund was provided to three hundo over 380 businesses in general support provided to over 7,000 businesses through the call center and direct one-on-one assistance provided to over 1,400 businesses between februari to our 2011 end may 2013 there 's also many other levels of support that were offered through their organization which I won 't go into detail and the fourth one was just the sheer determination of the business community to refuse to lie down and I think we 've seen there again and again and again including probably through yesterday 's extremely the situations small businesses will do almost anything to save their businesses including risking their lives to get back into their buildings and we learned that the relationship between limited liability companies in the owners is much more than just a company so where we are now and what are the issues that we 're facing now the first issue is around insurance and while we 're making progress this has taken a lot longer than what we would have expected for reasons that have been well boost forty five percent of house insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled which but but forty five percent of house insurance have been settled and seventy percent of a commercial claims acetal the second is around building consents and with insurance payments now coming through there will be added pressure from the residential sectors to have their homes rebuilt and repairs which are starting to see huge pressure on consent processors given we 're only ten percent under the rebuilders can only increase resourcing constraints are both around materials and supplying and supply including increasing building costs and people seven and a half thousand new migrants on temporary work visas arrived in Christchurch up until June last year seven and a half thousand and we 're expected to see another ten thousand migrants the forecast is around 10,000 by jun 2014 this year so know that there are all temporary work visas is some of that 10,000 will include some renewals of those seven thousand but we 're still talking about a significant number during this this year yet this year so this put significant pressures on our economy all parts including housing and accommodation and it changes the dynamics of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of constraints will put serious pressures on our resources and the context of a regional economy that is a really growing at seven percent so what does the Chamber 's doing to support business and the context of this new environment the chamber have changed their business model on the way in which they support their members up until six months ago our services were made available to all businesses not just our members we are now starting to get back into providing a high level of support a higher level of support to our members given where a membership-based organization and that 's our primary means of funding we 've doubled our resorts in two key areas as a result of the increased needs of business the first is a net health and safety advisory and consultancy offering and the second is a government contract we have with envy which is around running settlement support services for both new migrants and employers the large number of new migrants and employers who haven 't previously employed migrants means that this area continues to grow in the support mechanisms become more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we cover we have a team of 30 staff or when we also as I mentioned run a couple of government contracts the second one is a regional partner around building business capability in access to government grants for particularly around research and development one of the key points of difference we have is a wide range of areas we can assist and we support all sectors and sizes and businesses in the depth of service that we can offer we deliver support in a wide range of ways including everything from resources to training events advice and consultancy writes remember savings so just a couple of slides We strongly advocate the independency between a healthy business community in a healthy community many organizations or many individuals think because we 're a business based organization makes that 's our main focus but anyone who who knows what we do in those that work particularly that Peter Townsend and many of its management team are involved and recognized that there is a very strong dependency between a healthy community and a healthy business environment and that 's a really strong world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a non-political organization ensuring business interests are well represented and promoted across can 't agree so how can the City Council help some key messages that we here for you and minimizing the financial and positions on business be supportive of business and we 're possible overtly business-friendly through case management and making things easy and provide certainty for business we 've all heard a lot around creating a certainty of framework around some of the rebuilt projects and making sure that there is enough information back to the business community about what 's happening work on a big integrated plan for a city there 's so many different plans across the city if we can have one integrated plan bringing them all together that would be really helpful help us determine what christ church should be should aspire to be and also recognize that the chamber we are a trusted partner to work on a grade common objectives and the interests of optimizing Christ shooters future thank you very much thanks very much so take the liberty of the first question and it really was was there that comment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city because I think I understand you know we 've got the central city plan we 've got various other plans around the place transport different chapters you know we 're doing our district plan review tell me what what that would look like as far as the Chamber 's concerned well I think the main focus of an integrated plan is to create some Susan d around all these things so for businesses that are impacted by many different basics of those plans to have to understand the complexities of each of those plans is really difficult so having an overarching plan that takes into account all of the different components of those things created quite a strategic level and then would be really really helpful to create some certainty but also to create a centralized platform for businesses to go to to say right how does this all fit together so I mean I suppose some of your businesses would have more than one location and the city sat sometimes in the CBD sometimes unlearn and the suburb so that would be helpful as well yes absolutely and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key when I think yeah because it often it has done in isolation or Thor appeared it appears that it 's done in isolation so that would be a key one to be part of that integrated model yeah that 's great thank you I 'm Ali green though Thank You holy in I 'm going to save the leadership that the chamber showed for business particularly I think in the days and months that followed febri 22nd was absolutely stunning I think that it made a huge difference in actually keeping things going and giving people some shorty of income and businesses surety of income as well I 'm concerned though obviously about the insurance settlement figures you mentioned forty five percent of of residential you 're aware that the majority of those are redesigned cash settlements that there 's still a huge number outstanding as far as repairs and rebuilds go this has a huge effect flow-on effect into the economy to say nothing of emotional well-being and psychosocial well-being as well how do you think that this can be improved what do you think do you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a tricky question earlier look I think there is no doubt that there is still a huge challenge ahead of us and I think it 's really important to recognize that and we certainly do recognize that there are still many many businesses and individuals who are struggling and I guess our message is particularly around some of those figures as what we 're saying is making sure that the business community in particular recognized that because of those things have happened because we have made some progress and some good progress this will continue to put more and more constraints on the economy so it 's about and messages to the business community are you know make sure you are aware of the scale and recognize the challenges ahead make sure you are fooled planning and and how do you do that make sure you use the down time that you 've had or are having to actually make sure you 've got the right structure for your business make sure you 've got the right staff you know if you do need to employ more people do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we have is continuing to send those messages out to businesses that the business community is never going to be the same again they do need to recognize and operate with new business models that requires different schools they do need to look at different sources for scars for staff for their supply channels those sorts of things they do need to collaborate with other organizations outside the region so it 's about preparing those businesses for those changes so that 's that 's the role that we would take it you don 't I mean obviously what 's happening with staff and the residential insurance and EQC issues will be linked to how businesses managing that stress time off all those sorts of things as well do you see the chamber taking a more proactive role in asking for changes perhaps even an legislation or regulation around it to make sure that the people aren 't so affected affecting businesses too yeah yeast absolutely it 's a key role in fact yesterday I facilitated a session on workplace wellness where we had 98 people in the room that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court state in the morning so I think that demonstrates there is a real willingness out there and it 's a real issue so workplace wellness which ultimately leads to you know better productivity and better engage staff and lower turnover and all those sorts of things as a key issue that businesses are facing and we do provide a lot of support and resourceful businesses to cope with stress staff and change management and those sorts of things so whether or not it needs to be legislated as probably a different debate and I think there are many many organizations in Christchurch who this is part of the HR strategy as not an add-on anymore it 's just part of the way that they deal with their staff you know we 've all lived through so many different disasters in the last few years that in fact you know yesterday talked to one of our HR people about putting some information out around what their obligations were in terms of staff that couldn 't come to work you know what they needed to do to support their staff etc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've had so many of these things that businesses are now very well prepared and they they just they get all that they 're resilient so it is a key role for us to continue providing that support and those messages you know green living from thank you thank you being just in terms of the budget namit as well as social recovery of the city obviously it 's understood that once the cvd tips is more functional that clearly that 's going to deliver that a huge significant part of the economic recovery but what about the residential sector so am i my hunch is that we get people 's homes fixed and that goes back to insurance yeah settlement to that that 's got to be a big economic privately oh it was absolutely was yeah I mean again you know going back to the fact that we use were a business facing organization but recognizing that we have to have you have to have strong business death a healthy community you can 't have one without the other in our opinion so of course you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go in parallel with the residential rebuild and one should not be at the expense of the other I mean it 's you know certainly always been our position and will continue to be in terms of an integrated plan that would all make sense absolutely yeah and it 's a key part of it under greater plan as well it 's not not to have them in isolation yeah I 've never seen it as one or the other but in both together so right David thank you clear order think of your presentation and I really like that concept that working collaboratively in the different parts of this and just saluting to what Green Glen was pets asking you to like you refer to a large huge number Trinity of migrant workers coming in on a temporary basis so in terms of for example yep that 's really how could general comments support us to look at how in fact we can plan for their accommodation needs yeah the accommodation is a very tricky and situation is you know you were always very well aware of and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try and ensure that i mean the settlement support contract that we 've had for a number of years has primarily been around supporting the migrants with the settlement needs so information around you know the city how the city works you know the hospitals are schooling that you know the education all those sorts of things the role has changed quite significantly post-earthquake which is now also providing the same level of support to employers so employers understand the importance of all of those things with their migrant workers part of that whole conversation is around what sort of support the employer can provide to the new migrant which one component of that is accommodation so yes I think we can 't hear some conversations around that I mean we have a you know a very strong network of employers that are employing migrants here in the city who we meet with regularly to find out what some of those in each tranche of migrants that come we find there are different issues obviously different nationalities have different issues but as we progress through different stages of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognizing what those needs are and how we as a as a community actually work together and there are many people that work in the space that you 'll be aware of and it 's one of the roles that we also have as providing a network facility for all of those providers to get together to make sure we 're actually maximizing our reach and we 're not overlapping each other so it 's really important part I did notice Jimmy chin up work Missouri you mentioned earlier settlement support for new migraine improve away be successful by a moment based on your two thousand eight hundred members how much percentage e for all those the new migrant they are you know affecting the running their business in canterbury or quite church how many members how many of our members would be employing new migrants so yeah yeah yeah so the settlement support contract we deal with both members and non-members so it 'll be a lot of them will also not be our members that we 're working with but we would actively work with probably around 300 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ migrants or who are looking at employing my grits or who have some role in providing support to migrants so it 's quite a large number of businesses there are probably a very small group of migrants sorry of employers who have employed the majority of migrants so that in itself makes it probably a little bit easier to actually work in a sort of a one-on-one case management type approach with those organizations but many of those organizations are very very well advanced and the way that they support the migrants the next layer down the smaller companies who are now starting to gear up and look towards you know getting more staff through either migrants or other channels they are the ones that have never employed by grants before and need a lot more support because it 's a very complex arrangement tutor and also and great that into the enter that you know the Kiwi born workers as well so that it 's not seen as we do all this for migrants that we don 't do anything for a Kiwi work it so that 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you 've just got three quick runs with regard to the insurance as we 've got difference of twenty forty five percent for armed homes and about 70 for commercial and your organization 's opinion if there were legislation that insisted that insurance company sit within a time frame with it in your organization 's opinion have accelerated they reap the rebuilder and nice easy one start ya ya thinks in it look I think we would all like to have seen things you know progress much faster than what they they had have been but I think we need to understand that for the insurance companies it wasn 't a one-off event that happened and then everything went back to normal and we could assess the damage and move on you know we head on going earthquakes for you know up to 18 months and so I think that putting putting a legislation around there may helpful some natural disasters absolutely would it have helped for the earthquake I 'm not sure about that I mean I 'm not really in a position to make to make that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very closely with the insurance companies at end you know put in as much pressure on them as weekend to get some soutien tea around what 's happening when it 's happening in knowing to be fear with with the business community in n residence okay thank you my sickle i 'ma probably just as up interesting is you know you must own with timber send into the rebuild and we talked about the insurance settlement etc if you see have a time frame which they believe they 'll be done and dusted in this city what 's your organization 's feel on deck realistic time frame and look I think the time for a bit of that have been put out under the market around all sorts of things have you know been best kisses and while while it 's really helpful to have time frames and you know this is the challenge between having a framework of certainty and having those time frames out in the public domain as soon as you put a time frame in place and it moves people within criticize you for that so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put time frames out and actually that 's not helpful either because then you 've got it see no certainty for businesses to make well-informed decisions on so I think you know the time frame for many many things there 's probably a little bit unrealistic you know when you talk about how long every bit will take you know we often hear from outside of the region oh you know you told us that you know you 're going to be in the peak of the rebuild and you know 2013 but it hasn 't started yet well you know why not and so I think yeah as the tricky thing to answer but i think that the reboot is going to take a lot longer then what you know he 's been predicted and that 's for all those reasons that i mentioned before around you know supply constraints people constraints you know insurance complexities you know we 've got all these people now who had money paid out to them from their from their homes that now want to actually start rebuilding but they 're not just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whole lot of betterment as well so what they might have estimated that it might take three months to do that repair well it 's actually going to take sex because they 're going to add a a décor or do whatever to their to be properly at the same time so all those so let 's keep when you know pushing pushing time frames out thank you just like to follow what LEC though your organization we think they stick and what you did following the earthquake and oh you 're a number of people that I know that that really saved in from going and rural or thinking differently so just so thank you very much thank you fergie back thank you just in relation to Zurich are fifty appalling I 'll come back to it sorry no babies just just in relation to the temporary work visas you suggested that 10,000 and is that just for one year generally two years okay 13,000 over two years and those temporary work visas are they just attached to one person or does one person come with a family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an expert in this this area so i probably need to be we were keeping about the detail but so when i say ten nine ten thousand sixteen thousand and they 've generally are on to youtube its 10,000 for one year but they 're here for two weeks okay thank you what tends to happen as they come as individuals and not in all situations but and i 'm generalizing here they come as individuals what we 're finding now as many of them who are here I quite came to stay is so they they need to go through that process too yeah extend extend me around you know the permits are things and in terms of accommodation are they looking initially for rental accommodation yes yes I believe so yes and I mean many of them through some of the larger PMO 's you know which will be aware of hip accommodation arranged for them and different you know sort of facilities but those particularly that are coming out from and wanting to bring families and things will probably move out of that inter mental accommodation right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leanne wondering are you aware of any businesses that might be interested in actually providing accommodation for migrant workers there aren 't there are several businesses who currently do provide accommodation for their migrant workers and yet I mean out of any disaster there 's always opportunities that come up and there are business listen who set themselves up to provide support and all sorts of different areas including there somewhere we you know we 're seeing lots of sort of homestay type environments we are all sudden they 'll have to be dreams that they will you know lease out to migrant workers and things like that so not on a we 're not aware of well I 'm not a weird person have any large-scale your organizations that are providing you know direct accommodation but certainly there are some construction companies who have provided their own accommodation but in with my question is to conviction rate you as well on the recovered Canterbury program the would be site-specific particularly what you ran in each we 're and send Albans and that area had been struggling for years to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your work that 's been commenced and it 's quite successful and you also rename you know each we was open for business that you might have done it around the city and it was incredibly successful and really really uplifting for businesses in the community but my question is is that see that or do you still have a relationship a how proactive are you if you do and then keeping these things going you know and in communicating with them and supporting them as an ongoing type of thing yeah well I mean one of the things that came out of a cover cantore was what were some of the legacy things that we that we would like to see carry on beyond obviously the life of a cover Canterbury and then a lot of the things that were established were established with that in mind and you know it the measure of success is always when you walk away in those things continued and some of those things as you mentioned have continued which is great so the chamber does continue to play a role and supporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have us because we are membership funded primarily so if we spend a lot of time supporting non-members that 's to the detriment often to those that actually pay annual subscription for that support so there 's a balance between how much we can provide support to those areas and often etc in formation level or a you know like a coordination a facilitation type role rather than us being you know a key part of that association for example so yes we do continue to provide support for many different organizations like that but probably at arm 's length Yanni Johansson thank you just two questions one is how much are you doing around the issue the idea of sustainability and resilience going forward it just seems like is you know possibly an area where we could do better as a city in terms of either new buildings and the commercial sector or just the ongoing practices so it 'd be really interested to hear your thoughts around what you 're doing in regards to sustainability and whether we might be able to work with you through the program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivered on an interesting question actually because we had before the earthquake sustainability was quite a key focus you know one of our sort of tranches of work that we were actively involved in and instead of meeting a couple of weeks ago with Iker around pretty uh pretty much name asking the same question you know as it on your radar as it on your members radar and be fair to say that you know up until very recently it hasn 't been a key priority not not through not because it 's not important but it just hasn 't been a priority in terms of the other priorities that we that we have and I think with our own rebuild and kill north street it was one of the key elements of you know when we sit down some ideas of what we wanted to achieve one of it was we wanted to have a sustainable building and we wanted to be seen as a leader in the area so that members would obviously see that and go no it 's good for the end maybe we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole doctor sheet we certainly you know support sustainable building and making sure that businesses you know if that is a key component of the rebuild however really really important and this is a mission that I have thicker there it 's simple and it 's not done at a cost so it 's not seen as a an added cost so we have our building and then we have sustainability beats and on top of it it has to be really really simple and often in our experience it can be quite complex particularly around you know some of the consenting issues and some of the the processes that you have to go through I mean have you guys do you have a relationship with our target sustainability program within council we have in the past but yet probably not we would probably need to renew that I think that would be really good if you know obviously an opportunity um the second question was what you 're seeing in regards to the central city versus the development that 's happening in the eddington and suburbs and particularly around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come back into the central city do you see him constraints around what 's stopping people from coming back and do you have any thoughts as to you know what we might be able to do as a city to encourage people to come back we get asked that question a lot and I mean I think you know that this the suburbs will always be different now to what they were as will the central city and I think there will be businesses that will return to the central city there 's no doubt about it but it will be substantially different to what it was previously I think the longer we take to rebuild the central city you know the chances of some businesses remain the suburbs that may have come back there 's a real risk to us with that some of the key challenges that we hear about businesses who are wanting to move back into the central city or have visions to move back into the central city is just the uncertainty and that 's you know hints the reason you hear us talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give us some priorities give us some timelines and some of those anchor projects and I think we 're starting to get that now which is great and and i think you know some of the you know some of the major corporates will come back into the central city you know the retail offering and the central city will be substantially different but then I think it should it should be in it you know we hear problems youthquake so we 've got an opportunity to affect seen as you know for so we 've got a great opportunity to fix it but it will be different and businesses need to think differently about that as well so instead of them coming back in and taking the same you know foot space at their head youthquake they 'll come back it 'll be different and they might they may come in and they may share space with another organization or they may have a smaller space so you know that the message that we 're talking to people about us as think think about all these things but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to be and so they need to think differently about that I think there is still a huge opportunity for businesses to move back into the central city and I think we 'll see that but it will just be very very different to what it was um any concerns around the cost of people moving back into the central city and there 's so much cheap affordable on the space elsewhere absolutely a minutes you know that one of the I mentioned early that we 've just done sooo there were their members and there was one of the key things that came up as you know that the costs of what it may be removed back into the central city but that 's a reality and so businesses need to make those decisions based on you know well-informed information and yeah that will be a challenge for a lot of businesses a breath mangie yeah hi Leah you 're asking us there to help you and saying how can we help well I would put that back to you and say how can we help so if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be doing to help with those well I think I mean we 've talked about i 'll start with the fourth one and we 've talked about the certainty and the integrated plan i think that 's really important enough and if you can you know provide some leadership in their area i think that would be really really helpful be no overtly business friendly and supportive of business I mean that 's something that there 's nothing new we 've always played that role and we may actually play that role I guess is the question and well I think it 's about making it really easy for people so you know the fast tracking and things wherever possible making sure that for things like consent it 's very well understood what the processes are putting time frames on those sorts of things and I you know you 're certainly doing some of that now so again nothing to you but just continuing to have that focus making sure that everything that you do when you engage with businesses as make really clear you know well thought through in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what sort of impact would that have so you know there might be some specific areas around some building consents and things like that that we will seek some feedback from our members on and that we had some some comments from the businesses late last year which i know we fit through to some of the staff here at the council so it 's having those open door conversations as well and having the right people within the council for for our members to talk to so and I guess that you know the first one that the minimizing the financial on positions as you know making sure that that 's just for your any curveball amongst all of the businesses in making sure it 's not heavily weighed on the business versus residents and it 's just a balance there yet so and is there anybody in council that you have a direct contact with around business issues well I know obviously Peter spends quite a lot of time talking to me and also probably to acting CEO so no look I think we have a really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really useful for us to continue to have those conversations so that we if we we are finding issues within the business community got the right channels to to bring them to the council and try and find some solutions around them and what about CDC I mean it seems to me you know you 're actually in a very similar space to where they might be how does that relationship work and we weren 't really closely with the CDC we have you know a couple of joint ventures type of organizations that we 've set up with the canary Development Corporation so I mean obviously the focus being on a kind of economic development our focus been on directly building business capability and support and I think as long as we both stay in our own respective areas and we were you know where we can work together we do and we do that really really well so yeah I mean I think it works really well one of the things that I 've you know huge amount of respect for the width they 're doing series they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know the underlying you know sectors of our economy has still been well supported so that all the focus is not just going on the rebuild and so we we often will play a key role in actually making sure that our buses from in here engaged in the work that the CDC are doing so we work very closely with them okay thank you thank you very much the N and it was great that you could count my hope that your last point recognizing the chamber of the trusted partner I hope that you know inviting you to present an open session to the committee of the whole council as an indication of that absolute commitment to partner with the chamber and our other strategic allies that we 're in the city to make sure that we do come up you know work on those common objectives and the interest optimize christchurch 's future so this is a first I think for the council and so I hope that that represents to you the promise of things to come so lutely thank you very much thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you thank you so the next item on the agenda is a resolution to accept the I","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

3,DNfS6KnXlsY,20140225,1853.39,"Christchurch, New Zealand",4750,"hey with respect why would we do that I just want to endorse what rappers said this is we are wasting time this is what the process is for when we got consultation and that 's when we 're going to talk about these very issues as it seems to me that we 're putting another level in when we don 't need it and I wish yeps get up we have an amendment in front of us and and they are able to I mean people who move in second amendments are entitled to have them debated and voted on Pauline just quickly I 've got I 'm concerned about the message that this is going to give out to the community where a new council I think we 're doing very well with credibility I think people have responded extremely well I 'm getting very good feedback and I think this is sending a very weird message to people that actually it 's the vulnerable people that will suffer from this loss my other suggestion is you know cct and CDC seem to be having a quite a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could it be some of it taken from there and secondly are there any funds and the surrounded that have been increased for inflation and I could that could be taken off to answer your first question Alan by water did talk to you before about why he was not recommending the 300,000 cut in the budget and I 'm sure he 'll come back and talk to that again if you if you 'd like them to do so and the second question around inflation has really no part of the part of the finding the 9.9 is really nibbling away everything and which means a lot of the funds held same year on year and therefore the staff operating within it need to provide the same service within a reduced budget and so it 's there I mean if there was some you know a secret rocket lifts I would have told you it there really is not late to that I had bought this up at every workshop that we 've had and I think counselor Clearwater hairs as well just finding the way forward if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would be really it would be good for me yani and then Jamie I think this is just about actually messaging as much as anything if you read page 12 of the document that we 're discussing you 'll see that it 's the kind of doesn 't make sense is a bit kind of hypocritical in a way because it says grants have been reduced by 2.1 million and then point five four million relates to contextual community grants then under the same wider then says 3.5 million as being taken from a capital endowment fund to fund a million dollars of community grants 2.5 million for projects including sensing City and others so you 're actually putting 3.5 million into grants and you 're reducing it by 2.1 so you actually providing an increase to some of the grants funding but it but it 's just I think it 's got caught up because you know obviously there 's there 's categories within the community grants that have been cut and I do wonder whether one of the solutions would be to possibly make some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this was you know not to be cut the community woods not not to have their their budgets cut through this process and whether that kind of gets around their concern that people cave because you know I do think it 's just we 're taking money out of one fun to do something a little bit different but we 're still actually making their funding available for communities and I do think it 's a positive thing I think that part of the capital from the capital endowment fund was you know a million dollars of that is to restore to the community grants what would would have been removed the 2.5 million for projects was was to pick up their concept of legacy legacy from the earthquakes that this was you know a capital endowment fund this is not coming from rates sensing city as used as one of the examples there participatory democracy is something that again many of us stood on and it is the idea that the legacy of the earthquakes will be new forms of governance new forms of collaborative decision-making participatory budgeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money to leave the city with a legacy of engagement that just simply hasn 't even been you know well it hasn 't even been begun to be discussed in the rest of the country this is a huge opportunity for Christchurch to lead the way which was the concept of legacy that we have discussed at the different workshops that we 've had on this and I understand people 's concern about about where we 've got to with us and I actually think that it is unfortunate in terms of haratz characterized because there are there are additions and to enter areas of funding that wouldn 't have been available under the narrow criteria of some of the the funds that existed before and so we 're not seeing the total picture so I guess that if the if the resolution that is on the table the amendment is lost then I would foreshadow an amendment that would require staff to prepare a report on a strategic review of council grants funding well we actually I 'd give them to ya prepare a strategic review of council grants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time that the community consultation is concluded on on this so that by the time the community consultation is concluded we will have a full report on our entire community grants and yeah so but that 's that 's foreshadowed if the resolution as fails bawling a mind you the periculum to resolution was passed I think we should review anyway I 'm just wondering how hairy accurate the or fixated or the detail in that 2.5 million for the sentencing the city and just say through democracy and resilience is that a fairly broad there 's nothing actually been applied to for that deliberately and my question is basically could some of that be slightly reduced well we made a commitment last year to the sensing city project lazy well there will be a paper coming forward on that soon unto its net many of vanity much needed is it the 2.5 the law the summer I can 't remember off the top of my head but all of the amounts wherefore I think yeah I can 't remember them all exactly room in there not not not not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to two point one ish yeah but that would leave a hundred thousand dollars for some of the projects because there was there was half a million for a number of projects around well there was one point five I yeah look I can 't remember the exact figures off the top of my head but I can 't say that we could we could allocate we already allocated a million dollars of capital from that fund which means that every year from here on and we get less and come from and Trust so we have less money to distribute from there every year because we are we are reducing the impact on community grants for one year and that 's costing a million dollars to do that so you know I mean we have tried to to balance all of these things I understand that it is it is challenging as i say i 'm not satisfied that we 're getting the best out of a the concept of partnership that will talking about with community on these grants I don 't see anything that 's joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I look at the range of the grants and I wonder whether our new and very much invigorated relationship with other philanthropic organizations is actually a mechanism for for strengthening long-term longer term funding relaying relationships with some of these ones that are already for example on our a that the eight projects that are on our three year horizon whether we 've got that the concept of being able to move more into that secure funding and partnership with other philanthropic so and all of the philanthropic organizations are really really wanting to talk to us to see about how we can collaborate much more effectively around resource and community organizations fellow Clearwater look in sickening this motion this amendment I 'm also I 'd be entirely happy to include the what you refer to lien is staff preparing the report and put that up either way as to whether this is supporter or not as a Second Amendment it just seems to me that in fact a lot of the knowledge a lot of information for example about the value of community groups and organizations as being overlooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with those groups for many many years and earlier research is very clear that in fact in terms of investment you get a 10 for one back back on your returns really Donna we put in as a council that it 's been measured at a ten ten dollars back for a term that 's not too bad in terms of an investment which i think is why a lot of us really want to ensure that these small organizations survive so they have been partnered the ongoing partnerships and this is also a clear social investment so I 'm supporting that and I 'm also happy you 're the amendment you afraid also goes up for us us to vote on to Jamie God okay thanks deep breath for me I 'm incredibly frustrated sitting here with us because I like I can 't support there not because I don 't like the intent or the sentiment of it I do but we 've spent weeks upon weeks upon weeks more hours than i can physically count going through threshing something out compromising to end up with a budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the balances in line with the proposed rate increase of the long-term plan we got there and I just feel that it goes against every single governance principle oh I 've got to come along into the meeting there and Chuck ad hoc numbers around like this with no idea of what the budgetary implications actually are only when staff to quit man slate back no one even knew what this is and I 'm sorry because I don 't disagree with what is being proposed or what you 're trying to get out of it but what I find even more frustrating is that I 've had a brilliant suggestion from our mere which which suggests a cost neutral way of achieving everything of this with a strategic rationale in basis behind it which makes perfect sense as opposed to just checking finding airhole ways to propose a higher rates increase for no greater benefit arguably so I just think I just think that I asked that we voted against this so we cut we can implement the foreshadowed motion which to me is perfil which I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leads to good governance principles because this is just being here again small financial lunacy time right now with us Ben Livingston thank you just following on from counselor costs that 's a democracy and in response then in line of that actually in my view it is good governance to have this debate in the opening which we must do over funding despite the fact we may have had discussions behind closed doors which every council does have so I think the thing is I would support the miRs amendment going through either way whichever way the outcome of this debate I think it 's important that we do actually apply rigor to what our community groups are doing some are doing very well we have had cases in the past where we 've raised some petitions so I just reiterate that i support the grants remaining but I also support the strategic review I think that must be taken seriously and I would like to apologize for throwing us in at the last minute particularly to you kids look okay but the thing is that it 's probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't realize that all those nuts and bolts had to be tightened up before we got to this table however IM confused that we 're even here to have a discussion and i support Glynn here when he says this is the forum to have it too and the other thing we need to keep in perspectives that we sit here now in our office or near homes or even forget sometimes that this amount of money is a lot to some people a great deal and that 's where I 'm coming from so if we can find a way forward if it 's lost perhaps we can we were severe to find out how we can pick up this 390,000 dollars three hundred and ninety thousand dollars to put their into their communities thank you right is there any more discussion on the amendment so I 'm going to put the amendment sorry yeah we might as well just do it by machine so I 'll rather than hear the eyes and nose because it sounds like us code those in favor of the amendment press yes those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay so we 've got to find the point one two percent otherwise the rates go up so yeah I 've smoked that this comes out of the CC yet the extra see CHL dividend I think it 's a really clean place to take it from we heard that there 's money being held back for other unknowns to me this is a no one we 've voted on it when the time comes to consider those other costs then we 'll have to do that and look at how we fund it but I drop you know given that we 've made this call I think that 's the cleanest most simplest place to that once the budget from can 't can we get some advice on that certainly see CHL had indicated there was surplus funds available or that they felt they could make additional donation and initial dividends over what was on the plan that is certainly so and edit certainly so that we don 't know exactly what the other unknowns are as I said we we know there 's this work around port hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that 's moving and we do know that inevitably every year we have additional unforeseen costs around earthquakes we also know that right now we have no provisions at all so normally a normal prudent budget would have some small amount set aside in the balance sheet as a provision to meet sort of unforeseen costs so that we can deliver on the budget as counselors have voted because the the the other side to that is what position were in this year with the costs that we 're not anticipated as a result of the chain the crown manager has made where the rest of the council are looking to find the savings to hold the race so 390 I agree is relatively minor it 's not the 390 itself as an advisor that concerns me it 's the principle in the sense that you do need some discipline around budgeting but I know you all know that and I 'm not wouldn 't presume to tell you what you know so it is there it 's the downside is that it won 't be available for something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that and I think the advantage to doing it this way is that if you 're doing the strategic review which also support and you know I think we 'd intend to do anyway is that you actually balance the budget now where you go through this process and then at the end of that review you may have a better idea about what the costs are the unknown costs of those other things and obviously when we come back to finalize the budget we can take those into account all right well I 'd like to move my foreshadowed amendment just as an amendment which is that staff undertaken consultation with other funding agencies and philanthropic bodies a strategic review of council grants funding and prepare a report for council by the end of May well hang on buddy and debate is that before we when are we hearing the submissions right that 's okay it 's okay all right looking for the decision for them for the annual plan does anyone like to second that resolution Thomas Kendra can I just ask um with the movement second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grants go to excluded from this so I 'd like seducing consultation with the community what I thought that 's pretty important well what I guess that what I 'm what I 'm trying to get is is to get the other funding agencies and the philanthropic bodies to talk to each other as we as we develop a strategic review of our grants funding but it 's to get an overarching view I mean yes the concern I have is the people that receive the grants would have a view on the process the thousands of organizations identify their the thousands of organizations and individuals yeah well that 's what I mean who would I want to talk to them for the games do you go to tell I 'm on supporting this is it is i think that we need this information that 's a good step fordyce solid step foot in this information if we forget right down to the grassroots and every single epic and for a grant it could take some time this is going to give us a really good overview of where we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a really good time meet situation being and um so less strongly support the amendment as it is I do share yannis concern though that in a way I think there are some key organizations in our city who stand out who 've been involved for a long time who would be able to be like the voice of a wider group of organizations in a review rapist so if there was a way of including some of those in like England Kyra are an example and there are plenty of others so well their contribution today is huge and they know as well as any of us would ever know in terms of hell our funding could be well spent and I 've got no doubt though the the funding agencies that they are clear to on on what they are devolved so I think it is a way of joining us up really if if there if we could have the sum at least some of the providers included I think you know just to add to fells point one of the issues we 've got with churches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fix their facilities or they 've got huge financial constraints they 're now going through quite an extensive properties disposal process which means some of the groups that we 're funding are becoming homeless so that 's an increased cost that we have that we don 't seem to have any strategic discussion with those providers all those property owners around what is the best way of dealing with this you know quite significant and costly emerging issue I 'm Tommy I think through this though the council staff know the key providers they deal with them all the time I think through adversity and if councillors individual counselors have specific organizations that they feel that they should be but I must be out in this will ensure they don 't want miss governess I 'm sure they could seduce to start that they 're included in this so why don 't we put undertake and consultation with with major stakeholders major community stakeholders funding agencies and full interpret but philanthropic bodies yep I don 't care anymore just uh does what we and i agree but how your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we want to undertake a high-level review at a low level now the whole point of it if you want to find out how you can actually think strategically move forward about this is about saying the attention just take a step back where we at where do we want to go and how do we be scary i 'll guarantee you other site we want more money and it 's not going to happen enough no because there are thousands upon thousands upon thousands of these organizations having a strategic high-level review is about exactly doing that yeah major community stakeholders though i don 't mean those that are looking to the council for funding i 'm actually talking about the sort of agencies that are being discussed there which as you know people like anger can care who are in the community you know doing the work probably sports canterbury who are you know would probably meet the definition of act two of them you know so and i 'm applying more value now just moving yeah so yeah i 'm moving on to so i 'll put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say no Kerry right is there any more debate on the annual plan what an additional resolution following the grants one that the community grants around currently we 'll see what two million and that this be funded through the sea CHL dividend increase ECHL dividend but you can 't do there I 'm sorry I 'm sorry but you you can 't you do that we 're getting wisdom I just took advice at the end of the table after you said that you wanted to do there I took advice the advice that we 've got is that the money can be found within the existing budget we don 't need that resolution it means that something will have to go but we just don 't quite yet know what it is is that right now I don 't think that 's what i see no no what i said is you could fund it from CC a child dividend if you wish because they have indicated there will be surplus funds available but it will be at obviously at the expense of something else right and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because all provisions have been reduced and eliminated over the past couple of years so we 're not in a position to have anything normally you would hope to have sort of a million or so that you could fall back into that yet that you would rely on during the year for unforeseen events we are entering into the beginning of the financial year with without any of that as what is what I 'm saying all that using the 390 eliminates what you could fall back into so the answer is yes you can do it but it just weakens our position during the year yeah I mean and this like everything which is which is what I 'm saying that I you know you know don 't it 's it 's like all budgeting is that you give up something at the expense of something else the thing is we don 't quite know what the something else is at the stage and I gave the example of the crown managers the costs relating to the work the crown manager did which we did not know when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing that I guess that I 'm finding difficult to understand is what is what is the appropriate I mean do I accept the the resolution then you know the amendment put up by council johansson as a mechanism for saying where it 's coming from or that would be the preferred way because if you if you don 't nominate a source then what happens by default errs of the rates go up words they 're not the intention therefore it is better to nominate the source of funding such as the dividends in this instance and clearly you know and maybe next year if we can have the discussions I front we may be able to find it accepts of course we have had extensive workshops and briefings and really have staff feel they 've eliminated all possible sources of funding what I guess that the other thing that 's kind of at the back of my mind is that there are two absent counselors and after we 've received this full report and after the public representations that we receive it may well be that the decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone out for consultation with that and so I mean I just I just kind of want to well you can do that when it comes back before it comes back to you for adoption as the final annual plan you do have the opportunity to relook at various levels and you can amend them as a result of consultation so is it better that we dedicate the funding source for this now on the basis that it may still change in the future but we don 't want to put it on the right is in my view that is the better profit like I so the motion is is that the two that the the source of the 390 255,000 be taken from the sea CHL dividend the increase of CCL dividend the the increased cchr done that 's only 330,000 a 390,000 255 kind of thing is sorry yep extra see CHL dividend I think quantum was about four million is that right we had a choice between sex or team well remember though that does depend on their results through June of course because we need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don 't find that then you had three percent on to the rates for next year great so say what my point was that the increase cch dividend is only 330,000 now that was the amount you 've already put aside for other things okay so would somebody like to second that Phil Clearwater so i 'll put that amendment all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried the person who said no like to have their boat recorded against ref mangie ref mangie records of those vote against it the source of the funding be taken from the increased cch shell dividend hang on I 've just put boated up with voted on that so yeah so yeah and I 'm another note as well so so that 's mangie golf dalzell east right okay so back to the debate on the annual plan","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

March,9stZ-pPW4hE,20140305,669.98,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1690,"this I would like to perhaps begin the meeting just by giving a quick update on events that have have occurred obviously this morning we 've woken to sunshine which I think a lot of our fellow citizens and Christchurch will welcome as a reprieve after the last 48 hours so it 's certainly I certainly was really grateful when I could see the stars in the sky when I got up this morning and we were looking at a fine day so it is going to help with those who are going to be involved in what will be a mess of cleanup exercise I want to really begin the meeting by thanking everyone and Christchurch for what they 've done the communities have come together as as they did after the earthquakes and that i think has been a tremendous sign of support and you know a really affection across the city and i want to thank everyone who has actually stepped up and help people cope with what for many will be another sort of almost like a you know just another layer of anxiety and stress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our staff who together with city care and our emergency services partners have worked tirelessly over 48 hours to provide what i believe is an exemplary coordinated approach i have been you know ask the question why didn 't I call a civil defense emergency civil defense emergency is required in order to exercise powers in order to get coordination between the different services and make sure that things are being done I have to say we had that coordination things were being done and the the briefings that I attended really showed how collaborative the entire if it was so I just want to thank all of those and on behalf of my fellow councillors I also want to express our thanks to the prime minister and two ministers who yesterday offered their personal and practical support to the council and our city as a whole it actually means a lot when you get a phone call from ministers n from the Prime Minister offering all of their support and it really was appreciated it was particularly appreciated that the Minister for Canterbury Earthquake Recovery came down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he drove and my husband are still wondering how he got away with not having me giving directions but there you go but he was I actually think it made a difference that the minister in the mirror are seeing the same picture at the same time and we were able to look at it considerate and reflect on what it meant for the city as a whole so I really value that and I want to express my personal appreciation to the Minister for that to visit some of the worst affected areas yesterday and here really the the desperation that was expressed to us by people who had just faceless over and over and over again and I think for some that we spoke to on the ground yesterday some of them had just gone through the experience of going through there EQC repairs and here they were facing devastation all over again throughout last night and from dawn today council staff and their partners at Sarah E can and civil defense have been assessing the damage and working to make safe hazardous areas and to coordinate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a message from them yesterday to say that they are back on deck and that people can call on them for assistance so we 'll be including that in our bulletins today we 've got the city 's remarkable neighborhood and community networks one of the community board members emailed late last night to say that they want to start the cleanup and the heath cup valley today you know so again community coming together to really make a make a difference and meet those immediate community needs I 've also received message this morning from the insurance industry reassuring us that they have teams in place to support and respond to those dealing with the damage this morning so again the offer to make sure that people were able to access the help that they need from their insurers I mean obviously the flood waters have to recede before the damage can be assessed but again it was a very welcome message to receive and of course I applaud the minister 's announcement yesterday that he was reinstating the eqc emergency repair program for flood damaged homes but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they weren 't enough sandbags but I have to say that the severity and the extent of yesterday 's flooding really does highlight the problems that our city faces with respect to flood protection and that goes way beyond sandbags we couldn 't have predicted with the forecast that we had the extent of the flooding that would occur we 've dredged 5,000 tons of salt out of Dudley Creek last year as plotted part of the flood protection process and I have to say that that again that wasn 't enough so there has to be a more significant solution for their area I 've just come from a meeting where the engineering experts from Council and Sara brief Minister brownlee and councillors about what yesterday 's events mean for solutions already underway and and also to talk about the public consultation that 's about to start with respect to the district plan review and the natural hazards chapter so I 've been commenting that we already have a meeting established for the 15th of March for the public to start to understand the nature of natural hazards and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's let 's look at yesterday 's aventon and the light of the work that we were already proceeding on doing and see this as an opportunity for people to really understand the nature of natural hazards and how they impact on planning decisions that our council makes over time with respect to today 's meeting obviously we 're very we believe that there has to be intense collaboration between the crown the council Sarah EQC insurers and and all of the strategic partners we 've been absolutely assured of the Masters support in this regard and I 'm sure that we can use this brief window of opportunity to start a process of fast tracking action that would normally take years so this morning we looked at a couple of the options that engineers have been working on to really protect and this is focusing particularly in the flop turn area that focused on a couple of options it seems to me that this is this is a time where we should actually consider the more resilient option for that community there is the potential there to protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some measures that would make a real difference that would normally take years to deliver obviously consenting issues there would be legal issues there would be accessed bridges a little bit like the retaining walls issues that we 've looked at and other parts so there are significant issues involved with a proposal like this but we could actually deliver that a lot sooner if we were to take a fast-track measure and one of the things that we discussed today was developing a private bill and taking that private bill through the Parliament that would give the council the power to introduce these changes in a much more timely fashion and give people the comfort to know that not only will they have flood protection but for a 150 year event but they will also have a much more well much more amenity to their neighborhood so that we can actually improve the entire area which would restore value to the area and and make a significant change so what we 've listened to this morning I 've said that it 's important that we get this in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a decision and I 've asked that a paper be ready for us to consider by the end of the month that 's how urgent it is we actually have to get started on this process and once we get to that stage and we have the commitment of government for looking for ways for fast-tracking that legislation obviously with the consent of all parties then I think we 're looking forward to a real solution that will give people comfort and the meantime we have to look at what are the short term protection so that people have got the confidence that this is really going to make as significant a change as the original change was made just over 35 years ago which has protected that area until the earthquakes happened so I feel much more confident this morning that we 're in a position to fast check and get on with the job and using this experience as a reason for bringing forward work that would take years and years and years to undertake so again I 'm expressing the gratitude of the entire council and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christchurch who have really come to the party and helped us get through this event I 'm glad it didn 't happen at the start of winter because at least we 've got some forecasts and fine weather coming up but it really has given us the wake-up call that I think we need to actually get on with the job and our engineers at absolutely ready to take up that role so on that note I would like to ask councils of any declarations of interest that they might","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Committees,Quyk8MrNbsc,20140227,2234.46,"Christchurch, New Zealand",5462,item 15 which is the draft terms of reference for all my teeth and one I 'll move the draft terms of reference for all committees of a seconder Tim scandrett just one change that we we foreshadowed in the previous one is that the land use recovery plan reference comes out of the strategy and planning committee and for for all of them in terms of how they are presented we are I am NOT the chair could I be placed at the bottom of the list yep so I 'm certainly a member of each committee as of right under our standing orders but I think it 's appropriate that each of them when they 're listed on the website show up as as the chair in the deputy chair at the head of the reporting measure of preference from my point of view ped notification that the community committee would like to add children and youth healthy Christchurch and disability and accessibility and older persons there was also a request to add regional parks and garden inherited but in sports parks but can I suspect actually we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I was just going to say I and it was also I think health under children and youth disability Nexus videographers yes it 's right annals healthy crash it was a healthy crash healthy crush it just the charm that we signed up to yeah I agree and and is there any other any other changes yes in Livingston with gosh yes they 've been put through to the staff in relation to the housing Betty on my apologies I thought no not what we 're doing the lot okay yeah I 'm with the Housing Committee I 've provided the secretary with some additions that I suggested in the housing committee had agreed with and simple like under the second bullet point where we have developing and maintaining key external relationships and the hair of housing with besides sarah and ccd you it 's already in there though yeah that 's right um night are who would be a year that 's up there yeah that will be you know that 's a it 's a work plan so but what we 're talking about is developing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I think it 's silly to name CRCC do you own a tahoe when obviously dhb and all thoughts of others would be appropriate to be included so just developing and maintaining relationships with strategic partners I can or strategic housing partners that 's fine yeah yeah it 's it 's so it 's all inclusive was what I was aiming it so if it 's open yeah I can agree with it I was also under the last bullet wanting to add and some things just to be specific so in fact for clarity for the committee that we don 't miss these things and one was around just emergency housing and healing for vulnerable people so so as a committee we are clear that in fact that is within our terms of reference and what we would discuss absolutely yeah I think I thought it was then the other area I thought for clarity we should add besides youth housing older older person 's social housing and housing for people with disabilities yeah so with it I think how about putting yeah i would put youth comma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my view I 'm happy to be simple hey okay well I mean it 's it you 've got emergency housing and it 's them look I 'm happy to speak what what where I 'm coming from counselors is that when we 've a committee and a new committee say it 's good to be clear and I think earlier there any discussion this morning distinguishing between affordable housing and social housing gave us some Terry and I think for the terms of reference my suggestion is that we incorporate these distinctions well as hasn 't been defined sounds good but what is it I think if I may speak also it 's you 're committing so yeah that deserves to make explicit some of the now acknowledged streams within housing such as youth housing so if we could just say housing but actually I think it 's important to acknowledge some of the contemporary social issues which especially are now giving rise in Christchurch there 's been plenty of I just wonder what why don 't you keep it broader because you know what what I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover off absolutely everything and as a direct result of that nothing ends up happening because you try and please anyone you know middle-aged bachelors are missing beer but won 't you just say housing it just covers everyone it 's just simple easy the problem is we we could do that but you could get caught by assumptions over there and I still think it 's important we have real issues now over homelessness emergency housing youth older person so I do take your point but I think given Christchurch 's situation at the moment I 'm just confused now we 've got developing and prioritizing a work plan for the 2013 also so we 're not adding homelessness wearing emergency housing and housing for vulnerable vulnerable people that 's what social housing it isn 't social housing for vulnerability yes I understand writing an emergency housing and that list but doesn 't bondable housing cover all of that because it relevant of your w have a disability or whether you 're a single mom or whatever you 're in a vulnerable position and therefore you need house and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have a disability of whatever sort so okay can we just have the strategies to address homelessness including emergency housing is it does it address it or orders that or do you want to just a separate bullet point that says so we just have emergency housing as a separate line under it I just don 't know what housing for vulnerable people is other than social housing I guess it 's a clarification of that really and it does relate i guess to people who for example might have a mental illness and might not be cared for it all by some of whom won 't won 't fit into the traditional mental health rehabilitation programs and if hell 's in that way okay so there are other vulnerable people who social housing would would give would take some care of it 'll certainly a provide accommodation for okay so can we have another bullet point under under this so take the take move that housing from well why don 't we say how housing to address particular vulnerabilities on including age oh well just a housing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you really don 't need to spell it out do does it and we don 't we don 't need you to older persons and disabled people 's housing and because it 's everyone yeah yeah okay so take that one at that line out and coordination develop coordination development cord there is a bit a desire to have a whole plan for housing for Christchurch given the given the enormity of the situation and while there are pieces of plans held by the various agencies there 's a strong desire to actually have it like together faith and it 's simply that counsel in this housing committee known it would help coordinate the development of that an effect leader I can 't I mean I just can 't see that it 's needed what would stop you under the under the terms of reference that you 've got developing and prioritizing a work plan for the twenty thirteen to sixteen term of council considering why don 't we have the first bullet point as housing needs across the city because you being as in that the development on prioritize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housing needs across the city that then would cover my last point so yep I 'm okay with it so housing needs across the city social housing repair and rebuild strategies to address homelessness emergency housing housing to address particular vulnerabilities in a city housing affordable housing and do we need youth housing and the context of that is something separate earlier on I was concerned that because they are often overlooked and there 's a particular special special issue yeah okay right we 'll leave it on because sometimes their vulnerability is just simply because of their age all right so the only other changes to any of the other terms of reference Andrew looking at the earthquake recovery committee of the whole we 've got major facilities rebuild and facilities rebuild facilities rebuild is work that 's generally been considered by the community committee is it our intention to move that from the community community to the earthquake recovery committee I hadn 't seen it sorry um part of what i thought that we 're too agreed what are we agree that you 're questioning that that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and major facilities has been with earthquake recovery committee of home yeah we 've now got both facilities rebuilds major and just the regular facilities rebuild in recovery committee of the whole and not in community committee whereas community community committee has already been doing that work yeah the community facilities remain in the in the community camila committee because of the insurance because of the overarching issues all of those concerns the idea is it was to bring them under the earthquake recovery committee so that we 've got an oversight of the whole city I mean I have to say there that you know decisions that we are being asked to make on the back of a report from one committee when we haven 't all had access to that there indeed discussion I think was highlighted today I think we have to take hold of us and in own it as a whole committee as a whole council yeah it 's not not my recollection of what we agreed what we agree was at the major facilities any ended heritage facility should go into the committee of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the libraries for example you can it 's really hard to separate out the repair of rebuild of libraries to the library strategy so you know same with the aquatic facilities review so it has to fit together and I thought we were pretty clear that we would put the major ones into the community hole because that 's where the really big decisions are being made and this was agreed at the committee of the whole that this change would be made so I don 't understand why it 's now being that 's not being incorporated yeah sorry i 've done that some i may not have been at the committee of the whole so i apologize if I 've MOSFET yep I just wanted to endorse what you only said and just with regards to what happened earlier and the suggestion that there might be a reason why it needs to go into committee of the whole can I suggest that maybe we 've got to be really careful that we don 't micromanage stuff at the committee of the whole level when these sorts of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee level and i think that the distinction between major facility rebuilding community facility rebuild would address that otherwise it does become too fragmented i totally endorse what you see okay well look as i say i wasn 't at the committee of the whole so i must that conversation if that was agreed at the at the committee of the whole then obviously i am not going to disagree with that so we 'll take facilities rebuild out and put facilities excluding major facilities rebuild and to the community committee but i do want to kind of sound a warning i think there is a council we have to take much clearer responsibility across the decision-making in these areas communities have had their expectations lifted above what we can afford we have made decisions which do not make they don 't make an a sense of the integrated whole for example a decision anne edano II made an eddie absence of any consideration of what is going on that I don 't know a school site what you know in two years time within one block of where we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I honestly think we have to be taking serious consideration around some of these issues and some of them are going to be hard decisions but we have to be out there talking to our communities about what is realistic and not about what are the expectations that have been built up in an environment where people didn 't understand the reality that we faced and I kind of want to put it on the record the previous organizational hid did reassure both central government and the people of Christchurch that our insurance was far more secure than it has turned out to be we are still working through insurance issues and we will continue to drive them and I kind of want to put on record my thanks to ref mangie for the leadership role that he 's shown in terms of governance and driving the settlement of our insurance claim but there is no question that both central government and the people of Christchurch have not been accurately informed as to the serious risk that we face as a council in terms of that insurance settlement so people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make some hard decisions this year and just because the previous council signed off on a on a particular project that doesn 't mean that we are as a council going to be in a position to undertake that project and we have to be open and upfront with our communities about it and I mean I think that we are going to have to think seriously about some of the commitments the previous council made and I 'll put another one on the table as well and that is the 30 million dollars that has been allocated to the east eastern sport and Rec Center there is an expectation that that that is money that has come from qe2 park that isn 't the case from what I can assist in terms of what what what we 've now been able to look at it looks as if the allocation of the entire insurance proceeds from qe2 park as being allocated to the Metro sports for sir along with the centennial Paul that means that the previous council made an allocation of 30 million dollars from another place and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going to so all I 'm saying is that we have to as a council be absolutely crystal clear that this is not going to be an easy year for anyone because we have to be sensible about our financial situation Glenn and then if I may say I film asleep over the fact my understanding was quite clear and although I pushed for the entire insurance because I thought that was reasonable as a replacement for qe2 my understanding actually that the 31 of that 71 was actually from that claim so I feel oh thank goodness I 'm only reading what I 've had put them into me on not and I shall make my point that qe2 was a metro facility that was located and the Burwood Pegasus Ward yani um I understand what you 're saying and that 's why the committee 's been really came to focus on a strategic review of things are the aquatic facilities strategy of things like the library strategy because we do need to look at post-earthquake what has happened and have a conversation with our community about where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of council despite some of us trying for those things to be public processes because if you work with the community and help them understand the issues you face I think you do get people may not like the decision that you 're making but at least they can understand why you 've done the things you have yeah that the flip side though is that if we wait to do all that work then we wouldn 't have anything happening and so you know I don 't think it 's an option just to stop rebuilding community facilities to stop repairing local swimming pools to stop replacing local libraries in the meantime because we 're three years on and having no progress because of the insurance difficulties as something that you know it 's just I don 't think would be fair to our local communities we 're talking about you know children that are growing and I 'm missing out on a huge benefit of these facilities if we do nothing now and wait for another five years to get insurance resolution so you know I think we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at our priorities again and the community committee has certainly signaled that we do want to workshop with all the counselors to sit down and look at the whole work program it has been driven to a large extent around two things one is the top 30 that was prioritized with community boards last term and the ability to get agreement with our insurer over the quantum of damage that they will pay and that is largely outside of our control although I do appreciate we 're now doing things better and hopefully getting a cooker outcome but it has been incredibly frustration frustrating for everyone involved including local communities so yet you know i think there also needs to be a tire to the long-term plan that we 're going on and so i think this year will be the year of doing that really hard work around our strategic priorities and putting in place the budgets accordingly ya know what 's happened previously is that the cost year was done in isolation of the three-year plan the community had made numbers numerous submissions to five different processes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take centennial Paul it 's a really good example and one clear price is to work through with our community about what we 're doing and then budget accordingly I think is the appropriate way to go although I couldn 't agree more and I think that in a way it 's what has been absent from the process has been a joined up approach across everything that 's going on so that I don 't know a decision being made absent any reference to what 's happening with the school so yeah but but this is this is what we need to do and we need to we need to take control of this as a council and we have to be in a position to go out and talk sensibly to our communities about what is realistic and I totally agree with yanni and that is is that our communities are very up for a conversation about what priorities are meet to be given the given that they are given the facts of the situation people are prepared to face the reality as long as they know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then Ellie thank you look I just want to take up on the point you you raise the moment ago about metropolitan facilities being in these my concern really is not so much too pragmatic the the flow-on of of where money spent that but more the concern of the information that we 've received and I can quite categorically state that everyone in the and my ward is firmly under the belief as was i that the 30 point 1 million that is supposedly allocated to an eastern suburb sport and recreation fund was the a share or a portion of the qe2 insurance monies if this is not the case and as you rightly have indicated before the expectations of our community have been lifted some are highly and now if we are to be informed or told that this money has come from another source and could arbitrarily be shifted elsewhere there 's going to be a large number of people in the eastern suburbs who will be hugely deflated with the sort of new so my concern really is some at this stage is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if this is true that this funding source for the eastern suburbs Sport and Recreation has come from sources other than insurance money that to me is hugely concerning yeah I mean I don 't know where the money 's coming from I 'm simply referring to page 66 of today 's agenda where I noted that the Metro sport facility includes the Centennial pool earthquake costs and the NS include the reference to the insured value and the payment received on claims in relation to qe2 stadium so that says to me that the money for the from kiri to as being allocated to the metro sport facility ever I mean is that correct yeah it is correct so I mean it highlighted for me a problem and that is is that the information that is in the public arena isn 't perfect I just I was surprised when i read that this morning I assumed that others had as well so in the former cio must say it was never upfront about that all he said to me at the time and I challenged him he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he never said the whole lot was going to the metro yeah but it is in terms of in terms of the reality that we thought I think that what I 'm trying to put on the table is that we do need to have oversight there is no question that there is a need for a sport you know swimming facility Rick 's facility and the east and the Burwood Pegasus ward but the fact that they lost their metro facility that was located there doesn 't obviate the the reality that Headley ferry Mead needs something as well and that because there was a prior need and higley ferry Mead at the creation of a new need and booooored pegasus doesn 't take away the need that exists and that ward and i don 't think we should lose sight of it dan sorry i need to correct some i walked in the door to hear you say that qe2 was going to the metro sports but the better i didn 't hear because i was outside the door was a centennial called as the centennial paul money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pool in the east I noticed that says it 's going to metro sport it does in the report that in the finance committee report on page 60 under the under the and I mean under the way the plan was put together and counselor Easter 's like the money or sorry was it was you the money can go wherever you like but on the plan that was always intended to go against the pool in the east the Centennial Paul qe2 Centennial fall but there 's a big difference between Centennial Palo into the qe2 was going to the Metro sport Centennial court was always going to the pool in the east but the pool one that is the allocation that people believe has been made as over 30 million dollars no no it isn 't i have a clear understanding that just under half that amount for from qe2 is going to the east and that the rest plus the Civic amount was going to the micro furs okay well can we ask for a report on this particular matter for the earthquake committee next week well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll deal with it is it 's all the same amount and if it 's applied to one or the other there will be indifferent somewhere but yes I 'll come back to you okay thank you le h e 'd I 'm just cuz I 've got a question for you to just for clarification begin on page 66 and this is something I 've seen in some of the community authorities information about the insurance claims in the position of them at the moment can you just explain for me when you 've got an insured value and safe for the sake of argument at 6.3 i 'm looking at le look I 'm really sorry sorry I didn 't I was trying to deal with one subject or not we 're well past their well okay but we 're going to ask for a full report on the on the yes then if you email me I hear an answer my question sorry there I kind of site wreck because I I do worry about what I 'm seeing happening which is people 's expectations are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pray good process for open communication with our communities oh I just go briefly back the terms of reference yeah the Environmental Committee just one short change that above the healing roads in the foot just simply insert the word transport and it 's just for clarity around the rooster that and that the committee have agreed with them sorry which one so it 's it 'll be on page 279 for environmental committee and instead of the heading being roads and footpaths that that term roads and footpaths that be included but they 're being overall hitting above that transport and the commodities yes yes the committee of agree with it yeah just a clarification yeah all right any other changes to the just a very slight one the bracket needs to go after facilities so that it reads community for the Susilo tease rebuild so the brackets as expires excluding major facility and if I could just because I just was taking advantage of Diane being there that wasn 't what I wanted to you and ask just with regards to adding that there I just want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is randomly adding no difference because from going through the information on the community facilities insurance at the moment it is increasingly clear that a huge huge amount of money is held up on the negotiations on those and I don 't think that we can underestimate the huge frustration and delay on the insurance situation when it comes to facilities and as a result we are having to look at the figures that we 're dealing with we 're having to tell the communities that they can 't have what they expect when a building appears to be insured for that that sort of money and after the news on insurance this week I just think it 's absolutely appalling that the insurance companies are still dragging their feet yeah I think riff okay briefly in terms of the insurance we are getting to the end of the process and when I say the end of the process I mean we 're into that state where we are starting to look at a final settlement of some sort at the end we are ultimately going to get a sum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to allocate so I think what people need to do is realize that not everything is going to be funded that 's the reality and we have to start thinking about what are the priorities to spend that money on so we will way I 'm not saying we 're starting back at the beginning but the fact is we 're not going to have as much money as we thought we would have and I think when I look at all the commitments that have been made they were very optimistic to say the least though everyone really needs to start as they own said think about what are the most important things to be built and when they need to be built that 's really what it 's going to come down to but we should have good visibility within the next couple of months of where we 're going to be and it doesn 't mean that things will never be built there are things that we 're going to have to take a longer-term priority so and that 's why I think communities themselves need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult for us I mean one of the things that we 've tried to do right from the outset us get a good grip on our financial situation because I think there was a lack of reality and the last term that we are paying a huge price for and what I was trying to indicate today is that one of the prices is that people 's expectations have been lifted up here based on a honest belief by both central government in the community that our insurance was in a much healthier state then we have discovered it to be so we all know that we 're still waiting for the quarter meant the report we 're still waiting for you know progress on our claims i have to say that ref has taken of strong leadership role in terms of the governance that needs to drive behaviors in this field and you know he 's playing an excellent role but you know we 're going to have to accept that there 's a period of of not knowing what that final position is going to be but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it is your community saying about priorities because we are ultimately going to have to come down with a sense of balance about how we develop the most appropriate needed facilities and our community so that people can you know get on with their lives and via communities start to develop their there is not an even spread of damage across the city either and we 've got new suburbs that are being developed and at the same time we 're facing the threat of development contributions not being available for some of our you know sort of core facilities like libraries and Paul lonsdale and I appeared in front of the government local government Select Committee and Wellington yesterday and and made a plea on behalf of our council area and the greater Christchurch area they 're not be that restriction on development contributions because there is so much greenfield development going on down here something we couldn 't possibly have planned for prior to the earthquakes so cutting off a source of funding and then allocating that fund that you know the cost of it across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strike people as particularly unfair so so hopefully the Select Committee will have huge heard the plea that we made so if there 's no other changes to the terms of reference I 'll put the motion subject to the amendments that we have there all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and then we move,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

so I 'm happy to support this going out to receive the public information in view in terms of what people think obviously the major issue the major cost associated to this financial plan is the loss

plan I think reflects that this is a one year in your clan we will be going through a much more intensive long-term planning process over the next 12 months and I think that 's the opportunity for us to have some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to public notification of course like all councillors as we have here submissions and receive further information we may change our minds on certain things that are in it and I think that is healthy that is part of local democracy and that is really important that we do that as a council so happy to support is going out for four public consideration again I do think staff for the work they 've done in very difficult circumstances with an election and a some major changes happening within our organization I do appreciate that you have worked really hard to try and look at how we can be financially prudent and obviously you know this job then reflects that so thank you Jimmy chin thank you yeah I also supported Easter drop the annual plan because these are drop in upland my personal view they have a some of the characters the first one these this is the kind of the second year of those year plan particular is based on the the Sarah actor nursery airplane to replace the original long-term prayer and also the with reviewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of risk is six point of five percentage so loud anal plane or a two thousand fourteen to fifteen still committed six point of five percentage so no any the increased the percentage to kibler burden to the property owner or to the repair so this one character secondary tester and these the draft in your panda we request a community board or give the feedback that 's very good because the before my understanding can be people always emphasize all while the drop in Oprah nada you know typical nipple had four layers state anode and a fee picture so this time I think that 's where we could affirm the the come near board the point of view before him the third one is the and the this the annual credit counselor you 're handsome mansion is a job integrate know today we approve still 02 la pobla de our consultation especially my understanding in mail the there will have the kind of the Harris of the samee she saw the community that group you know or individual still editable to have their say regarding to these two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know original we might consider during a positive review all those the project the the part of the budget may consider to reduce to cut some of the seven volunteer libraries the budget know that not a lot but after that you know discussion we reinstate those the party know any cut this in cool they cliff this the kind of Easter side Mario who look Molly whole days for the northwest and reclaimed Aguilar sauce in a kind of the central etc so it 's a citywide you know especially after asked whether this is part of the community resilience so we keep the volunteer the library the party to keep the original I think there 's the fantastic give the community give the people more confidence and trust in the council services the fifth character is the wii reinstated a budget or 664 k for the kind of a community grind i think that 's also where we were very important especially the Earthquaker community resilience we need a more careful the community to hell meant to achieve a able to provide an information provided service to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here i still have a little bit concerned because that this year ennio plan you know we compared to a three-year plan even we have reduced the nine point nine million dollars that the pad we still increase the of the 41 million dollars for one of our three year plan but if I review the street so you meander the items why is a tech capital program just 1.1 billion dollars second is operating the expenditure is a six hundred forty eight thousand dollars last one is a interest expenses nice 59 the 39 million dollars so I still consider whether the borrowing the increased kab hai this my my my concern but anyway there 's not any particles effector so we go to the community the public no try to seek in their fee paper then we have manda manda to try to keep the list anyway more practical more implementable this is why I supported is dropped in okay thank you okay clean Livingston thank you me I 'm going to apologize in advance for not doing this this has happened very fast which is good we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I don 't think will be too difficult for the council to handle I know we 're going to come back and have another go at this with the community but if I could have that on the screen please it 's in regard to the pressure wastewater system and i 'm putting this board not only as a measure by which we by which the community is protected but also the council itself this has meant a lot to the local community the the fact that a future council could possibly take away or refuse rather to remit the electrical charge for these systems so I 've would have put there is any change to this policy by future councils must adhere to the significance policy in relation to consultation if there 's anything where you zealand councils trip up it 's over consultation and we know there are several examples around the country that we councils don 't consult they get into trouble and it actually ends up slowing things down so that it 's why i 'm putting that forward and seek your support to it it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the council in other words to prevent a future council simply moving from the floor that we will refuse to remit your electrical charge this is in reference to page 117 and it 's under remission 5 the conditions in criteria section so i 'm seeking to to have the edit to go out consultation imus human counselor East is like a second to the resolution I think that 's an order it doesn 't add financially to the situation and I know that this community is looking for reassurance in terms of you know future councils you know behavior in relation to the electricity charges associated with the system Jamie golf don 't want to hold anything up sounds quite reasonable makes sense i just wanted to just before we go on to moving this to suppose any staff comment around that our staff had anything they want to say that we should be aware of hardly needs a report or anything to accompany it but is there anyone that would be able to help us out on that Terry left a bit early to me we might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it looks okay but I 'm trying to see he 's a mentally ill person who was there before but oh oh Peter but she 'll come and join us and actually while you 're coming down I 'll take the opportunity to introduce Bruce mower which I didn 't do before and sorry about that but he 's here to advise us on rating impacts of changes that we may make today so thank you very much for being here and I apologize for not acknowledging you before but here is Peter Mitchell well just the counselors may be aware you can 't bind future councils it 's right so in the same way as governments can 't blind future government other than by signed a contract or third party so I think it is a signal or a clear statement of intent in terms the council 's intention it is putting a lie on the scene a future council of course revoke or mean the resolution if it was passed from that perspective but at the end of the day in terms of the current council that be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think that 's right and I just wonder whether the wording of it you know sort of almost challenges the the future council and maybe it would be better if it read that this promotion policy is subject to the significance policy in relation to consultation which means that they would have to amend that before they sought to change the policy without it I don 't I don 't think that would probably achieve at the significance policy doesn 't require consultation right it essentially sees the council needs to consider whether or not a matter is significant and then decide what the what form the consultation shall take if any it doesn 't bind a council to connotation so helping us out a better form of wording would be that any any change to this remission policy must must be must be the subject of prior consultation with the local weren 't we affected with the affected residents before any decision can be made as made and I think that that 's the you can then resolve that and then a future counselor then need because you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be around changing that if you like and that 's I think we try that 's right whereas if they did want to change it in the future then they would have to just be so they would have to consult yeah but it 'd be simple resolution if they wanted to do away with consultation but then everyone would see that they were over tuning the consultation requirement yes any change this remission policy must be the subject of prior consultation with affected residents Oh actually not prior consultation but just take out the word prior consultation with affected residents it 's a affected residents prior to any decision being made can I just check things that does actually that person that does bind future council trying to take them know it well it binds them to the extent that they that they could amend that right I mean it 's like that you know entrenchment clauses and parliamentary terms although they are entrenched to say that you need two-thirds or the result of a referendum you can 't actually legally take those out without two-thirds of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does defeat but this is the this is the constitutional reality that we cannot bind future councils but I know that affected communities are really concerned about future councils making decisions what we 're saying here and in a thank you for bringing it to council 's attention is that with this policy there has to be so there has to be consultation with affected residents before any decisions made if a council wants to make the decision without consulting with the residents then they have to they have to repeal that clause so that so that means that the first debate that they have is to take that out but if they made it if they made a change to the policy without consulting they would be in breach of the policy and it would not have a fit all right yeah okay I think it gives the community the assurance that this council is putting in place our protection against a future council that we can 't guarantee but that gives the best protection that we can offer yep David East thank you meta mirror I think this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this in the precious sewer system debate are the installation of the actual tanks on the property of the second one is the power to these tanks of counsel in the long run is of a mind to go down the pressure sewer system path I think this resolution will in some part allay the fears of residence that the future council will be able to quickly remove that part of the remission so I think it 's a very good amendment and I would encourage counselors to support it thank you oh if people were happy I 'll just put this amendment and get it carried and but then we 'll come back to the debate on the on the whole of the that sounded rather dick territorial of me didn 't know that but i 'll put the amendment all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried so can we move on to the to the rest of the debate now on the on the on the annual plan I don 't know Pauling cotton thank you I 'm agreeing with counselor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we 're looking at requiring three hundred and ninety thousand dollars to to keep their the same and when you look at the fact that they haven 't had any increases for over 12 years possibly 15 have actually been decreasing anyway every year we were in enabling council we are a city in recovery I believe that we are supportive of communities and this is where our recovery begins not it 's really important that this would represent around roughly around 60k poo would if you looked at it in that way that 's a considerable amount of projects that could be funded or workers in the community or whatever or events and I would be really really reluctant to see this lost and i and i also i 'm not sure how people would come submit on that because it 's such a broad category community funding so it 's not like you 're going to get people toddling and to make a submission and this could easily go under the radar where people not happy with it but not not get food so I 'd like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether or not the only possibility is the capital endowment fund again I keep coming back to that but I believe it 's a rainy day and that 's what it was for so I would like to to move that we consider that please bulkeley order I 'd like to secondly well we 'll hang on speedy we need an amendment if that 's emotion okay I move that we consider datacenter motion or so and i 'm in mountain view what we 're doing at the moment though is the draft annual plane so shifting money from the capital endowment fund which i 'm assuming that 's what you 're suggesting that we do into operating expenditure well i think we made we made a call that we would we would look to the capital and down and fund transfer of capital for legacy projects but you 're suggesting that a component of that be transferred for the purposes of allowing the current grant system to let stay at the current amount i mean i just i I 'm hearing what you 're saying but I 'm wondering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other grants in here that could be considered legacy projects which could be funded from the capital endowment and in that allocation go to the community funding it would be a juggling operation but I 'm circling I don 't want to see community grants cut I guess it 's not my place to tell everyone where the money 's coming from but I don 't know it is because we agreed to thank you my dear it 's that is on this occasion so yeah okay gone hey look look what can we just take take the if we can sort out what the actual motion is that the amendment what the amendment is then we will know what we 're discussing and the only thing that I mean I kind of wish that I 'd had advanced notice of this amendment so there so that we could either agree that it is dealt with as part of the you know I mean I think that what counselors want to to say to the wider community in terms of the submissions on this that one there one you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or increase expenditure in one area in this budget we 're going to find a way within the current budget to do that so I think that 's in Council collars certainly looking for somewhere to do that the second thing is is that she 's identifying the problem around community grants so cuts to community grants when it 's a broad brush cut across the board who raises the public concern about how that might impact on individual organizations and powers that achieved and is it best achieved by by not having any cuts to that fund and thereby not having any input from the wider community on the subject if you see what I mean there is an advantage and putting that there is an advantage and putting the draft plan out there with the cuts in it with a clear signal that council that there are many councils around the table they want to reinstate that through means of moving things around if you if you know there is a risk around not having that out there in the public arena for for discussion but if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll take them Ted a suggestion there and I don 't actually know if there is necessarily a resolution there I think what Pauline saying ultimately is that the amount of funding allocated community grants be increasing I think the ideal place for that is exactly the phase that we 're moving into which is a consultation as you said there is a signal being sent that we 're trying to be financially prudent and balance a budget to make sure that 's in line with the rating increase that was signaled in the LTP we 've done that and if something moves something else has to move to balance that up so as we then go into the consultation phase I think you would be saying to the community groups if you 're uncomfortable this you come and you tell council at the amount of funding to community grants be increased it 's our job then to find out how that 's going to happen but if there is a will for that I think going into consultations and perfect opportunity that signal to be seen and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you say I 'm and I 'm open to hearing how we do that it fell clearwater look i 'm just wondering if as a way of council staff finding in fact a way of balancing this so we keep our projected six point five percent of increase n no more and and like as Pauline god has pointed out previous councils have made successive cuts to this fund over many years and it just seems to me we know that in fact community groups and our own community boards who were saying we want the strength and are going to come to us and say look we can 't cope with us we know already that many of the small agencies aren 't coping and are starting to go under and this is the very year the third year after the earthquake were in fact we as a community as a council are going to need these organizations most I don 't think we should be expecting them to come along and put out their hands and say please sir we 're going to need some more I i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact as a city we are dependent on we have been dependent on these on these small organizations and we want to support them and now is not the time to make cuts and that we look in other areas where we may make reductions and will or if as a way as counselor kota said of taking the money from the capital down in some way or if there is still scope and I 'm not sure about although in the in the in the supplementary report the 22 section 22 refers to a point 33 million increase in the capital and the ocean city holdings dividend if that still might be a way of being increased as a way of what funding that 's mean okay and led James principal sorry David Heath was nice sorry I was wonderful die might respond to that last piece to don 't vanish I think what I was asked this is the sea thel dividend a source of funding to make up the 390,000 and the answer to that of course is that Miss potentially it is the only caution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dividend for more of the bigger issues that we know are coming through regarding the unknown factors still around port hills and other and other events so the to be honest really this budget balanced budget is like balancing your budget at home you can really and we will do whatever you ask it 's just a matter of understanding what potential downside is and using phones david ease thank you look I think we 've done a fair amount of work over recent weeks and actually looking at where we can make some savings and actually come to a six point five percent rate rise and I 'd be happy to taught us to actually go out for consultation and as the mirror said it provides a starting point for for community consultation having said that I I am personally quite in favor of seeing the community funding being held at its current level but I also to look to the future in our three year planning and looking at more empowering our local communities to be able to do things themselves and adopting more of that type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however if we are going to stay with the current sort of balance of community funding I would prefer to see that we chopped metropolitan funding and kept the community board fundings therefore if we had in the final analysis have to stay with where we 're at now I 'd rather see it come out of Metropolitan Community Grants rather than the community boards once so I think we should put it out to consultation now at least gifts as you said before an opportunity and a springboard for the community to consult on on the plan and also signaling that a number of councillors do have a viewpoint on on reduction or community funding Ali Jones I didn 't do as much of what David 's just said I think too we have to be very careful just saying in a blanket way we should keep community funding at the live letters it 's quite clear from the work that we 've done in the last couple of weeks that there are a lot of community groups and there is a lot of funding I think we need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well are they double ups and I think David 's point about supporting communities to source their own funding outside the counselors something we should look at as well so i would agree in suggest that we put this out as is and have this discussion during the consultation period in livingston thank you i agree as i think we all do in relation to sending out a signal of financial prudence no question there the question for me is but should that signal be in the form of proposed cuts to community grants my own view is that these community groups are the glue in our city and we need tech glue to be particularly strong at the moment so I I would support our staff doing whatever they can to ensure that the grants that are kept at the current level I do wonder how much interest is left and the the capital endowment fund and how much could be applied from that as a way forward we 've that one yes and so the 1,000,000 that has already been applied to the payment of grants was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is 0 yep Andrew Turner I 'm very aware of all the great work which is done by various community groups right across all of our communities and I 'm very aware of the the relevance of this work at this particular time three years after the earthquake we 're still very much in a recovery phase it 's those grassroots community groups in many cases that are engaging community members and keeping community through all together and in fact in many cases it was community groups that jumped into the gap that was left immediately after the earthquake and so communities begin to recover and also very aware that the way that we do community funding at the moment may not be the best solution I 'd love to see us work through ways of making communities more sustainable making communities able to stand on there at their own two feet a whole lot better rather than constantly giving the same money to the same group to year after year so that that becomes an expectation and something that 's relied upon so I I do agree that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we we administer community funding I believe that 's something that we should be looking at in terms of our long-term plan discussions I don 't think simply making cut to the level of community funding at the moment that this particularly important moment is is the way to go I certainly would support leaving community funding in its current level if that 's workable in terms of the budget in this annual plan and then have a complete look at the way that we deal with community funding in the longer term as part of long terms and discussions there any other comments you jaani Oh handsome i guess um it was my expectation that we would have more flexibility around CDC and cct given the you know their inflation-adjusted grant so every year they get more money the cuts of their being that they 're finding is really a little more than inflation so they 're actually getting the same amount that by getting rather than lease and we 're taking money off community grants and real terms that was not inflation adjusted I have a real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that actually the previous council and I think this council although you know there 's a proposal around the reduction to Community Grants and I don 't support that that actually we have been incredibly generous we we spent huge amounts of the interest from the capital endowment fund into physical facilities and local communities we have been funding things through our betterment improvement in infrastructure allowance to replace the physical community facilities like the Gaiety so I think this council should be proud of its investment it has made it to local communities post-earthquake at a time when our finances have been increasingly constrained but I do have a lot of sympathy for the arguments that have been put forward and again I think there needs to be a clear steer today around the air of the possibility of what we can do to look at I think a better readjustment of the 6.5 increase in relation to community funding now I don 't know how we get stuff to look at the CDC cct endowment fund stuff it was my hope that some of the endowment funding was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess with a more sizable substantial grant for new innovative creative projects that might be mum Legacy Project legacy or in fact even the events seating for example so you know I 'm not sure we 're talking about a big quantum of difference I do think there 's some principles around around it that we do need to look at I certainly do not support us introducing community board funding at all interesting to note that like lately community boards have been asked to pick up metropolitan funding because there 's no money so we 're being asked to funders community boards metropolitan campaigns across the city which seems really bizarre given the local focus that community boards should have so there 's clearly a gap in the community funding that 's been available made available I think I mean I 'd like to comment on us because one of the difficulties that I see is that we haven 't actually had a strategic review of the grant system and the the final comment that counselor handsome just made really reemphasize a-- 's that because to community boards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metropolitan project but the Metro fund is open now for the next financial year and it 's a single process for the entire year ahead well that project that is seeking funding now wasn 't thought of a year ahead so wasn 't able to be dealt with in that context it 's only the what tell me the name of the grant that exists after july the discretionary fund very community board so no no no mount pollen metropolitan oh metropolitan grants opens and closes so it 's open at the moment it closes and then it 's for the rest of the financial news next financial year but there 's also a discretionary Metro grants funded yes that 's right energy don 't one there that I didn 't even know that that particular organization had applied to it it has a certain amount left in that but I don 't know how much the particular group was asking for so I mean I 've had a briefing on this today and part of because I 've been concerned about this whole question because there are a number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them isn 't clear and it does look as if this discretionary fund was established so that those organizations that didn 't meet the the year out sort of all several months ahead of for a full year that they didn 't have the they didn 't have a really yeah so it was developed for that purpose of meeting those that can 't meet the requirements of the Metro fund then we 've also got a number of other funds so and I mean myself as mere i have a small discretionary fund that i 'm able to use as I indicated before the mural Welfare Fund which really ought to be a civic well-being fund actually needs to pick up that discretionary fund but but be nimble enough so that it doesn 't have to hold things up that need an urgent and put of cash just to resolve such situations it does appear to me that as a city we need to have a mechanism for providing some a sense of reciprocity when we 've received so much from other countries some of our own residents live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no fund that we can draw on that 's not rate payer funded in order to assist someone overseas and I would like to establish part of the grant system to address that as well so I actually you know i 'm i 'm thinking this morning that looking at the whole community grants and the fact that the current level of funding it 's 7.2 million i can 't say that that 's actually necessarily meeting the best knee you know the best that our community could get from the investment or the co relationship or the the co-funding relationship that that we have with a community and and that 's what i really want to see us move to as we debate the the reserve what a resilience city looks like is that that the council doesn 't fund an organization they work and partnership with organizations to to get the best of them there are only eight organizations that have a three year relationship with the council now well and and and how they get to be those eight organizations whereas others apply every single year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you how those eight were chosen over and above all of the others that actually looked like they should have a set funding stream from the council so I what I 'm what I would prefer to see out of this this process that we 're going through now is a review of the whole of our grants and a strategic analysis of what that might mean in terms of how we get the community engaged in its own you know since of itself and its relationship with us as a council so you know i 'm not i can 't i can 't tell the ratepayers of christchurch that that 's 7.2 million dollars is necessarily producing you know stronger more resilient communities and in the way that i believe that it could with some rejigging so in a way it almost you know with it whether the whether the motion is that we retain the grants level at this level and then we have a review within the context of this review period because by the time it comes back to council after consultation will be sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a full analysis of of our whole community grant system so in a way yeah so yeah so the only disadvantage with the amendment that i can see for me is that it doesn 't require us to find the savings internally within the budget because that and itself would have a point one two percent increase and rate so we would want to find you know so that for me i would want to see that the community grants remain at the current level 7.2 million you know but with what they you know the cost of which is meet within the within the budget is that I mean oh you know what I mean yeah it yep being that not all of the 7.2 million goes to community groups a lot of it through the discretionary will be community boards paying for something like a seat or a bus stop or I don 't know what else it 'll but it 's not all going directly to the little people of you like so and everyone who applies for the fund needs to bring a note and full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measured by staff so it 's quite it 's very strict that fund is very strict so I would support your social to my amendment that it 's news to me so is that right that that sometimes community the community boards funding is not just used for community groups it 's used for community facilities and yes yes I communications for community boards having Awards our bored lately was asked to fund a toilet public toilet so so there 's some very local cool things that council do maybe sixty first words are having to pick up there 's been like everything I I through the board 's discretionary response phone they can fund there 's no restrictions as to what they confirmed as long as it 's not contrary to the council policy right then I 'm not funding a appeal legal challenge to something that council has moved as well so there is a lot of latitude for boards to be able to fund public routes ok so but are we able between the mover and seconder to find some wording that that looks for the internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budget tell us you um do it he wouldn 't be something on the lines subject to cost savings being filmed no I 'm told that that 's not good enough we actually have to find where yeah we have spent weeks go over the stuff we have to pass let 's get on with it and wait for the consultation process and come and ask for that we 'll deal with it then this is a complete waste of time I couldn 't support this because it really there 's no corresponding we haven 't identified corresponding 390,000 although i support the intent of it so I said before I think it 's we put the draft out as it is now we signal a strong message that there are counselors that would like to see the community funding retained at its current level but to achieve that require corresponding cuts and other parts of the budget so I 'm happy for the draft to Gary Alice Elizabeth a signal fell I thought we had although it 's been long discussed I guess people were looking very hard at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's a way for example of the calendar the year the cable and gentleman Fundy found all the CC HL dividend if as a way of their actually afford in this or some of the other projects we are staffed to find those and I certainly support the concept and this will be an addition to this amendment and along the lines that you lee and have referred to another bro you I 've been told that that doesn 't sufficient we actually have to find it in the budget before it goes out so we would have to do that now we have to allocate where the money 's coming from but but the point is is that I mean I 'm getting a sense that you know then it might be better that i put the resolution as it is if it 's if it 's voted up then we have to find a place in the budget for it if it 's voted down then we can move on with the very strong signal that counselors that are going to vote against this resolution have said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reinstate and I guess the commitment that I 've made is that we will report on a full analysis of our whole grant system right across the 7.2 million dollars so that we can actually analyze what we can do in a much more strategic way than I think that we 're doing at the moment","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"
NZ,NZ,Christchurch City Council,Christchurch City Council,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZETwErnCvvgbvBbnnHfyxA,27.2.14 - Item 23 - Central City Car Parking Update,GmStLo2l4U8,20140227,984.54,"Christchurch, New Zealand",2785,date item number 23 and I would like to move that we note the contents of the report that I call a meeting of all interested parties as soon as possible in order to present the report and to discuss solutions and that the report itself be referred to an earthquake recovery committee of the whole who are given the delegation to make decisions on this matter it would be my intention to call that meeting hopefully for next Monday and have the matter referred to the earthquake recovery committee of the whole next week so that we don 't lose any of the momentum on this so I 'll move that would somebody like to see Kim that Jamie golf so that 's open for questions for staff of Yanni hey I 'm just trying to understand when are we going to have a center of city car parking strategy but what 's the time frame I know we 've had a workshop recently but what is the time frame actually getting a draft but I thought that was going to be today so where were we up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan before Christmas but we mean it it looks as if we 're required to have a parking fan and place it in the original the development of a parking plan for the central city that 's to be developed between us and Sarah 's the way that I read the the plan you 've already outlined the basic principles but I suggest the question as as that when is the parking plan going to be completed through human mt yes the draft bacon plan was prepared by in December it was a very rough first cut of it that 's now been peer reviewed we did go through the principles that are briefing on on Monday of that and other things within an accessible City and basically the briefing we agreed to workshop that further with council and then report it up to review earthquake recovery committee to full council so we 're available to do that anytime as soon as we can get a workshop with the council laws I think that the there 's a level of frustration around the the the different components of you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a layer on on parking and it is kind of like chicken and eat it 's um you know how can you develop a parking flame when you not quite sure what the what the requirements are I certainly was aware that a developer had purchased a site just outside the frame only found this out last week and as building a car parking building there as part of the whole development so I mean it 's almost like we need to know who 's who 's providing parking to see where all of this fits on litchfield street of course not being the major West East and I think when we made our resolution last year we didn 't really take into account the impact on traffic flows that that would mean and that they but then thou we 're out our buildings are located and that 's got a whole lot of implications as well i mean i 'd be very keen to call this meeting outside you know of outside interests to a meeting next week and would would staff be in a position to report to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take into account sort of some way forward because there is frustration on one hand and but you know this is where speed and deliberation you know you can but i mean it does appear from the outside that we are the ones who are holding cleanse that but it 's when you when you drill into it and and that 's what this report is really highlighted is that we 're now left with a quandary what do we do i think i think you summed it up well i mean it isn 't a very straightforward element and there 's a lot of private players who can play in the space simply because in fact the the city plan for example encourages them to do so and allows into it provide up to fifty percent of their car parking we 've done has been focusing on what is the utilization what is our role in car parking which is largely around customer related car parking looking at both short and long term demands we 've been very aware of the litchfield and the crossing issues so we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both those which I think we 're where we can talk to counsel later about as well because those are also relevant because they are both the key points that we are some interest in the market is occurring but they also key car parts but as you rightly pointed out there are some real challenges around those because of their location and some other changes in the network so as rich as pointed out we are at a position where we 're very very much in a position to workshop with that with counsel not quite sure madam chair flow pencil came in late Ozma who all the interested parties might be in that sense because potentially there 's a very large number of interested parties if you take land owners and developers as well it was really along the lines of the those that are undertaking developments at the moment well we can say we 're happy to work with your office to to do that so I think that would be a good opportunity I mean partly it 's also a good option for us to check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to provide customer car park and they see that very much as councils role and we think that 's our role as well but it 's balancing our role against their role in providing for their their tenants and what have you yep so I can 't that would be great I 'm felt thank you can I just ask in Relations Board on page 38 you 've got the table with with the the occupancy of your like your rate of the other different areas and there 's just the two which are actually are you hi victoria street and city west and i 'm just wondering and given that i guess parking assessments after take place rapidly just how accurate and reliable is as the starter I guess where I 'm coming from as it sounds like there 's some anecdotal evidence that hard to get apart kind of thing so I 'm just loving if you could comment on there because clearly the report pertains pretty quite strongly to the being overall generally sufficient capacity this learning if you comment on me I 've just refer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come from information that we 've gathered in late January and I think Paul will be doing another survey in April so we periodically keep this information updated I think that the problem with their data as I see is that providing data around core North doesn 't actually including data around core North doesn 't really affect the retail precinct on the other side of the square so I think that when we when we look at this I think that looking at capacity within the within the retirement I don 't know how it 's worked out but you know I mean I think from I hate inec dohtal because I 'm really into evidence but my anecdotal contribution to this is every time I go looking for a car when I want to go to the restart more it 's extremely difficult ince the Gulf site is being developed not that i am complaining about that because i think it 's fantastic that that 's happening and i just wonder whether we need to be doing a lot more to get parking or you know even temporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know exactly what 's going to happen when the restart more relocates and through the development starts and their immediate vicinity yep i think one of the complications in that an interesting you know if you think about restart more the council did put in I think 112 car parks across the road alongside the bus the tempe bus exchange specifically to support that more but I think part of the issues were with people 's experience of car baking is the fact that not all that the very fact that they 're very distributed now a whole lot of little car parts makes it harder for people to find them and I think also the way that people 's transport patterns get disrupted coming in the place that they think they 're going to go in part something they can 't easily get to so they have to hunt around for something different and that creates that level of confusion as well so there is some work that we should be able to do i think i will talk with Terry and Paul around trying to create a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I think that that variability will will continue to be an issue for us until such times we do start to lock in some of the major you know purpose-built car parts yeah I 'm Jimmy chin question the pair of our faith in Paraguay six current parking capacity we 've seen 48 in the retail the relating there 's many the Council on capacity all is served combined together with private sector in the console facility our hypothesis this is our capacity ours is not an now that covenant is Wilson Wilson 's car park they 're off street includes the Wilsons got up LOL straight they don 't go on ok our pool league has been touched on but I think Mia you 've said it 's hard to find a cart back and what we 're finding since these figures were actually done a lot of car parks have disappeared and they 're going to continue to disappear as plots get taken up especially in the Wilsons a area so I think it does need to be some erosion sort of temporary parking put in place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's got a real issue once they start building the transport interchange so she finished march next year and that 's is going to take up almost car packs on litchfield street where they currently located we 're probably going to lose all the car parks at the south side of Castle Street up talk but by the bridge remembrance and it really is going to isolate those businesses that are currently existing and we have to remember that we are in a Trent a major transitional phase and we 're going to make sure that whatever is up and going and wants to get up and going they are able to get a stay and maintain themselves in parking is certainly key part of that I think there 's more point than anything else yeah but I think your point is right is that you know there needs to be you know comfort given to those that are investing and major developments that that that there is a you know sort of matching area of investment happening from the council yeah Mike did you want to you 're just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to see it clearly but this is a map that Paul 's just given me so but the red dots actually show all the temporary car parks we are operating around within the forever news so we can pass it around now what obviously what that does is there some of them are small some of the median sized it also shows the the major car parks that we do have so we are trying to get that education out there I think going to your other point that the one of the challenges I think for us is how much invest that we actually match the investment in car parking to the demand that 's expressed so there 's a real risk if we invest too early or over and this we end up with an asset that we 're not getting an income off equally we were in a bad position thanks Lucy we 're in a bad position if we under invest and people find that that constraint in the marketplace so that 's something that tyrion paul richard are looking at something of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the retail sector particularly for casual street that 's something that we 're addressing sits somewhat separately yeah I think that one of the things that we will probably want to discuss as whether there are other sort of you know public-private options that are available and I understand that their previously there have been proposals come to counsel you know from the private sector involved and parking and you know and and we 've had you know briefings on different proposals you know here and as well and I just wonder whether they need to really be all in the mix again now so and I mean we can discuss that when we get to the paper at the committee of the whole but I think I think there 's a general indication that we want to look at all of the options now because it is so urgent yani do you have any sense of what the government are doing or not doing in terms of you know we know we 've heard that there 's 19 million being spent on government departments going back into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of land and both of the phrase it would seem to me that it 's kind of one of the unknown questions as you know are they going to be providing car parking buildings for their government departments are they have they thought about using their land as a transitional thing I know there was an announcement I think it was last week that or maybe earlier this week are some residential development opportunity eastern frame but you know do you have any sense of what government are doing or thinking around car parking provision or how we might work with them we are in certainly the anchor project will have car parks and car parking associated with them we haven 't seen the detail of that I mean one of the things we obviously are concerned about is that sometimes car parking is the first thing that gets you know value engineered out of projects so that 's one thing we 're continuing to to work with ctd you on that is what is actually being provided in terms of their role and providing car parking no I don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest net or what discussions we 've had so like to buy the Justice emergency precinct and the Metro sports which are two that are underway so already been dug are they going to be car parking buildings there yes so having it 's my understanding that there 's very limited car parking on justice emergency services prison until now in terms of Metro sports I don 't think it 's been finalized as yet but I it 's my understanding that there was anticipated to be a reasonably significant number but but I think a school in its early phases so but for justice and emergency certainly I don 't think that providing much we have so just to finish my art we have actually actively raised with CC you how they might support us if we 're going to advance our car park construction program but that we so we have actually approached it with them but we 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know that 's carried thank you thank you very much and the,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Housing Projects,IwMFWwMES9w,20140227,1769.41,"Christchurch, New Zealand",5105,"14 the land use recovery plan housing New Zealand exemplar housing projects housing people to come yeah i do understand that there are some people from housing use in and here i wonder if you 'd like to come and join us at the table thank you see one girl hi I well first of all get a I 'll get a motion on the table that we can discuss who would like to move this motion Glenn Livingston seconded by Jamie golf so that puts the item on the table I know that counselors have some questions around the exemplar project status but I just wondered whether you would like to take the opportunity of introducing yourselves and just giving us a quick snapshot of your involvement in this and yeah for our recovery evenson canterbury with me is Patrick who 's very much leading a planning side of things so this is a this is a planning of mechanism which is very much coming out of the loop and venues recovery plan these two projects ones in broom whirlwinds and surely we give a lot of tenants 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to as examples of new developments in very much in line with the provisions of the loop to showcase new housing new affordable housing new sustainable house with very strong community value values and ready in many ways from our point of view are given we own 6,000 buildings of which ninety-five percent of damaged and the earthquake events this is this is exciting for us in the sense that we are building over the next to you seven hundred and units and these are very much in that space but these these are very important projects from our point of view is that they not only showcase what is possible and both the social housing in the affordable housing space in terms of not only the build form or so the interaction and in the the way their buildings work with their community and community valleys and people 's hold of life requirements and also we hope they will prove to be exempt our projects in the sense that no the not good our good have low cost of ownership and work for people but also we can get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner so we can get these things in place because we certainly need more building to be done for the right reasons in a quicker way in Christchurch so that 's my view on it very excited to be here and we thank you for the audience and we 're very much chef good really solid relationships with both the social housing unit within the City Council also such a the wider Council in terms of community boards and the planning themes and so and so forth that 's my view so thanks very much for the opportunity Patrick you want to refer to the planning context here yes I think as Paul said this is a response to what 's been called out and land use recovery plan it 's been quite a short time frame from that in December to the fact that two weeks ago you passed those decisions about what the exemplar expectations are so we 've obviously had a sense of what they might be as you 've been developing those and and so those are the that 's the process upon which this these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so we see this on one hand a business as usual for us in terms of how we looking to do development going forward but these two sites are going to be in the exemplar space providing a lot more visibility about how medium density will be working with in Christchurch particularly with a view to how that fits into the social housing affordable housing space we also as Paul said I 'm hoping to see that with that greater visibility of how these projects will be unfolding some of the issues that are going to come out of how these developments going to work through the consenting process how we 're going to engage in with the local community make sure that we get you can get one in to build houses and the other end we make sure that these houses fit appropriately in the environment so it is a short time frame to get from where we have the similar here I know that it was an aspiration in the work that council would be looking to approve on the 6th of March these exemplars but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design development partners on board at the stage to be able to present to you a full designer so what I understand the council is looking to the side honest is that these locations are the appropriate locations for these exhibits to occur in each year we 've got a staff member here John as well so if you 'd like to come and join us at the table to end it might be quite useful just to talk about the connection what you know what the council can offer because I think there 's two things one is obviously the the connection with the community and and and the design and all of those things because the design league components really important I think to everyone here and the second thing though is our connection with the consenting because obviously we 'll want to work very closely so that this can be a exemplar process as well as an exemplar project yeah yeah I mean on a consenting side first and the land use recovery plan introduced a range of mechanisms that allow these types of schemes to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think patrick has clearly outlined the timescales that the lerp set out to get these schemes up and designed and ready to present to you what we 're always challenging particularly the housing New Zealand in this first three month period so the following the reports that we brought to you in coming months will deal with the details of how those schemes will look and feel and fit into their neighborhoods but really hear the sites are being identified to you in the community engagement side the community engagement site I mean the mechanisms that the lerp introduces do limit notification expectations but housing New Zealand 's own engagement of the tenants you know will allow them to explore how those other developments are landed in those areas and certainly through this exemplar process I think there is a need for the council that we 've already really ourselves to explore how that will be discussed with the communities in which they land yeah I think I mean I wasn 't thinking of formal notification I just I know that there will be a huge a greater degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the process and and it was our experience in odd annoyed the more people felt that they were involved in the and the process the the more that they owned it and the more and I mean they you know the community helped design decide the design for the houses and things like that and it was the wider community not just the the tenants of housing New Zealand if any well I 'll pass on to councillor clean living sternum in yani Oh handsome thank you me and thank you for pepper and also Vivian as well willing to acknowledge you and and the work that we 're doing together it 's good to have that both the the formal structure memo of understanding plus the informal connection but obviously you 'll be picking out the density is an important issue for all concerned here and when I look at the two proposals I 've got my Mets right one works at it about 270 with 30 sites the other 191 and one of the criteria talks about medium density so if you could we could tease that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do yeah sure so the the intent at this stage is to convert these to project sites one has nine houses on at the moment the other has 13 into 30 to 35 units part of that is a natural extension of how housing New Zealand is looking at how it needs to reconfigure its portfolio to match its demand and so we 're looking at more smaller units that fit the needs that we are finding we have the other thing of course is when we enter into the affordable housing space the smaller house the more affordable is pretty simple and in it obviously goes towards what the land use recovery plan is is sought to achieve in terms of promoting the greater use of existing infrastructure in place through medium density in the brownfield space within gross dude so the the design brief that we 're putting together right now for those sites is as an aspiration of 30 and 35 minutes for those sites and it 's to match that medium density expectation which is small units with a mixed typology and and this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not necessarily just to be a hundred percent house in new zealand it 's looking to to open it up with several housing and some some market housing in that we have to be a little cautious about promoting exactly to how that 's going to unfold until we have our development partner on board because the exact mix of how that works and the financial matrix that comes through that has an impact on on how those those topology end up being determined sorry yonni you Hinson um i guess it 's really a question of the chief executive the acting chief executive vulnerable council staff but we were going to have a briefing or we had a report on that i use recovery plan it was put on hold we 're still waiting to understand what the changes that govern have made to it are and i 'm kind of i feel like this is kind of chicken and egg like I appreciate housing is young when I get on and get stuff done but then when I look at the executive so in the report it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criteria and then when we read on to the assessment we see that there 's actually a whole bunch of assessment criteria that they haven 't been assessed against because we don 't have that information so you know I 'm really kind of puzzled around the process why this is in front of us ahead of being able to actually do that assessment sorry which ones are missing from up high quality safe and accessible well well energy and efficient innovation within the housing market showcasing ensuring that they will be provided by the time we sign off on the actual exemplar this is just around the location that chosen so there 's another step to go ahead i think that what housing new zealand asking us to do is to endorse their selection of the sites that have been decided that there will be through the reports coming to us with the outstanding information on the brand launched early projects it 's part of the resolution that we will be receiving that information right so in terms of decision making so we haven 't had we don 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got a report this let 's stop we 're still waiting to get we 've got a mechanism that 's in that play in there there is nothing that we don 't know about the land about the exemplar projects okay so he exists the assessment criteria north and though these are the assessment criteria here that 's fine um and that hasn 't changed in ladies recovery queen it wasn 't and the Lea nice recovery planets been agreed between counsel in it and housing New Zealand for the exemplar projects isn 't that right absolutely hips I could refuse account the council back to a report that are you received on the twelfth of Phoebe airy and you approved the exemplar criteria in the process in that report and and that was necessary to enable this report to come to you with the level of clarity that is here today right we are trying to to ask that previous decisions of the council are included in the reports themselves so that we can follow the sequence of events up I apologize you know I knew that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement as to what they were and i 'm sorry i didn 't have that in front of me so so it just seems to me it 's kind of you know like I totally understand the need for housing and for progress in things to keep moving but if you don 't know the bulb in the scarlet and the density exactly is going to look like how you know how do you choose these sides so what happens if we get to the second stage of the process which is and then I was trying to understand the decision ok we agree to the sites so that so housing these Lincoln go away and do the plans they then come back and say here 's all the different assessment we look at it and say yep we 're a happy no we 're not and if we 're not then I guess it goes through another process if we are happy then everything goes two consenting and it gets through the consent and work heavens I just I don 't quite understand at what stage do we see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our communities about what this might look like the issue here really is around timing the lerp expect Council and all the other lab partners to approve the two housing museum and exemplars by the six of March has been explained we 've got to a position where the sites can be identified but the detailed work has not been able to be brought forward quite yet hence the request for you to receive further reports in the future so really I think this is more of an updating report saying look we 've got to this stage there is more work to do but that 's yeah it 's at least like letting you know that these projects are in train and we 're working with our housing New Zealand colleagues to move these forward and there will be very lowly details measures were required to do to collaborate in which we want today so how like what reassurance can we have the scale of the development that 's going to happen in these local in these two areas is going to be done in a way that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't totally destroy the character of local neighborhood and actually doesn 't put a big you know three-story four-story five-story in the straße t so in the further reports you 'll be given all of the details about the schemes and really your view as to whether this scheme progresses an exemplar is still a decision to council to make and if we say no then what happens that 's that 's a I guess at the choice of counsel has could I could I just pick up on the point in paragraph three point semen which talks about it 's covered by the community housing redevelopment mechanism which is a design lead me to drive absolutely in if you remain it requires a buffer between yeah and the report we go that was um to the last Committee of the Whole which was left on the table it did say that the assessment quote assessment matters had been removed by the minister around these developments so you know that 's why I was sort of referring to up to start there were changes that we made that we haven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i mean yeah this was raised when the council met on the thirteenth of februari and look back through that those design assessment matters remain a very firm part of both of these mechanisms and will remain you know to consider any consent relating to any of these sites sorry um it 's a quick although only a client I had a list of people speaking I 'm sorry Phil thank you and overall with the recommendations I Sydney support is where you want to ask you about one aspect and it 's in terms of like to one of our Council objectives clearly as supporting communities in heaven communities gaze of and like we 're aware that it 's a government policy around healthy different properties in fact that when a renter achieves a particular three shot of income that they would need to find other accommodation we understand there I 'm just wondering are there any ways that we can work with you or that that the government policy pets can be softened somewhat I kind of help you on government policy I 'm sorry but what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to deliver affordable housing into crisis to the private market so in the wider social context I guess there 's an opportunity for people of lesser means to have access to quality building and very much part of the initiative here I don 't know where the answers your question but pepsin part maybe oh no I look I do appreciate that you 're like the messenger account for the policy but it 's just I guess how in fact there might be some ways to winter we 've it so it 's not to the policies in too harsh on people in terms of being required to suddenly leave a property because they reach no they don 't well with the their job was something like that and yes there 's specifics on our way yeah reviewable tenancy is not you that 's yeah it 's no I can 't comment on there sorry sorry I was up because I got sidetracked on an issue it says it 's not a question that 's an order for for the council to ask a staff yeah um pawling I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been sit back I 'm do you have a new timeline have you got is your problem with the designers what 's the holdup have you got any idea so just to put it into context we 've received two weeks ago the exemplar criteria yep so it would be inappropriate for us to have proceeded down the path or the other heaven knows criteria which council is now set a fortnight ago so basically from here we are working on your design process looking to go through our panel of development partners in select the appropriate people to work with work with them on the design long answer to your question but what VIN has to happens wind up presenting their proposals to our board were anticipating it to appear by the middle of this year and it 's that 's the time frame so we 've anticipate before that time that there will be an engagement with the local community as the designers been developed so that they can be informing the process so what are really saying is we 're still the two exactly how that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've just been working under since running repairs those details support night ago but just to give you a sense of when are we going to get houses on the site if things work to plan we 'd anticipate that would be in two consenting process with council you know the second half of this year and looking for construction to begin and for completion to be next year I can 't say exactly at this time until the form of the building is no confirmed but of you know middle of next year or the end of next year would be the completion time like that that is not something that we can you know we 've not said that in the contrary we 've communicated with our tenants about the process that we 're going through it 's a sight you know these sites that we 're considering for development so we were it 's not appropriate for us to be putting time frames out there at this time saying this is when constructions happen because it also turns around this is this is where these houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we 've actually got set in place yet but always been through our prices sum of all know whether it was going to be another question that communication with the tenants is it face-to-face yeah so standard stuff is done personally face-to-face we do a fair bit of this just generally face-to-face we do it as quickly as we can so they have to we want to hear from a person rather than from a neighbor or anyone else and credibly it 's incredibly important and when you do there it 's amazing how positive the responses and then we work to a range of different options for them in terms of what they want to do with vocation and whether 111 so call them some take an opportunity to move somewhere else some like to stand the locality and you know north of ninety percent transferred to another house some other things happen in their lives but we pretty much take the approach that we offer them something equal or better somewhere else and people often people actually like to feel as if that part of the development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel like that that 's good for them good for the committee and they support it but the crucial thing from our point of view is getting into them through to getting them personally and running out it 's good close as quickly and I 'm really we 're running out of time yes why they haven 't used that corner of skipton and HSN do you not own that property I 'm not sure oh it 's great it 's great okay yeah we would have probably one day yeah riff did you have a question yep seven which is not included plan and so why is that we are we own that it 's relatively new development so time by housing designs relatively new to 97 yeah okay so we wouldn 't really want to redevelop a relatively good asset again would need to integrate the development around the nest yeah okay no that 's fine yeah I would make the point there are various other ways of the other sites we could have chosen he would chose what we thought were two typical sites too because this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good example and in terms I 'm not a planner but in terms of all the criteria but affordability in amenity billion in look and feel again despite what the planners may say and write we know this is the sets the social example going forward so to have that social contract to bow to do sorts of else we need to get this right right up front and we need so we know where that entail you 're right and then you know if you get this right it will make it a lot easier to you know if you get it wrong you can have a proper way here simple is much better Ally James I just wondered how important knowing things like hard the quality of the of the builds the safety of them the accessibility the energy efficiency all of those things that aren 't available information wise at the moment how important are those to the site what is the relationship if any between those things and the site because I 'm just picking up on what counselor your insolence yes yeah that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these things and the more more living space you can have our interior to the north is fair bit of a thermal efficiency clearly if there 's a park across that across that the roadway it delivers public amenity into a private space so that all does come in sigh and from a cost without from affordability point of view that the valve the actual land quality is material as well so again if you 've got a site with everything from greatly into terrible mean you 're trying but that but the green space and the best use of the land according to the sites are sites are very important some of these have got two different Road frontages which opens up a lot of possibilities as well so the sites do drive a lot of what you can achieve so until to some extent but don 't counsel Livingston 's comment it does drive a little bit of density as well so you 're confident not having that information at this stage doesn 't negatively effect on the ability to be sure that this is the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are comfortable that these sites can deliver those from our experience as the designers is unfolding so the matters that you raise while they may be building specific the locality I so that what we 're talking about now in terms of the selection is relating to quality of the land its proximity to key services and activities and such as transportation recreation and schooling and those sorts of things and we were very comfortable that these two sites fit that that those are the key issues for us to get this to this point and beyond that it becomes how does the design actually respond to the requirements that the exemplar list has been set out Paul you just want to take up yannis point attempt at an hour earthquake recovery committee on a second or fibra we do have a point and it was his community housing redevelopment mechanism counselors version of the community housing developed a redeveloped mechanism requires a mix of all types and associate assessment criteria Sarah removed this requirement and the associated assessment criteria we understand that see remove this requirement any associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of housing is Ellen and other social housing providers to provide back types of homes they deem necessary and the point that Jonnie made was that be deferred that report because it wasn 't there hadn 't been an opportunity for the minister to respond to the detailed issues in it he doesn 't agree with any of the points that were made and we are meeting with them in order to resolve it so there will be resolved and when we were a result a shin we have already passed we 've heard on the twelfth of februari the assessment criteria so it isn 't true that there are no assessment criteria for the community housing redevelopment mechanism it 's going on that I two sets of criteria here I think this is probably where the confusion lies the urban design criteria that there remain in place there was a set of criteria that sought to ensure that the worst housing mix was encouraged in social housing schemes that remains for the comprehensive development area these these wider market-based areas but in these social housing areas of community center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through by the minister so you know the diversity of housing there may be more limited I think it 's very safe so will remain social housing rather than and it was more about unit sizes so we neither the criteria really tried to ensure that there was a mix of one to three bedroom houses instead of perhaps blocks with just two bedroom or just one better in which particularly the worse so that 's that 's the distinction but there will be a mix on these ones philosophically the housing social housing stock in crisis is reasonably well spread their arse intensities and some streets so we don 't want to intensify that social housing stock but we certainly want to retain our numbers and here is like Shirley and in Bruma so when we build more stuff we want to you know we want to retain the numbers we have but because the lands being used for effectively is more stop we will in a way download our social presence of that makes sense so over yr approach on this on this top of development is we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have the same as a number we 've won 13 we want yeah yeah yeah yeah but we 're but when we do that is is another question but as it is a minimum we 'd want the 13 back in a new film forum so we 're all your numbers yeah all right i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much ok and we will now adjourn for lunch and we will be back here I 'll so in half an hour so at ten past one thank you","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

livingston seconded paul n kata that the reporters a whole be adopted I put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no Carrie thank you now the community committee part a decision facilities rebuild program monthly update that the committee recommendation is the same as the staff recommendation that the community committee received the information and this report the stir your hints and like to move that yeah thank you happy to move who was second up Andrew Turner most your Henson you 'll see that there was just one point that the committee arsenal v she just our staff I 'm not sure if they 're coming down just to talk through to our city in the provincial building on the way we can give you some update on that okay fer sorry wish that what the committee was really cleared knowing that this is a real these two priorities for elected members to consider and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council we thought it was really important that we get clear timeframes and an understanding from staff as to when decisions are going to be made on these facilities so we haven 't had that information back but I think we 've got stuff here we might to take the opportunity for them just to give a very quick view from the point of view is it okay yes okay hello my can 't away unit manager of the major facilities rebuild unit it 's like this with great pleasure that the Canterbury provincial chambers and our city projects Ricky recognized there 's fairly significant heritage buildings and important their seats for the city in high risk like is have been transferred into my unit I 've recruited a project director sitting over there Phil crew is a specialist project director and here into space to look after these projects so that 's that 's where we 're at so we kind of in a bit of a transition phase as the project 's move into into my program so what 's happened on on canterbury provincial chambers to date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making sure that they 're closing the building out and it 's preserved and looked after for going ahead at the same time like all the assets in the city we 're working through our insurance claim on that project getting very close to I guess an agreement or an establishment that will have reached its full insurance limit and we 'll be able to set their insurance aside hopefully that will be the part of that process so really done the prep in establishing the safety we 're now going into the phase of actually very carefully looking at saying what is the full scope of work to do for the project there was a whole range of choices likely to be in terms of both timing which or do we do it being very cognizant I guess of trying to get the building open as we can if we could on the way through recognizing the significant heritage value of it so really we 're taking a deep breath and looking and doing a very detailed planning exercise to look at their options and costs that could take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them mid to later part of this year that we would be able to come back and say here are all the options in terms of time and budget and scope and the our city is in a very similar phase we pretty much the same exercise being applied to that bill except that our city 's a little bit smaller than the Canterbury provincial council chamber yes I read the later report on it because I have a particular interest in that building and that its potential for collapse related to the staircase is and so the 15 meter booth that has to be granted includes the National Memorial to women 's suffrage and that as a site which is particularly special to women and visitors to our city and in a particular date that is relevant to them as the 19th of September so I personally would like to see what what what efforts could be put in place to ensure that we have a solution so that the the national memorial to women 's suffrage can be available you know permanently available on their site by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there must be a strategy that would enable that to be done I understand that the demolition of the stairway as part and parcel there but that seems to me to be the only reason that you 've got the 15 meter you know perimeter fencing I don 't have the detail to be our answer that question but what I do know is that we have engaged the engineers and we 're looking very seriously epic trying to achieve exactly what you 've asked for I mean could we have an earlier report and Israel on there and I know Vicki 's going to have some questions about can reproach would count as a chamber but i 'm just wondering on a on a reasonable time frame for there because it would be really good I mean next week as international women 's week and a well International Women 's Day on the eighth of March and we had hoped that there could have been something available on that day but people don 't want to go on and clean up the site is a community exercise I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I the woman of Christchurch really want to come together and restore the surrounding area to the to the beauty at once contained so that it can be available on a permanent basis so when would be a reasonable time for you to report back on a strategy that would at least enable that took here i 'm looking to looking to fill who 's being really involved in it but look it shouldn 't be far away we will advise you sometime within the next week is to when it 's coming back okay so so Jane can report you 're not taking orders of CEOs report and who needs report to locate some thank you Dougy and just a couple of a couple of questions is there any requirement on the our city building to use it in the way it was previously used or is that now open for discussion again I 'm not aware of any requirement to use it in this way but that would be part of I guess our planning exercise will be exactly there I mean the best thing about heritage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secondly just in terms I 've seen the insurance estimates for both the provincial council chamber and the our city some of them don 't seem to be too far apart but in terms of the total amount that 's going to be required to be spent on them is it possible before we spend all of the basement fund to have an approximate idea of what it will cost on top of any insurance payment to fix our city but prevent but end the provincial council chambers so like quite soon before it all goes on other buildings we can come back to you quickly with our our best estimates before having completed our fault but I think there 's an appetite to sit money aside for that purpose any other questions on this right thank you very much i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried the facilities rebuild planned demolition of littleton service center who have we got those same people and the recommendation that we have here is the committee recommendation which is to approve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff around that future consulting with the community board yani would you like to move there yeah no absolutely I know that by Andrew Tina yeah I know that this was um there were concerns about making sure that our insurance as at a satisfactory level I think one of the important points to know is that we need we need to get clarification around the basis of the insurance settlement and does this clewd the automatic reinstatement so as we assess buildings are we automatically putting in claims for automatic reinstatement Adrian no Dara Moses facilities wriggled manager chemical program group no don 't even answer here at the moment and probably aware this is one of a number of ongoing issues of Investigation and the facilities rebel program we don 't appear to have anybody representing insurance in the room today so I can 't offer up a nice i 'm afraid you think you know we 're asking for counsel Gators clarification that 's all it 's a pretty important principle for most of our agreements with our buildings and that is if we have automatic reinstatement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovered through our insurer rather than just one payment for the different things that have happened so that the autumn a current statement is pretty fundamental because you 're possibly gaining more of what you 're properly entitled to then you 're otherwise getting if you 're just doing it on basis of one one event so from this is as important to get clarification I think the staff could just note that this is important then you know I 'm happy to support the recommendations that are in the the this is a facility that is a bit of an eyesore and little to nothing to put it kindly and I would certainly defer to the council for the ward he may may may wish to make other comments generally as a principal don 't like for us to be demolishing things without having the alternative and the plans for what 's replacing it in this case I think it 's really important that we do move forward Andrew Turner and yes certainly I would support council yo Hanson 's comments around the insurance from the community 's point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street needing to be demolished all of the privately owned buildings have in fact been dealt with this is the last building on London Street Littleton 's main story requiring demolition and I know the community will be pleased to know that that work is about to be underway just a couple of other comments I 'd like to make and things really perhaps just to give a give staff a heads up within the building there are some artifacts and some items of cultural significance that will ideally need to be recovered as part of the demolition process or prior to demolition so certainly when negotiating with demolition contractors if I can request that you you take the need to remove as I say some some cultural artifacts from the building and there are also as I understand some property records in there that date back to the littleton Borough Council which would would be something that we want to keep as well and then referring to Clause 7.3 this is around the arrangements for for a new facility or in particular a combined facility there was quite a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the work done on the Littleton master plan which would be the the most recent piece of community consultation done around earthquake recovery in Littleton I would just draw staffs attention to the the number of staff that we have currently working in the temporary facility in littleton democracy services staff strengthening community staff parks and reserves staff customer service staff all of whom are closely linked with the littleton community in all of whom are people that the little thing community loves been there so we certainly would want to see a new facility that allowed for all of those people to continue working in littleton and i guess you know little sense a place where there 's a strong community and we would have aspirations around what you might call a little city hall for littleton littleton could be a good example of some way that we could progress that kind of idea so really just to request that staff think of future staff accommodation needs in Middleton and I 'm sure the community board will have some comment on this when you go back to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions one is that and demolishing the facility are we sure that we 've got all of the information that we need in order to sustain the insurance claim given that there isn 't agreement on it this was a stroke of good luck and coming to the community committee they are the insurer 's conceded that it was a total economic loss supported by a statement a position which claims total sum insured plus a tempest in margins so we have been Marin writing and that 's the best thing we can possibly have to proceed with absolute confidence to the malicious facility okay and the second question is that I couldn 't tell from the report whether the Littleton library as in an existence or whether it 's being rebuilt and this is editor or this is this is added to an existing building so the library is adjacent to the community center the library is currently open and the service center activity happens out of a library not no problems here whatsoever and the little fan master plan directs that in fact combined Littleton librarian service into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Super Center demolished will be looking at future options for amalgamating into that into their library area so expanding on the existing society yep but you 're not talking about demolishing the library re building a whole new center ok but it does again raised us with an issue of a major shortfall between what we 're insured for and watch that 's going to cost to rebuild hmm again that 's why it 's really critical that when we do work through the insurance as to what policy interpretation we actually have oh yeah yeah I don 't think that 's going to make up a shortfall all right so I 'm gonna I 'll just say this I just think that this is incredibly challenging for us to do this building by building place by place without any overarching picture that really is and it 's not a it 's not a process that I find easy at all understand communities expectations you know three years down the track but we 're faced with an extremely challenging financial situation and I don 't sense a joined up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and with a similar heavy heart I moved to the demolition of the heath cut voluntary library building and the recommendations around that oh can I just say for this three that he 's good ones were referred to a community board for feedback there 's been a major can live in he 's got over the weekend I know that the board has been actively talking through with its community over the if get one so my my suggestion is that this is basically when the community board reports back and two weeks time to counsel that as part of that report back we consider these reports so that we can a directly from it so that 's for these three is get reports I know that they have provided some feedback already but yeah okay um so so the motion is just simply that the that the wood okay so that we do fear items was up nine point nine point four four and nine okay fine 29.5 to the match the thirteenth meeting all right so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lead a field no but can I say and bringing that back and in terms of the paper itself the financial implications paragraph is not as not good enough it should be able to stand alone so in the content and the whole of the report we talk about the difference between the sum insured etc but the financial implications only refer to the results and I think if we look a financial implications section should be should stand alone she 'll be able to look at it and see exactly what the financial implications of the decision that you 're making art thank you so that 's all of those who can give advice on the reinstatement question from the Littleton oh okay if yes no that would be model thank you okay um our policy does not provide for automatic reinstatement and advice was given to the corporate financial committee in September to that effect so that if if the building is destroyed we we can recover the fall amount if we had started to repair and spend some work on it between one event and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recover if we done no work between the first and the second and the building is subsequently destroyed in the second we can only claim once as I 'm sure you would appreciate but I just want to be clear because I 'm you know in terms of the basis of preparing their claims I know that automatic reinstatement is you know there 's different views about whether we had it or not it 's the turn of the policy I 'm where I 'm hearing Diane saying that our policy didn 't contain it right now policy does not not every policy down statement well I an honor to you I bought a copy down for you but I would refer you to the advice given on the sixth of September 2013 at the corporate and finance meeting which is that it does not provide for automatic reinstatement this this advice gives that I 'm happy to circulate yeah give us the three worked examples which is incredibly helpful and hopefully could just distribute it to the council afterwards I think that would be very useful thank you Thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ library 's 2025 facilities plan update would you like to move that I 'm happy to move that committee recommendations and the who 's who would like to second that will be a water yeah Lee did you want to speak to it yeah just very quickly appreciate that staff have provided this updated revised version but we did find it a little bit hard to just go through and see what changes we were doing and thought that they needed to be a bit more work around putting it into a very clear in table format so that people could see really clearly what changes we were making we also also thought it was really important that we talk to our local community boards so this is just a procedural thing to get a bit clearer picture of we were going with their libraries 26 and community feedback before we consider it yeah but no I think that 's very useful any other comments I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no it 's carried thank you and now yani johansson moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the report is a whole be adopted i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no

Part 5,up0L01fln6Y,20140226,824.57,"Christchurch, New Zealand",2198,oh okay would you like me to set the scene over it okay it just procedurally too I 've checked with clear that these amendments understanding orders can now become the actual substantive so rather than tangling zup and eternal knots this can can go at as it is as it is we 've also had some tweaking with with staff so that that 's part of that that that means those amendments which are now the substantive is slightly different from your circulated email for me if I just set the scene firstly to begin with the question why do this why look at the concept of putting residential red zone housing units on to Counsell land and really that the answer is just about on the question the fact that if you 're looking at a social housing possibility in order to begin to meet the challenge of affordable rental in the city then that 's one way you could do it we have a disparate housing shortage but we have a housing supply couldn 't you actually pick those houses up and put them onto public land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housing through social housing so that 's what we 're attempting to to do here we have a lot of support from Sarah to do this we still have a supply of houses but the clock is ticking the residential red zone houses are being demolished we 're going as flat packs to Auckland onto farms to other tas that perhaps have less restrictive rules than we do they 're going anywhere but on our own counsel land and so I 'm putting it to you that we have an opportunity the amendment says you 'll see up there following not only the housing committee meeting but that they come out of other informal meetings that we 've added so you can you can see them there the first is basically that overarching principle of supporting any effort to relocate housing and that that 's important principle which which we need to embrace if we can number 1 i 've already spoken to that sustainability is a huge element of this as recognized by the Housing Committee why would you let houses be demolished and you know I actually think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they knew we had all these houses and we we let them be demolished at a time of crisis number two we do recognize there are other means of providing social housing and we need to test it as we need to test this through an open procurement process number three talks about a delegation to the GM community services and the CFO and consultation with Pauline and me over the selection of council land for a small-scale trial of up to ten units we 're proposing that two million dollars from the nine million dollars unallocated funds be used for that staffer here they can speak to any element of these amendments of you wish to ask them staff are already working with the insurance council New Zealand and Sarah and houses have been identified there are over 200 which are available at the rate in which and if you talk to quantity surveyors at the rate of rebuild houses in the last three years since the febrile earthquake if we were over mind to suddenly pick up 200 with just about be catching up to the number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that in well possibly less than a year so item 6 that the provision of up to 10 houses either from relocation or by other means to go out to tender with the aim that council could make a decision at its earliest opportunity we 've suggested a tender timeline Paul in and I 've sat down we 've tried to be reasonable over that again staff may have some input so that 's the end of my speech and if you wish to throw that open it 's tonight I congratulate you helps Livingston that was very well put I just think another thing we need to emphasize here along with sustainability which is one of the key facets is the time factor we 've got urgency here if we 've got some space on some of our land let 's pick one of these or two or teen up and put them on we can do it quickly very quickly compute to the other stream that we 're doing which is the intensification which is a longer term process stretching up as far as 2018 so this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I think we do have to keep that time factor in mind we could have families in those homes and about four months if we really get moving so I 've support thank you I strongly support this I just want to go back in time a little bit that after the earthquake one of the international speakers that we brought over was kept Miyamoto from Japan in the US and one of the things that stuck with me and what he said very early on was actually in terms of a disaster it 's not just about the it it 's not just about the human consequences it 's actually also about the environmental consequences and that the earthquake has been a huge natural disaster but it 's also had a huge environmental costs and one of the things that he was talking about was the idea that we would demolish so many buildings the embedded carbon in these buildings the embedded energy that we lose by destroying all these things that have taken energy and resources to build there 's a huge cost to our environment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been done a long time ago it is absolutely upsetting to see so many properties that could be lived in that could be reused could be recycled so many valuable materials so many heritage and and cultural and character places that are being destroyed for what for what so this is a really great initiative this is a really important thing to be looked at and I think if we can take a leadership role then we should do that it 's incredibly important it would be really neat to actually have a carbon clock in our city I know they 've got one in New York for example that counts the carbon that 's been emitted into the atmosphere and it would just be really I think quite stunning to see that as we see that widespread destruction and demolition or buildings and houses throughout our city what the cost is to our environment and if we can mitigate that in any way then I think it is incumbent on us for future generations to make sure that we get a sustainable recovery both in terms of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also for our environment so thank you to the work you 've done on this I 'm strongly supportive of it I think you I wonder if staff could just give us an explanation on item for the nine million dollars of unallocated funds and in fact whether there are any proposals for that nine million dollars and and what impacts that may have on that budget happy to councillor East in fact it 's probably slightly misleading item for that the housing fund is made up primarily of a bucket of money that 's in there for maintenance and repairs etc and that 's about that nine million and there is a programme of work relating to that nine million however in that bucket we also have what 's left of the 21 million dollars that we were given by eq c is a step towards settlement quite some time ago now of that we 've spent about seven million of it doing various things and there 's about another four or five million of that that 's already committed to other projects that we 're on going with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting in there from that EQC money that 's the money that we 've used for example to build a new units dundee place that 's the money we 've used to do the build new build at Knightsbridge and we would see that that was an appropriate use in it and that this would be seen for us anyway as replacing lost housing stock in the social housing portfolio which is a perfectly legitimate use of that money so I think the intention although the wedding isn 't quite right there I think the intention and the ability to access that funding is fine with the direction of counsel look I want to strongly support the recommendations and I want to thank the staff to for all the work that you 've done along and in with the Council of innocent in Council Cotter I think it 's terrific and it just fits the social housing part fits so neatly alongside the housing entity that Vicky back described before so I think it 's really exciting I think it it should be cost effective in that with that tender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is like a chicken balance for these reasons resolutions just a quick question in terms of the social housing that is ring-fenced from the ratepayer so that so this is all costed to run sustainably on its own so do we have an idea what the rents might be that are going to go to be charged no not at the moment but that will come back to council for a decision will be able to tell you what we need to do to that would have been sensible to do that in advance now we couldn 't we have any other tenders and yet it 's still all to know what their costs will be but we can come back to you with that reasonably quickly okay because you 've got you 've got some numbers here on page 79 around how much it might cost to for the relocations versus new builds etc so you must be able to work out roughly what you might have to charge yeah we could I don 't have that to go you have a month ok boys invariably under market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have some issues there but that that 's fine we can no I mean I do I think it 's a lovely idea but we just have to be very careful that all of this is financially sustainable so if we 're going to be actually driving this we 've got to be very clear about what our objectives are and how much it 's going to cost us be coming back with all of the financial details for before any any sign off and before any agreements are entered into we 're not delegating we are delegating for a small-scale trial if I might also add the the tender process timeline that 's been laid out by councillors is we I haven 't taken advice from my staff as to whether that 's actually achievable it looks extremely tight to me I would be surprised if that was achievable in that very tight timeframe but we will give back advice on that but i think it 's with the end of februari now to have this all done dustin tendered completed by the end of march seems to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can you scroll up just I can 't see that part of it sucks oh sorry scroll down oh sorry that so the timetable is no longer included oh no oh ok so that 's just a night I had a timetable of a month from now basically air for tender to come back to hear ya but it is but that may not be possible but not but what we 've got is that but the the provision actually comes back to Council for a final decision so yep it does say you 're still filters to carry I 'm just a little confused now what number three C 's delegate the selection of council associate oh you know that 's fine so they 're good but it 's still going to come back here yep okay yeah we need to identify the land so tender i can say on this bit of land it will cost us X X amount yep alright so i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much and we now move on to the report of the commune,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

1,h8Ej0BpRs_Q,20140226,1119.08,"Christchurch, New Zealand",2779,"or of the Housing Committee to it who is joining us at the table for the Housing Committee hey oh okay Pauline his moved shame full Clearwater his second of this green boy sorry I didn 't notice that being gone sorry okay well look I 'm oh yeah where who would like to start I 'm Vicky and so I just want to talk to recommendation 7.1 on page 81 remover signal is moved to God and sitting goodbye Pauline and felt thought basically explained that the issue of housing is completely urgent and that a great deal of work is going into this issue and that the scale of the problem is that we are about 11,000 houses fewer than we had pre you 'd quake in Christchurch as of the end of 2013 that housing is one of this councils key objectives and is definitely one of the most pressing issues that we face I 'm hearing through the Miz welfare fund for a number of social service organizations and you 'll all be hearing about kids living in substandard housing you 'll be reading in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the difficulties that people moving into the city are having with finding affordable rental housing we 're also seeing actually that the rental prices which have gone up dramatically and now actually starting to cause a new class of poor and in the city so from our point of view from the City Council 's point of view doing nothing about a audible and I stress this is affordable despite the fact that it comes and of course that basically deals with social housing and with relocation of houses into the red zone I am NOT talking about relocation of houses from the red zone sorry and but doing nothing is not an option for this council the scale of the problem as such that it requires major action and 2014 is not the worst all of the predictions suggest that it gets worse from here until about 2017 so if this is not the worst we are in for some pretty awful things unless we do things so what we are working towards and what we will bring to a council meeting a special council meeting around mid March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more particularly a new housing entity which will involve this city council and the government and possibly other parties but even the government and the council will not be big enough on their own to solve the issues of housing that we face in Christchurch so it 's intended that this new entity will work with the private sector as a catalyst for the provision of additional housing particularly additional affordable rental housing and that that will help with the problem it will need to be quite a large solution because the problem is massive so council has been working hard on this what we intend to do and just what i want to say today because the obviously in order to start a public consultation process on something we are required to bring a full statement of proposal to the council is that that full statement of proposal will come by mid-march to a special meeting of the council it will then go out for public consultation for at least a month and then come back to a further special council meeting such that the consultation can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearings process to be heard on any aspect of it so this is really just a flag that that is coming and it doesn 't as I say address the major issues in the housing report of the of the red zone relocated houses it is intended to go well well well beyond that and it 's actually looking at the provision of new affordable rental housing in conjunction with the government with possibly other parties and particularly with the private sector to look at not just to increase the supply but also to drive innovation to build communities rather than houses and to also allow for the innovation in some of the costs around housing as well and so just so that people have that information that 's coming back to us in mid-march I don 't think we need to do anything additional here but just in relation to 7.1 the committee recommendation that 's where that has now gotten too because this report was on the 11th fiddly so that was a long time ago this is on the facilities rebuild yes if i may just highlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one trend here in this there 's relationship to the wider bigger picture over social and affordable housing is that our waiting list trend continues to trend up i wish you to note that with regard to our units sixty-three percent in that work package of january to december last year that 's 44 out of 70 of closed units have been repaired in open 39-percent have 78 out of 202 in the various reasons for that figure some good news in terms of repair and I 'm particularly delighted to ceylon Christian rich Stillwell courts in the east for residents there reopened in terms of the numbers are three Atlan Krusty sex it reach still well the DS are nearly completed they should be through by next month I know that more unit open unit repairs are happening as we speak and I 'm aware i think some more will be opened quite soon in terms of the u QC global settlement we 're still waiting on that dundee place is a new bill is very close as well I think anytime now we 'll be looking at an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good yes yes so I 've just highlighted a few aspects of that part of the report and if you wish to open it up for questions with staff it 's jimmyjane no sorry okay how about 2.2 because a moment have a 325 the kind of social housing has been shut down but to category 1 is due to structural damage design weekly means the other is the health and safety a cut such a difference I have no idea whether it 's over late all separate yeah to tell you exactly what the differences thank you thank you with her speak to the health and safety there 's a couple of examples aired relates back to the original civil defense yellow placard that was placed on those those units a lot of those ones that are referenced under health and safety also contain structural damage but the predominant thing at the time was the health and safety aspect of that for example we have units at brom village that are not too badly damaged but they 're adjacent to the three-story blocks that could actually collapse onto them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there it closed due to health and safety due to the fact of the neighboring units could collect science them and then we 've had other health and safety issues and they 're worth liquefaction surge coming through the units that have been closed closed on a health and safety basis but they actually have underlining structural damage so the classification relates primarily back to the original you know yellow card placard that was placed on those very good writeup well in Qatar just wondering on four point two point four regarding the insurance if you see if it actually did it explain a little more clearly because the technical advisory group seeking to finalize invalidate the total claim damage assessment model by early februari 42 2014 do we have there and following on from it unfortunately this has lead to a suspension of the current joint damage assessment process as implications on the associated appears program also it 's early for the first part yes we do have a technically the first part of that we definitely have in February and we have actually shared that in great detail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yuki see as of Tuesday this week we 've received the ECC 's version of the same sort of analysis and we have our men with large brains sitting in back rooms trying to match up the two data sets at the moment and identify where there are differences and try to explain and understand where the differences are from the eqc evaluation and our own evaluation on a block-by-block basis so that work is progressing the that will continue this week and next week the two technical teams from the two organizations will get together and work it through at a professional level so they do understand where where each is coming from on the twelfth of March we have the next scheduled negotiation meeting so with the myself don 't brandish and Kevin Locke and our team and live by Tom Weston QC with the eqc team only five routines and so that will be coming back together then hopefully at that meeting will be able to progress an understanding of the gap between our position and their position and look it away forward so yes it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to comment on the second part Scott yep so with respect to the second part of your question there the original process that we had in place with EQC was jointly going out and reassessing the properties and it came about due to the fact that they did their first high-level assessments like you 've run out some christchurch and they must a lot of scope out so we started a process we would go back out there jointly agree those costs those up equally and then we would get on with the repairs and that so when this global settlement came about they basically diverted the resources off at unto this so since August last year fcstone lyst joint assessment process so we 've still had a number of properties going through our approval chain that we 've done that process on we 're coming to the last of those now so what with the delegation in place their revised cost and the cost that we 've agreed with our contract have meant that we 've been able to proceed with repairs or thrice through the general managers now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a low level you know the original scopes net the difference is outside that the delegation so what you 'll see coming up is reports to proceed with repairs coming to council to get authorization because it 's the gaffer 's is higher than I moments so we 've been bringing that to the Housing Committee as required so we can keep the program ticking along Wilder negotiations continue we don 't want to stop and slow down slow down or stop but the risks started to get higher as indifference as a big help clearly and with regard to the large blocks of units where report repairs aren 't feasible in fact they will be demolished in due course and there may be just one or two of those units occupied say is replace or a time is Rebecca time plan to have those sites teed in due course well we 've done a lot of work on particularly you 'll know without going back over history of the old and cold blocks the 400 and something rather that we wish to get rid of and we looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know there are a range of sites that we 've been trying to work our way through to try and progress that so we do have some the first one up as was Andrews crescent and we 're just at a point really of thinking about how we manage that and there are some issues about how we use the land that we 're getting some advice on as well so we have a partnership program in place to replace and develop our social housing sites and some of those will be some of those big sites i think i 'm thinking particularly large sites which are virtually empty apart from say two or three in a row rather than vandalism and feet and council needs to proceed as soon as we can with with respect to we 'll be following the same approach processes the community facilities we 're we seeking to get a final position from the insurer on those ones because most of one 's you refer to our and the over cap position so once we 've got there we will be bringing forward a report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size recognize in fact that the derelict structures the trick is getting as much certainty as well can out of the insurer so that you can make a good decision about what we do next Yanni Johansson thank you um along the similar lines but the houses that we have in the red zone have we transferred those to Sarah and do we no longer own them and I know originally there was kind of a thought that maybe some of those could be lived in temporarily not badly damaged but you know I 'm ability of Road housing I assume that those opportunities of thing lots yeah the the transfer is underway at the moment there is issues around the around sort of Public Works Act and the transfer mechanism so it 's quite protracted in terms of that actual land transfer component with respect to the structures themselves they are now increasing derelict state the all the electrical connections have been removed a lot of the services had significant damage anyway so and and I I 'm sad to say the majority of them actually have been significantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cylinders ripped out in stolen I just think by every good D are you expecting a report that will come back to Council to transfer those units and that land over to the government I mean I I would presume there would be a formal report that did that I think that goes back to the cost share of salt I 'll have a look into that yeah I mean I think we 'd want to know because as you say lots of issues um one of the one and somewhere in particular Captain Thomas quartz which could be subdivided and not be in the red zone have we done that or first time up this faster probably team to have a look at that and they 're going to advise with me shortly about whether we can or can 't do that what the implications are and theory that whole bit of land goes to Sarah and I guess in theory we might have to buy it back but I don 't know where that discussion will go but we 're getting advice on it at the moment okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for about two years we win can we get some kind of definitive answer for people that don 't know captain Thomas 's and Sumner it 's near wakefield f in the the rock full analysis that came out basically half of the units are at risk the other half armed but because there 's a that the property is all in one title that obviously takes in the whole area so if we could subdivide it we could probably have people living in those units although they do need a bit of repair and we could actually have some land where we could you know provide social housing I 've just just had an update counselor the Angus in our southern our property team has been talking with Sarah and has put this proposition to them we 're expecting a formal response from them within a month it 's good all right well I 'll put the motion on the facilities rebuild social housing program status update all those in favor say aye those opposed say no cash","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Mitchell to ask whether the ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the annual plan need to be consulted on if you wish to change a level of services actually in you and your plan itself as opposed to a management one do we need to consult before we can change it even if the ship stopped coming I mean yeah or maybe but how long of the ships not been coming to Littleton fourth so what enables its servers still design I mean that 's my point I mean I 'm not I 'm not being critical I 'm just saying that in terms of a process I just think that we need to be much more ado if we 're going to play a monitoring role which is our role then having a standard against which the staff cannot perform it seems to me to be not a good a good function okay so you 'll come back to this on this the other thing is another example was the rural fire fire authority minimum training standards those new standards were put in place in October 2013 I think it must have been anticipated that they were going to change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some respects that a flag should have gone up much earlier and maybe some of the the training should have been put in place prior to the standard taking a feat because I mean correct me if I 'm wrong but normally when standards around training are changed there is a leading time so that people know that they 've got you know that that it 's going to take effect from a particular date so they would have established what the training standard was what you know it was and it may have been that last winter if it 's could have been made to ensure that the compliance with you know fifty percent trained to that level you know I again it 's just forward thinking and I yes I think your question was asked by others within the building as well so yes yeah and the building and consents I was quite came to heaven up oh and just as I said building and consents mr. Sparrow walked in the room would you like to join us we 're just looking at the Finance Committee report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain terms of our targets and our results and you know obviously our targets and results are not well aligned it 's putting it mildly and but I do understand that you know we 're looking back at a period of time so rather than looking at where we are at the moment and looking forward so perhaps I mean this is an opportunity just to give the council some context for these figures page 47 sorry we 've got all of the built building consents and inspections item seven I was a little worried that if we simply are going to receive the support and it contains these very poor levels of results against targets I really want to hear from you that things are improving and and that we are on track for meeting our targets with anything so just while Peters gathering his thoughts he 's probably not aware that this gets reported through in this way this was for the period until December which was before your time Peter yeah but what the mirror is looking for us some comfort that the labels of servers going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yeah right ok so this these several thing sorry it 's Peter Sparrow director building control and City rebuild these several several things that the building control group are doing at the moment one is a customer advisory group so we have many group house builders commercial constructors project management offices within that group so what we 've what we 've asked of them is to give us a bunch of issues that they have and we will concentrate on rectifying five at a time to show improvement in so we 're showing improvement to our customers the other aspect does we 're also monitoring our outputs so things like inspection quantity quality processing and consenting the trim that we actually have at the moment is coming down we were averaging around I think it was a September last year we were averaging around 41 41 42 days average to issue consents we 've brought that down to the last assessment was 31 days okay yep and I think at the moment we 're even averaging out at about 28 so the downwards trend is showing at the moment so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past about measuring these trends because of the systems and processes that we have in place at the moment we 've done fixes to that system to allow us to lunch of those trends more accurately we also report weekly to central government in Sarah central government in be on those statistics as well so it is being monitored basically on a daily basis we are also going to be developing surveys so that we can monitor what our customers think as well as well as their customer advisory group so the reports will be there as well I 'm counselor east as the committee chair of the rectory in consenting to yep and we are reporting to them on those statistics as well on a monthly basis a monthly basis okay good think I just didn 't want this these figures and you know the way they are presented and this report which is a standard reporting process to be without the context but I mean I know every time I get in the lift and someone gets out at the third floor I know that they 're in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of the conversations that I 've had on the left is a lot of excitement about how how much better it is and you know and I mean people are busy there 's no question about that but people are much more satisfied I thinking and what they 're doing so if they 're starting to see results flow back into what the customers are saying then that 's certainly what we want to hear yeah we 're also monitoring beginning a lot of good feedback from our customers as well which is being monitored so we 're recording all of the good feedback they were getting but we were also actually and commending staff on that as well there 's a lot of their feedback about individuals yeah it 's just absolutely fantastic well thank you very much as I say when you get receive a report like this and the figures look bad what you 've suggested is that the trends are just continuing that movement down yeah and there 's a lot of work at the moment around system improvement yeah and simple procedural improvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet being developed so we 're also looking at getting a lot of improvement through those procedural improvements as well and you 've been recruiting too yeah yeah recruiting evilly yeah Yanni thank you I 'm appreciate it 's a difficult challenge and I know that these statistics are out of date but it 's good to hear that you know the transit is going in the right direction um have you considered I 'm just mindful that a lot of people come into the central city and it 's quite a nightmare you know with all the roadworks the lack of parking have you considered actually setting up a space and that kind of eastern suburbs possibly just raise up the land would you know service center and putting services that are more local and more accessible to people it just seems it 's one way that we could really improve the satisfaction was the people having instead of having to come into the central city for effectively services that could be delivered through a service center in an area that does have an increase governance you know proximity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys have considered strategically about just China then more resources in the area with the most demanders so we have considered that and we 're working on that with the allocation of inspection resource so we actually cover the city with inspection resource and we have teams dedicated now they were currently centrally out of this building however to to have a service into providing building control services preliminary strong leadership and control over the group so by breaking it up we 're scared that we 're going to actually lose a little bit of that control now that said our applications for building consents in our communication correspondence is usually by telephone or email a lot of the applications are actually coming in to us electronically so providing the service elsewhere is probably not required at this stage we have looked at it they will you get the really tricky complicated ones where people need to come on um the second questions do you have it like a heat map of where to consent activity is happening on a geographic special basins or is that something that we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure we can we can probably do a report on it yeah absolutely quite find out the know you can see you know into I think rather than then use the Finance Committee report for a wider brief work we may organize peps through report from the rig 's committee a a brief for the committee of the whole on on the whole process because I mean I 'm very aware that it 's the primary task of rigs to to oversee this process and I 've probably you know taken some Liberty here but I just didn 't want the bold figures out there without some sort of context for what was really happening in the and the department so thank you very much for your time and we 'll look forward to through the reports in the future hopefully that trend will continue it will definitely I just just died and i just had one other one which was around the Civil Defence and Emergency Management went on the reading net communications i was a little bit concerned to see that potentially with other people other councils pulling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program and and looking at options of the possibility of bringing in house and I just wondered whether another option was to discuss it with local government museum to see whether there could be a sort of a nationwide approach to to really neat communication because my understanding is that that 's actually been very very good and and was excellent during our our time of need so I would hate to see us well I just worry about it being again truncated to just one area instead of the potential for what it 's got great potential I think nationwide but I 'll make thank you very much and so so somebody will come back to us were they with some ideas around what the yeah okay that 's great good so I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and we 'll move on,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Circulated),etJbyzAwYuU,20140226,1013.44,"Christchurch, New Zealand",2710,to hand over to Jane profit to take us through her report and and i will move that it be received can only have a seconder for that android tuna and over to you Jane thank you LeAnn as usual I 'll take it as read but just a couple of things to highlight and a botanic staff sweep the dicks at the ellerslie international flower show so we 're very proud to see that happening we did a great job there and second thing of note and 3.4 you will see a recommendation around sensing cities I think it 's self-explanatory but you 'll be aware that we did in fact sign of the draft annual plan which included a note that capital from the capital endowment fund be made available for projects including sensing cities if anything should come up prior to the adoption of the annual plan I recommend counsel deal with it in the earthquake recovery committee and of course there would have to be a comprehensive report going to that so you perhaps need to adopt that resolution formally if that 's your wish to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amended with council tunas agreement that the that it 's called sensing city rather than sensing cities yep to delegate authority to the earthquake recovery committee to make any decisions on that matter would it be necessary should it be necessary make sure which can we deal with it by way of separate resolution the reason is is that I at the point that that comes to the earthquake recovery committee I will have to declare a conflict of interest I didn 't know this at the time that I met with sensing city but my sister is on the aboard and that creates conflict of interest which means that I won 't be able to participate I believe in a decision around funding so but I 'm going to take some advice on there literally I didn 't know until the last week so it 's been a little bit difficult for me in that regard so so I 'd prefer that somebody else moved letters of as a separate amendment David East and Phil Clearwater do people want to deal with that amendment separately now so that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will I 'll pop that amendment all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried so that 's that 's now part of the formal recommendation but I invite you to carry on thank you not much more to see you will recall we were looking to having a new leadership structure in place by the end of March I think that will happen we may not everybody might not to be here I 'm unclear on on that yet but the structure should be in place by that time and then the rest is really questions and answers some you have answers to in this report and some will go to the the other committee so I guess I 'll just other questions add to the long list of german jame Yanni one question regarding to paragraph for internal organization update because it recently the council we put a new is active leader team and I 'll say whether either the the handle is active or director said sure I 'm concerned what 's the job description between the director office of chief is active @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being recruited if he has a different view how to remediate this kind of situation because they will happen before I think we did discuss that prior to commencing the structure for the new leadership team that was a way back and about October and we took the decision jointly between myself and the counselors that we really needed to keep everything moving in parallel it is unusual you are correct but we 're in unusual times in Christchurch and we felt that we should progress everything in parallel so that we don 't lose any time the alternative would have left as notin of a positive position hi jaani you 're handsome thank you just in regards to the on page 3 79 the McGrady when to report other recommendations from that that I mean how are we going to as a council either agree to that give feedback on it adopt recommendations and a what 's the process around it that one is dealt with firstly by the chief executives advising the mayoral forum and it 's the mayoral forum which is all the near so it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conjunction with the other mayors because this was this particular report was for all the classes I i I 'm just kind of curious because this is how a cane the elected he Kenned was dismissed that these things happen without us as a council having been clear about what mandate we give to edit the chief executive all the mere around our view of how we should work collaboratively with people in our region so I guess I 'd really like to know a really clear process for which any views that a representative government actually come through us first so that I think it protects both the chief executive in the mere so that you 've got the support of us behind whatever representation is made I am really concerned that we put in place a process by which we can consider any of these recommendations I mean I welcome the idea of that we would look how we work together and as we 've done in the training agreement we 've just basically ratified what we had previously and things around public passenger transport for example shared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at but I think we do need to understand his accounts of discrete work program and how that fits into what else we 're doing in the board of content yeah there 's a fair comment indictment of it 's probably more for me to comment on rather than acting chief executive as I 'm the council 's representative on the mayoral forum so I will certainly take that on board there as a mirror for a meeting tomorrow so i will indicate them as i think i undertook last time that i would indicate to them that I no longer have any authority to speak to them on any matter rather then unless it 's been through the counsel fees so I think that 's been made pretty clear I think that 's good i think what we 've got is we 've got a piece of work that 's being done which i 'm not clear about what its purposes so we 've got circulated the report but what I don 't understand is what is the process from here on in to actually respond to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's my responsibility to do there to know apologize i 'm i 'm sure i forgot to do it just the second question as I 'm really I 'm really concerned over the courier wide mitigation with we 're told on page 318 for help demolition so these demolitions our head things it 's his staff of our Syria organizer briefing for Council I 'm just not sure how long we wait it 's already been in the media so have you got any timeframe for that and in the second part of that that Christian last time was when is the report coming back I know you 're saying it 's going to be an April I really think that that 's far too late as we know neighborhoods and communities are being demolished on the port hills and and I think it would be really helpful that she identify areas where there 's a possibility of here at web mitigation much of this work is already being done and I think just continuing to work with Sarah doesn 't it doesn 't give me any confidence given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know how can we actually as a council work out the areas that we think it 's feasible and then go to Sarah and government and say look this is what we think rather than kind of have limbs and soon to be leading a process which is taking too long and means that we 're missing out on these opportunities there 's there any way to fast-track this is basically on-site and for us to take more leadership on the second one first I think the port hills working arrangements have worked well as working together because we do have different responsibilities so I my advice would be don 't disturb that now in terms of the getting there any faster it is frustrating i know for everybody and especially for those who either live lead or want to live there but we keep getting new information and there is still information to come march is next week for a workshop and then followed by a report so I guess I 'm saying I don 't think we can speed it up without I don 't think we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Syria and ask for a time frame but if I may what is the information that you require from Sarah that we actually will the community haven 't already got my understanding is there 's been a number of geotech consultants that have looked at mitigation options and the port holds and the people that made the presentation had a very detailed presentation about a very what looked like a relatively straightforward simple request to save her no I think was up to about twelve houses with some pretty localized mitigation I don 't understand why this is taking so long and what new information we need to start identifying these areas I 'll go back and see if I can give you a clearer explanation can we come back to this at the earthquake recovery committee of the whole so perhaps if I could ask you Jane to have a full report to the next meeting because i think that the concern that council Johansson us as raising as a valid one the the complexity of what has occurred is added to by the government 's decision to red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be green zone diff the mitigation proposals had gone ahead at the outset would that be a fair comment um yeah i mean i think that the factors that you could do mitigation and you could actually save people being over saved stay in their houses and then their communities is really important so you can mitigate the risk yeah we know that lots of this work has already been done so you know i think them i think sarah or the government have taken a view that they would not do mitigation we as a council who are funding fifty percent of what 's happening in the port hills it seemed to be not being able to make any traction around identifying areas I just you know I think it 's more fundamental than that we 're spending our money doing what they want without giving effect to what we 've asked for so i will put the matter on the agenda for the committee of the whole which is next week no pressure no pressure no pressure next week yani is it all right and i think if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deputation to explain really what 's what works being done sons that would also be really helpful I don 't know that that can be done in the time frame but let 's put it on the agenda for next week which gives us a clear timeframe for reporting back to the committee of the whole plain cotton my questions on a similar line just regarding the flockton basin in the flooding and we have a time and date to be confirmed for a urgent briefing so we 've us for that two weeks ago and I do appreciate the complexity of this and I know it 's going to be a tricky one but light Yanni can we hear an update on the time for that please even if it 's a briefing to tell us if it again that it might actually be better because I know that the I know that the work that 's been done with the community is quite you know significant in terms of the briefings in there and the Russian you know that the news-leader that went out to them as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the agenda for the meeting next week they could actually come and do the briefing here with everything up on the screen and people would be able to see exactly what was going on on the flockton rockton cluster area thank you not the basin yeah I know but I mean I think I think they have a preference not to be referred to as such there any other questions for Jane Jonny the question that came through into into parts of the runner after our call center the the question really was around are we looking at being able as part of new justice and emergency precinct to look at an after-hours emergency call center so you know even it kind of hasn 't been captured in the response I 'm really concerned that you know we went to palmerston north on the basis that they didn 't have great risk they had a big earthquake when we needed it it wasn 't able to use I think the idea of having a strategic after hours call center in Christchurch that could possibly service the South Island around you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of scenes but because we haven 't been involved in the justice and emergency creasing and because we 're not involved in the decision for the after its call center I don 't know how we as a council at a governance people say that this is something we want looked at yeah I don 't think it 's right to say that the council hasn 't been involved in the justice precinct council council yes I know but there is a governance issue and you are right I thought that that that question was incorrect but I couldn 't remember what the question was so thank you for bringing that back we will give respond to that next time i would just said it 's a simple guess because it 's obvious that in a resilient building a level 4 so what your call yeah it is illegal for ya that you would do that but i 'll come back and yeah confirm I think we 've had a briefing either on the justice and emergency precinct over we having briefings on all of the anchor products as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been turned on yeah and i think the designs already been done so i think it would be really useful um because my concern is that you 're doing after hours contract that will prohibit us from being able to do that strategic well put that thing in so you know there 's a short-term issue and then i guess a lot of a launch industry if that 's your main concern will make sure we don 't preclude ourselves from doing that if we go into any arrangements yep excellent right okay well put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed they know it 's carried,"(-43.5320214,

Matters - Part 1,y0XTHmTNEhs,20140213,774.33,"Christchurch, New Zealand",2319,who are declared the meeting open and we are now on to item 24 item number 24 as the report of the meeting of the chief executive and employment metas committee and the resolution well I 'll move that the council seek a full feasibility study and time to inform the long term plan over the implications of implementing living wage etc do I have a seconder for that who Phil Clearwater is there any discussion Jamie golf firearm for living wage drunk and you 're just removing the committee recommendation there yep I actually sorry it does he want asking questions I was just going to go into the beige but yeah just countered debate yeah be all right okay sure Jory estándar with nothing oh I don 't care she I mean it was a previous standing order i mean it 's currently standing orders but i would like to exhibit amazing orders them i 'd like to agree i 'd like to exempt the meeting for those that want to sometimes things are important and you want to get up and stand and speak to them so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an interesting report I I supported the report being prepared and around the feasibility of the living wage you know I of course like the idea of the living wage and the people on lower pay rates receive more aging is a great idea i supported the report being written because it spells on black and white the tangible implications are i think is terribly important in decision-making particularly when it 's when it 's rate payer money that 's that 's at stake I 'll for caution back then though around what the report would say and this is exactly what what I actually cautioned that it would and that can probably be for only two reasons 1i am either a clear and can see the future or 22 I just understand some basic commercial realities now the fact of matter is I 'm not clairvoyant unfortunately but the commercial realities around us and what concerns me is not not the intent around it necessarily or or what it 's trying to achieve because i actually think that 's quite Noble and I do support that but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laws of physics and it 's with every action is an equal and opposite reaction and when you increase outgoings which wages are your bottom line or the amount that you have to spend it 's going to be adversely affected proportionately so everything else that we need to do is this compromises direct result of it you know a lovely idea to pay council workers who are on the most basic pay grades more money but that comes out of the back pocket of every ratepayer it isn 't funded by a magical theory with bottomless pockets you know I also see and the report actually sums up really well there are a number of in my opinion nonsensical implications that occur as a direct result of it such as putting apprentices on the same pay rate as as workers that have spent five years doing the same job or actually four years three years two years and the flow-on effects for that worry me and that 's not necessary covered at at stage one but as time goes on I think it would be fair for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time that I 've put in there so I think that it 's just an ongoing flow-on effect which again it 's the ratepayers which worries me which worries me most you know you look at on the young guy that that works cleaning and cleaning some dishes on a week in for some pocket money for the council there and the simple fact is I don 't believe that they 're going to pay them eighteen dollars 40 per hour what they 'll do is they 'll fire the guy so I think giving giving the break to it to young chap that wants to earn a bit of pocket money it 's actually quite a positive thing and I think that the implications of this are that you end up actually losing the people that you 're trying to help you know it means that those brakes aren 't going to be given to the people but Jamie Jamie I 'm just going to interrupt because this this debate could go on for hours if we 're all going to put up our opinions on the result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on whether the council should seek a full feasibility study including investigating different options of implementation and ensuring that we meet our obligations under the local government heat which was spelt out to us in the and the report so rather than focusing on whether we agree with it with the implementation in one way is you know but which could be an outcome could we focus on whether we should go down the street and I assume that what we 're saying is that because you you you think that the outcome you you wouldn 't support one of the outcomes that we shouldn 't do the feasibility study and if we could stick to that debate then I think we could deal with this quite quickly like I mean I 'm not there no no to be honest in saying why I guess to bring it back to that I feel that that we 've we 've had an idea that was that was brought to the council and we 've gone down paths we had a report prepared around it which which outlined the financial implications with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go a step further watch which is captured and the recommendation there and to be perfectly honest you know it 's it 's along the lines of the netball courts for me you know I don 't know what the point isn 't spending more money just to get more of what we already know and that with every dollar that you put up here as a dollar that comes down here so you know I would just simply say the reason why I 'm not going any further with us is because I don 't have an answer to this question that that why a cleaner who works really hard cleaning the floor of the hospital should have to subsidize someone that does the exact same job but just happens to work for the council and it comes out of the event pocket so in my in my opinion I think that it 's continuing on a path financial lunacy and we just need to be financially prudent more than ever right now so I just want to I want to stop this here we 've had the report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would come up with and and i 'm really interested more in cutting out cloth accordingly as opposed to finding ways to spend more money when we can least afford it so I 'd foreshadow the motion with the staff recommendation by voting against the committee recommendation rev did you want to did you have your hand up I 'm sorry I thought you had your hand up to speak on this nope yani um thank you and i will send up because i do think this is actually a really important thing that we 're considering here this isn 't actually what the council asked for we asked for a feasibility study this is a sort of initial report and i think if you are at the employment NCO subcommittee or committee you would have heard from people around just the extent of this report there 's a number of areas that this report has not looked into that actually should be considered as part of a full feasibility that seems like staff turnover the cost of retraining staff in the cost of investing and staff but then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunities they looked at some international cities around the world we 're living wage had been bought in and there are actually huge financial benefits to some of those cities so I don 't think we can just dismiss this as for some reason just having a financial cost when we haven 't looked at all the factors that should be going in to it I appreciate that you know staffer brought back an initial you know calculation basically but it does seem to miss on some of the more social and community benefits that could be attached to paying people a living wage a productive workforce a workforce that can actually afford to look after their families a workforce that stays on longer in a workforce that we invest in and we get good good good returns from so you know this is a start but I do support the idea that we should take more time come up with a considered approach I think the worst thing we could do is rushed to implement something without looking at how we achieve it and a sustainable basis rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on how your budget is but the factors that it was talked about by councillor goth around the issue of subsidisation from one cleaner from a hospital to a council actually if you read this report well this report effectively as saying that the huge huge subsidies that we give to professional sports through V base is more important than paying people a living wage that the viable commercial model of V base that supports and subsidizes to a huge extinct professional sport in our city and in our region as has a higher value than paying someone the amount that they would need to live on to support their families and support themselves and I just do not accept that I do not accept that that sort of cross subsidization there 's a sort of society that I want to love it I also think we should reflect on the percentage of increases that people are getting in our society could we please or at least I am trying to get everyone to take the same way just stick to the subject about feasibility service I know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so the final point I wanted to make is I do think there 's an incredibly important piece of work that this hopefully well look at as it 's not just about paying the people on the bottom more it 's actually around having a greater equality of how the increases and pay go across the board so the people the factors that in the last few decades the people on the top of beginning huge increases comparative to the people on the bottom who have been getting in real terms less and less and less and I think that is an issue that we need to look at around how do we make sure that we 're living in a fair and just society and paying people what I think is a fair living wage so you know I do think it 's more work to be done please support this feasibility study he 'll clear water well into its for the feasibility study I 'd have to say it 's more than an idea as councillor Goths is you said like 20 cities throughout the world have already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning and their economy developed Wellington City have adopted it and the whole point about it it 's not an overnight thing by any means it 's a step-by-step gradual consideration of how in fact not only our council can can adopt the living wage but in fact eventually that the whole city in the whole of New Zealand so it 's it and I 've got i do feel very strongly that if we were in the position of getting a salary or wage that is lower than a like then eighteen dollars fifty and that 's above the minimum wage we would be thinking about it differently it ties in very much to what we 've heard the other day about the cost of housing about the full ability of reeds and all of that so I strongly support the feasibility study entertainer I 'll just keep it very very brief I believe the living wage is important and particularly in a city where we 've got escalating rents and escalating property prices my belief is that if we pay our people well then we will attract and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a very good idea which is proven elsewhere that 's been brought to us and I believe that as a as an exemplar employer as an employer who has a significant number of people in the city working for us we we 've got an obligation to at least consider this we should be aspiring to pay a living wage so the next step is to get this feasibility study done and for that reason I 'll be supporting this today alright i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no would you like your vote recorded technical thank you very much that 's click carried we 'll move on to the,"(-43.5320214,

Martin 's up our toy library makes other things as far as I 'm aware they 're the largest toy library in the South Island and they are one of many community groups that had to move between temporary premises post-quake they have had to move five times I think another time and he going to break and and that highlight submit a need for the use of the distribution center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our board before as a potential site for housing community groups and finally i want to point you to item 13 and 20 that features lincoln road eddington as many of our reports do just want to point out that the borders remains very strongly opposed to additional four laning of lincoln road so we thinking we have a severely d 'être me to effect on the increasing social capital there and i want to point to the impact of bronze direct going through well from Sidon and Eddington and the 1970s and what a negative effect that is head and it 's more important this is in question thank you who would like to move that I think Thomas can dress on Phil clearwater county is there a plan to fall i 'm looking right into tia is as i 'm aware as planned to make continue four-laning both ways down thinking right from hagley f2 that 's that 's our fear we haven 't confirmed that there will be for learning from that stuff from whiteley ever clarence street to through to the city but that 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice on this because I didn 't know it was state highway 1 sorry what was the headdresses okay so this is in the three-year plan that was signed off last year we don 't have a tenure I don 't have a 10-year plan at the moment why would NZTA be doing it it 's not we 're just it 's a mistake it 's not NZTA as the council yep and I I have been under the impression there 's a sense ETA that has been pushing that they can only do it on the road so it 's not the road there 's good news as far as a community boards created well no because the council previously had it on its agenda so presumably it will come up on the long-term planning process which begins again this year so be aware well the good news tenant is there an area-wide traffic management plan for editor that 's been ripped off we have asked for an area right a white truck metric plan there 's no parking plan has worked on by formally communicable chippers and Clearwater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic management planning looking at that the wider area around Middleton as well but i am not aware of an overall management plan okay like is there a need for one should we pass a resolution to get one at just I I mean there 's so much development happening here that it to me it seems I could need to have a stick look at I 'd right to take Phil clearwater fish because I think to resolve what you 're referring to Yanni the second important plan that might be a be extended to include this this part on lincoln road that 's all but there are I guess step by step management plans and for referring to a wider one for the whole hillmorton eddington area preps they do need to be joined up including Middleton exactly yes hmm am Tim just to get rid of the four-laning of lincoln road if you go and look at the corner of our Lincoln Road where it meets whiteley over Barrington Street it 's four lane and logic would say that if you 've got halls or road going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is would be a plan somewhere to expand the rest of it from between white liev and Morehouse Eve that 's been spoken to it and talked about for a long time and I think Paul raised the concern of what brands treated especially to wealth and which I know personally but also Eddington and others has certainly changed those and environments quite direct drastically with regards to attribute management plan for the entire area I 'd be surprised if there was one because when we talked to NZTA with regards to extending the southern motorway into Brown Street we we took out one satellites to basically bring the first satellites within the southern motorway comes in to Christchurch on to sell one Street and look at the me status say thank you so how do we how do we get NZTA and the council and elected members involved in this kind of planning process so where do we wear to work I mean okay but but how do we progress it you know I mean it 's it 's an issue that needs further we know question so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on on what the what the process will be in order to address these because that they are now quite complex and some of them are exacerbated temporarily but temporary is going to be a long time so it does need some careful thought about how we manage traffic flows and these areas because they will calm down once other things happen but as I say that could be years away a lot of work has been done on parts of it you only referred to the positive to hold traffic management plan for the whole area and I 'm just wondering if information was seeking if in fact that might be able to advise a future traffic management plan for the whole area so we join it up so once we get information as to how we do it we look at bit skating for Jane to bring the information to council about where we 've got to and a suggested process for how we progress it but thank you very much for bringing that yep the issue that you raised about community groups not having places to operate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean the one by beckenham library have the abacus that it 's very good yeah it still has a big crane for moving parts in it debt at what you know was bought for the old purpose of the it currently houses paper items for distribution around the city it 's essentially a warehouse that 's a warehouse in its I mean I would say it is that the footprint of it would be four hundred square meters and you 're probably about four or five hundred convince your community board done any work on the relocation of the warehouse aspect so that the building could be used differently we have had discussions the council clearwood and was involved with full counselor Corbett around this issue but there has been raised that the rear housing of those items there 's no reason why it has to be at Columbus tree though at one stage there it was really looked at very hard and because of that being a warehouse rather rather than a sort of purposeful building there I understand my recollection is there was a decision by suit in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get a report on the feasibility of a purpose-built building in the land adjacent to in south of that distribution center that 's my recollection I 'm not sure with it report has got to it 's all kakima can we get use Jane 's report to get an update on that are getting an update on the issue will get really useful because I mean if there 's a solution that we can find I mean you know we you know brief yeah but yeah accommodations really really there 's a lot of pressure on community groups for that reason and not just of availability but of price so if we can assist in that regard than I should but retrofitting warehouses is not always as easy as it sounds but then again some community groups are actually quite happy with the sort of kind of almost funky retro look of a of a warehouse environment that you know might be quite different to what they 'd imagined would be their office accommodation or their facilities accommodation in the past I 'm also concerned about their access to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other issues that you raised around there and I think that might be also worthwhile to put on the list of things to report back on sorry my understanding is that report you were coming to this wonderful way of finding out where things are up to can I just check you my understanding is that that report is due to the board it may be your next meeting oh I don 't I don 't know that it is coming I 've who did it might may be coming it 's it 's not coming to the next board meeting well I 've just got a list of things that are coming but I know that it is being discussed but if we have we 've got it on on Jane 's list she can just give us a quick update as to where is it up to and and that that i think would certainly satisfy us so there any other questions I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you very much,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Region,m2O2IBAxdkE,20140213,679.16,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1708,thank you and we dealt with item 21 so now we 're up to item 22 the training agreement between local authorities and the King degree region with someone like to move the recommendation I 'll move the recommendation David East will second it is there any discussion yani I don 't quite understand the financial that says there 's no financial implications piece of staff Nemeth you when you when you read it actually does give quite a lot of power to do a few things in terms of our work streams and so I just I do find it a little bit weird that the Canterbury Merle for example has the power to levy for any and all of its objects and such a mouth that are mutually determined and acceptable so yeah you know this the scrapers doing a lot of work I presume I don 't have any sense of what the organizational pressure is on the organization to provide support to this way that living would have to be agreed by the individual local councils before it could be living have to come back it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as it 's mutually determined and acceptable to individual local authority so we have to sign off on it before they could levy ends but I guess if you look at the chief executive forum is doing a lot of work around collaboration but I kind of wonder whether we need to be doing that at a government level and and how will how will be doing that in terms of things like the representation review and things like public transport so with the mural forum is about establishing and maintaining close liaison with other local government networks to ensure as far as possible in pursuit of common objectives and the minimization of duplication establishing and maintaining close liaison with ministers of crown and local MPs establish and maintain local close so where is it that we don 't do what you sang oh sorry so like for example that always 2013 Makri wandering code paper like what is that what does that mean for us as an organization sorry refuse my age 42 page wat do what we run where I want to go 22 sorry 142 I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think you know if it would be nice for at an early stage for us to kind of give a signal to the areas where we want to look at collaborating but I don 't I mean I don 't have a sense of how we we basically say these are the things we want you to regress what I get a sense of which happened with EK and the way he can got disband it was the mirror form we 'd often did all the work and organize to get rid of the elected he can and I don 't want that to happen again yeah I 've anything to one yep the purpose of this agreement is to set the basis for doing things there 's only been one since LeAnn has been elected from memory in the last term I 'm not sure that the mayoral forum meetings were reported back to cancel it will change so i 'll thank you that is true that is true that is true and it was the time and yeah yeah we were not given enough time to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their it again well no we do need to agree with you about process and and we were placed in the position because of the timing of the review and the fact that there was only one mayoral forum meeting between the time that we were elected and within a matter of days we 're not a matter of days of the election but but at the first mayoral forum meeting we had to we had to basically state our position about where we would where we would be so and what the government is planning to do is to undertake a put out a discussion paper with various options and so what I made sure was that there was an option in there of going to full elected representation at the next generally next council election because what I was concerned about was that the discussion paper wouldn 't include the option of having the hybrid 55th or whatever whatever the hybrid Azad and appointed and that their option would be the option for 2016 if we didn 't have a midterm election to bring in the hybrid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 2016 which is the expectation of the people of this region the expectation that people of this region was that they would have elections last year for 18 positions and they didn 't I guess an essence what I 'm concerned about is we 're giving away a lot of power to a group of people to do things that represent some quite important strategic directions without a process by which the mandate comes from the elected county I agree and if I had said that I would bring it back to Council then we wouldn 't have say yeah so i apologize i agree that the process was not ideal for that what we need to figure out with me taking some leadership on the matter is how do i make sure that i communicate to other councillors that in future i will not be making any decisions or contributing to any debate until i 've discussed the issue with the council thank you and yes the final question is on page one four one what is the Canterbury local government strategy and policy forum that we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have come back and so we can understand what what it actually does I have no idea because I do worry that we 've got Sarah we 've got council we 've got you des we 've got recovery strategic we cancel groups we 've got all these decision-makers with all these different sets of objectives for the region without any clear understanding about a common agreed objective and it seems like there 's too many groups it 's a bit like the met you you like to show about it k recover I think it comes from the the Peter that the McGrady wonder Co paper which talks about a far more collaborative approach but this is not that the Canterbury local government strategy and policy forum is not just Mears that 's actually about the council 's and he can working collaboratively around strategy and policy so that we are an effective combined voice when dealing with central government that 's that 's what it 's about and it 's not really about earthquake recovery it 's about our approach on local government like the local government act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minute our submission on its how do we work strategically as a region so that we are an effective voice for our region when we 're dealing with central government zone 5 and we are so well because actually you may not have noticed but Auckland now is an incredibly a full voice when it speaks to central government and I think the idea is that we should operate as collaboratively as we can so that the focus is on our region all the time not an exclusion to others but so that we don 't get left behind that 's the purpose behind it I don 't know I don 't know where the counselors have actually been given a copy of the mccready wondering co paper would that be helpful yeah so could we circulate a copy of that paper to everyone it is I have actually read that paper and it is very good but it talks about us collaborating in terms of our relationship the central government 's got nothing to do with it quite recovery to do with the region roads very something anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's to do with our region so so I will I will certainly communicate our councils position to the next meeting and I do apologize for adopting the position that i did on a keen prior to bringing it to counsel but otherwise we wouldn 't have had our position known well my position known at all i had to adopt a position brought home that they only consult with the mirrors to get a mandate for a region so that 's why i 'm really cautious because it 's a very deliberate strategy from government to only consult with form ears as somehow being representative of the wider cities and the populations which I feel really I know the history and I 'm assuring you that I simply made the decision because otherwise it wouldn 't they would not have had that particular option and put up now I don 't know whether the government will put it in the discussion paper or not but I certainly hope that they do because I think all options should be on the table as we think about the future of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually been critical of the processes that government dot they put you in that situation it was yeah I mean I think it 's it was the it was the the timing and I and I do I personally agree with you that the timing really didn 't take into account that that there were new councils and new me is being elected with no history in terms of the the way things ought to be so I will take all of that on board I 'd like to put the motion or those in favor say aye those opposed say no Carrie thank you the next item,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

December 2013,sEfqOLAneH4,20140213,625.799,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1530,oh you 're not um 109 which does see that 's it oh it 's it 's a just a little a road yeah corridor item so my apologies for not being no no no no that we you know we 've got to this little later than the important expected so would you like to move the the recommendation yes I 'll with the recommendation and 6.1 and seconded by Oh Phil Clearwater there any discussion Yanni um I think this is the stretch of road we every tree got clear fell since going it not sure the only I count the corner okay we can add staff me but assist with us play okay can I just raised the issue that I 'm really concerned at the number of trees that seem to be getting knocked down in this area there 's some very well established trees and I just think it 's but I am really concerned so you can I just ask staff to consider how they can minimize the loss of mature trees and also as they recycle it doesn 't look like there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being provided or not I 'm John 's right well my understanding that mirrors there 's a show there is a meter gap between the you 've got the pavement you 've got the other Road then you 've got some grass boom and then you 've got a meter and a 3.5 traffic lane a 3.5 traffic lanes so that we 're putting cycles right next to with the big trucks are going okay I just think the UM it kind of seems really silly to be putting a cycleway next to where you 've got oversized heavy vehicles that will regularly be using this piece of road and not actually put it on the area where you 've got the slower traffic and so do we have any say in this can we is there anything we can do to try and bring some logic to what 's being proposed this is not the item that we are discussing what we 're discussing is that the put that put that proposing to provide a residential service road as part of their Western Corridor upgrade and it requires seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Christchurch City Council and as part of the proposals that constructing the road at their own cost before the bee sting so this is not a discussion about what 's happening on the eastern coral but I guess is an issue when we 're vesting right that 's a bit like that I don 't want to pick up noble because I hate bringing goggle up but it 's a bit like when we 're this thing or green two roads in our area where you 've got really kind of designs that don 't make any sense why wouldn 't you try and get a better design can I suggest that that 's something perhaps we take up with the transport committee because as meant the mirrors mentioned this is related to the residential being so if we can then by ramin fly beg your pardon just so we can the question is could the cycleway in this area be placed in the in the area that 's being the student council so this is an access road it 's going the other way it 's an access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the West on parallel if i read that wrong no that was my understanding met Amir I wonder if just in terms of this though that in dta wants something from us they are building a Western Corridor the design of which on page 109 does have cars hard up against trucks which is staffed and I wonder when we go back to them and say hey yes we 're fine with us but here 's the thing when you build roads actually physically separate the cycles from the tracks and the cars please yeah they 've almost completed it yeah sorry I Drive yeah that lets the brute I used to go to the airport and it 's pretty much done except they 're now going to do an overpass but sure I know alright I 'll pop that up i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no carried there was one other issue to that i did want to raise and that was 4.3 which is in part b and we had a deputation from Emmett wattle and Jonathan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regards to the community facility that a zone Colombo Street this was built as a transitional facility by lions there has been some tension between the residents association and the council pre prior to the earthquakes the community center was essentially run by the residents association and it was some suggestion that Lions wanted this to be run by the council however the more decided as you 'll see here to write to the Lions Club to explore the possibility of the center being handed back to the two Sarah this and all those residents association look for them to manage and we had had a response from the lions club and they have said they hope that the use of the facility reflects the need of the community they will not oppose any strategy that we the community board that is wants to negotiate with counsel for optimum community access so that 's something that we will be exploring further with regards to the Center it 's ripped very helpful so about the I thought we dealt with it how about weeks it 's additional to the report neighbor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me so we 've got now that the reporters a whole be adopted but shelly jones is moving and that 's being taken really really simple question I understand now looping and all sorts of new verbs but what is talking of buses your host where is that on page 113 at the bottom or with your super Stop side going to write to EK and to ask about the talking of buses but I just like to know what it is before talking well isn 't that the angle of the tooling well just give me the number again sorry ok right at the bottom of page 113 right right the issue there is that the when the buses because of the way the bus stops are by the houses cars are coming down pepper nuit road towards the city if you like and people who are pulling into their driveways are coming up alongside the buses signaling to pull into their driveways the buses can 't see them and pull out and there have been some near misses with the buses pulling out which i think is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what talking is come on yeah it can someone sick in the motion we can discuss it bill clearwater yani Christian I mean um the board 's funding a foot clinic at a church I just couldn 't quite understand okay well that we were that was raised and talked about as well because initially there were some concerns expressed by a local podiatrist particularly around health and safety if this is good not going to be a and that that was a fair comment as well and we discussed it and it was confirmed that essentialist as a community service to create connections for the community to have a cup of tea there is a health issue to check people 's feet there isn 't any cutting or breaking of skin to this little potential for there to be any health and safety issues if there were problems noticed by the people who are doing this then they would be referred to health specialists to take care of it right so this is kind of like a community development type initiative by very much it 's you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at your feet sadly the walls none of it when I visited site yeah the only that the super stop site visit I was just a little bit concerned around some of the issues there that you 've sort of having to deal with their including the disposal receptive course for cigarettes and additional rubbish buns because they were both issues that were raised in the record on section so can you just make sure that the community board reports on the report that you receive because I really would like to see what happens with their yep all right i 'll put the motion that the report as a whole be adopted all those in favor say aye those opposed say no carried sprayed in health care community board,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Royd and somerville as to whether any authority approved the intersection so we 're still awaiting that once we get there that will come back to the committee and then on to counsel the questioners as the road safe and at present it seemed not to be safe but hopefully some answers but be provided there a third issue as the record home transport hub which you have dealt with in the previous meeting and can I say you dealt with it well in my view the only last one is broomfield common and that is linked to the nobles the subdivision issue not just sketch get out for you there 's a council reserved called broomfield common it at borders new housing development and enterprise homes who 's one of the developers of the three in that section where noble was actually involved the Environment Court said to three developers in 2005 this is the way you must build the road everybody agreed signed off on it and noble came back with a subdivision and as you know the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frustrated with that and it made an application to put a road through broomfield common which is a council reserve it was originally thought that community board members could hear this but there has it has been decided there 's a conflict of interest for board members who attended meeting with residents and potentially a conflict of interest for board members who have actually dealt a lot with Colin Stokes from noble subdivision so that I think will go to the environment committee to make a judgment on that I just wanted to give you at a background so it does tie in with noble subdivision so there 's frustrations everywhere on on this issue so that 's that 's my report madam men right so we 've got three meetings of the robot return agency yeah welcome with graham community board and assuming that Jimmy chin is moving yeah i 'm going to keep to a question Jimmy chin is mo bang as Betty back prepared to sit in the motion thank you so the machine to questions that i would like to ask a start first one we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to subdivision my understanding dust mites the staff already received independent consultant assessment report and also designers response and distributed to the older community board members also the in the last month tongue solar meeting I asked the start you know whether this all information with the staff recommendation were presented to the commune upon s communal stop come from yes but I 'm revealed on next Tuesday a team of favor with a cameo meeting agenda I didn 't siddur this the agenda in a communal meeting so I just want to know when this report will be presented to the lexa community for meeting this first third ok enjoy discussion didn 't because the Civic amiable meeting agenda I didn 't see here right second that is regarding to the chapter 16 and the paragraph 3 point of why the hell and she mention earlier regarding tricks and passenger the transport hub i remember in december the council meeting we first start to review the lease the issue can report back to the the council as soon as the possible with the summer alternative way so just want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report I don 't have that I don 't have the resolution from that meeting here this is the Riccarton but this is the best oh yeah yes I sympathy symbol comes on meeting December council just 10 home free there I haven 't got the motion on the front of me so what I just thought that I thought we were going to have it dealt with between I can 't remember that was the Environment Committee in and I can or whether there was going to be a workshop what they can i thought we said that we would work with he can too but there 's the second the issue this over order you know cities way the public transport is kind of me beautiful but we got into the victim bus stop we depressed and ripping yet the resolution stated the council requests to report urgently on other options for the record on bus interchange hub so so the question agent Lee is when are we getting that and the second one is the council restates that the council Environment Canterbury and the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passenger network early in 2014 so when is that being established and in fact I 've had a call this morning from the from a can asking wind betters appearing because they they seem to think that we have made a decision to do something other than have a workshop but actually we directed that a workshop be held at the last meeting and December last year but when when when is the public transport working party meeting to discuss this but I think that he can believe that it 's that that the Council believes that it now can deal with it at that level whereas that is not the case the council has directed a workshop take place so if they 're if they 're meeting has to be held in order to set up a workshop it seems to me that it 's adding to a delay rather than actually facilitating the holding of an workshop early in 2014 I 'm very mindful of the fact that our time has been stretched with the requirements of the district plan review and the annual plan absolutely no problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ February but need to have a March date for it as soon as possible thank you yes so when are we getting a report back well it would have to be available for the workshop yep okay so that 's dealt with your questions that 's great

Albans who 'd been trying to get a group of trees protected since 2004 and they would cap down another guy anonymously giving on an x3 and Peggy Kelly she was in tears for two days and couldn 't speak so this is this is how important trees out of us in the city and I think it would be quite good if we could actually revisit that at some point when it 's appropriate well I think I think you 've raised it a very important point and it 's a little bit like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ application and fees and various criteria that have to be meet getting a mosque and I 'll sort of say that 's another branch of council but there you go can 't help myself and but the but I think it is important that we get a tree policy back on the agenda this is the time to do it so rather than wait because we 've got significant we 're going on in the city and so if we are going to address these issues that might be better to do so on a you know a policy seating that actually reflects the position that we run today rather than we we were three years ago are there any other grisham johnny under page 23 6.2 low-income strokes um was the board had concerns over the quality of what was it angle was that just kind of a general presentation I yes we had had a complaint about the length of the grass and and burnside park and um other people had over council people staff had had complaints about some of the length of the glass in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that staff are very aware of horse Binhammer I think because I levels of service have been reflecting this as well and I know that there 's other places around that counts as have I don 't know if the ca has taken could take a particular interest in ensuring that this is look them to it 's just you know it does concern me to see some of the Lincoln maintenance and some of the parks and you know I know we 've got contract monitoring in place but clearly it 's not working otherwise we wouldn 't be giving I don 't think no mowing is often as I used to be my blanket that 's a conversation we need to have through the annual plan drop down you 're playing around the levels of service of mowing our parks if that 's changed do not think we just need to be up front with our communities yeah thank you Tim I would actually like to get an understanding of the contracts and how they work because of Delta three requests and her in hay and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parks and when I went and saw one of them it was actually particularly long which I was surprised about but it 's not only just dead it 's also overhanging branches on footpaths etc and so I 'd actually really like a review or just an understanding of how that is operating because we 've also got to assure that only clerk preserve it and how that 's managed as well so thank you for bringing up very good when I put the that the three reports be received all those in favor say aye those opposed say no it 's carried thank you very much,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

questions that people have and I think we 've got all I haven 't now I 've presumed David East would like to move the motion that the two reports we deal with them both together that the two reports be received and who would like to second that motion Phil Clearwater yep um who is there paranoid community leadership group I 'm sort of i know you 've got actors that the air annoyed community leadership group is the school 's the score proposal what 's the mystery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i think there 's about six people select chosen from the community to do the consultation around what the management structure of the new school that 's about the musical I just yeah it 's sort of like this emerging thing that all these groups have these names that don 't really reflect what they are which I think leads to a lot of confusion like you know if people look at their you 'd have no idea apart from the word campus that it had anything to do with the schools and I know we 've got other different planning processes etc um is it do you have any idea where no likely to come up with a decision that the group have already reported back to hiccup router and so that that group is essentially becoming defunct I think they are still going to sort of linger at an official group but their formal role has ended okay so maybe if we could get some information about I think it really useful to us we actually meet with the minister last Friday and she mentioned that the report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it could have been more usefully called the ordinary community education leadership group but it was established for the purposes of leading a community consultation and it 's and it 's been the best process that I 've seen so far in any of the education decisions that have been made so that 's to be congratulated enough I know all of the community groups were engaged in it I 've been on the email list they 've used email they 've used social media they 've used public meeting the argue is the locus groups have just it 's been a really broad based and I believe that they 've really captured the essence of what the community is looking for it 's great well I presume that they 've reported to the administer they were established by the minister to report to hear but but she 's very open to engaging with us it was a great meeting on Friday any no weed no we didn 't um Tim Baker and I both applied to go on the group but obviously there was political well that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lead-up to the group getting going they did to consult with a wider group of the community and I was involved in an early stage of their group empathy I teamed up with them sort of unofficially because avondale school were very alienated by the process and they were having a lot of trouble engaging with that community they were having meetings in one parent was turning up so I sort of worked alongside them to try and facilitate greater engagement in inside yes in a way I had a fair amount of input and to and to that on behalf of the opened our community anyway yeah I mean it hasn 't been an easy process because you know one school kind of sits outside the ordinary area and and I think in many respects that the floor going into the process has been how people ended up on that crazy so tetra but but be that as it may it 's still such as the best example of what you can do with the community and their situation I went to the feedback meeting that they gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copy of that sort of feedback session that would be named in the slides and things that were presented it may not be the exact wording that lead to the counter I 'm going to stop it it 's the the gist of what came out of the commutation Vicky buck yep we 've just marginally related and one of the things that we 're just waiting for a two-page report on all that we know about the current schools and then what we intend to do is have a meeting with the ministry of education so that they can tell us exactly what they 're intending is happening to every school space because as you know and every other community board member knows there is huge demand for community groups who could possibly be housed in the next year or so on school space and we actually don 't yet know as counselors what 's happening on every school space so that will be happening quite so it was very frustrating for the whole community not not knowing in any decision making processes it 's an atom peeping on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the motion now we 've got two meetings heaven way so that needs to also include the meeting of the eighteenth imaginings of November yep the central New Brighton port where you talk about the North your brother one that 's currently being used as the doll pool the central Eurasia one I believe that renew Brighton are in consultation with the ministry to get a lease to continue its availability but it hasn 't been signed off yeah yeah and they had been working with other community groups sports groups and particularly the surf lifesaving around around their proposal so it 's not not finalized they found animated deputation to the community board to that effect yep at yesterday 's over the summer they they trial day a dollar then we used it its remaining open it after open up two schools in the weekends as well for public use very good very good right big soap until the 28 of februari outside of school hours for the public usage and then it closes for the yeah it 's not a heat in poetry okay i 'll put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in

chief executive office report and I will fend over to Jane papa Thank You Man this is the second of these reports as you know what i have done is make any updates and read so so it 's easy to track but i think the an said to you last time must have been a couple of weeks ago that this was a bit of a work in progress and we would improve as we go what we 've decided to do is split the report into two with i essentially section 2 on rebuilding recovery going to the committee of the whole and the rest coming to this regular council meeting so that a month goes past for each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that I 'm just going to take it as read and take any questions okay well I 'll move the report be received seconded by the deputy mayor and so I 'll open it up for questions Pauline cover Thank You Jane I 'm just looking at the the update on the flood risk in the Dudley in and read you 've put a detailed briefing can be made available to all members could we please request one urgently we 've had more flooding last night down there and it 's that rain was actually quite short lived if we have a rain period of several days like we had in a June they 'll be out of their homes and we 've had Ellie and I 've both had a email from the fellow who was out of his home for 11 days last time and there beside themselves so it 's urgent that we work with other agencies and find a solution here so if we could request that you gently please it would be really helpful chica yeah um David east on the sections of building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know 589 resource consents are on hold and would it be could it could it be provided or it would be helpful if we could ever break down on whether these at the request of the applicant I just sort of parking it or or or the requiring further information the same with the building consents one as well and secondly just a question I suppose I 'd and 3.2 how long is the the name ellerslie contracted to that event a memory and I 'm looking along here I 'm from memory we have one after this event it 'll come back to cancel to make a decision on the future I think that 's right so that 's not I will correct myself via email but I think that 's that we were at yeah sorry if I 'm mo but just we have asked for a full review of the flower show to be done for the old council wanted to do it last year but we thought with a new council and given you need a long lead time between events we thought it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that the key point about Alice Lee actually as we did do some surveys last year about what people didn 't like and the staff and the organizers have been very I 'm hardworking and to putting more garden Sun and better quality exhibits and I think if you I know from talking to staff we 're doing we are doing very well in terms of ticket sales and people you know I think it will be a much better event then it than it has been previously that suit maybe feedback that I 've had so I know that from my perspective I think it 's really important that that process cut off straight away after the show so what what mechanism do we have in place to ensure that that happens it 's coming back to the community committee I 'm sure there 'll be specifics but certainly Jane can follow up the actual process of evaluation so it 's so much what would what would be really useful though is to have a reporting mechanism so that we formally kick off the process of the review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its efforts not in the system at this level then there isn 't a timetable that we can put in place so that there 's a report back to us it is in the system yeah but it 's yeah what yeah I 'll talk to you afterwards but but I think that what we need is to have it in this report straight after the Alice Lee flower show is to have the the mechanism that is in place and the timetable for reporting back yep are there any other questions Jimmy chin two questions the first one to one point of what the portal here regarding to the how much council you know spend to date to a outed for the heels the council apart either prove or four countries 34k whether color cover older you know resistance affected by the those that love waffle well that is your question will that cover all there is a day yeah yeah that 's what council have budgeted so not enough staff will have to come back and make a case to cancel okay so how many interesting effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to point of what the Inca project regarding to aesthetics check replacement before a reporter to LA counsel whether this report were beat up his Center to the community first I think this comes directly to cancel I remember last time they went to the Cameo up then have a you know the two amendment so I bonito back to a communal firstly I 'll follow up you don 't hassle please follow up thank you I 'm Jonnie R Hansen thank you several questions just come through two brief ones on terms of their major facilities no mention of the Metro sports facility I think we 're contributing 150 million sorry what page page two I think it 's pledged to its item to rebuild and recovery um we 've never had a full briefing on it I don 't know when we 're going to be involved in terms of design scope what because this is it being Cyril eat um there 's a requirement because listen I understand the requirement but it 's a syrah lead project what you 're saying is is that the Sierra lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think so absolutely yeah but i also think we need to get some visibility of what 's actually i think it 's got to be a secret item like Sara Lee reports around the anchor projects but it 's a very good point thank you I 'm the second one again the justice and emergency precinct no I don 't it 's a Sierra leaders know you know but all I 'm saying is is that this report hasn 't included the Sierra lead anchor projects you 've made an exceptionally good point the reports will include them in the future I 've asked Jane to divide this report and future and to two parts and one part will come to the to the committee of the whole and it will be focused specifically on the rebuilder shoes and this report will be much more generic than that so that we 've got the oversight of what 's going on in the current just because the brending at the Justice emergency precinct has no mention of City Council even though I understand we understand the problems yet the rock just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we 've asked how is progress going on there I 'm just really concerned that Sarah are ramping up the demolition process we haven 't been briefed on the demolitions and they 're potentially demolishing places that possibly with area wide community scale mitigation we could actually save and have people living in houses so here we got any timeframe or any information about we were out with that I know that the report is underway that you 've requested I 'll come back to earth when it 'll come in front of you yeah it 's I can 't emphasize how time critical it has given what Syria it says staff will arrange a briefing with Sarah staff involved in this project so that that is going to happen soon both what you 've asked for a good time yeah it 's a demolition stuff which sarah have ramped up and going quickly we passed a resolution to get some areas where we might do community-wide mitigation area-wide mitigation yeah ideally that should be done before the demolition star I 'm sorry and I hope in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost saving with I think about 54 million that was tagged for rock fall of borrowing that we 're not borrowing because we haven 't paid so I think it would be interesting to know in terms of the first item when we 're expecting that process to conclude and in this financial year whether inspecting any savings I would have thought there should be some considerable savings the final question I just had was on the after hours call center can you just remind me when that decision will be made and you know in terms of the resilience sitting network I know it 's a relatively new thing has there also been built into consideration that you know things like the opportunity to have a you know I guess a resilient call center in canterbury or in christchurch that could could you know kind of provide to due to services if you like that we you know the resilience city and also the local service that just seems that I mean again the rationale for Palmerston North was because we had earthquakes when we needed to use that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't actually help us so I would have thought the idea and you know being resilient you would possibly have some except lot but more local boy EQC had its back up call center and Brisbane but they didn 't think about flood taping at the same time yeah yeah but I 'm sorry there is never soon as that though up from memory I think it was March that we 're looking at because they become your points yeah I 'm just worried that the decision will be made I would have thought the possibility possibly and again we don 't heavy the justice and emergency precinct possibly you look at an after-hours call center with a new civil defense thing is going just an idea cool good idea it 's a very good idea Annie Jones oh please hold me sorry oh sorry now you 're right Vicki I just wanted to ask again on that same pay tree will damn recovery and the Performing Arts precinct entry there just for clarification has all the land being obtained for that is that basically ready to go just look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to her so that is a Sarah issue at the moment not account cilicia thank you and I had just two quick issues and I apologize to jenna sort of that you know beforehand but one is the the item on the Litchfield street car park and I 've been following this up as a result of a direct approach from some of the property owners in the area who are you know dependent on the council delivering on its car parking and and so the matter is now urgent and again with our comments and the and the paper this morning that reinforced that that the problem as I see it is that the subsequent assessment particularly at the Litchfield street car park has identified significant cost increases in terms of of its repair and and so I really want to re-emphasize the urgency of this matter and the second issue is that if the car park building can 't be made available within a within a period of time this year then by the time we get to the next summer season with a number of car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very good thing and because of potential movements around the restart mall alternative parking has to be made available to their area and and we really need a joined-up report that brings both elements together because it 's two different arms of council that deal with the two different issues so we 've got the reap the facilities rebuild looking at the car park building and we 've got the parking space people dealing with the parking issue so can I just urge that to be a joined-up report and I really believe that that this is now so urgent that we need to have it reported back to the next council meeting with what a position that we can resolve it really has to come up with that degree of urgency and there was a second issue but there was that that was the most important one thank you there any other questions Paul on so I just want to fully support that last tape around the car parking I think it is actually critical for if we want to see a rebuild happen at a much faster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right so i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no carried thank you and thank you Jane that 's um it 's much better process having the report,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Board,4MrHo_3Sjak,20140212,2018.36,"Christchurch, New Zealand",5121,bury me community board agenda with the chair of the head referee made community board like to come to the table we won 't deal with the whole of your report will just deal with the item 12.2 is there anything that you would like to say and there may be some questions for you from counselors one of the key things that are bored we hadn 't seen the lease at that stage we also thought that community consultation would be a good idea on this particular issue and it was our recommendation that the that staff get community consultation before giving advice on this home so the recommendation from your community borders a Berkeley that staff seek the views of the community and stakeholders group on the Christchurch nipple request to rip fence and include this with its report while it 's too late sorry included with the report to council because this is the report to Council so so if I 'm going to look for a resolution out of us and I 'm looking at councillor johansson and lonsdale been the local councillors that that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well actually would your community board want to lead the consultation on this in what way no no because it 's hagley taxes ok reduce that staff seek the views of the community and stakeholder groups on the christchurch netball request to a wreck fencing and report back to council yeah yep and we don 't need the second item because we have a lease attached yep and ok and so take out 9.2 and and am I correct in saying that counselor Johansson and counselor lonsdale would like to move and second the motion so that we can there 's a few questions on the basis of the dictation that I mean yes I know but I want a motion that we can speak to so and ask questions on yeah the problem is that them I mean it may be that we wish to amend these motions on the basis of the advice we hear back from stuff example things like building can seem yes I just noticed the staff member boy we 've got prizes here okay so could you come to the table both of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of a point of order one don 't we need a mover and seeking to just get it on the table that 's what I thought so and I 'd prefer to have a motion on the table but I 'm prepared to be flexible as usual so well I certainly have a question which is is it correct that a three metre fence requires a permission of the minister and end of resource consent and or a resource consent in terms of resource consent the definition of building and the city plan includes structures that are above two meters in height what I haven 't had a chance to look at before coming to the meeting just now as whether there 's any exception to the rules in the plan for the need for resource consent for buildings that are even though about two metres in height smaller than a particular site area for example 10 square meters I 've got an idea how big this fence would be in terms of the area and what rules and the plan would apply to that so I 'd need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at the plan to answer a question okay and so so I 'm saying that the the motion would be request that staff provide advice on the on the consent issues relating to the proposal and end also seek the views of the community so we can tidy that up but in terms of the second question position was put that it required the consent of the minister for direction that I I couldn 't find them in the lease no I haven 't seen it under lease I 've ever seen it was a mention of a minister of conservation as he was a dispute between the lazy and Lisa war here yeah that 's what I thought I couldn 't find it on the building right are there any questions to staff before we formulate a resolution and can I can we as a with it would anyone like to move what we have here now um over the Hagley Park management plan and what they 're kind of envisat us for these sort of structures and I do have some comment from staff over the issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for exclusive use of other sites within hagley park and how much way isn 't we should take into account and for example you know the cricket pitch is the obvious one but there may be other sports or codes in lynn wish to have exclusive access and higley park so just want to understand terms of general hagley park management plan and the puter station with a kind of lizard lizard slice on us would happen or go I haven 't had a chance to look at that before coming down to the meeting just now apologies counselor but I mean do you think it 's in a pet auditors can look at that thing that we should be taking into account what do you see this is a very distinct isolated individual I think I think it 's more isolated and natural fact the the management plan doesn 't preclude this sort of arrangement doesn 't preclude it think it 's almost silent on occasion I Heather 's um why wasn 't the issue of the fence considered before the courts were like with dip with staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a major repair engaged at the time and was the issue etting raised and the insurance raised before the workmen ahead I 'm not sure about the timing of when the fencin was arranged I 'd have to check on that for you okay Thank You Terry so item 6.1 6.2 staff recommendation that permission be granted to erect the fence so you 've obviously considered those issues yep and so staff is satisfied that if we 're happy with that they could just go ahead and do that good advice on the Christchurch netball request to a wreck fencing so if that would and could be lifted up and to the thing on the following issues to a rip fencing on the you know no leave that in the on the following issues the implications of the higley park management plan B the consent issues regarding this proposal and then a 9.2 request that staff yep seek the views of the community and stakeholder groups and report back to council okay would anyone like to move there yani Paul yani Johanson poor lonsdale now we can are there any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a question or discussion but one of our deputies mentioned alternatives to fencing and I know that we do have cameras around the city in various places to protect property in two people for safety do we have any data on how effective cameras are and looking at perhaps the camera is an alternative to looking at fencing I think that would be something you 'd need to take up with the police after we wouldn 't hold that Delta it in the report bit Jamie Gogh um I was just waiting to speak to when you really well there any further questions to starve all right well we can now debate the issue but I 'm Jamie Gogh thanks look I I appreciate Christchurch netball 's predicament here it 's actually it 's a fabulous facility that young people in Christchurch er really do enjoy I agree with Ellie who 's saying that if you don 't predict st. you lose that I also agree with Martin on that I probably ever been Martin 's favorite council there are over the last few years I actually quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great asset to the city but um but I was respect Martin and I respect his group and well we may not agree actually agree with Martin on this why she liked eglee oval is that mum dad can actually walk the dog crossed there the next day after teach test match has been played a little johnny can go down there and had the ball around in in hagley park which is the jewel in the crown of christchurch the public gym and the crown of christchurch and why i have an issue with this as I think there 's pros and cons with everything you know and if you want to pay a market rental you can be on private property and you can do what you like it 's not brilliant really for our little Johnny or Mary who live in Christchurch because they obviously have to be hit those rules but I think if you want to take the pro of paying what 's pretty close to a peppercorn rent a love of thirteen hundred dollars per annum you would set the fact that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the crown of Christchurch there going to be some things that go with that and I actually like the idea that actually people can go down there and I don 't know if the term is shooting some hoops I don 't know what it 's called a netbook but they can just play there when they like because it 's in a heavy Park one of the best things about Christ you just hectic park and I think we all realize that so much more of we didn 't before you know after the earthquake you can walk around there and actually actually forget for a moment that we 're in the middle of a war zone this is an absolute treasure and I do want a part to be enjoyed I like actually heading over because I think it does that I think it draws people in there and allows them to enjoy that 's why I take it over sorry Martin but with this 1i think Martin and his group are absolutely right and I apologize in a sense to Christchurch netball because I do understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per annum you can actually self-insure because I can sure you can add a couple of zeros on to that one and that 's what the rental would be if you 're anywhere else so I think on balance with the pros and cons this is just too important to Christchurch and of John and Mary want to go down there at seven o 'clock and shoot some nipples there that 's part of the package that 's part of the deal so I don 't support it and I 'd like to move an amendment that the council decline christchurch nipples request to erect fencing around the netball courts in hagley park but i 'd like to have a second if possible I 'll Becky thank you so an amendment has been moved to the to the original motion and I just propose that we debate both of those so rather than move to the amendment first we will vote on the amendment first but so did the council staff get the amendment I mean essentially it negates the emotion I could actually except I mean I could just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion then but no it doesn 't it doesn 't negate it so it needs to go ahead of so to decline the request to recline the request from from christchurch netball to decline the decline that christchurch netball request and remove the width after nipple yep to Rick fencing on higley part around nip is not the netball courts that 's around some four quarts and that 's moved Jamie golf second and Bucky back so and did you want to speak yep who would like to speak to the motion as it is now we hear we saying I 'm opening up the debate to the amendment as well as the holding Jamie 's permission but to to investigate alternatives to help higley neat board with these security that that 's in the original motion so you but if it 's lost in yes I think if the if the second mesick motion is lost then it 's picked up and then I ok well no no eventually I was just wondering with what what Paul in saying is you know the first part of what i said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me what I don 't want is for hagley park public park to be butchered in my opinion so what will Pauline 's really asking is you know could staff work and peps fine sort alternatives no i don 't so decline the crashed ship crash eh netball request to a wreck fencing around a portion of the netball courts and hagley park and direct staff to work with christchurch netball on alternative i 'd be happy with it and if the second errors then we can go forward but I just don 't want big 3-litre fences very helpful counselor cut it but anyone like to speak to the motion ref mangie Jimmy Choo um yeah just quickly I don 't have a problem with the with the fence it 's not a building structure it 's a fence I mean I just don 't see that it 's such a big deal the network course already there it 's not like they 're putting in a new facility so yep I 'm supportive actually of the staff recommendation I know we 're not talking to that but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the staff recommendation I think they should just get on with it put the fence up and get back to business and I just think we 're making a huge fuss about a very very tiny thing I against this amendment because of this is the community board you know bring to the council table until we know our discussion through the issues we have not yet a cadence of sufficient information first one whether least offensive the neighbor caught comply with the Hagley Park managing threat second equations where the result resource council building concern is compliant or not third one is regarding to alternative way we have to request the start bring to the console table next time we cuddle for sufficient information then console maker a final decision a moment is reader issue an idea tato information why today we need to make a decision so the other end is the process against that this amendment thank you what enough anybody 's being Daniel had a look at the Eric and concern I agree with ref and the fact that there 's a fence running along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's another fence in and when you look through the area it 's not going to interfere with the park it to any degree most of the fencing cuts through their own area that they 're using all are doing is trying to secure a really nice court a court area leaving istana large chunk of the calls to be there for the public these particular courts have a special coating on the actual area which has been badly damaged and it is really hard to control the antisocial behavior that says here on there at the present and no matter how much surveillance cameras you have there 's ways of avoiding being detected on who you are causing the problems and the problems it 's a reactor few you have to then actually try and find the person who 's always done the damage but the damage is actually caused so I 'm modern supportive actually declining the request I think we should actually go through the NFL motion as a CSI believe it 's a very small issue and I think we should go through the motions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could I just say that I don 't think this is a very small issue I think putting fences around and effectively privatizing the usage of part of hagley park is never a small issue in Christchurch hagley park particularly since the earthquakes has become the place where people go for all sorts of solace in a way and I think it 's become the new cathedral so I just cannot see that there is an any way possible that it isn 't any way possible a good idea for us to erect three metre high fences around a facility that is used not all we not all of the week fences never deter antisocial behavior let 's just be clear on that we know that is not going to happen if people want to be social antisocial fences are a great challenge and this will not do the job but more importantly hagley park is here and belongs to every citizen of christchurch so the stakeholders in this are every person and christchurch including i may add the skateboarders the people who use this for all sorts of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one in this instance that is actually not the counselors responsibility is the responsibility of nipple the netball Union I can understand why they deferred this issue while the cricket was going on I hate the idea that we set precedence for any more sports to effectively privatized and exclude from those areas of hagley park which belongs to the entire population of Christchurch for their exclusive use these parts parts of it I 've been involved in it will for a very long time I 'm not now I 'm a past member of netbook of the board of netball New Zealand so I 'm totally in favor of nipple happening of kids enjoying netball and I think it 's brilliant but not at the expense of something as important as heavy pack it creates a precedent which we cannot but then stop so I am totally totally opposed to this and I 'm not even wanting to go out to public opinion on it because actually it 's an it kind of gives the impression that the council would consider this option for me as a counselor this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no pattern actually making this go further I don 't want to spend a huge amount of money debating it with the public eye I 'm very happy that we look at alternative ways of preventing vandalism even though that is clearly the responsibility of the lessee and under the lease but I there is no way that fencing off chunks this chunk and then another chunk and another chunk there is already far too much exclusive use of heavy park and there can be no more I 'm sorry I just have a very strong view on it and there 's no way i 'm in favor of this in any way shape or form david east and then come early thank you i won 't be sought supporting this amendment and i 'm in concurrence with council mangie interesting to note on North hagley park we hear the number of tennis courts croco facilities and a whole range of things in the back of the botanical gardens that are all fenced off and I agree with counsel a mangie we 're not fencing off the entire netball facility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is very difficult to to monitor and protect from from vandalism and I think you know we 've already we 've already got facilities on hagley park that offense tonight I don 't have any problem with it and I would prefer to see the staff recommendation go through as well termos Kendra la then injury I 'm the proposal kind of can be neat ball is basically though they 're going to want to fence off half the netbook course that 's not the whole thing and if you look at the Met that 's provided basically a third of their area they wanted to fence is already fenced it doesn 't join up obviously but it 's still fixed the other side of that is a totally counselor fact that it 's just another encroachment and on higley park and I personally would like a very strong mandate from the people of Christchurch about what they actually want an higley park do they want more of this because it is an encroachment up piece by piece by piece we 've had it with other things and I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christchurch if they do want encroachment on hagley park in any way shape or form or not Thank You Eddie Jones I have to support Grove who from from David them and ref as well the Arsenal courts that will be open to the public there is all there are parts of hagley park as David mentioned that are unavailable or are fenced off as well and if these courts are damaged and unable to be used then young people and others won 't be able to use these courts to play netball and goodness knows we 've lost enough and the city already and we all know about the importance of health and well-being and we can 't have courts unable to be used because of ongoing vandalism councillor back mentioned privatization well you could also call it protecting it you could be protecting this for the young people and others who are getting out there and doing something and the outdoors the park is big enough yes we all seek solace in the park I live near the park and walk around often but there are plenty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big enough for everyone so I think we 're in a new post-quake world we all acknowledge that and we have to adapt accordingly so I won 't be supporting the amendment I 've Phil Clearwater well I do want to support the amendment I just think that there has been i think the lessons that the whole city learned from had the Hagley oval is that people are really concerned about further intrusion on the park there are some small fences around some of the smaller grounds for example at the croaky as I 'm council East referred to but they 're they 're low fences that just protect intrusion on their very special grounds and and I can cope with that I think approaching hi feets is like this which is only an extent well it 's only an extinction boy that 's the whole point that there 's no if this avera council agree to those in fact there 's every every will be every right to any other group to come and want further fencing to how far do we go I 'm really concerned that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that that would be basic surely we should have the community to should have been more involved and in looking at for example other crime prevention methods apart from fencing and it doesn 't only need expensive cameras there are organizations in air city and in the head leafy ramin ward who could do this and I 'm sure they will be involved and we need to we need to protect the courts and there are other ways of doing it or not I said I support this amendment and entertainer yeah I also will be supporting the amendment today I believe that erecting a three meter fence sets of very interesting precedence as to how we might handle future requests and certainly sets an interesting precedent around future uses of hagley park we need to bear in mind as others have said that the park is an asset for the people of the whole city and as much of the park needs to remain as accessible as possible I 'm I guess in some ways anticipating that whilst there will be opposing views and some contention if we go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general public would want as much of hagley park to be open to as many of the general public as possible so I 'm also mindful of the the message that erecting a three-foot three meter fence sends two users of the park it makes it look as though we 've got a vandalism problem and we 're not able to deal with in any other way so I 'm supporting the amendments on the basis that I believe that there 's a responsibility on the part of everybody involved to to work towards finding alternatives to putting up a three meter fence thanks Paul lonsdale I don 't think anyone doubts how precious our park is that I think that say she 's a question I think what we have to look at here and i think counselor Scandrick put the nail on the head is that we need to understand what the Mandate of the people of Christchurch actually is this is a question for the people of Christchurch I think that we need to understand because the reason it is contentious because there are totally opposing views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there was a lot against it so it is continued so we need to understand better and I think the first motion actually would actually help us identify that there any other speakers on motion yani o Henson thank you um well as some councillors maybe we are was quite critical of the process that the Hagley Park cricket oval went through no clear process for community to be involved different decisions made by different groups of people and organizations and in the end at the end of the day it was actually put in by government anyway so the community had no say so I don 't think I can you know agree to this amendment that 's been put here today without knowing what the community views are given that was a real key argument for me over the cricket and higley park so i think it is proper to go through a process that weighs up the different considerations yes they will be opposing views and many of the issues that are being raised by individual counselors make a lot of sense and I understand why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've heard that it may be accrued if you look at the Hagley Park management planner is really clear that any new structure including fencing should actually take into account the impact on other users in the public but in the community on higley park and in my view this report hasn 't done that so I can 't support making a decision today I think it is important to get the additional information to make a good decision so I appreciate some councillors have a different point of view and you just want to give a clear signal to to to your view today I do look at this report that we 've been given and I do think given the sensitivity that it was important as the community will tried to do to get those views consider before this actually came to counsel that hasn 't happened so I will not support this amendment today right okay well I shall put the motion there 's clearly different views going to be expressed so I 'm actually going to suggest that we just go straight to a to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amendment first to decline the Christchurch netball request to a Rick fencing and direct staff to work on alternatives could you please cast your vote now should be an we 're doing that a minimal first we 're doing that vote first to decline the Christchurch netball request to a rich so if you think that we should be going for the full report that be the community board asked for then you would vote against this if you support the views that have been expressed by the mover and the Second Earth and others you vote yes so we 're just waiting for counselors Cotter gough and chin it 's not not showing up as wise counsel a golf have you voted it 's not showing up and North counselor Cotter yep voted and Cotton 's voted sorry so what do we do when their screens have gone bet yep is it sorted we 're doing it again it 's everyone 's voted right and the answer is gosh it 's 67 so it is 2 cleared lost and now we move to the original motion that we request @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they seek the views of the community and stakeholder groups and report back to council so yeah well we didn 't discuss what that would what that would look like but it would have to be a formal consultation of some sort so i 'll put that motion again just vote on the on the on the electronic voting system and we have counseled a buck to go yes voted so we will now have a look at the result and it 's 11 to two i declare that vote carrot thank you very much and i think it 's probably time that we have a quick break for morning tea and we will resume again at what 's the time,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

proposal needs to be considered in the context of the overall role and use of hagley park changes in sports needs and the prospects of currently soldiers seeking larger facilities to meet those needs

current very large pavilion the pavilion is used frequently for functions that are not netball related which brings into question the lease conditions related to commercial use which would apply to other buildings also within hagley park protection of an expensive assets such as the artificial surfaces of the netball courts needs to be considered but again the question of factoring this aspect in that the time decisions were made to commit to capital expenditure should have been considered why has this application be left till after the construction has been completed with a advice to do it this way and if so who an alternative fencing is surveillance monitoring and rigorous prosecution of vandals who use netball courts in a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visual amenity of the area as fencing would I think you 'd have to look around the area and ask how many businesses and even hagley high school have three meter fencing around to protect from the same sorts people that are using the South hagley park and the netball courts and none of them do this security cameras appear to be able to do that do the job I myself has just built a large expensive building on cranford street and I 'm concerned that people come in and tagged or do sort some sort of damage but I would never consider a three meter fence around the place because it 's in a word it 's ugly so if it 's going to be ugly on cranford street why would it be less ugly in in South hagley park exclusive use of a public recreation reserve is not an entitlement must be subjected to public consultation this application raises a whole question of whether the nipple facilities are properly located inside a Glee Park they have been of there have been historical considerations of developing elsewhere one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and parking congestion that is generated by regular competitive netball on this site which has been a problem for decades it 's not likely to decline and will be excessive ated by use of the adjacent Metro sports facility and the hospital future parking demands one of the other problems related to to this is if you are going to put a three meter fence round a half million dollar investment with the netball courts to get insurance what 's going to happen in the future with the cricket oval they 've got a nine million dollar building there surely they will at some stage be looking to put a fence around the oval to protect their investment and get insurance there 's the the precedent this sets is quite alarming really the current proposal from cannery netball is not anticipated in the statutory hagley park management plan 2007 and many conditions have to be met before approval for any fencing this fencing request by alici brings into question once again the nature of leases and their conditions being issued to lease holders in hagley park a matter that hen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the council before further agreements or approvals of whatever nature in hagley park are entered into I would point out that the the least they 've signed our net will have signed includes the the phrase the least shall prohibit the erection of any building without the prior knowledge of the minister and I believe under the city plan any fence over two metres is classified as a building in conclusion hands off Hagley believes it 's imperative councils seek the views of the community and stakeholders on netball 's proposal and request that a public hearing be held for oral submissions netball doesn 't have our designated area to the park as per their letter to the council rather they 've been granted a lease for the use of an area of public open space for use for a specific winter sport it was not designated nor an exclusive right over that area or even part of it in another alternative I guess is to reject the the proposal at today 's meeting which would possibly save the City Council a lot of time and money when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cricket proposal I think an early rejection would be in everyone 's best interests thank you could you just help me out with them whereabouts and the lease does it say that that the ability erection of a building requires the prior consent of the minister I couldn 't how I have seen it but I mean I just lifted that off the off the internet copied it down okay you know the minister I mean I like that because I will certainly ask the question of our advisors as to whether there is that different I mean that is the first I 've heard that offense would be classified as a bowling if it 's over two meters so we will get that checked out so that we can ask the question when we come to debate the actual topic so thank you for raising that the lease itself as I mentioned before said there no buildings fences etc shall be erected without the prior consent of the parks manager and the reason that this has come here is because there was a view that the parks manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't have the appropriate delegation from the council to make that decision even though that was the intention of the lease when it was originally drawn up so I suspect that could be the reason behind why things look like that there 's there 's been that way the netball people understood that that this was an appropriate process to go through it but I think the question has already been put to them as to why they made the decision to improve the courts without having got the decision on the facing so I can understand that and I fully sympathize mmm I would just point out that if they 're concerned about people partying up on the tennis court I sorry on the netball courts they didn 't have a chance to put in an ejection or raise some concerns at the hearing over there cricket proposal when cricket were proposing that 20,000 happy spectators will be descending on on the Hagley Park to watch the cricket so they they never put in any objections then about people hanging around the park and drinking which they could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skateboarders or skateboarders are citizens of Christchurch as well and it is their Park although they shouldn 't be on the netball courts causing damage is it not possible to actually put a small skateboard facility say opposite agriculture and and then that would draw them away I can 't see the sense in anybody skateboarding on a flat surface hmm yeah I agree not that I 'm a skateboarder but his if people got questions yeah Ellie James you know I was just interested he say Martin that if you don 't take care of what what you have you won 't have it very long you could apply that to the nipple courts to couldn 't you oh no no no this so that well the network courts can be anywhere hagley park on but if we don 't protect these netball courts now there 's a chance we may not have them very long stop it Oh Bo that they could well be both damage on the new services yes but they 've gone ahead and put the new services in without checking so that the onus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help them by as I say putting something in for skateboarders a little further away in the park and just camera surveillance will take care of most of the other problems everybody else in the area shares it why wouldn 't it will be specially do you think should pick up the cost for those the distributor the camera surveillance and near skateboard well I i think the the cost of paying your insurance fees and the costs of erecting offense would pretty well cover your cameras ok can I just clarify one statement you you made that you ascertain that a structure over 2 meters would possibly require a resource consent was it yes yes the existing fence line is that over 3 meters or are 2 meters which existing fence is this well as an existing velaphi and stayin ere now there 's there 's nothing 3 meters there to the map is an existing fence and we 're adding to it just alongside the building there 's some fencing and and then we 're we 're going to add to that page 51 of their existing City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or three meters high actually is I mean it is it is there now but any new fencing as far as my reading if I one scenario you 're you 're asserting that are any structure over two meters high will require a resource consent what if it 's classified as a building uacc that was deemed a building and needs a consent say again I think you actually said that any structure over two meters high is actually deemed a building yes and requires a consent so something I need to just follow up with there yeah but if you 've got something there already that so over there hi I mean it 's just an existing use right there that 's just been an audition yeah if there 's this year 's edition overdue meters will is deemed a building and will require because yet need to follow that up we will take advice on that indicated that as there any other questions thank you very much a deputation it 's my proposal that we now go directly to item 12.2","(-43.5320214,

November 2013,zbXmZeJqZ7A,20140212,625.32,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1939,and we bring people back um just just as we set the meeting their car I want to seek the leave of the committee to deal with item agenda item number 21 which is the report of a meeting of the occur or why we rework community board meeting of the 21st of November 2013 is Pam Richardson the chair of the community board needs to leave so are there any objections to that course of action being followed there appear to be none and so I will now move to item 21 and invite him Richardson welcome pembridge that son to the council sidering my request I do have a busy morning and a busy day ahead of me but I just had a few comments that I wanted to introduce introduced person that thanks very much sincerely for the visit that the mayor and returner and yanni made before Christmas to our community the reception in the street was absolutely amazing in the chemist shop wherever our meal went she was well received in the community really really value having the mountain coming to the little Mole help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that and it 's important that the our team has actually seen in our community we 're delighted with the progress that you have made with the Gaiety theatre or the Gaiety hall and that process and hope that the community will be able to be involved with that as volunteers and we look forward to dealing with that I must say that the live screening is a very valuable for us as a community that are not here all the time and have access i actually set in wanaka and watch what it want went on on that live screening on that particular day so it is very small your holiday well I was dedicated to the cause and just wanted to see what was going on but it is an important I think and it is valued by our community as they look at things that are going on but there are a couple of things just that I want to mention from the from the minutes and at 4.4 this is just about the Bowling Club and flooding but we are increasingly getting a number of concerns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high rainfall events coming off the hills and we need to be able to work with our communities to find resolutions to things but it also goes much wider than that and climate change maybe but it also affecting upon our coastlines and we 're seeing a lot of our coastal roads being eroded away but those that 's an issue that needs me to and along with that of the sea walls and we have a number of historic sea walls that we would like that looked at down the track another issue that is quite of quite concerned to us as a small community is the amount of documentation behind running events and as you see on 4.5 we had an event that was put off because the costs involved the documentation was very difficult was only for about five or six boats on the recreation ground in a corolla so we are we are planning on having a seminar to deal with that but i just highlight that some of the decisions that are being made by the events team and other things for small things and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancel them because we can 't actually deal with it but we will find a way of working through that and finally I 'll just say that 18 cruise posits to go great to see that the freedom camping issue has been to dress for our community because it is a continuing concern outside the the council office the portico mom them on the the boat rigging area there 's 20 caravans in the morning and they even tie their clothes line to part of the the porta com of what share counts our staff work out of so they like camping ground operators down there but we do acknowledge that you 're addressing that issue so those are just a few things I 'd like to add thinking man thank you and I 'd like to begin by simply you know thinking you on behalf of myself entertainer and Diana Johansson for an incredible display of hospitality when we went to a Corral we had a fantastic day the weather was tuned on for us as well we were able to watch the you know the cruise ships unloading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roy has been you know dealing with the in the light of the you know closure of report to cruise ships although I did see a cruise ship and Littleton the other day so that may be the beginning of of a change there as well and it was a very expensive trip for me personally because I went into the pearl gallery but it will be but there was a there was a very worthwhile visit as well and the other thing that I would mention know is them I was actually concerned to read about the about the the costs and documentation associated with hiring grounds and and can 't end in feeling that people had to cancel events in relation to the use of public land that isn 't just a rural washer it 's a local show as well with parks and you know sort of Christmas carols and various other events which are intended to bring community together start to raise a cost on communities the the two pieces there are two pieces of legislation that tend to be cited but largely the health and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council would like to have a look at whether in fact some of those some of the some of the risk averse behavior that we see in some areas could infect the address by you know if it is seriously an issue under the Act maybe we need maybe we need to be thinking about approaching government around some of the some of some of the relaxations around things that don 't really have a major a major risk associated with them sometimes legislation are cited but in fact it 's an over compliance and it 's not something that we should be addressing and I think and in rural communities people would rather ask for forgiveness their possession so I think that you know your your comics have been well received and I think that this council will want to follow that up further on behalf of all of its district rather than just the the rural side yani johansson OMG thank you for raising that it is timely that I did raise us as part of our draft in your plan so we have us time to actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be really helpful for us if you could encourage people making submissions to the draft annual plan when it 's out and also providing us with real tangible examples of you know the cost of the extra things that we 're requiring so that we can really fine tune it to ensure that we can get these events happening yet without having these barriers in place entertainer Thank You Pam um and yeah just to echo the the mayor 's comments thanks for thanks to the whole a chiro community in fact for hosting us to a great day out back in December certainly a great start to what for some of us were with Christmas holidays so thank you very much indeed for that and also it 's been a pleasure to support the early return to use of the Gaiety as well um just going back to your comments on the cruise ships obviously the the mayor and council Johansson and I were fortunate to be there on a day when there was a large cruise ship in and we were able to see the way that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make some comments on the way that the cruise ship season has run this year any any issues there have been or things that have worked particularly well look I think it 's it 's run extraordinary well I haven 't heard of any major issues of course there are issues of people not being able to do things when they want to do it but that 's just the sub thing that we just have to learn to cope with as part of living in a tourist town and we 're doing something still as a result of the earthquakes we get tremendous support from the City Council with the events management and the management plan the traffic management plan the cleaning of facilities done extra times rubbish collection there 's a whole lot of things a whole package that goes around it as yet we haven 't had our wrap-up of the season we 've got 18 to go but there 's been no need to bring up an extra meeting to deal with any issues at hand so I can only presume that it 's gone it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Curragh that we we need their support as well we have the extra enforcement staff that have come over the holiday season so I think it 's being managed appropriately enter the best of all of our abilities to the nth row sorry thanks Pam um I do agree i think the health and safety except overused by public organizations i was just wondering would it help in your opinion of say council stuff I 'm talking the senior staff as well as the frontline staff of events and the event bookings come and actually meet with community boards and explain the process and perhaps understood more the issues that you and other community boards and community groups were facing yes we have a meeting organised to deal with that very issue we need to understand I actually feel a for myself for the Lions for their for their event once you know how to do it it 's not too difficult but there is public liability insurance that you 're required to go with it may be traffic management plans that are needed with them there are some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety plan so it was quite easy the council didn 't say no there was something wrong with it you know so we are working through it to understand it to help our communities to understand what they need to do community will report following bit could you make sure that there 's some action points for staff to follow up that you could bring to us you 're interested and it will be your staff that I 'll be involved with it so years we will interview and so Andrew Turner 's moving that the report be received do I have a seconder David East I 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no Carrie thank you very much thank you I 'm I 'd like to now deal with a procedure,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

refurbishment and repositioning of 18 high-quality deco chief netball courts in hagley park we need to be able to ridiculous as it increased vandalism has occurred since late 2011 and 2013 appears to

already this year intentional court damage has occurred and the estimate receiver appears as 2083 dollars and we 've also been required to dispose of some spectators it 's damaged beyond repair we

usual mowing and some edge request tree trimming christchurch new porn our maintains at their own cost care packages car park gardens driveway gardens adamson planter boxes courtside grass-eaters that

this application to fence discussions had initially started with council staff early in 2012 this delay has now resulted in a considerable amount of unbudgeted funds being used to maintain and repair our property in the intervening period we would prefer this measure did not go to public consultation and create issues and debates by a small group of self-appointed protectors of hagley park we believe the building and courts themselves could become a target for graffiti and potential damage as a result of increased public attention we 've spoken to collaborate percentage of some players at various forums to gauge the on this proposal and we 've been met with a hundred percent in favor of submitting an application to counsel for a fence our club members are proud of the refurbished courts in the building the fact that nipple was able to be provided for 6,000 plus people in april 2011 in time for the commencement of the season has seen a renewed interest in the game in christchurch the skip adults teenagers children and families busy active and involved in sport during difficult post-earthquake times netball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students mums and their families and is the most played women 's portion in Canterbury if we are required to continue paying high maintenance costs on uninsurable assets it is inevitable that the cost of players will increase to cover the cost of repairs as a result of vandalism we believe we have rights under section 224 of the property law act and considering the large investment the centre has made in the new courts we believe our request is reasonable we need a fence and we need it now thank you here 's some has anyone got any questions for clearwater thank you for your presentation just ask you in terms of opportunities to deal with the vandalism what sort of proaches might have been made to either say the police or any of the community policing organizations we have spoken to police I 've hit restart somebody from hagley park we 've had squatters sleeping in the doorway those sort of things but there 's very little that they can do in terms of two other time in the community and we have security patrols was there any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what other alternatives you 've looked at to prevent this happening we 've spoken I 've spoken to a community placement when we were having issues with somebody wandering around the park but no not really there 's probably an Avenue in each at school another counselor field clear water question based on Yoda the history has any de you know how many times regarding to the neighbor the facility has been there you know South for these kind of window Lisa before and also these times after the refurbish you know three services which particular part of this new facility you you 're a particular concern will be affected by the vandalism the new court surface as a decorative surface slightly rubberized which is much better and safer for our players but it is more vulnerable to damage from roller bladers skateboarders bikes those sort of things not to the extent it 's happening now we 're finding that the growth in Eddington we 're getting a lot more attention than perhaps we had in the past okay Janie Gogh thank you very much thanks for your reputation just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just haven 't been able to find this figure here so hoping you might be able to help me I see that you were grounded 33 year lease from about 93 oh yes the 53 it is and just wondering what what rent do you pay for that and just wondering if you can 't comment this theory on that you how about how much yeah I can find it we 're at how much is the ring oh great okay oh thank you very much what page is that you know that 's fine within and just in wondering if you 're in a position to come in how that would relate to a market range will if you were leasing though that that premises on private land I have no idea sorry okay that 's one I think you 'd be a deputation I 'm taking the defense in proposes as per the document that you gave councillor Paul lon started issued to this it 's basically you 're looking at doing half the courts and when you really look at it about a third of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this service yeah it 's another frustration you must feel them and it 's a hard area to area to secure as in erie a lot like that and any it seems that anything you try and do as post the damage so you 're always behind the eight ball and repairing that it 's always I suppose I am a burden on any club financially and obviously netball and that 's particularly this year is the main area in Christchurch for netball and it is as you say the largest sport played by women and can vary so that is an important SES I think you sorry it 's in the body of the lease so at some page 62 of our report at the very outset it says that the the lease agreement is for an annual rental of 1300 payable half-yearly and advance on the first day october first of april so there hasn 't changed since the lease was signed so right there was a reduction in 2011 I believe 2012 slight reduction right so as a result of the earthquake yes yep yes there any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lease agreement i do see and I just want my dear some clarification from from perhaps our legal advisers on to me it 's sort of almost indicates they could a wreck to keep people from misusing the area under I think it 's five who X contrary to any other rules for the conduct of persons using the premises providing provided that any emission or failure to observe such rules made in good faith and if any social person defender compose the rules and attention be drawn shall not be deemed to be reasonable for his removal looks but expulsion then it goes on to say enforcing the rules or preserving a proper management and preservation or the premises and I think that 's the part that I 'd like a bit of clarification on in how they able to actually a wreck defense without a consultation under that clause the if you refer to page 62 which is 64 think illegal but if you look at 62 paragraph 5 be no buildings fences or other structure structure shall be erected nor shall alterations or additions be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the seed packs manager the reason this is here in front of the council is because they there was not a proper delegation given to the parks manager if a proper delegation in accordance with the intention of this lease had been granted this decision would have been made by the parks manager and based on the advice that we 've received as a council that lease that Commission would have been granted so that the asset could have been protected is this a sort of contrary that particular clause country to them yeah that 's right I mean there is not a proper the deputy no there was not a sufficient delegation for council staff to be satisfied that they could meet the intent of the lease because the delegation was not appropriately given to the packs manager who 's no longer called a parks manager Yanni um thank you um just I 'm going to let you go over time because I 've prattled and I shouldn 't have just um and the letter to John Allen on the seventeenth of April you talk about the issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a public area did you take that into account you know I 'm just trying to understand how we 've got to a situation where you 've had this major investment without understanding with you who getting sure parents or have the fencing court interpreted the asset why why is it being done it seems kind of around the wrong way chilled by counsel as its counsel land and we found out that was not the case we knew we couldn 't ensure the courts but we are committed to providing quality courts for our players and safe courts what I 'm just trying to understand in terms of like the request for fencing why would they have not come before the money was spent on doing the enhancements given he couldn 't get insurance well we went being subjected to the vandalism we 're being subjected to now and we did start discussions with council staff in 2012 about fencing the courts and just a second question in regards to the long-term future are you looking at any sort of indoor facilities or I don 't know if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you see that there would be a time when you would actually have more activity in a different location and therefore you know if the fencing was granted whether that could be on a kind of transitional period to enable you know that I guess that future relocation to it no suitable venue with the number of people that plane equal in Christchurch when you take into consideration our Saturday sport plus primary secondary in intermediate netball as well the Metropolitan sports facility will not cope with those with all those numbers so there will always be a Knick ball played outside and headed back as far as we 're aware there is no other option there are there any further questions oh no we reached our time anyway so very very much for your deputation and now I would like to invite","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Report,xV2GizK7ed8,20140211,992.91,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1914,the the net natural environment recovery program progress report can I move the items and 3.1 with all its subsections and seduced also that there is a monthly reporting schedule against these to this committee okay see condensed cancer in your handsome search route to set some questions before we so I just wondered how how do we engage with our local community boards and local communities over this this program and it just seems to me that there 's a bit of a a bit of a gap in that also I just wondered do we have elected members on the group is zero kind of a group that 's overseeing it the year the natural environment recovery program has a technical advisory group that meets monthly and oversees the program and there are no elected representatives on that group they 're all officers from the various organizations involved right so if if there were things that might at our community board where we 've got local people that want to be involved in environmental recovery how who do they interface with the local community board the technical advisory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not clear i saw the strategic what is that the strategic advisory commit the recovery strategic advisory committee stick the probe the program has a full-time coordinator and that coordinator is Chrissie Williams so people can speak directly to Chrissy but to be honest the recovery program itself is an overview of existing projects and operational activities in various community initiatives so people are usually involved and that Nixon deauville down if you like the projects and the things that are actually happening rather than the overview program which is mostly monitoring and connecting and looking for synergies and putting people together the thing that I think would be really useful is to understand and i think you know every every counselors board will be slightly different but i 'd really like to have an understanding and the Hagley ferry made ward for example what work as part of this program is being done is that is it possible to understand is it possible to have like a ward based reporting mechanism that enables local communities to actually see what 's going on today that you actually suggest solution that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based reporting framework that enable local community boards and communities to see progress but I mean we can the committee will can invite Chrissy if you like I just you know that this is very good at a high level but in terms of understanding it locally what 's happening on the ground it 's quite hard to see but um M cheered I think it as Helen pointed out this is very much a high-level document and actually reflects largely work programs that are in a lot of the individual Council so in as much as the the net the assets net with people the stormwater management people are interfacing with the community boards and with the relevant committees of counsel that 's probably at a practical level that the key way that we can improve and make sure that communication happens I think it would be good to have Chrissy come along to the community boards and talk about the overall program and if there are specific areas of work that they that they want to be informed on that can come that they could raise that through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriate part of the organization to work with them on that because a lot of it detail is about the business of council the stormwater management business the ecological restoration work that sort of thing I use the other option is that arm is counsel as we can approach Chrissy directly to talk about certain aspects will compute a score with regards to say I 'm control piece that citroen the red zone who we have is to speak to directly would there be well I think the answer christy is likely to give you in detail is to say we should go back to your own counsel because that 's what 's doing this so Christie 's very much coordinating and reporting across the whole program and across the council 's I think the key thing might be M paps this is a suggestion if you invite chrissy out we could make sure the staff go out with her to the to the relevant community board if there any particular issues raised we can come back into the organization and find the right people to talk at detail to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overview sure point back to the council 's as being the relevant bodies to communicate that so if the community put community boards wish to do that we can certainly arrange for her to go round and meet with each of you and have staff at end led as well she regarding to attachment to the recovery strategy or the whites of the community why is there a fee babe in their comings where i watch paragraph huge attachment to page on 11 to the 14 i means after presentation to least the recovery strategy advisory community group what is their comments in the feedback oh that 's a that 's a political body so staff wouldn 't have been at that so i think the mayor was attending that meeting so she may be able to confirm what the recovery and what the Advisory Committee responded but i think largely the required advisory committee just received this because this was just basically chrissy respond reporting back on the establishment of the program and the initial mantra for the 3pm they 're also to come and is most important as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved in this one so we would like to you know to know the harder this strategy group their comments and also the feedback i think that 's important for us otherwise maybe maybe the mayor need to the feedback to us and my guy like your suggestion that the specifics around that these projects say that they be dealt with through the community boards and will be involved with it too of course because some no definitely detention too and like unpaid for exactly don 't expect you to answer this at all but on page seven there 's bound the stormwater management round catchments and for example my area on wolseley as per the sediment goes into the kashmir stream it 's been doing it for years it 's a paper road that the four-wheel drivers you use regularly and cheering the sediment up i 'm just adding well increasing the problem that kind of thing that 's one example in India there 's another 12 on page nine in relation to promotion of signage on the portholes which it says as urgent it 's just to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having a few of us it 's great the checks are open but being up the you know this I know that the signage is peppermint especially if all comes in and stuff so it 's I think but i just want to say working with the committee boards and staff and endnote and fire Chrissie Williams that will be great and would be pleased to be part of their prices okay no because it will do that provides an additional part of updates provided to this committee on a monthly basis okay she run come some particular cancer because the once a month you know the the creases she presented to the candle otherwise a committee by the comments in the feedback less important whether we can gather this information as well otherwise just one waiter presentation only space your achievement reporting problems I think manager what we could do is when we get the minutes of the advisory committee we could attach that the relevant minutes relating to that item because the advisory committee gets a report my understanding is it doesn 't tend to give a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be a lot of feedback from the advisory committee but if there 's a if there 's a minute item relating to the natural environment program when we get that we can include that in the next report to Council and that gives you Jimmy you give you then you get the assurance of what the Advisory Committee are saying can I just flag a second amendment and there is in relation to the specifics of this information going to the community boards and in involving new if you do and so just to be clear their nearest only get an update once every three months I is that um it it 's recommended that this note the note reports are received by the community boards and there be discussion with nope as we put Chrissie Williams title of it is let 's go see well let me see a woman in an NIT coordinator good cut and end appropriate and appropriate to the council staff that 's right yep I 'm I think we can but I thought I think we mean to need to make sure it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to support there too yes and can I just I don 't I don 't want to be difficult but given that I raise this concern to start what I just I just think given that it 's coming back every month I think what I 'd really like to see is you know a reporting structure to community boards that 's relevant not not at the really high global level but about local things that are happening in the area if I give you example um I think we got like one day 's notice and I don 't even know if the community will were invited to go to the second stage of the auvergne river park where all the sediments being taken away from the river so it 's that there might be very local things that are relevant to local community boards and that 's what I 'd be interested in not yeah which which is fine but yeah I just think that we ask staff to consider as part of the regular reporting the way in which community boards can receive information in a ward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll just leave it as it is that 's fun let 's move on the most of these things that are going to be of interest to the community boards are emerging out are coming out of the emerging issues so in my mind it 's more of a unity boards or an indication of how these emerging issues are going to be dealt with so some of them will be sites are specific to a certain community boards others obviously not though so I think you know if we are maybe just been this amendment somehow rather making reference to the to the emerging issues that are being signaled yeah you you,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Vision,1nvIipGBU6E,20140211,520.2,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1114,what work um my belief looking at the report and looking at the work of this group is entirely in the east of the city is that the correct governance group to to work with Easton vision would be a committee of the joint community board so for the community boards in the East to actually be the the council governance body that interacts with Eastern vision on this so in terms of 6.2 my my view is that the primary point of contact with Eastern vision at council government level the governance level would be and the the two community boards a joint community board well I was just completely going to echo what was seen and that you know I at our community board when we had our last meeting people raised the concern that they didn 't really have any visitor we r of what eastern vision was doing and right so i think it 's i don 't have staff can so you know give us any information about whether they 've been through community boards with there 's been presentations or engagement or it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eastern vision approached the last term council they were looking to make I think now we 're looking to make a deal with the council at that point rather than community board something I know this council may be a different emphasis on community board so yeah I 'm not exactly sure what what important they 've done to those boards just I just don 't quite understand if you 're going to have community boards doing policies and objectives and visions for the area and you 've got another group above doing something else I do think it needs to be integrated into up community boards are doing so I 'd agree with injury i agree with the Senate entirely was Andrews at earliest point and end that go to a combined community boards or community board cheers and like n point 10 it 's all about optimal outcomes for communities and areas of eastern suburbs require community leadership and community engagement there it is so I think we this is heading the right direction but for for the scanned and of course we as counselors are part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a point of water really we didn 't have any declarations of interest earlier on and there are there are myself and Glenn are members of Eastern visions I should be probably better than away from this clearing there and n clean has left the room so that doesn 't become quite so relevant for him other reading the directions of interest while on the subject if not it just remember to bring them up at the time as as we did so just in terms of the community boards are you satisfied if it goes there that it gets sufficient grant at the council where does that come to from there just direct from that joint community board meeting to the direct to the full council well I think they 're EA raises the question about a liaison with their and um I yep I think it 's some error community committee is if it 's it 's part of the delegation here so one of us could attend those meetings but I think I mean from what it sounds like it 's a beer with Pegasus vision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missing is a map of what this where this area is so we actually know and also some understanding about what it 's well it 's already done it 's really talking about engaging people on east christchurch but we 've got two councils from one ward on it in other areas that don 't have much and put into it so i think there 's a more fundamental question is really around you know what area is a is it covering and then we look at half watts of this structure but it heavy for it to report to council through the community committee but it seems like they 're trying to do more strategy and planning staff as opposed to local activities that just it 's to that group initially and if it works well brilliant if it doesn 't we 'll review it but just in terms of the area that a submission covers there 's not a map but there is a description in the footnote on the on the first page of the protocol itself give a list of who 's on it as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but but David is to help resolution given the confusion over there not just more of a process in question once the I think there 's a great idea so once boo Pegasus higley pyramid combined make a decision there is that effectively a recommendation that would come back to full council just in the form of like the community boards reports tell my recollection of delegations is at a wood and this week and one least we delegated it especially yeah that 's fine yeah just the name for me is actually really misleading if it doesn 't include certain areas that are in the east and includes others and I do wonder whether we need to give I think if we could ask tough to attach a net to this report would be really useful in the list of members but also I mean I do think we should consider the name of this organization and whether the boundary is actually appropriate it might be that you either change the extent of it or you might actually think about changing the name to reflect more about what its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said I 'm sure I mean I mean we can make suggestions but i love this Eastern vision is a body to itself and its own title and what it believes is it Syria of coverage i supposes for it to determine all they 're asking for us as a relationship with counsel I understand what counsel your hands and a saying in perhaps so they have tried to define the area a bit more but I mean I think it 's the rather long bow for this counsel suggests they change their name but yeah I think that 's all open for discussion with them when the two boards meet with them absolutely,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

4,i-PxN2D5Xgo,20140211,1070.26,"Christchurch, New Zealand",2760,"thank you um I 'm Evan Smith as you 're probably aware coach hear of an entire network that 's the head on wearing here today for the past two years on and around labor weekend able to talk through network or even has organized the spring river festival in the east side of christchurch this waka Huia was carved and gifted to us as a symbol of that festival there 's a lot of symbolism and like time to go into it but it 's quite an important event for many people we believe that over the last two years we 've demonstrated that this has that the festival has the potential to become a very successful annual opportunity to celebrate spring and to showcase the vitality potential of the east to become the playground of the city however we need the commitment and the support of council to grow this and make it a sustainable festival i 'm here today to seek that commitment and support there 's no secret that the wards of higley fair maiden booooored pegasus were the most impacted by the earthquakes of 2010-2011 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lower Aven and heath kept flood plains is also the key to the area 's recovery and it is the recognition and restoration of the enormous immunity value that the waterways in the coasts have to the city fellows living in the communities of the east life has been in many cases continues to be absolute hell many of those communities have simply disintegrated altogether disappeared or fractured as a result of the Reds owning those that remain are dealing with tc3 and flood management area issues eqc and insurance issues and very munted infrastructure this foremost our East is a very individualized private battle the earthquakes brought communities together the recovery has torn us heart for many of those living in the other side of town the East is viewed as the badlands the war zone and they cordon it off in their psyche you don 't go there it 's out of sight and out of mind people are disconnected within communities the communities are disconnected from each other and everyone is disconnected from the immunity of their environment and there remains a strong disconnect across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great our greatest three years out from the disaster this for this reason that even partners with healthy Christchurch to organize the river of flowers events along the rivers every 22nd of februari and weekend after next will be doing that again for the third anniversary there 's also for this reason that we feel that sitting aside one weekend in spring each year as the spring with a festival to reconnect the communities of the east reconnect West and East and reconnect people with our rivers is a priority and should be a priority for the council we have child two different formats for the Spring River Festival and believe that the attributes that work best include a focus on the rivers history and beaches of the east and the communities that lived there a diversity of events so that there is something for everyone whatever they age interest or ability you may have been issued a leaflet that gives some indication of what kind of events that would be held in the first year then embrace areas such as sport and recreation with a whole variety of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they along the river corridor natural environment garlands and food production art science and entertainment and Community fairs and markets in 2012 we coordinated over 40 events over two days we need to make sure that program presents no conflicting key events and illogical there 's a logical geographical progression of events so that people may be travel down the river as they go from one event to another so they don 't conflate we feel it 's best held over one or two days on the weekend following labor weekend not on label weekend itself because we want to see it integrated with other festivals Fister has staked its claim on labor weekend and we fully support that that 's absolutely critical to make these things happen that they are well resourced professionally organized and professionally marketed support to date from council for the spring of a festival concept has been extremely limited we believe there is a strong council at a strong case for council to prioritize this festival to provide a much higher level of direct support of a variety of types including event management support which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team alternatively funding to contract professional event management services which can be quite expensive logistical support the council owns reserves and venues equipment and festival resources that it would be good to deploy in the festival of this kind accessing that is quite a bureaucratic nightmare at times and and it would be good to cut through some of that red tape to make things happen a lot easier it just become it in our experience very hard to deliver an event like this you spend most of your time trying to access funding and cut through red tape we would like to see greater priority to funding festivals and events outside of business as usual and outside of the CBD take some risks with some more edgy transitional initiatives in areas of the city still heavily compromised in terms of infrastructure to assist them in their recovery we need communications marketing and PR support the council has really good teams to do that sort of thing that could assist to help secure the profile of the festival and help secure sponsorship finally in terms of festival integration it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of scale and you can leverage off each other imagine an annual spring festival season that runs from labor weekend right through to show weekend and starts with festa over the labor weekend in the central city weaves and diwali progresses to the spring river festival out on the east the following weekend and then culminates and cup and show week please help us sustain this initiative by prioritizing it for resources so that the annual spring river festival becomes a significant feature of the events calendar in an important part of the recovery of the east in the natural environment cheers thank you even and there was actually a really good budget submission or it should have gone to the budget committee or perhaps in terms of events to the community committee however and you 've just had our really good chance to influence the entire council at the time when we starting the budget so we 'll continue through the remainder of the last couple of minutes is there any questions Paul in German David Lee who she have you apply apply the Phantom from City Council this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emma right and here there will be the end or march this we applied in 2012 for funding we receive for a half thousand I think of five and a half thousand dollars from rich bottom fund and we had a shortfall which we approach that both the wards for from the discretionary fund which we topped up with about two grand from each in order to make that festival happen i had sir personally underwrite it to the chain of thirty thousand dollars to make it happen and we didn 't know we had funding effect until after the pistol happens and we managed to put all the pieces together last year we applied to council to get an invincible team together and employ them professionally to do it we applied for a grant for 75,000 from the Metropolitan funds we got another scene um probably make a good enough case I don 't know but it 's been very difficult to access funding our funding has come from other streams out sort of council okay I deserve a thank you even for your presentation and I really want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there you 're doing a great job and I 'm a big supporter of these types of festivals and especially SEO work and the east two things first is that a you promote and your graph engagement protocol East and vision promotes pathway for people place and play and prosperity to thrive in the East are you working with the coastal pathway people to preps connect so there 's a greater integration and right across the East certainly have a relationship with the coast of pathway people and you 'll find some of the I don 't you 've got the events that happened you 'll find some of you bent happened in the mount pleasant area and now there 's real opportunity to use it there 's actually a crystal clay there yeah and there 's a lot of negotiation as well and discussions around making that pathway connect up around the history to other potential pathways along the river corridor so you absolutely we see that all interconnected the other thing to just a sick of other question is that a sponsorship is another obviously revenue stream that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunities and the interface both festivals were sponsored by foodstuffs Community Trust the first year they had a little bit extra and they could he to do put this create recovery work so we got 15,000 for that and last year we got 5,000 we have had in kind sponsorship from many organizations and providing trait management plans etc etc a pro bono but increasingly we found last year that people are over the earthquake recovery generosity and so it became a lot more hard work we have had some assistance from some staff with them Sarah to try and make links with appropriate potential sponsors but it 's a it 's a difficult thing because if council is not supporting it that 's one of the first questions they say is council supporting this well with applying we don 't know yet I can tell us when you do know and that negotiation goes on till beyond the end of the festival thank you even for your contribution today my comment is more of a statement to the probably the rest of us here and that I think really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place in the annual plan needs quite a review last weekend I was at the sand castle contest in New Brighton and there was 30,000 people and that had a minimal with no support from from the city as well so I think there is a need for a quite an edge and review of their their event management and in its place in the annual plan as well too well done for what 's happening though heaven and the in your organization and its contribution to the recovery of the east thank you you mentioned before about red tape and you know if you bought in an event professional event manager that a lot of their time can be wasted on red tape because you actually want them to execute the event can you give us an example of that I 've actually got three quick questions this is just one I mean it 's just just three and i guess the pending applications are very difficult in this protective process trying to work out we apply to what committee you go to to get some recognition we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years trying to get some traction here and so i guess the whole drug receipt of of getting all the ducks in a row to get it make a festival happen it detracts this hard workers organizing it but getting to let the the funding all the consents fully going through the right channels trying to find the right channels the Vince management service probably has all of that has the experience of that so they can do it a lot quicker than a community organization can with this organization you see a lot of organizations saying one stop shops but they are driven and turn me to be created and then you get external users and it just doesn 't work because the internal version of a one person running one stop shop is totally alien to to what 's outside of this organization had someone who are non financial assistance that would work with you to take you through all so whether its consent getting permission to use counsel and all that type of thing would that cut through a lot of the red tape there 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on getting around by a different person each week saying I 'm your liaison person I think one person yeah yeah this was meant to be one person they said i 'm your one liaison every week it was a different person so I mean that 's partly the problem the other problem I think is that they gave the impression and I might be wrong is their job was to manage that the processes in the funding it wasn 't there to support us so we ended up having increasingly decreased expectations of what to what we could achieve until it 's to the point where it becomes a community fear rather than the festival realistically the one-stop shop is non-existent there are support people out there in this is it a great deal of many good frontline staff out there I think they get tangled and processes and bureaucracy okay thank you now I just let this current I just hear that this is about much more than four I mean funding as a key element but actually it 's about how do we as account so embrace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helping it to blossom is it it 's kind of I think so it is but at the same time we don 't want to become a political football and that process either um so I I think it 's about what priorities council has for its events program generally not strategy for events and how much of that is in-house how much of it is funded to be provided for external etc so that our understand you 're reviewing those pinner processes so this has a role with the net but all I 'm saying is that when net review play process please consider going out sort of business as usual type of events and please consider not just investing on events that happen in the central city even 22 community boards are around this area potential for you working with them so they are like the council working with us to get it going is that can you that I open we did do deputations to both those community boards but what it tends to do is actually fragments the whole process and actually multiplies the amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something can i comment that 's a really unfortunate i think we need that process flowing which is your we say you 've made councillors very aware of a budget issue and logistics issue and let me just suggest a number of ways of you dealing with us first of all if it doesn 't happen on the 25th 26th and you will notice that weather weather does then you have the opportunity to present to the annual plan budget obviously or if you 're stuck you can come to the Metropolitan Grants Committee as well and it sounds like your community boards would both like to support you on this if it doesn 't happen to be in the budget but you 'll know that at the end of their mark okay did you very much okay thank you very much indeed for you even for being so good and pull money up yourself okay and write the agenda","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"
NZ,NZ,Christchurch City Council,Christchurch City Council,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZETwErnCvvgbvBbnnHfyxA,12.02.14 - Item 4 - Presentations - Part 2,V7vMidxsiQY,20140211,1703.24,"Christchurch, New Zealand",4976,thank you okay I 'm 4 g 's for being slightly late we just proved you couldn 't get from Wellington to hear by eight-thirty firstly thank you for making the time to hear from us I 'm really just going to talk through some of the issues that arose in the report on the Canterbury earthquakes that we released last December and I think it 's really important to understand that this report is not a sort of an a complete look bag and sort of critical analysis of what 's going wrong what 's gone right part of it has been actually that there is nothing like this in the world in relation to human rights analysis of disaster recovery this is the first time it 's been all brought together and um I was in Geneva last with a week for last and there 's considerable international interest in this work so in a number of the standards that we refer to in this report actually only came in after the earthquake so there 's a lot of learning one of the key things that we decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that we weren 't going to sit back and wait five years to do some sort of inquiry into what went wrong and this is very consistent with the guidance to Human Rights institutions that it was really important for us to engage with affected people in particular and people who could make a difference to their lives and effectively not be the ambulance at the bottom of the curve all the people actually reporting on the emeralds but trying to head off problems before they arise so we 've taken a very pragmatic and practical approach and advocated for the last two or more years really that people should be at the center of the recovery process and you can you can see examples of that in the report from advocating for flexible settlement dates insulation being installed during the repair process the intervention in the quake outcast case or examples and there 's many more of ways in which the Commission has generally quite quietly intervened so the report itself is product of two years of working with the people of Canterbury local government and the central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I say non-government organizations don 't include particularly what we call the pop ups the the organizations that grew out of the earthquake and aren 't necessarily even formally incorporated they have been amongst the most valuable people that we 've worked with one of the things that we 're really pleased to see over the course of the two years is that people have come to understand that this is New Zealand 's greatest human rights challenge and the government itself reinforced that in Geneva last in the last couple of weeks and we all explain a little bit more about that and also appreciation of how a approach of putting people first people at the center and particularly involving the affected people and developing the solutions can actually improve both the outcomes of the solutions and certainly improve the psychosocial health of the people you involve and I 'm just going to very briefly brief you on the report and then let you ask me any questions you might have so the first thing as the Commission 's position is that the Canterbury the human rights issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facing new zealand today other sort of human life 's issues that countries that have been in conflict or countries that are developing normally face and we have them in the middle of a developed country two weeks ago when I was at the United Nations periodic review of New Zealand 's human rights record the impact of the earthquakes and the recovery process was one of the theme I stand there there 's that what it do unless the Collins and her response was very clear of what she called the challenges in the story cognize the ones human rights legislation with international obligations and the major challenge that sheave referred to as the one we would agree with which is the middle human it is the right to health there is a human right to health and then the the other interesting area has really been around housing not only housing as housing is a there is a right to an adequate house in international human rights law it 's part of the right to an adequate standard of living that doesn 't mean that government has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are provided in the state are adequate as defined by international law which includes things like habitability affordability security of tenure and things like that but the other side of it is perhaps even harks back to the 1840s and the confiscations that happened thereafter parqueo New Zealanders have understood what it means we 've had Park area New Zealanders coming to us and saying does the Treaty of Waitangi apply to me and so the issue of property rights has assumed a much more important situation with us as a result of the Canterbury earthquakes that 's been picked up by the constitutional review panel which was chaired by to read sona 's as you may know and and really that is about people being what it 's really about was best put to me by a red zone at 80 year old red zone who said you know I didn 't realize for this is quite why I bought my house in the sense that i bought it so i could be free from interference from others now everybody is telling me what to do in my house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspect of one 's home that is important to your human dignity into your feeling of freedom and a place where you can be yourself and you could be with your family without interference from people like us and in others so that 's a really important thing to think about it 's just how much home is related to dignity the other thing I think that 's very important and to understand is that home yet you have in your city one of the leading examples of reform of public health in the world in the work being done with a cannery health system but that system is based around having people in their homes not in the hospitals so if their homes aren 't adequate if they 're cold old and moldy they will be sick and we 've just got to make sure that the system values the savings that are being made in the health system when considering the expenditure should be made in the house system so some of the things that you were doing around wants our fitness now and other things are things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been seeing and I don 't think it 's any surprise to you high levels of psychosocial harm and we 're obviously the primary stressor for that is the earthquake but the secondaries stresses are acknowledged by both us and the government to be financial strip distress unresolved insurance claims and poor an insecure Housing and Community dislocation and she the two chairs of the Constitution review but that really well in terms of the Reds owners about we forget that ninety-five percent of the support of any of us does not come from local government or national government and all the money and services they provide but from our family in the community around us and when that disappears you notice it and that that 's what the community dislocation is and then this if we move people out of communities we 've got a sort of real a cake you know reconnect them with that support if they 're going to survive the the critical thing I suppose is so far a lot of money has gone into the last really in the last 12 months began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the health system into the education system and other places and the other thing to work on is trying to avoid the problem occurring that 's where a lot of our focus is and a lot a lot of everyone 's focuses and trying to actually am stop stop the cause of stop and prove that will remove the stresses from deal with the financial stress deal with the housing deal with the insurance issues and none of these issues and the insurance issue is unusual in the sense that this was one of the most insured events in world disaster history but but these levels of psychosocial harm our scene after disasters so it 's not necessarily a human rights abuse that we 're seeing high levels of psychosocial ham need to make that clear we 'll only be able to judge 5 or 10 years from now whether this is worse then might have been expected okay the kick their the rights that are involved just to just quickly summarize them are the right data good housing the right to health the right to property the right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participation in decision-making the Commission has been involved since 2011 in working on the people centred approach we do see and that if you put effective people that decision center of decision-making and solution development you get better services and stronger recovery for everyone the report aims to share practical lessons from the recovery to improve the situation for affected residents and help their better decisions better services and a stronger recovery for everyone and there are lots of positive examples the but the difficulty of writing a report like this is to try an get the balance right between the good things that are going on the things that need to be fixed we 've made 33 recommendations in the report to improve access to adequate housing health services and help make business or help business make a more proactive contribution to the recovery some of those are for the future so there was a bit of publicity that timely made the report about the rent control suggestion what that was really in the context of was saying if you are going to have a situation where you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of an area of of people so you ever create housing demand as it were movement of migrant workers in there needs to be some work around understanding the economic consequences of that and what could be done to mitigate those consequences and in we 're not we were really saying that something like rent control is one thing that could have been considered in the past but the horse is probably bolted the in in terms of one of the things that really strikes you when you 're working i 'm sure it 's truck view is that everybody involved in the earthquake recovery is working really really hard and try to do the right thing and we include the insurance companies for example in that list but the analogy that best i think sums up the situation which came for a senior executive in a bank said it 's like we 're all in a swimming pool with about 30 lanes with big really big lane markers and we 're all swimming sometimes different strokes as fast as we can towards the end which was to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lanes doesn 't equal up equal the solution and we 've got to somehow break down those lanes in some of those areas and join the people working together to come up with better solutions for example banks have a longer-term view of the world then insurance companies can have when they 're dealing with the same customer and some and so we are trying to encourage some of these silos to get together and work together on on solutions to the problems that we we see and we do think the council has an important part to play and leading that work you know think I 'm helping remove the black line markers and bring the players together and we do see that good progress has been made on rebuilding the infrastructure but we have a long way to go on the psychosocial recovery and a lot of those of the reasons I say we believe the key is putting people at the center of the recovery and in that the best that 's what it 's been all about and just two examples and the mentioned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house and the people in the house at the center of that and that 's saving tens of millions of dollars already now that would have had to have been done even if there hadn 't been an earthquake you know we simply can 't afford to put all our old people into care we need to find other way so that housing is part of the key another good example and services were you know you know we appreciate that the City Council has been quite staunch when confronted with suggestions that services might be cut off in pointing out that it has statutory obligations to provide services so a good example of a services issue that we has already been addressed was New Zealand Post so New Zealand poster decided it couldn 't provide services and the way it normally did in the red zone consulted with the people in the red zone and came up with different ways of solving the problem so people could get post and that 's the sort of approach the individuated talk to the people about what their needs are come up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of our sort of key key worries at the moment as we share concerns concern that there are hundreds of people still stuck and by stac we mean they just don 't know what to do they an and we we support their idea and that probably the solution is some sort of door-knocking effort by organizations like them just just to make absolutely sure before the winter that we 've actually identified every vulnerable household that that has throughout the last two years been quite a revealing issue and that that in total the system doesn 't know who the vulnerable people are we just don 't know and it 's so silly surprised me but I do understand I understand it the systems line I 've just heard the Privacy Commissioner coming two ns are coming in here about the difficulties of information sharing in government and that relationship with privacy but we 've got to fight out of these vulnerable people out before the next winter and we 've got it to everything we can to make good in the evenin temporary ways their shelter and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in addition to those that one in front of us at the moment we still are determined to see Christ Church of the meet that vision of being the most accessible Crocker surf city in the world disabled people are counting on that and so far the few exceptions we 've seen good progress in that area and the other area that 's you know coming on us as migrant workers and the service again was discussed in Geneva New Zealand it didn 't sign the market with workers convention human rights convention because we really didn 't have any to worry about but now we do and we probably if even if we didn 't sign the convention we need to learn from those countries that have fun you know have significant market workers in there in the inner place so that 's really a summary of the issues and I 'm open to any questions thank you very much for your presentation you covered a lot of areas that realm vulnerable people in those psychosocial factors you referred to two groups like Kent or concern doing that work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small number of other groups are doing that is this and like basically you 're really saying look we don 't know what we don 't know about what it 's still going to head us this year so is that an area which perhaps our Council and our community boards might also be able to be involved with something like that door knocking exercise that you referred to yeah and I think it is I think I just there 's a real opportunity for the council to lead I mean one thing I should have said too is we really appreciated what the mayor said about keeping the politics out and not make and not playing political games with Christ Church and that 's you know I think that 's the council that can lead there I um I don 't think anyone would disagree with what you said was regards to the problems and issues that people are facing in Christchurch and look I 'm sure people are trying the hardest insurance companies included in there but i 'd be very keen to know what you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually put some pressure on those who can make a difference i mean i do take issue with the comment with regards to this you know the most insured country in the world and this is a huge event and so forth I mean the auditor general 's report on EQC made it perfectly clear as you will know that the organization was set up to handle such an event and there is an expectation of a level of preparedness and three years down the track to say we 're the most insured country in the world and this is an unprecedented event is unacceptable so with all due respect to you I do have an issue with that so at what point can the Commission knowing what it 's done journalist work actually say no and maybe it 's with government and local government and the insurance council and so forth in eq c no this isn 't acceptable you need to pull your finger out yeah well I mean we firstly we have been doing that okay and we 've been doing it quietly rather than in in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the whole good and not you know but we 're by no means the it in part of the problem there is the silo issue but you know which includes government silos as well as iki see and insurance company silos but the the you know one of the interesting things i think has been here that the sort of leg guards and leaders have shifted around in in the insurance industry over over their time so we know there 's a there 's a commitment to do the right thing and I mean I 'm meeting one of the only insurance companies today to see what is going on and try and understand why things aren 't really should be the so so one thing we can do is point out to them as we have done you know that there are standards that they have to meet and that we don 't think they 're meeting them and you know make some suggestions about how there 's one of the problems with the sort of enforcement if you like side of this is that there are no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business and human rights area that the whole area of business and human rights was stuck for decades in a battle between civil society and business over whether these things could be litigated or not and in 2011 when they exceed all these rules in they effectively decided that they weren 't going to be litigated so there is a route through which has been used X to buy some of the insured people through the OECD guidelines through the National contact point which is mb to complain that the businesses are not complying with their international obligations as regards business and human rights but that 's a long route and what we 're trying to do as I say is to continue to work away with it with the companies to get changes in behavior and I do think that the Nick one of the next key steps is actually getting particularly the banks and insurance companies together to try and you know see whether we can and get things unstuck by having him work together yeah I 'm just aware that we 've actually reached the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compelling so i 'm going to allow I know that will be quitted more so I 'm just going to allow a bit longer being aware that we have got a time limit on our meeting do you do by the way are you doing public presentations so that people can hear what you just said and yeah we 've here Cecilia so keep it short I 'm thank you for the presentation I guess my concern is it 's just you 've got its cottage and even everything but that doesn 't help your neighbors that does it help out what I really want to know is the meat in the sandwich can do you is a group within government have some to muscle to push things along I mean we 've got there must be documentation on every household affected by this earthquake held by either eqc or Syria or some government agency you 've mentioned that the council kezule could have a lead role and door knocking surely with with all these agencies it 's just at a point now it 's three years but not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appalled and to be quite honest yeah what is the next step I mean your analogy with the swimming pool is so correct at silo in which should not be acceptable more style yeah I mean thank you the we met I don 't know now that provide us exactly how many men together six to eight months ago with the tents ESO the social sector and Syria and others and you know had a real session about you know this is you know this is not acceptable we need to join us out now what the arrow impression was that that was happening and we 're now trying to find out exactly whether it has happened or not because the cancer suggestion would suggest that hasn 't happened right so we need to sort of get back on the horse and look at that and try and find out because there 's what it is unacceptable we have to find a way particularly particularly in a way for you know if the counter for council is going to lead it needs to know what information us needs to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because if we need to know that information sometimes we 're told we can 't have it that 's right that 's something that we 've really got to get onto I think that you know like checking up every six months you know that 's very quickly to go through three years checking up every six months so I think there 's got to be government organizations are relevant of insurance companies because they 're private organizations but we 're talking government or local government that areas that we can control you get ever say it 's yeah well one thing that is going on every month but has been going off some time as the auditor-general Ombudsman and I meet with the SSC to try and bring it bring the issues at their level and they will bring an agency 's to do it so I think one of the things we could do probably better with the council is make sure that you can feed into that process and vice versa come back to your let you know what we see is going on yeah and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we totally understand where you 're coming from what we want is solutions and if you 've got part of them and we 've got part of them and other groups and individuals have got part of them we want to put that all together so the lanes disappear in the swimming pool and and I 'm just wondering actually given the sort of the depth of knowledge that you 've got on the subject whether it 's useful to sort of sit down with you for a couple of hours and just go through a program of what needs to happen we 're very happy to do that okay yeah II last question I mean that was kind of um quick let 's go to my point you 've got this big report there 's a number of recommendations it was done in december did you give up do present this to the council who and council I know these recommendations here that reflect counts or what I 'd really love to see is a kind of list of the recommendations that you 've made and what council should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I don 't know of yet seen it is there someone here yeah so has it been a response from me no I mean we haven 't written it came late and just in December and there hasn 't been a sort of any sort of official response blow I think that 's a good idea okay so then we created a council centric version yeah and I think that would be really useful I also kind of wondered if you 've given the recommendations to government or Sarah and whether they had to respond or withered oviya agent in my lord well I mean one of the things about the way we do reports is that we allow agencies and NGOs to see what we 're saying about them if we 'll say something so many of you know it 's always a bit of chicken and eggs things get done ahead of you raise an issue and it get it done so you 're then reporting on what 's actually positively happened so there 's a there 's a bit of that that going on in the process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about things like heritage but you don 't make any recommendations about going back to some sort of proper process you talk about the appointed EK and commissioners that you don 't make any recommendation around the right for people to vote yellow leaves yeah I 'm pretty fundamental ya know netra garland we respect you know that we dissipation yeah we did it 's a select committee on the attend hearings quite strongly assert that issue and the need for Canterbury ins delete their representative so it should be remembered that was the recommend a return to local democracy yeah pretty yeah me too so yeah so we 've you know that 's something we 've certainly sittin it 's literally process I think thank you for the work you 're doing and I 'm I can 't you know say how much I you know I totally agree with what you 're saying in terms of the human rights and I just think the loss of democracy in our city is unfounded unparalleled and in the New Zealand history so thank you for the work you 're doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of taking school that because I since that everybody will want to take with them are you meeting with ccd you or Sarah while you 're down here not this not this time we do it regularly I 'm just wondering if it would be sensible if we try to organize a meeting with you the council and maybe Sarah or and even though that doesn 't quite put people at the front of the recovery and that net meeting and so because I just like to explore what are the things that need doing we know a lot of them and all of what you see just resonates incredibly well but I just like us to sort of then allocate the tasks and get on with her sphere if there 's something you are happy to look at yeah it is and we and we had a discussion we met the me at last week and had a discussion along you know along similar lines yeah that 's okay thank you for your time,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

3,ndwAkRPHXWA,20140211,990.749,"Christchurch, New Zealand",2547,yes people and these these are deportations and they 're 10 minutes and thank you to this group for giving us all of the information and advance it 's incredibly helpful so if you would like to yeah say what anything else that you would like to add to it and then we 'll yeah okay thank you thank you fifty marissen Thank You commissioners for allowing me the opportunity to come back this is not my first deputation regarding the Christchurch international hub in fact I was here a year ago and I spoke to cancel a golf chain Livingston and cancel a Yanni but anyway I am here to make another appeal because as you will well appreciate the matters that we 're dealing with in regard to assisting businesses and my colleague here we work a lot with displaced ethnic businesses in fact we volunteered our time all of last year assisting communities who have been displaced market operates as backpack operators people who used to work in the CBD restaurant tours and to see what we can do to a system and so we have come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution we feel would be able to assist people by looking at a concept of this Christchurch international hub and I just wanted to put the matter into context by sort of bringing it home by having David who used to own a language school just describe what he 's had to go through in terms of trying to relocate his business which of course works in the same area with the international students thanks chase and thanks to the deputy mayor in the counselors the opportunity to come in on one of the examples of some people have been displaced we 've moved please three times since the earthquake at the moment we 've got premises in mona vale avenue and it 's really a lovely location but it 's um it 's too small for what we need and they 're also like to say thank you to the council because twice now though goodness resource consent to teach in residential areas but they 're published with insurance and anyway the number we really want to get back into the city we we 've been going a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had education contact stick with teach workplaces he and numeracy and anyway we teach lots and lots of that migrants we find that being in the suburbs is a real handicap where one of the forces at once because we haven 't got all our eggs in one basket the international market I mean the fact that we 've got the the government contracts as a name of us to survive because I remember before the earthquake there are over 30 english language skills in the in the in the city there might be five or six left and i think that loss of those some those students really Rob 's the city of a sense of vitality I feel that anything we can do with this especially international hub if we can bring the young people overseas students back into the center of the city that 'll add more than just money it 'll add that sense of vitality we lots of lots have been written and said about how sad the unit part of the city is but if we could do follow this project through to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and be a real boost in the time hash but it 'll be an increase in the in the optimistic outlook and the riveting of the the center part of the city because at the moment people like myself and other business have moved moved west they 've gone out to rigaton and we 're in the situation there we were a bunch of suburbs looking for a heart you know we it 's anyway opps enough oh yeah no problem Thanks like the extra mile that 's great so I just wanted to say of course you will need no educating about the impacts that the earthquakes have had and I 'm quite pleased that the forum is focused on solutions now we have put forward decide this proposal and I 'm pleased that cancer the lonsdale is sitting here as well because you will have experience in helping earthquake affected businesses having champion dad being behind the restart more project so we feel that anything we can do which is a weather of a temporary nature or helps us to look forward and helps communities move forward will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help relocate over 50 business owners as I 've mentioned the types of businesses and I believe that the benefits of colocation in a market area of this sort which were proposing would bring business and owners and customers together stimulate activity and economic growth with low overheads join promotion and shared capital investment and therefore in that respect is a very sensible solution to alleviate an immediate agency that exists for many displaced operators speaking of business is located in homes that again is adding pressure to the competition for the homes that are required by people looking for homes and I think also that there 's an opportunity to put our city on pie in terms of being able to promote our city as a place for migrant said for the international workers for students who are coming so we 've already received support from the cpit which has lots of students and they 're constrained by a lack of premises backpacker operators and Tim Hunter has written a support letter which you saw and you 'll be interested to know as well that you know in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been diverted from Christchurch because of a lack of visitor destination point so and I guess in essence it 's just a matter that a center of this sort would serve many uses in terms of creating jobs and helping with tour ism I 'm just thinking that it would be sensible if we got the questions because there is such a great start before Jimmy does the list and proposal that you 've given us is specific to a site in near street yes it need to be it doesn 't need to be but I have chosen that site for a number of reasons because of its proximity to the retail precinct to cpit current shopping malls and the arterial routes and also its zoning bingle mixed-use it means that we could also have inner city accommodation such as bad purposes suit and but if the site is going to be perhaps used for other things are there other sites that this could go on and what would you actually need to make at least the market part of this happen well I think we 'll just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the last consoles that they seem to be no other alternative sites but I could be wrong in that respect yeah absolutely yeah yeah absolutely I 've tried to look through the private sector and either very inhibitive in terms of costs or we have to go much further outside the CBD I think it would be sort of sensible here bloody esata you know would like to support about my understanding original the University Council all the kind of the central city recovery plan we have put into an international the court in there but after data Sarah they take a lead you know Tula quite your central recovery print they take away so we 're what is the sailors the response well Sarah supportive in principle of the proposal however they 've indicated that given the number of anchor projects and government projects that they have to look after that they haven 't necessarily got a site that they can allocate to us but perhaps brokering with council might make sense in this respect to see what alternatives they actually have second question is that because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a kind of presentation pure is time I remember we request your presentation you know to the staff whether you have engaged with the council stuff whether you get any response from lid and the solar no more posses request for proposal you can you know get a yodel also to the other style well that has been one problem of faced is that the council staff member who has been tasked with this it 's been not been very forthcoming and i 'm not sure what reasons are behind that but we 've said lee tried and there was discussions that he was working on a tender document at the end of last year that has never been finished to us so you know it 's it 's difficult if we are trying to do something and you don 't seem to be getting the support you require well my initial request would be that if we were to set up a temporary market even if from the region of at least two to three years it would certainly help us to get some momentum last one up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group in a multicultural group have engaged with you in a supporter this iron well I 've got the assigned expressions of interest here which we prepared and we 're looking at well over fifty business owners yeah what um I I guess for us it would be really good to know sarah ccd you that I mean that I 've got heaps of land in the central city the biggest landowner in the central city by far now they 've taken well we 've given them roads and you know they 've just got unlimited space really where there 's a need for activity to happen so you know when did you approach sierra ccd you have you been to them recently is there anything we can get in writing from them over you know possibility of support or assistance because it you know if I think of the rest up more for example and you look up cash or more I mean it just seems this huge areas in a central city that they really have control this is like probably one of the few sites we actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I understand a request for proposals process but but we 're very constrained in terms of what we have they seem to have a lot so I was concerned for you to say that they said they didn 't have yeah I mean we can suddenly go back but it does feel like going back and forth without getting any progress so yes if we could work with council to get sarahs indication and insert into what is available not available that would be helpful maybe we could as an outcome of today 's meeting I would like us to approach Sarah ccdu about areas of land you okay so it 's just that enable you to move forward the bottom line is if we could come up with or with you with a piece of land there week at least and if it was temporary two to three years yeah you would not need any financial or other input from this council to all you need just to get so at the stage the market going yeah so there 's all you need absolutely because we 've engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active lawyers we have enough on that crowd so we just need land yeah okay say thank you kissing yeah look I think I set up the market and restarted and it is difficult to set up markets but what we did in the am is we bought the market to the council streets especially sitting on council land and my suggestion to this council is perhaps we look at Street lines that we can actually activate around existing businesses and I 'm talking maybe your region street is that they need a lot of help there 's also lower high street where again they need a lot of help and we need to activate you know the street line so aside from land we could actually assist in and getting use of some public space and for a temporary so just because I generate some income so we could look at other options yeah that 'll be good I mean we 'll be happy to put Markieff and make some sort of a start with very can do in that respect can I just ask a question before I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides what 's the status call on that at the moment it has as it has about five proposals for it so I 'm dead that 's why I 'm just looking at you need some land and there is plenty of land in the center of town at the moment and there is a dearth of activity so you want to put activity on land there 's plenty of land and know it it doesn 't seem that hard to me actually so what I 'm going to suggest that we do is that Jane will undertake that 's one of the appropriate staff person will bring you by the end of the week and we 'll start working with you and then in two months time the school come back to this committee does that work for you test yeah that would be fine yes okay I think giving us a in and as certain direction would assist the community different be clear though like we 're currently in an RFP jay gets this question when we 're currently open for it arif have we released the rfp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holdup because with i mean this is like the fourth time i 've heard from tears last time when we heard from them we say well we 're going through an open public process for people to put an arrow fees and that 's the appropriate way for us to make you know way up the different options it just doesn 't seem to be getting any traction so you know it couldn 't maybe when the person gets back to tears if I can give some time frames around that document and processes why is I mean eventually such a center has to be located in a permanent space but yeah sure yeah oh absolutely yes yes I agree with it yeah that 'll be there will be a good stuff yeah that 'll be a good stuff okay wonderful all right thank you so much,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

1,6lc7zRpaVVc,20140211,1202.859,"Christchurch, New Zealand",3014,"and just so everybody is aware there is a strict timeline on on these and that will include the questions so probably a clock will go up thank you for coming and we are in your heads trust and with me today I have Dave maggots and Mike Vincent I 've provided copies of a report we 've produced for counselors two weeks ago to provide it to your staff so if you 've had a chance to read that I 'm just going to quickly run through the role of the style places fast in general terms and since the period of the earthquakes I 'm going to quickly run through to you some statistics which hopefully you 'll find of interest and really then look just to leave you with some key messages from from our perspective so they start places trust as an autonomous crown entity I have to pick up the next slide please that 's approximately eighty percent funded by the crown through the ministry of culture and heritage we operate under the requirements of the crown entities act and the Historic Places act the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minister for arts culture and heritage Minister Finn listen and incorporates Maori heritage council as an automaton immerse crown entity is not subject to direction by the government on matters of heritage policy immediately after the 2010 earthquake event started about contacting over 500 heritage building owners and Canterbury to provide free expert heritage and structural engineering advice we 've also been providing heritage assessments and individual reports to the Earthquake Recovery Authority and to the ccd you to inform their decision-making and respect of them exercising section 38 of their act our normal and ongoing role was to assist in the long-term survival of highly significant heritage places while he tapu and why he 'd to Pune and archaeological sites next slide please we also give support to district councils through the Resource Management Act recognizing that it is the council 's and Environment Court who are the decision makers and respect of our protection of heritage we also provide and center funding for the conservation of category one and while heat up who entries on the New Zealand stop basis trust register and with providing important support to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owner responsible for 48 heritage properties located throughout New Zealand which are managed as a cultural tourism attraction and notably other time world station in Littleton ok just to quickly run through some statistics we 've broken this down across the Christchurch City Council geographical area to Christchurch central registrations and what you 'll see there is a pretty close split between what is our understanding of what has been retained or retention is likely through discussion with sarah and ccd you and what has been demolished there is still quite a large portion there fourteen percent and two percent of heritage sites at risk or or where the situation simply is not knowing these figures a measured against that New Zealand Historic Places Trust register just prior to the earthquakes and therefore differ to the statistics people produce for the Earthquake Recovery Minister through the Sarah reports which baseline in July 2012 is the point of start so it ignores the fact that quite significant numbers of historic buildings were demolished prior to that point these statistics are also slightly skewed at the fact that Christ College and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two locations because of multiple registrations so that again probably highlights more attention than is actually the case if you go to the next slide please that there is looking at outer Christ ships are outside the for the central Christ it 's outside the four avenues and you can see there on that one also does not include banks peninsula or or littleton so again showing quite a relatively small portion of retention definite or likely a huge portion at 30 p 2 percent with situation simply is not knowing and that is through discussion with property owners in the Earthquake Recovery Authority position at this point are being unclear the next slide things again looking at littleton retention definite around thirty seven percent of historic sites quite a large portion thirty-five percent already demolished and again getting close to thirty percent where we believe our at risk or simply still not known and moving on to the next slide is broken down just as banks peninsula much more positive but with lesser items and lots of registrations though through a Carrara of old wooden buildings and particular so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city as a whole so you can see there forty seven percent retention definite or likely so over half of christchurch of 501 registered historic sites either demolished the situation unknown or at risk and again a large portion over quarter where we simply don 't know what the situation is or we believe they 're they 're still at risk just to the final slide their plea thank you so really that the key thing i just wanted to leave with you was the situation under your term as council will be we 're teetering around the fifty percent loss and it 's which side of that mark do we go will we end up with over half the historic sites of christchurch lost or will it be better than that and there is a large portion in the order of twenty to thirty percent where the situation is where there are sites still at risk three years on which in some case may be due to safety they may be due to economic or other social reasons as determined by others we look forward to continuing to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helen and phillip barrett who will our staff will work very closely with and also we 've we 're working closely with the neighboring districts are selling and why McCreery i think i 'll just leave it there and there 's any questions thank you from capsule livingston and apologies for lateness can cancel meeting they 've both accepted and i also should just met people who are submitting know that this is their life strength i should have it you know before 10 my apologies are there any Christians can 't slice me of also being counseled unit thank you for your presentation can you let us know how the talks regarding that the cathedral might be progressing in any way and in what way ways council might and support you of those yeah thank you for the question counselor are today there 's nothing to report we 've received no feedback from the owner of the cathedral the church property trustees but we have had engagement with the greater christ church building trust who keen to engage in some form of torts thank you i 'm guessing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of reasons some of them because they were dangerous some of them as a result of section 38 notices issued by Sarah do you have a point of contact within Sarah and do you have an open line of communication there 's working are you able to make some comments on that place yeah we very early on in the process babe maggots as a specialist heritage architect was sitting with in the Sarah operations team advising we produce reports for them on the heritage significance and we often give some commentary over the information provided in engineering reports or the positions of the the owner for Sarah to to make that decision and we have had regular ish meetings with the Earthquake Recovery Authority throughout periods times over the last three years where we get updates it 's not perfect the communications but it 's there and we have a good level of contact and working relationship with them but ultimately the decision is with them thank you several questions about thanks for the work that you 're doing pretty bleak statistics really um have you got any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repaired that have been demolished versus the ones that were just you know destroyed in the earthquake or beyond on any sense of review I don 't but but like all these things of it in any building can be fixed if you 're prepared to throw enough money at it and I guess that 's the difficulty and it it 's where that balance is found and I guess that 's been the challenge you know for the Earthquake Recovery Authority and I know you know there 's many cases that yeah they have taken it time they 've looked carefully at the information that 's been provided to them before these decisions are made so I guess elephant the answer is no right I 'm taking question as I note that there 's no mention of here around what 's happening in the red zone do you have any listed heritage properties within the red zone with in Christchurch City know why macryrie district we have a three remaining buildings but in christchurch city known and and that follows on to my next question is how proactive have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the the impact of the earthquake and the loss of so much and identifying any new buildings that should have greater protection given a sec substance really good question we 've have not been proactive at all that registering new buildings we have taken of you to not go down that route whilst particularly whilst has been uncertainty with insurance companies and owners and it 's often seen as being interference or unnecessarily perhaps so but to the state would not we 've not been looking at new registrations and it 's also an internal resourcing issue as well so I 'm glad you mentioned resourcing I look in here you say you 're getting more emergency applications for archaeological sites do we need to be asking government for more resource for you to actually be able to deal with the archaeological sites and possibly do new listings and actually be be able to be a little bit more proactive I just it 's quite concerning to hear some of the developers complaining about you know how long it takes and what a disruption it is but some of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is being done around archaeological sites and that it 's just kind of seen as a you know thing that people go through a process but there 's actually no real meaning given to yeah there 's under the ordering council we have three days to turn around an application we have processed with one member of staff one archeologist you supported now by one other person he 's been the same person throughout the whole process is not missed a deadline of turning an application around within three days he 's now processed in excess of 1,700 applications there has been an increase we have under the order and counselor there 's a designated emergency Canterbury archaeologist so I now have also people designated in kirikiri Wellington and Dunedin to help support whilst you 're really since about November the the applications started to increase tickly as we get into the red zone in the port elgin and just help me understand like why someone you know given that the earthquakes haven 't quite a while ago why they 'd need an emergency archaeological investigation rather than a kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different to other than it 's just the time frames on us to respond I think and where we 're trying to be and are being as pragmatic as we can to turn them around quickly and we have not been as and simply through resourcing and and through trying to assist developers and people recover we have not being as stringent in chasing or checking reports of fines as we might otherwise have done and I think that 's been correct and proper so just a final question as we 're losing a lot of heritage there 's a lot more to be theirs at risk as we 're still waiting for the heritage recovery program it 's you know taking a lot longer than any of us would have liked what is it short of a moratorium you know getting government to put a moratorium on the demolition of listed heritage buildings both yours and ours is there any I mean NF obviously said that they won 't do that is anything else you think we should be doing is a city to try and save our heritage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or we should be doing ourselves to try and halt this really consuming trend I think there 's some interesting statistics overseas at rental returns on historic the length and often in central cities older character buildings get a higher rental return than the newer buildings so I guess it 's ensuring that all the information is presented to the to the owner when they 're in discussions with the Earthquake Recovery Authority around the future of that building to ensure i think all factors are being are being properly considered you know there 's the situation confronting christchurch was one we 're not all buildings could have been saved so identifying really what what are the key city assets that we wish to make some effort to protect was key clearly we still have a number of key assets in sitting in the two cathedrals where the future is uncertain you could probably put the public trust building and that category and same dimension so it 's so it 's really ensuring every opportunity is given to to ensure an option can be found to to save those buildings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you that was really interesting I heard someone speak last night at an event and he was saying that one of the major issues as he sees it and the retention and fighting for buildings is that people don 't understand the value in heritage buildings that these days it 's all about building code hopefully it 'll stand up let 's make sure we get out of the building and a safe then we look back and decide whether it can be saved or not do you think that there is something that following on from what counseling your hand since it 's something the council can do to help you or perhaps you can do strategically to actually inform people to educate them on the value of the buildings when you look at the Greeks you look at the Romans look at how much they value their buildings how well they stood is there a bigger issue around there as well yeah that 's a really good question counselor where we 've with with a with a limited resource and very much with the council heritage response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that we 've provided information we 've we 've had info on our website of preferred well recommended suppliers that can that have knowledge and working with particularly older buildings and unreinforced masonry buildings so yeah I mean we 've tried i 'm thinking more actually in an advertising promotional way so that you can get some understanding and support from the public because clearly that kind of pressure and and support from the public you may help change the stance of some of the developers who are keen to just let them go right okay that 's a that 's a good idea Yes No thank you yeah no I don 't think so other than I think you know we need to continually work with with council staff at you know trying to influence owners where we can and indeed with with the Earthquake Recovery Authority and the ccd you as they progress plans and the blueprint project areas to ensure our remaining heritage is you know enhances those areas okay if I may and I just want you if you 've got it aware of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oh great yeah they look thank you that sounds wonderful yep we 've produced an augmented reality app for four high street which has a couple hundred stories on there from from from from from a range of uses that the street has had in the past which which is interesting we 're trying to work with tourism Canterbury and also members of the council sibling do something similar for Regent Street View Regent Street as well yet look I also i can send something through with a nap but yes yep gotta supers website or at the moment it 's not on iOS it 's suddenly on tablet format yeah I know dreadful yeah I was horrified to see how much it costs to flee across the iOS but we were waiting for it to for iOS 7 to update but you can you can you can pan around high street see images of as it was and it comes up with targets various interviews but it 's a tourism thing with some signage around which we are with QR codes that you can pick up these things it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ which is becoming really right thank you give me a thank-you castings you","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"
NZ,NZ,Christchurch City Council,Christchurch City Council,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZETwErnCvvgbvBbnnHfyxA,30.01.14 - Item 10 - Report of the Housing Committee Meeting of 10 December 2013 - Part 1,hXRMoSFU4IE,20140130,796.24,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1719,the quick note you go right the the first resolution arising out of it or the first recommendation arising out of it as around the smoking policy or non-smoking policy in relation to units that tentative so can we have a mover in a seconder of the committee recommendation Glenn Livingston pauline kata so is there any discussion in Livingston thank you is your see there how much would you like me to not yet if your question is to do with 8.4 I think that council Livingston 's going to dress it would you like me just to go straight into their you know cut to the chase or did you want in background you prefer just to cut to the chase runny yolk okay so you will see the recommendations basically line up from the committee with what the staff head counselor Jones has an amendment to 8.45 and this is going to be a point for and she will speak to that just to clarify over the policy where it comes to remodeling my viewers it 's quite a reasonable policy it 's not to have well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table now so Kim can have you given neck to stuff I 've seen the suggested amendment and have a suggested suggestion related to the suggestion amendment well can you can you move move you 're a mean mountain can we can we use the one that you 've come up with so this is an amendment to a point for line okay staff came up with a change ya know he has change which new perspective been a reflexive you so yeah but we 'll use Ellie 's you okay since she 's moving it yep um yeah I bought this always going on original I 've just I might meet you there here yeah can we get the amendment move so that we can then debater so do i give it to ya ya so do you know if Elly 's got a second for the amendment any one of us you me I was like wings probably quite pulling Kotter ok so we 've got a second sight unseen you want me to say a few words just a full on the game yeah it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the starting point is this is about cost savings you can see how much it costs one unit and you multiply that by 10 which is about the number that have to be redecorated per year you can also see we have supporting this from a tenant 's Protection Association we feel that it meets a legal test there and we also think I think if we put it to the reason ability test that it 's actually quite a reasonable policy too so I think that the thing is just to you know please understand it it 's about it 's about the physical effects on our units in with building new units with redecorating units people can still smoke but we 're saying and this will be built into their tenancy agreements for new units or remodeled units it must be outside those units can we add the words in accordance with 8.1 because I don 't want anyone who 's having remodeling or redecoration to think that there some have been treated differently to somebody who 's moving on to one it 's out the rules in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so because that says tenancy agreements to these new units are to contain a non-smoking clause smoking is only to be permitted on external Porsches with windows and doors closed to prevent cigarette smoke from entering the actual unit so rather than saying that it becomes smoke-free it would be I mean well we could say in accordance with 8.1 yeah because if they smoke outside they 've gotta actually also protect against the smoke going on right so is there any discussion on the amendment yes I just checking with the staff the ability to enforce 8.4 is is not there it would need to be part of a renegotiated tenancy agreement so if it 's a current tenant under current tenancy agreement you can 't automatically go and just say we 're redecorating I 'm sorry you can 't I longer smoke in there so it will be a difficult one to enforce we can do it by agreement and negotiation with the tenant but we would otherwise have to renegotiate a tenancy agreement for an existing tenant so we understand the intent of 8.4 but we don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can 't force it to happen without actually changing a tendency okay can I ask ya is there nothing in the tenancy agreement that enables you to with means what yuming you you know the law and able to enable you to vary the tools all they give notice of a variation on without agreement yeah Paul Paul hull Sue 's city housing manager will be able to answer all right any variation would require about 90 days notice to the Tennessee River okay so so in actual fact what we want is a hybrid of the old 8.4 which is too i mean the lease otherwise a the notice under the tenancy legislation will be assured yeah yep so so can we go up to the original 8.4 and copy it again changing it and bring it down right let 's see if we can do this so agree that when an occupied unit requires modeling rhetoric in it this workers receive but the issue of smoking of a newly de Groot is to be with a view to amending with a view to and mending the tenancy agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be reached then notice of the change of condition will be assured in accordance with the residential tunity residential tenancies eight-year 19 could I just make another suggestion with the view to amending the tenancy agreement can you qualify there so that it 's amending the tenancy agreement free in the tendency to comply with 8.1 yes yes yeah yeah so no no no no no go go back full stop and go and take out the rest delete the rest of that and then with a view to amending the tenancy agreement and accordance was so go back up to the yeah the fear centers and then in accordance with 8.1 and then I think there should be a reference to smoke free Canterbury I mean it has it has to be that has to be by agreement throwing yeah it 's early stuff will take that as a direction anyway yes we would do that okay all right so you heavy with that wedding second does happen I 'm Pauline Cotter second deck all right now any more questions for staff yep ask a staff even these the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendency the agreement no escape the permission to smoking by the new tenants not allowing or small 3 i 'm wondering whether the staff can engage with those the tenants before him maybe some more smoke today i would like to follow the new amended the kind of tenancy agreement maybe they would like to sign you know new new agreement then we can reduce the almost the smokers because why i asked this question i shall consider the ABE compare 8.1 and 8.3 or 7.1 or seven pounds three it looks like you know same same area but they have a too deep in the regulation is if they have a dispute you know how to remediate lease kind of dispute that is my particular concern you we can you know to tottenham this before him they can remediate this reverse the effect whether it is pretty cool possible or not i think the there 's a quite rightly some concerns with the difference between new tenants not being able to smoke in the units and existing tenants that can and so part of the second phase of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke-free canterbury to do cessation courses through our activity service so encouraging tenants to participate in that to give up smoking and following on from that if a tenant decided that they would didn 't no longer want to smoke and wanted to put a clause into the tenancy agreement to reflect that in in line with what 's being mooted here we would we would agree to put an amendment in the tenancy agreement and and we believe it and that helps tenants as well in the sensor that they are visitors turn up to the flat who what we want to smoke they 've got a fallback to say I 'm not allowed to because it 's in my tenancy agreement there any other questions I 've changed the seconder to the amendment because because Pauline was the movie of the original motion she can 't move she can 't secondly secondly amendment so no apparently not so I didn 't know that either so there we go live and learn are there any there 's no other questions is there any comment that people would like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timeframe for these renovations so the renovation is take take place all all year round so alone it 's just you 're rolling yeah rolling renovation in terms of a vacant property and redecorated is that the timeframe you talking about it 's usually about 16 days it takes us to do that way ok thank you no other questions any comments I 'd i 'll put the resolution I 'll put the amendment first sorry so the amendment is sit out on the screen all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried I put the substantive motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no Kerry thank you the next item,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Zealand",1179,Russian we have counselor Turner having submitted a notice of motion and relation to freedom camping so counselor tina i assume is going to move the motion and do I have a seconder for the motion Paul lonsdale so a counselor Tina peps you 'd like to speak to your motion thank you as someone who doesn 't believe in over regulation of anything I 'm only bringing this to the table today because I feel there is a need for us to do something and in my world this is all about balancing the the regulation of fact the more undesirable or controlling collapse of the more undesirable aspects of freedom camping with another function allowing freedom camping where it is appropriate and where there would be no objection to a from our residence now I came back from holidays to a reasonably large amount of correspondence from community members mainly across the peninsula and in a number of locations across the banks peninsula as well so in the a Corot Township particularly around the Acura boat ramp area where we have been some reasonably serious conflict between legitimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to park their vehicles while their voter in the water that was quite widely publicized in the media in fact and other aspects around inappropriate parking on the waterfront in a corolla by freedom campers in campervans which created road safety and traffic issues as well so there are certainly two areas in a corolla where there have been an issue but also other areas in the peninsula where we 've seen aspects of what i would consider to be inappropriate and quite possibly disrespectful freedom camping in Robinson 's bow devotionals infected devotionals there have been freedom campus parking directly outside the camping ground and then using the campgrounds facilities while obviously freedom camping and paying no fees for doing so river is another area where I had concerned residents came to me and again there 's one particular area there where there 's been a consistent problem anding tour said they where where freedom camping was was giving rise to complaints from residents as well and there 's quite a big difference here without wanting to go into too many details this is quite a big difference here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parked away from people 's homes away from the main roadway where it 's not causing any any safety issues where there 's no litter bin left behind where the Vans self-contained and what we saw in Robinson 's Bay for example in an area where there are no public toilets where there are vans been parked there with no facilities on board and you can imagine the potential for the kind of thing that gets left behind in their situation and in fact I was forwarded a photograph from an a Corot residence where it was quite a graphic photo and it was pretty obvious what had been left on the ground behind where freedom campers had been with no facilities the night before and as if that wasn 't bad enough when I zoomed out of the photo what was in the background was the a Corolla lighthouse so that 's the kind of unpleasant behavior by irresponsible freedom campers that we we don 't want to be seeing we certainly don 't want to be subjecting our residents to and where there is clearly a need for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to begin to control over your lateness so you 'll notice I frame promotion quite widely in particular I didn 't mention the word by law because I wanting to preempt the work that staff might do on this and the type of report they might be type of recommendations they might bring back to us in a report I 'm also aware that there was some work done on this in 2010 2011 in anticipation of problems that we thought the Rugby World Cup might bring us of course there were earthquakes in the meantime and priorities and things have changed since then everyone we 're obviously now at a stage where tourism is real problem is becoming prevalence and I think the time is right for us to be getting staff to bring a report to us so that we can consider the appropriate course of action so that we can solve this problem before next summer so I appreciate your support of the motion today through nearly comments Pauline cotton thank you Indian genuinely supportive of Andrews comments here and there was work done on on previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe it was just solved or approached by means and if i 'm correct lee lewis it was Sumner and I think cream and a square and my queen difficult book I 'm has changed but do we have any data you too perhaps silence might be a way to address this issue of injuries yani if you think of the central city and of some which we 're problem spots prior to the earthquake obviously there 's got had such a huge impact on roads and access that is really pretty much impossible to tell but what I can say stuff I 've done a lot of work on this at a national level there 's been freedom camping forums set up we should be seeking advice from our tourism operator as well sorry our tourism holdings company cct Canterbury tourism marketing so there 's a lot of work that 's already been done in this space I think it is really timely that we do get this information coming back to look at what the options are we slightly do because of what 's happened with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arisen because of the earthquake that we now not just now out it is complicated by the fact that in some areas it 's actually Crown land not council land and then it also possibly eat in so depending on where the locations are there might be side alright umm Ali Jones just very quickly till I wonder if there 's a responsibility on behalf of the renting out the vehicles without facilities and then to perhaps I don 't have some brittle material or inform visitors that you know is it yeah yep i said i think that the resolutions wide enough to cover you know that the staff doing that and i 'm sure that I mean we don 't need to tell

welcome back there 's been a lot of discussion over the over the tea break and because we are very keen for the for the ball to get reopened and without waiting for further analysis and costings etc etc we want to go with the staff recommendation which is to get it to sixty-seven percent at a total cost kept at 624 so Andrew Turner 's move that motion Jana Johansson will second and I 'd like to open it up for debate entry thank you very much now first of all I 'd like to thank the three people that came to make deputations this morning very moving deputations with a lot of information in there that certainly leave counselors in no doubt as to the value of this facility to the agoura community in fact the the communities of banks peninsula and also in no doubt as to community involvement and community passion about this facility over a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that had the community not got involved in the Gaiety we may in fact not be having this discussion today because it may not have survived until the earthquakes so the gaze is one of the top 30 identified facilities rebuild project so it has been prioritized and as I say we 've heard today in the the two impassioned deputations the value of this facility has to the community and the level of community involvement in getting this this much-loved facility to the state that it was in prior to the earthquakes to where it was price of the earthquakes the repair of the Gaiety as I alluded to earlier needs to also be taken in the context of the fact that this is the only facility in a corolla which is capable of hosting larger community events and of course in a tight-knit rural community those community events in space to have weddings and gatherings and community events performances other occasions of very very important the facility has been well used we 've heard and is much much loved by the community a Corolla has also suffered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a number of which are closed at the moment including the post office the council service center of the information center and a large part of its museum which the data has been unable to open falling I refer counselors in the report to the relative portion of the figure which is for deferred maintenance and also to the likely insurance recovering in my view this is our opportunity to send a very strong message to the community of a Corolla and the communities of banks peninsula that we respect and the involvement that they 've had in the the restoration of the Gaiety prior to the earthquake and that we share their desire and their passion to save it it certainly sends a very strong message that rothmans we understand the value of facilities to communities in general but in particular to these small rural communities so I urge councillors today to support the urgent reinstatement and repair of the cayton thank you thanks I 'll keep this relatively brief because i think my line of questioning really covered on my main points around us the one thing I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be very misleading people have I don 't know whether it 's through our exam systems or whatever else we we seem to look at one hundred percent and think that that 's sort of a mark under percent or anything less it is actually not necessarily a good indication of safety this doesn 't have a brutal collapse mechanism it didn 't come down and in this timber earthquake all the febuary earthquake probably isn 't going to 25,000 earthquakes later it 's still standing I 'll tell you what it is a stang building it 's actually beautiful entirely agreed as the jewel in the crown for a Corolla and it 's incredibly important to the community on the peninsula there look encode today is actually safe most public buildings and commercial buildings are going to heat the people in them right now at thirty-four percent of code perfectly safe may I also say that sixty-seven percent of the currently NBS is a hunt ask code the only other point that I 've make two is that look as a council and as an organization we need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do worry about precedence talking of jewels in the crown we 've got motive are coming up one that I entirely think has joined the crown for Christchurch bring it to sixty-seven percent of code it hasn 't come down as of years anyway was still standing and sixty-seven percent of code is perfectly safe which is as I see the hundred percent of the old code so I do worry about precedence there what I do want a certainty into movie heat as soon as possible I back this place I 'm sure the council base this place I know the community does so we 've got some students we can move ahead saloojee will to support resolutions and weaken and we can pop along to the opening hopefully yeah yeah I supported a staff recommendation the recent said not only these are kind of heavy you did but also the public community the building is spatially we heard from the two representative of a community on this these are building a trees is a central part key part of a garage area per hr is part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hungry percentage but I consider the time is still important if I stay hungry percenter weather is definite eyes the 675 k then we we probably lost it take another I don 't know how long and also the key issues in here we are aware this one of top 30 the council approved the community facility these facilities we all went through the community consultation and community consultation in Delta we all awareness hi urgent and important so the timing is wavy wavy the important part is this this building and where the stuffed alligator chart because I will review the paragraph 4.6 in here in the center of last year they just standard the nba 's assess assessment only take a two month they complain all this information to counsel table they are amazing quite young belief if we compare some other top 30 the project order facilities since tempered 2012 up to now has been six months still proud of you now get a print to the council table so this way we could a model could exempt or no we can follow so that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I I do is to speak in support of this resolution that 's being pot I I do need to make the point that on heritage buildings often the percentage of code can be a little bit misleading and if you take Mona Vale the reason that you don 't go to one hundred percent at mine eval is because you actually damage and the interns at heritage value of that facility not not because it 's a cost issue but actually because it 's a heritage issue and therefore you destroy it here building by doing so much work to it if you go up to that one hundred percent so it 's a very much a different debate then then this one but the Gaiety is something I think that has been prioritized by the previous council it does need action in terms of getting a decision to go ahead and get it fixed as chair of the community and recreation culture committee last term of council and as chair of the community committee this term I 'm really supportive of us proceeding we did ask that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from our insurer because we need to have progress happening nearly three years on after our major event and we 've still got facilities that are only now starting to be repaired so we do need to keep progress going we do need to spend money to do it and we do need to make these buildings resilient going forward there 's no point spending small amounts of money now that cost us long term in the future bigger amounts so I do support the work that 's being done here I do support doing the overdue maintenance this is actually about fixing a broken heart and when you hear the love and the effort and the passion that the community put into this building before the earthquake to turn it into that special and unique place restore it to its former glory I think it 's a responsibility of council now to do the same given that three years on from the earthquake the damage that has been done and also the long overdue maintenance required so I want to again echo the comments that were made and thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you work with in the Friends of the Gaiety the frogs around the work that you 've done in terms of just keeping the flame alive for the this building thing repaired in conclusion i 'll just say that to accept that our heritage program as a council has been working really well our staff have been working with our heritage contractor and although sometimes things seem like they take a bit longer actually the delicacy with which they approach these are projects to ensure that they put back as they should be I think is really important and I know that we have had good progress on our heritage facilities through the contractors that we 've had and through the working relationship with the loss adjusters that does differ from some of those other facilities that counselor chin was alluding to and so there are different processes within the big organization that means sometimes other projects are taking a lot longer or aren 't coming as quick but again this was a priority

Executive,UYvqDglFD5A,20140129,743.64,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1847,the report of the chief executive and I 'd like to hand over to Jane profit to take us through that this is the first time this item has appeared on our agenda but it will be a normal feature of agendas going forward thank you thank you just really three things I 'd like to say first of all it should be the acting CEOs report for that needs to be corrected secondly on page 318 there 's an item on the southwest library service center I 've asked for that to be removed from my report because it 's incorrect this will remain as it is in the long-term plan so that 'll come off the report and just heard way thank you to the mirror for a bit of guidance and trying to get as she said this is the first time report trying to keep it succinctly counselors abreast of some of the bigger things that are happening there 's a big organization so it 's hard to really find it down I 'm actually going to take the reporters read and unless anybody wants anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the that the report be taken as read and be received and the deputy mayor will second that and I 'll open it up for questions David a couple of questions mere under three and issues coming up the after-hours coerced into other any specific criteria associated with that RFP process in terms of of where this where the after hours call center should be and we 've had some minor criticism I suppose of the after else call center being in palmerston north and being a sort of a disjuncture between christchurch and and the people answering the calls actually having a knowledge of what 's going on so are we considering after us call center closest or christchurch-based or canterbury based or is that part of that i haven 't got the detail as to exactly what 's in the RFP but please be assured that we 've heard all the feedback on the service that we have been getting we would have taken that into account when calling for proposals so i guess i can come back with more information but it 's going through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trans waste canterbury considerations what specifically does their Memorandum of Understanding allowed in terms of the council being able to pick up extra shareholding or again that was not a quick answer but as this proceeds I would envisage it goes to the canopy joint landfill committee which you are on with two colleagues and issues such as that will be brought to them if necessary that the MOU goes back to 2000 I think it 's a big thick document or legal people have gone back to that and responding to what 's happening here just a signal that we will be if necessary or risk having to I guess the the clauses and fork anything in there but I can 't give you any details of what that might be other than reassure you it will come to the joint landfill committing ethnicity good is that on the same subject is yours is a different question yeah and so so just on the after hours call center I 'm wondering if we can 't put in I appreciate an open market araphi has gone out but I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to have such preference I don 't know whether it does now but I don 't see why we wouldn 't support jobs in the Christchurch economy to imagine i 'll say five percent or whatever and so i 'm wondering if we can perhaps have a paper i met before before we accept any of these tenders and and and just on the trans waste one I wasn 't clear from the answer whether the council must boost right to put just any of the partners or whether this joint local authority entity has first right we 're a a partner with the other five councils but it is complicated so I 'm happy to come back to you on the joint landfill committee is where let me think about that and and just back on your first question about can we put something in the tenders let me go back and check what 's in and hope that there 's something in that covers that first glean Livingston thank you this is just more for your information but I think it 's a good one on page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the figures were updated so that they will serve as a good contrast to the housing report once we get to it and I 'll speak to those figures there so in case you 're wondering about that what looks like a discrepancy in figures it 's actually the built-in time leg that we have which any council has yep Danny I have several questions just that after i was call center last time a decision was made on that it never came to counsel for any important decision as envisaged that the rfp will come back to the elected members for a decision or is that something good stuff if delegation on staff currently have delegation on that one right so um I 'm quite concerned about that I would like it actually given what 's happened for it to come back to a committee at least I would seek guidance of this resolution to ensure that that happens i think is important for Kansas to recognize that one of the justifications given from moving it to Palmerston North was because of our earthquake risk in Christchurch they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the service wasn 't able to be utilized as we needed it when we needed it so actually I really think the elected members need to be more proactive in this space because it has actually a change I think to a level of service that we provide to our local community and I know that many cancers will have had experiences but if you look at our levels of service that are also not meeting other current levels of service through three impersonal symptoms so well that this is a very new processes of the first report I think it 's great i think that the idea was that it was an opportunity for issues to be flagged ahead of them becoming issues and also to provide a mechanism for the council to monitor the counsels performance through the reporting of the chief executive and i think it 's a very good model group so but let us take that one on board I don 't really want to take an amendment that requires through the reporting to come on that we are going to have a report every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can respond to these questions and the next report will exit of the service functions on the first March we don 't have much time between appointing a contractor a new contractor so i presume decisions on this one will be being made any day yep the point that I 'm making is is that this is a this is a process that was already underway under an existing delegation so the acting chief executive will be reporting to us in two weeks time and that is inside the time time frame or mobo studio do we know when a decision on the final location of the after earth course it is going to be made or can we get we can get that information will sit here went up with us sometime the second question is the port hills do we have any idea about out of the 50 7.9 million that 's been put aside for property acquisition or mitigation do we have any idea about how much we 've actually currently spent and and if so how much and do we have are we going to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huge impact on some of these areas where you might do mitigation because I 've just read what we 've seen in the paper but we haven 't been briefed okay first question I can come back with an answer and circulated to all quest counselors I 'm good at my fingertips second question that 's a matter for Sarah and it sounds like you would like a briefing well I think counsel would be involved in the demolition and the portholes given that we 're fifty percent funding the sum of these purchases and also some of it as adjacent or probably on or close by to our land which will need to be accessed for drones and helicopters and whatever else they 're doing so you know do you think it 's pretty urgent that we get a briefing on this yeah um Pauline land drainage and flooding and the flood response plan for dudley creek now appreciate the council 's continued investigation I 'd really like to if we any way we can expedite this because we know we don 't want to get into winter it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Memorandum of progress on net 244 council steps of what we turn your time to readings yet more information on this and other words thank you yeah we can no I think it would be worthwhile at some point to have a a workshop on this because you know the council staff I think of their own initiative developed a communication that went out before Christmas and conjunction with Sarah and nqc which is a model that we are really encouraging is to have joined up single point of communication with people so they 're not getting different messages from different groups so I 've been incredibly impressed with the with with what they 've been doing again the whole communication strategy started last year going out and telling people how it is and it 's it 's been a really good model that we need to we need to encourage but I agree that there needs to be counselors that obviously need to be up to play with that because it won 't just altima tlie be dudley creep there 'll be other other parts of christchurch that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone else that wants to raise any issues all right that 's a very good start i 'd like to i 'll put the recommendation all those in favor say aye those opposed say no carried and congratulations to you jack or a good start then

1,6lpnfa5eMBI,20140129,993.089,"Christchurch, New Zealand",2729,"has anyone got any questions of staff yeah Johansson thank you um I think counsel at turner also raised the question but the decision to go to sixty-seven percent or the staff recommendation versus a hundred percent seems like a little bit of a lost opportunity given how much it 's not a huge extra cost and given that we 've heard from you know obviously the community really came to be involved work with us fundraise possibly around some of those extra things so I just I wanted to hear from staff as to what be the process for getting it up to a hundred percent in terms of the work and the delays or extensions of time and also how are you planning on working with the local community and obviously the Friends of the Garrity and the Gaiety trust to make sure that their ins intimately involved in the project and okay so we have recommended 67 because basically that 's the target we 've suggested I mean staff are favoring one hundred percent option the difference being the costs and obviously the methodology because we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue as far as between the 67 m one hundred percent it 's the cost with regard to your other question I 've been engaging with friends of the Gaiety in the local community since I 've taken over this we 've had various meetings you 'll see within here there is length a list of maintenance items included asking for funding that is what I have cheery picked out of the frogs less what needs to be done to the Gaiety so that is just essential maintenance following today 's meeting are meeting up with AC donors to go through this wish list to get an idea of I think we can head to cover off these expedition alight Amell be engaging with the frogs again to see what we can actually do Andrew tuna um thank you very much the methodology as I understand it then between the sixty-seven percent and a hundred percent standard of NBS the repair methodologies methodology is the same am I writing under in understanding that the only difference is the size of the steel that goes into the is essentially the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes into it or the strength or size of the steel that differs on the basis of this report that 's been requested yes i will caveat that with heritage people have not had a significant time i normally give them to go over the methodology and make sure that they are hung up isn 't comfortable with it so we 've given you what information we have at the moment the steel is the likely option if we go into further detail there may be a wooden option to that i don 't know you at the moment that that 's the best information we can give you a loan yeah yeah if you go would you like to join at the end of the table of the you 're all over this i mean the question is for us I mean there 's an appetite around the table to go to the hundred percent so so I mean do I mean and if the difference in the cost does as you say and assuming that we 're talking at the you know that the that the recommendation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent if it 's going to cost an extra what is the difference about 50,000 difference then I don 't think that there 's a there 's a view around the table but am i hearing from you that that could that could expand out well it could go either way to be honest because we 've just in a best guess at this stage for the honda for the hundred what the specific question was asked of our engineers like you 've done the extensive report 467 give me a paragraph i can take the council for a hundred and that 's what they 've given me and the caveat is that it is estimated what i will say is we 'll do our best but i can 't promise I won 't come back to you later saying the hundred-percent may require more money or going to be less perhaps given given that that the answer that you gave to council a tuner would it be correct to say that you could proceed with the recommendation as it is because the to bring it to sixty-seven percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shufu something that 's the the back of the stage isn 't it as the top issue now the back of the stage is the plot the plywood is strengthened that back at the stage wall the steel is just basically increasing the strength across the building sorry but what if we fix the stage what percentage of code for sorry it 'll be 34 it be 34 route so so if if yeah yeah that we approve the funding that is the current hundred percent allocation and if they can do up to one hundred percent in that allocation great if they can it goes to sixty-seven percent yeah I think that 's the solution so are there any other questions that we 'd like to put this because we 're going to have to have an amendment move I just respond to that obviously when we 're doing a 67 one hundred percent the material we we order is different yes we 'd have to make that decision but but you can proceed to to the work on the back of the stage before you have to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct right so and that would take it to thirty-four percent which is legally allowed to be used yes yonni johansson I just I just think that the deputy mayor 's suggestion is a really good one that we we just say that we aim for a target of one hundred percent of MBS as per the funding that 's been recommendable or put them total estimated by staff and I think we just enable staff to get on and and trying to do that with the budget that I 've seen obviously if there 's additional funding these options for talking to the community about whether they 're doing fundraising and whether they might like to contribute but I I think we need to get on and just seemed the signal that we do want staff to target one hundred percent but we do seals and the bounds the funding that 's been yep so we do have to amend the resin yes so now I 'm going to take an amendment from Andrew Turner on there yep as you 've obviously done some work on the difference between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballpark figure what is the timeline to get a actual figure so I mean we 're not talking months you version don 't work so it is she a very short process because I realize we 'd want to move on this for this community yeah i mean what we 've done is we 've taken the deal would produce these us detail quickly we 're in the process of doing finalizing the figures and give it some more detail design now but obviously we still have to engage the Heritage people with the methodology so I would say it 's a matter of a few weeks get that resolving actually yeah yeah mayor and councillors on just urging caution on how we take this forward this we 're all clear we want to take it forward we 've got very good information on bring it up to sixty-seven percent right when we hear the words like ballpark might go up Michael doe it concerns me that you 're making decisions without all the information there so we just need to be clear what it is how we how we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the restoration of the Gaiety to hold to at least 67 bhasin and that if it can be repaired to 100% within the budget allowed here then it go ahead to a hundred percent except that that the resolution will kept the cost at sixty-seven percent at six hundred and twenty four thousand forty four thousand four hundred and there isn 't the provision to come back for more so to bring to sixty-seven percent the hundred percent is up to six seven five thousand 675 as for the one hundred percent yeah good it 's a one point I mean if you did kept it and we had additional funding I have a massive list of stuff freakin to on the Gaiety right Andrew if we were to amend the resolution to read a hundred percent and capped at 675,000 den his staff weren 't able to do that they would be coming back to us to tell us that they couldn 't do that which would then give us two options to direct one of which would be well it can 't be done within the resolution so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because we can 't afford to go to 100 within the way that we framed the resolution or there would be a need to find some more funds whether that were from the community or whether we 're reducing the cost of some aspects of the the work by maybe the community helping with I think some painting was mentioned or there there might be other areas that that could happen so that it can be done within one hundred percent but ideally I 'd like to make a decision today that we address the issue by allowing funds of up to 600 75,000 with the name of going to one hundred percent of code and if that 's not possible then let 's hear about it but let 's work in a world where that is possible at the moment based on the advice in the report when will you know when will you know the you know the actual cost because the dream there is a side of me that wants the whole open you know and it all that 's required to open the hall as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if you don 't do it all at the same time then you increase the cost but you know faced with a choice getting it open and utilized by the community would be contested when i did my visit over there before i meet you I put that to community expecting that the same response and I didn 't get there on the general feeling was if you 're going to close it and reopen it do the permanent works ya know but uh yeah but when we yeah anyway how does this really easy amendment as I say it 's just that we proved that we 've quite redistricting in over demands of the Gaiety up to one hundred percent in Des at a total cost of 675,000 that 's what Andrews already 96.2 that we sit aside up to six hundred and seventy-five thousand from the phone is there any reason why we couldn 't just do that sin that signal to staff and then they can as andrew has correctly said you know they can come back to us if they if they feel like and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done but it gives them some flexibility and it enables progress to be made so so our counselors quite happy for the building to paper appeared to 602 sixty-seven percent of the new building standard if it costs 675,000 is that what people are saying Jamie job yeah this look my concern around there is I think what I 'm hearing so far as I think that sounds I think it sounds nice and theory I think it sounds logical and theory but my experience has been that that is actually almost saying go down ambiguous row because it sort of sounds good now I almost wonder if it creates more uncertainty than anything else you know the reality is for going to one hundred percent of college you have to go down one path to go to sixty-seven percent of code you have to go down the other path it 's not like saying well just screw the screws a bit tighter than if need be if you 've got the money and it makes it hiring BS the fact of the matter is a hundred percent of or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last code it is not an unsafe building we had 25,000 earthquakes that hasn 't come down I love the building it 's the jewel in the crown of a Corral let 's just get it open but I just think that what we 're seeing is just more ambiguity than anything else which is just what we can 't afford to do my question around us after with that in mind is as I 'm feeling really uncomfortable when we 're just getting estimates around this what I want to know is just in black and white what is the cost going to be two hundred escena code what 's the sixty-seven percent of code costs struggled works and a and a quote and then we just go for it and it should be perfectly honest if that was 62 4.4 ok no more 60cm Center code I just over it because that stops certainly but it sounds like there 's more ambiguity around one hundred percent of code and in all essence you 're creating a gray area for nautique of a lot more benefit yeah I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think we need to bring back a rather than a ballpark figure on estimate we need to go away and quickly refresh that piece of work with our engineers that have done the work to date what we 've brought back is in line with the council 's earthquake-prone built in policy which targets sixty-seven percent will clearly we need to bring back the hundred percent option as well confirm and bass out the costs and that is it at fifty or is it more and and we can do that we can be quite agile in its face and come back here and bring the council back those full and final options for decision making but could we make it decisioning right now then if it is 624 400 sims in a code that we authorize that to go straight ahead that 's what i was getting too so look why don 't we break for morning tea and come back with an actual resolution that we can then vote on because i think i think the solution is precisely that that we authorize the repair and strengthening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us it 's kept at six hundred and twenty four thousand four hundred if you can go to a hundred percent with a cap of 675,000 you don 't have to come back you can go ahead and do that if there is a hundred percent cost more than that then you have you have to come back for the difference alright Paul look at 4.9 there is no ambiguity but with the whole thing it 's a methodology it 's just bigger steel so I don 't see it is what they order for the steel there 's all the differences all right so it 's it 's a June for morning tea and we 'll come back here at what well 11 11 05 thank you","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

building and as I as one of only two sites in a Corolla then can accommodate that can accommodate functions and gatherings of an excess of 100 people it is essential to the well-being of their community and I cannot emphasize strongly enough its importance to the people of a Corolla these are only a few functions they 've haven 't swapped over two pages here which I had sorry there there since the closure of the Gaiety the annual n zack service after function has been disrupted due to not having kitchen facilities and having to use the school gym and school home economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gym the Gaiety is a perfect venue and could also accommodate the services during inclement weather there are always two very good antique fairs held during the year both now finding it difficult to find a suitable venue large enough to accommodate that activity inquiries regarding weddings are already noted for march and September of this year and also federally and Easter weekends of 2015 along with the conference in April 2015 and no doubt there would be more if the venue was open for use in 2011 there were such weddings prior to the hall closing the annual music festival was a huge loss of income as it ran for most of January each year and already inquiries have been made as to when they can return to the Gaiety these are only a few functions that bring people into the town which helps it economically and of course many local events and celebrations used the hall as well as groups and clubs on a regular basis for meetings and other functions that form an integral part of their for our life by providing a venue for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I 've already mentioned it is a welfare center for civil defense and it has the ability to provide public toilet facilities which continue to be in short supply in the township especially in special events such being held such as cycle harrier races and the cruise ship visits some years ago when i applied for the position of county clerk at a Corral county council a courier was described to me as the jewel in the crown of canterbury and if that was the case in the Gaiety stands as our star jewel in the crown it is a magnificent structure which has been and still is well loved by all our residents and tourists it is essential to the well-being of our community and I urge you now I plead with you today to favorably heed our request but ask you to vote favorably to restore to us our much loved and frequently used building think it thank you very much have we got any questions anything please you your base on your presentation you prefer to repair these the LT whole you know repair is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to listen to you star accommodations repair to the 67 percentage obviously a hundred percent because if you only do a little bit now you 're going to have to come back later and do a bit more and surely you should perhaps bring it back up and deserves being brought up to its former glory now that the answer to your question that is careful in combat I 'm just wondering how many other community centers are there over there not that familiar is the main one or as they 're in their other meeting places yes there are we have a community center in devotional but it 's very small caters for smaller meetings it took us three years to get the devotional hotel rebuilt of the earthquakes and it caters in that area for people but the main thing is the Gaiety Hall has the character and standing for special events in large numbers of people all right and you 've got the the Gaiety trust in friends so does that trust take over the running of the sequel you 'll hear a little bit more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so you 're saying that it is very well patronized in an N do you foresee that it will be very well used oh yes indeed future yes it does have an income stream yes Lee and you 'll hear more about that as I understand later on but that 's why I 'm here because it is well used thank you very much sir I must read that did you did you have Dale Thomas as well to come to the table do you want to come up to the table as well it 's a separate once okay OIC wrote that that 's fine no no no it 's okay sorry I didn 't mean oh sorry I 'm Andrew tuna I 'm presentation this morning all very interesting now you mentioned devotional which of course is geographically quite a long right a long way removed from a Corolla but I wondered whether you could just comment on the Gaiety in the context of other facilities in a Corot which are damaged which have affected the community okay there 's some which sorry can you just repeat that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course isn 't the only facility there in the community facility which is damaged in a corolla though there are others I wondered whether you could just comment on the goethe in that text okay the the big one of course is the museum which has been put together using the parts of the building which are a structurally sound but it 's still very very small and it to needs a little bit of attention especially with the cruise ships coming in they have nowhere to go used to patronize the the museum quite a lot the Gaiety of course has been used for singing with the Stars and a new lot of concept type functions which we got we 've got nowhere to go there now no one can cater for that I 'm a marriage celebrant so I 'm a little bit understood on the wedding side of it and there 's really only one other rural center that can actually cater for people of over over 100 people there 's not many weddings today that arahan under a hundred a necro is a popular place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Jana Johansson had an opportunity to go through before before Christmas and it was actually quite heartening to see you know the work that 's been done theatre to sort of improve its appearance E and in readiness for a decision from us so this that 's fine thank you very much so now I 'd like to invite I 'm Derrick Thomas to come to the table so I didn 't realize it was a separate time deputation but because it 's on the same as you all well I 'll move on to Dale thank you very much and thank you his Thank You London for your information and to you for the opportunity to speak here today I 'm Dale Thomas I 'm president of the Gaiety trust and I 'm here to speak as a lifelong local of a Curragh about the Gaiety well offered to tell his story really in 1876 a hall was being planned for the members of The Odd Fellows Lodge the Agora branch was called the loyal good intent lodge and in their planning they showed an example of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so it could be used by everybody they opened it with the ground ball for the whole community in 1879 for generations gatherings were held their club meetings concerts Anzac Day Services children 's fancy dress would you believe it even rollerskating then how they did that but I know they wrecked the floor and much of a Curragh history can be seen through photos and our fine little Museum of happenings in The Odd Fellows Hall when the movies became popular te Taylor purchased the complex and his granddaughter renamed at the Gaiety and movies were shown to full houses almost every night I remember them myself clapping and yelling as the reels were changed or the projector broke down it didn 't matter it was the place to be the Gaiety when I came to live permanently in our family batch in the 90s and a Kuro the Gaiety had been taken over by our local council and I was surprised and sad to see that it was barely used no one would want to use it it was boarded up the walls were cracked it was cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I met two women with the same sad feelings that I had about this in our dream became to bring the fine old lady back to life and to give the community back its heart to be brief the three of us formed the Gaiety trust and we raised enough money to totally refurbished and renovate the whole complex from floor to ceiling garden included and much in between she was looking splendid my hobby quickly became putting on shows functions fresh French French festivals balls the popular open stage night in all and a couple of years I had put on 50 functions for the community and we were having to turn people away heaps of fun the events were keenly look forward to and that other people started hiring the Gaiety from the council themselves people like the court theatre Dave Dobbyn the New Zealand ballet there were weddings lots of weddings my own two children were married or had their receptions in the Gaiety was hard to get a booking anything major that happens in the community was held there she is as London said our only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had become not only a venue for clubs and meetings but cause for pride in our community and a drawcard for people outside an emperor to come to our little village following the odd fellows example of good intent of providing a vibrant community center again the gaiety trust felt that their goal had been realized and like the rest of the town we were pleased and proud of the results then the quakes hit new codes to comply with the doors were closed and the locks were changed investigating engineers ripped her apart and lifter and a disrespectful miss exposed open to decay and to rodents a quraían her friends are heartbroken to see the deterioration that is taking place through neglect a key element of a historic streetscape has become a source of shame rather than pride sorry added to that as a loss that we filled with no place together to support each other and to host visitors and have fun it 's as if our communities form apart and it 's truly depressing what now needs doing to bring her back is far beyond what volunteers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our situation is being understood by the council and that help us close the gate e trust wants the council to know that all money from the events that the trust holds and from our funding applications goes into our guarantee account we have always used it to work with the council and provide what is outside counsel scope we are keen to give every assistance we can to see the Gaiety reopen our love for the Gaiety is strong as is our commitment to continue our care and fundraising when she is up and running again we so very much look forward to seeing that good intent of the original Odd Fellows in action again for our community and our final leg may it be soon thank you thank you and thank you for a very powerful presentation I 'm I hope I mean you 've seen inside it now have a new year so it 's um much improved from what you 've described and true at everything up did it happen which we are very grateful for yeah yes but I understand the you know that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think we all do so there 's anyone got any questions Pauline thank you that 's very moving and I do appreciate how you feel about it looks just like a beautiful building and I can see how it could be such an integral central part of your community and when you just a question when you mentioned that you actually restored the whole say what what year was that I don 't know if you see that it was at help I suppose he called the turn of the century 2099 and to thousand love is it that it 's not that long ago and the other thing is mentioned volunteers do you have much skilled labor there that who might be willing to help it 's just a kind of thought to maybe get the community involved in some of this work but how would you feel about the indeed the the Gaiety trust was just as three ladies but since we have formed the Friends of the Gaiety frog we call ourselves which is a group of something like 30 or 40 people and they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing in the gaiety and that 's their purpose and but I just know the Gaiety is so much love that help could be found easily and forth what you 're speaking about years is because the the costing me for the painting alone is 92,000 and sometimes communities do have skilled laborers that might be able to cadets a conversation that if you 're willing to have it could his head is it as different your conversation that we could should have we shouldn 't have we want to be part of it you didn 't want to be part of use I think it 's good sign in thank you Tim Scandrick many years ago as a road manager for a tour of sweet charity and one of the two places in New Zealand that really sticks and then my mind was a gouty hall in a Corral we turned up at four in the morning and the Baker 's came across the road to make sure that we were legally beer and then about six and morning I came back with breakfast in that community spirit was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was absolutely wonderful we got I didn 't put on a belt stone okay you 've got it that 's how it is yes really doing sorely missed sorely missed even in change RR and I know that Michelle a quartz performed in the Gosselin and I wonder whether you could expand a little more on the number of people and the types of performances and attractions they they bring to a girl coming into the gate e because I think that 's a very important part of the community and showing a growing to people from outside of the area to what sort of performance and visitors do you have and have you had today is we make quite a lot of use of the ads on to a program that allows us to bring things at a reasonable cost because we 're always into making a profit I must say we have always made a profit the antitrust had for the Gaiety in anything we put on and so they are drama shows music shows and we have a system where very often if we have the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it 's just like someone as you said to me it 's not being in our living room and that 's what it is and the performers from out of town who come are absolutely amazed that people coming in with their picnic baskets and they also love the acoustics of the building but really is the whole mood of it and they come back yeah there any other questions European to me none thank you very much for your presentation I suggest we move to the item number 13 on the agenda and perhaps for achieving a rich team oil could join us at the table","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Turner the same staff that process this resulted in this are still the same staff now that are telling you that they 're trying to resolve it in your agenda had paid 150 to John Higgins has said that this situation that we 're currently yet is entirely normal I disagree these are the same staff that brought this about and through the whole process they have been doing reviews of themselves and telling the elected council that they 've done nothing wrong they 've been engaging lawyers from outside of the council soliciting them and changing the reviews as they go through asking them to add things delete things such that it 's the lawyers reviews have said that the council staff have done nothing wrong obviously we now know that is wrong and even to the extent of when the the outgoing council finally voted for the safety or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommending to the elected council not to have the safety order done and to vist the roads with the ratepayers so what my concern is that the staff the same stuff are still looking to remedy these dangers and I 'm not confident at all that anything has changed they still telling that the current council now this is entirely normal there 's actually on the situation its stated here at page 152 of your agenda item and this is in relation to us happening at the moment dr. Turner is engaging with another independent traffic engineer as well as the developers traffic engineer to see if they can agree on matters what it says at item 152 the third page 152 the third paragraph in the bottom it states this is from John Higgins who was there very start when this was prices in instances where there is not agreement between the safety auditor and the designer then the issues are reported to the client who can choose either to direct the designer to amend the design to reflect the safety as concerns or alternatively to accept the residual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues in the safety order so basically saying the client can choose to accept the safety risk now it 's season there 's some item of the council staffs that the client is not the council so it 's indicating there that someone else is the client and they have the illegal opportunity of actually disregarding the safety risks and carrying on I would challenge that so what paragraph was it that 's the third paragraph from the bottom on page 152 of the agenda have halfway through depth do you hear from your clients and quote mark six if it says elsewhere in the report that earlier on that the client is not the council it doesn 't actually say who declined as it may well be that the client is the the outgoing elected council that actually voted to have the safety audit done a way that i read this was that this was a you know i don 't want to take up your time but the way I read it was that this was a general statement of what happens when you do a road safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were just you know using what whoever the client was but right but it is specifically season the documents that the client is not the council hunt in this case they said this is unusual because normally the safety audit would be done before the roads of god it 's right and the client wouldn 't be the council in that case yes because the the safety one 's been done later yeah that 's right so they 're suggesting we r who is the client man who knows the clock i have an XP see obviously it 's not entirely normal the safety order would be done after the roads are built it should be done before he had not found on there yeah but but it would be the developer that would do that the developer would put his arm traffic engineers report and further counsel yeah the council should give their own traffic engineers to review that it would be that that would be the road safety audit with the two of them working together and this is where it would be a matter of disagreement yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the council all the undeveloped would come up with all the other things that would actually go to another independent auditor okay yep carry on sorry and please don 't take the time off the bat okay I 'll try and keep it short anyways my husband there was also a legal review done by dr. Royd and somerville regarding the decision that was made to narrow these roads the decision was made by David Kirkpatrick in Oakland barrister those to actually do seminars together I would suggest that dr. Somerville was probably conflicted and the fact that they 're close colleagues doing seminars together around the country he didn 't reveal that basically he has defended David Patrick 's decision to to actually decide on that dangerous road at the top dr. Somerville has suggested that there are no grounds the judicial review I beg to differ on that um this well well documented high court assessments on on with this judicial review grounds based on unreasonableness and that 's the document that I 've passed around there to you what it states there is order through there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local government decisions on the basis of unreasonableness was set out and the court of appeal and Wellington City Council this war with New Zealand it states even though the decision maker has seemingly considered all of the relevant factors in close its mind to the irrelevant if the outcome of the exercise of discretion is irrational or such that no reasonable body of persons could have arrived at the decision the only prophet inferences if the apart self has been miss you goes on here this is for a document from simpson aggressive yours at 23 paragraph a new the test has been adopted in the context of notification foolish group limited versed Auckland Regional Council it states the court in walworth further accepted that to prove a case of unreasonableness requires something overwhelming for an ultimate decision to be invalidated as unreasonable the court held that it must be so perverse absurd or outrageous and defiance of logic that Parliament could not have contemplated such decisions be made by an elected council so I would submit hear that no elected council would choose that road at the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 't comply with safety standards doesn 't comply of the city 's own infrastructure design standards the city plan New Zealand safety guidelines to make a decision to accept that road would be absurd that rages the parts of logic the Parliament would not accept you guys do to do that so there is grounds for judicial review I 'm not suggesting that that 's where this should go I would certainly want this to be cleared up by the council all I 'm pointing out really is if the staff do what they 've done in the past and continue to try and bury this issue and give you further documentation that this is completely normal nothing 's wrong vist these roads regardless I just want you guys to realize that there is an opportunity here for a judicial review which affects the only way to fix this it 's available if you 've simply got to ask yourselves as elected members would you decide on that above road when dr. Turner 's stated that has 10 serious and significant safety shoes the current staff as I said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right through Peter Mitchell was the is the advisor to the Acting CEO the Acting CEO was the general manager of roading assets at the time these roads were being built without a consent and didn 't do anything about so I 'm just concerned we do need independence on this from the council organization if they are going to finally stand up and accept that they have made mistakes that 's all I 'll say thank you do you want to speak to the actual recommendation I mean I mean you have presented really well and it 's tasty nice to meet you since you 're only an email name so could you just are you happy with the recommendation that has come from staff and the community board I am happy with that recommendation going forward and going through that process I support that I 'm just alluding to the fact that some of the statements made by the council staff that are the same staff that stuffed up in the first place other ones still organizing as some of the stuff they 're telling the elected council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about that they were somehow be able to push this through like they 've been trying to do for the last three and a half years but the intention narrative is to pull an a separate under pendant consultant to respond to those issues yes sir there 's just for a wee bit of background we had workshops two workshops during the process of all that 's happening we 're by the the dangers were revealed at the workshop and accepted and the council staff priced to bring back a remedy to the community within two weeks and then failed to do so they reneged on that so I 'm just concerned that the same process is going to cape around in a big circle again I think you 've made a very strong presentation to the to the council has anyone got any questions or no again this is an embedded item and open a committee report so wrong we 'll get to it when we get to it but thank you very much for making the time to come on thank you my favor got into I,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

implications which is page 69 of the community committee and I 'd like to invite Lindsay castle to come forward thank you good morning my name 's Lindsay Carswell I 'll clean around here quite a number of years now just in case some of you may not take they know me I 'm a retired school teacher and I taught counting in economics for a number of years and the far north lieutenant this concerns some the I 'll get started going on the tenth December last year the community services committee requested and Bertram staff memorandum regarding the full financial cost both capital and operational of the hag the oval development to the council in my opinion the provided memorandum lacks expect expected detail now the next part is lifted straight out that particular report I 'm not going to read it all out it 's the first part their number one capital costs we had listed their funding for those capital costs now there was 950 4,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then that and the 2012 plan at over 1.65 million and then there and the renewals and replacements in the 2012-13 annual plan 759 thousand and then 300,000 from the capital governance pulp I want to make a few comments to summarize the original cost of 2.64 million was origination assumed to be the total costs of the development overall there has been an increase in the capital cost from that figure of 2.6 4 million to 3.6 million dollars an increase or forty-one percent on the original cost an extra items I want to have a closer look at funding the extra capital costs the 300,000 capital governance pool I 've examined past minutes of the council meetings and indicates that funds from this source receive council approval or at least a subcommittee approval the question I poses should start have obtained approval at a full council meeting the renewals and replacements the seven hundred fifty nine thousand dollars the memorandum as provided fails to disclose the rudder burn headings for this expenditure in 2012-13 annual plan we were under the recreation and leisure which has 1.1 million sellers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spaces and waterways which has 6.2 million available under that heading this cost that 's the 759 thousand this car should have been identified as a separate cost and not hidden away in a larger figure to the revenue expenditure or the operating costs memorandum reports reports that a net operating costs for council is budgeted at three hundred thousand dollars per annum currently we are tracking the budget Miranda does not disclose we were this expenditure was included in the approved 2012-13 annual plan whether the come from lives with coming from point three capital renewals over a period of ten years this is straight from the memorandum there will be a program of capital renewals and replacements to ensure it goes on and on I won 't read it all out but there 's an extra twenty thousand dollars there is mentioned 400,000 bail also be needed we set aside for drainage and irrigation if needed first of all the 20,000 is an operating expense and it should have been included in suicides the four hundred thousand dollars used will increase the total capital costs 24 million and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2.6 million dollars an increase of fifty-six percent a direct expenditure councils enforcement at the fonda membrane councils enforcement and traffic management team will from time to time control and evaluate processes and practices had events to measure compliance the cost of a service is built into the respective teams budget the cost of measuring compliance and if necessary enforcement of the consent conditions should not be borne by the ratepayers of christchurch be handed over to kennedy crickets it costs I want to make some further comments now out of this memorandum my opinion the memorandum provides insufficient information to enable a clear understanding of the actual costs of the project and funding sources and particular detail as to where it 's when or how some a ballistic costs were approved furthermore the significant increase in the capital costs does little to instill confidence in the accuracy of the operating expenses the project appears to have the potential to be a financial burden for council ratepayers i find it typical to understand how senior staff can commit the council to such expenditure during a period of financial astera t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a look now at some of points here concerning canopy cricket are into the strict conditions imposed by the Environment Court a whole whole the polymer that they have to comply with I into those strict conditions including the number of matches that may be played and even a number of spectators that some of them that can be present at the ogle kenrick cricket may find that the expected financial return may not eventuate don 't forget to that alot of Li the major pictures this is a world cup once the world cup organization will be taking a major share of that plus New Zealand cricket I don 't know what the split on the beam but I think you 'll find can be cricket will get very little in august 2013 but counseling creep requested that a business plan be submitted what can a big cricket excuse me to show how they intended to fund the proposal this is the minute said they can be cricket provide within the next two weeks a business plan to counsel the counselors and council staff showing how they intend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ august 2013 item 13 tag the oval repose development works and lease canopy cricket responded with a one-page funding plan an earth is on the last page they ended up giving you that 's what they provided that was called a business plan come because i talked with them much beautiful me in my opinion the council needs to be satisfied that can bring cricketer have the financial resources to maintain the consent it facilitates and fund the compliance costs i submit that the council should request the detailed business plan a proper one this time for the income and expenditure over a ten-year period based on court imposed consent conditions finally but I 'm concerned that can be cricket will seek further financial assistance from the council who is going to pay for a long-term maintenance of the pavilion once the dust has settled after last ball has been bowled at the World Cup gains hagley oval in 2015 thank

thank you very much oh you 're sorry so we don 't have a stock in Jimmy King lots of defense between the intense where we t saw system no no no I 'm sorry counselor we 're not going to have a question and answer session around the issue this is simply a question around whether we transfer the decision-making from the Argentine janitor to the to the committee of the whole so that 's the earthquake recovery committee of the whole thank you yonni listen yeah thank you um if you look at the report on page 270 of our agenda we asked at the time that staff investigate an order in council or other regulatory intervention that can be made to enable community participation in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was we 're told under on page 251 3.42 that it was investigated but I actually don 't see any explanation of what that investigation showed and I think in terms of the process we go through to make the decisions I 'd like to have an understanding of what was investigated and what the options were but that 's something that we can again deal with that the committee of the whole when when we because I think they will be to stage one is the as a preliminary report and secondly as the decision as it I note that one of the orders and counsel expired and that staff have some extension so sorry butch what are you working on page 253 we were exempted from decision-making obligations and sections 77 79 local government act but that that 's now expired and that staff of saw an extinction so I think it is quite relevant if we can consider this matter the committee of the whole but I do think we need to be really clear about what what she had been in terms of public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affects that given that we 've already sought an extension sorry I didn 't think that the order and council made any difference I thought that was dealt with in the Bailey decision but I could be wrong um we do help and yes I could I mean that as you mentioned before this report is purely to change the decision making decision maker I would anticipate that as part of the process going ahead from here we will be giving you all the information answer all your questions and engage with the committee as a whole to clarify issues such as council johansson has raised so I 'm clear so previously the council could ignore the local government act because the order in council noda Bailey decision made it absolutely crystal clear that the urgency of the situation did not exempt the council from its obligations to consult with people under these circumstances and that the Bailey decision only affected that one under budget but as a council we are not going to stand by and have a piece of a judgment that only applies to one person not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the final decisions haven 't yet been made you know I agree with that I just I guess maybe we need to get more than explanation that under the 4.2 comment from staff over what that whole section of this report actually means I think that would be useful so let 's not get into it now no it 's not get into it now so I think we 're all agreed on there so and there is an additional staff recommendation around around the consultation process but I would rather that we not deal with that that we actually decide as the committee of the whole the appropriate consultation process because I think that one of the problems as loss of trust so we want to reestablish trust with the council and I think the community boards going to play in a very important role and actually doing that so I would like to put the recommendation that we resolved to revoke the delegation and give the decision-making authority instead to the committee of the whole council and here now who would like to move that resolution David East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henson thank you I always strongly support this resolution at the time I was in a minority view that this local decision-making should actually go to the community boards in the local areas so they could balance up the views of the resonance and engage through normal local government processes around seeking community views considering the options unfortunately that wasn 't agreed to and we 've now had the history that we 've had I strongly support it going to the committee of the whole I think as in governance group these are decisions that have huge impacts on local community and is about the loss of local democracy that summer felt has been one of the reasons for the downfall of how the set to this situation has arisen so I hope when we consider at the committee of the whole and I am encouraged by the comments that were made by by the mirror that will actually talk about how the community boards going to also be a useful tool in the decision-making process given that they do represent coming of these local areas so I urge you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signal about a new approach that the new council is taking engaging without collaborating with our communities David East Thank You counselors mere I also would like to encourage fellow councillors to support this motion and i also am very confident that we are going to engage in a good consultative process with their local community to ensure as they say on their in their little to us today that a decision that 's made in full after detailed consultation with the community and all the informations available so i think it 's good outcome and i think we all need to support it thank you right I 'll put the resolution all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that is killed thank you very much thank you,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

NZ,NZ,Christchurch City Council,Christchurch City Council,https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZETwErnCvvgbvBbnnHfyxA,19.12.13 - Item 19 - Report of the Chairperson of the Community Committee,ssosfQusBgQ,20131218,1529.279,"Christchurch, New Zealand",4185,person of the community committee uh 10th of december 2013 and and i understand councillor you know hanson will will move that report he he does have an amendment to it i 'm not sure if that 's already been written into it and who wishes to second that um motion paul lonsdale so um have we got the exact wording there councillor johansson no sorry um not not not entirely um just in regards to the committee recommendations i 'm just actually struggling to find it on the on the one that i 've got but um it was just in relation to the gut the gaiety just in a different resolution um so we 'll put that as c um and it 's just that the council the committee recommends that the council approve the permanent repair of the gaiety um it 's the gateway hall the gayety hall in akaroa subject to and note that a full report will come back to the first council meeting um yeah no subject to so that the council approved in principle yeah the permanent repair of the gertie horn akaroa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the next council meeting um for a final decision that one for final approval yeah yeah um yeah that would be great all right so does anyone want to speak to their report this is a question for staff quick question for staff okay yeah well perhaps if i take the question um and if it 's to the chair of the committee that 's fine i would like to ask i remember during the community committee you know because the while quite a few people in the white community particular concern lincoln community hall you know the repairment status during the meeting we have put into the meeting minutes note the lincoln community hall status will be presented in february of next committee committee but not in the meeting minutes so i just want to ask why i 'm not sure i 'm just as i said i was just struggling to find the actual resolutions um so from the committee um but it it should be they should be recorded in the in the recommendations so i don 't know if we 've just got a different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff no it 's um it 's on the top of page two it says receive no page three receive the report request the council workshop in early 2014 on the facilities so it 's halfway through because then we move on to lynnwood library it 's just above the linwood library heading but there was a resolution about the gate the gaiety hall as well in these minutes i think i can help and see if i get this right clear this the gaiety hall was part of a part b um report in the agenda and therefore was going to the end of january council meeting so you 've shifted it up from part b the full report from this meeting was going to go through the genuine meeting um but this has been and that was a part being request contained in that report right so so what what we 've done is we 've it would have gone to the january meeting yeah the full report okay yeah so so so what we 've done in essence is to move forward that item but it doesn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or does it well no it should because there should be a record that we are getting um we the committee did make a number in the recommendations it will be in the report that comes to the um the normal report that comes to the committee to the council on uh in january thank you yeah so i repeat this one it 's the same situation committee committee committee you know make the recommendation or make decision but last time regarding to this facility the promise in october the the meeting but they postponed not any the reason but this time also the uh postponed to the first of council meeting or committee meeting steeple if we are not to be note in the meeting minutes i doubt maybe we 'll be postponed again this is my particular concern look i think i think you 'll find that um that the reason that we 've lifted the gaiaty hall out of this is is because you know we have um we have an opportunity to talk to the people in akura tomorrow it is a decision that 's that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be overdue but the normal process was to go through to the council meeting in in january so that the next meeting it will be on the agenda so the recommendations from that committee will come to the council meeting um in january so so it 's not going to get lost it won 't get lost if i may just respond um the the reason that the gate the reason that i 'm moving this resolution today is that the council staff are asked to bring a report on the gaiety last week that obviously because of the time they 've been unable to do that so what we 're basically signaling is that although the committee has asked for this report to come last week it hasn 't what we 're saying to to the community is we will get it for the first meeting but the resolutions around rickerton there 's some resolutions around governors governors bay and some opportunities out there they 'll also come um to the next to the next council meeting as well so i think the key thing here is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do want this report to come back urgently as it 's been requested and i know ricketton has already been requested as well so if i might just speak to this well i was going to invite andrew turnitis okay councillor johansen great thank you um so as you know we 've got a huge amount of community facilities that we need to rebuild and repair and we 're making progress on some of those some of them haven 't been going as fast as we would like heritage buildings are also an issue that we have been making progress on but the gaiety in acaroa is a really special building to that local community i 've talked to some of the people involved with it and we really had a few options as council we could have tried to do some temporary fixes we 'd spend a lot of money doing temporary things to get it open but actually the community are really keen for us just to get on and do the permanent repair and i think that makes a lot of sense the time the time shouldn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly longer but it really was felt that the best use of our limited funding that we do have as a council was to focus on the permanent rather than the temporary we did open a number of buildings that were under the earthquake prone building policy under 34 of mbs but we 're largely wooden timber structures on the peninsula that actually were very low risk and had really robust engineering reports to say that they would be okay to be occupied the gaiety sort of falls in in the middle it 's got one element that is of concern to our engineers and that 's why i think moving to the permanent sending a signal that we 're moving to the permanent repair is really important and we will get that full report to the council as soon as possible so that we can get underway so had hoped that this would be decided before christmas hasn 't worked but we look forward to the report coming back and and seeing what we can do early on in the new year to get this important facility back up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall akaroa is one of the council 's identified top 30 facilities rebuild projects and i absolutely agree that this decision is overdue here we 've got today an opportunity to send a signal to accoral residents that we um support them and in their concerns and that we do value this facility um and that we appreciate all the work that the community have done in getting the facility to the excellent condition that it was in prior to the earthquakes this has been a really good example of community ownership community input into a really loved and valued community facility so here 's an opportunity for us to get something moving for the gaiety despite any difficulties there might be around insurance it means that we can get some actions happening on this facility much sooner than perhaps those things will take to to work out so um as i say the gateway has been sorely missed by the community and following its closure after engineering assessments like many areas across the city akaroa has suffered loss of facilities loss of community meeting spaces and of course in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important as the glue that helps to bind communities together and allows the networks to continue to happen and and so on so to put it in context this is one of um a number of facilities that have been lost in acura which certainly adds to the value that we need to place on on getting the facility permanently repaired and back open again as the councillor for the banks peninsula award some of my very first engagements with community members in akaroa were around their concerns around the gaiety um and certainly their passion to get this facility back open again so i 've certainly spoken to a number of very concerned residents in accora he 's our opportunity to send a message that we we support them in their concerns and we 're committed to getting this facility back open permanently repaired as soon as possible that was made very clear to us in a deputation to the akaroa wairua community board at their last meeting and i 'll be absolutely delighted um to to see councillors support this motion so that we can be talking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we um we share their concerns about this facility and we commit to getting something done thank you any other comments i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried and then there is a second recommendation in relation to linwood library which is also going to be slightly amended and so if we could again councillor johansen is moving the motion yes yeah i just um i need a seconder and then uh paul lonsdale so um now you want to do you want to tidy it up first and then we 'll talk to it um yeah if if if you like yep um so just um after speaking with the mayor i think it was important that we that this is done in a cost neutral way given the financial pressures so it was just that council implement option one as soon as practical um and as soon as possible um and that this be done in a cost neutral way so i think it should just start really explicit that um is that okay no no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acting see what resolution would be yeah um start and then hand over to michael if it 's to be cost neutral the level of servers will have to go down in other places is that yeah look the the library budgets are struggling as it is to get back to their zero percent which is where they 're heading for unless we change levels of service in some other area yeah so increase the levels of service in this area you 're going to have to which is what we want to authorize so would you like us to come back to you with what you would like to cut so that you can then approve the increase i i really wish that you wouldn 't put it like that um what we 're what we 're addressing is um an over statement on a facility that isn 't yet open on manchester street and and enabling the um so one day a week the reason for it to be open seven days a week as i understand it is because of access to particular documents for research purposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community to access it for um you know for a normal library situation as the as as um as the lynnwood library is so linwood library is about community access the manchester street facility is about access to historic documents for researchers so they 're likely to be doing that monday to friday they can do it on saturday as well it isn 't a community access issue for the sunday whereas this is about communities accessing their library um seven days a week and and to enable that to occur in a cost-neutral way it does require it but it 's not a cut it 's actually a reallocation to prefer the availability of library books to a community because it 's a community facility manchester street 's quite different is it i mean maybe i 've got it right that 's right manchester street isn 't even open there 's no levels of service for manchester street um and the the staff are wanting to open it on a on a sunday um and so it 's not a cut it 's definitely not a cut it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunday cost of manchester street to limbo where you 've got an existing library that 's open that is hugely popular that has been incredibly successful and and could be open hopefully as soon as possible on a sunday to enable more people to access libraries when you 've got one in manchester street that 's not in a residential area that 's been moved further away had millions of dollars spent on it and you know i think we really have to question um why we 'd have that one open on sunday and the one would one not i 've got um tim scandra and then vicky bark my understanding from staff was with regards to the sunday in manchester street was that it was to the start that they we would require staff to manage the access to historic documents for researchers etc manchester street which that could be reallocated to the linwood to run that on a seven day a week yep so the levels of service that manchester street and peterborough street combined are trying to duplicate the levels of service provided by the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all of this collection so that 's that 's why we 've been doing what we 've been doing with peterborough and manchester which is why the level of service it 's not just because it isn 't open doesn 't mean the level of service has gone away but if if the direction okay if your direction is that we don 't open manchester street on a sunday and we reallocate that funding into this then that 's we will we will do that that 's it 's your call so we 'll follow your advice okay bye all right then michael does that actually does that allow for the total annual running costs of this i am certainly not happy about words that say incur the additional no we 're going to take that out the answer is i don 't i don 't know the answer to that unfortunately the library people aren 't here but we will have a look at that and if if that is the case and that 's the direction we will pursue that it will take a wee while to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing is is that we 're not giving approval to incur the additional unbudgeted costs so that 's that 's what 's changed in the resolution so um so that the council will implement option one as soon as practicable in 2014 with um with with um because the thing is is that we want this to be cost neutral so we 're looking for a way through this i don 't know what the figures will look like but it would seem logical that we could probably do that um a sunday for a sunday will cover the penal rate issue quite well i 'm just not quite sure of the numbers but yeah if we don 't open manchester on sunday across from manchester street to linwood library um so that the result is caught so that the result is cost neutral so so if you can 't do that in a cost neutral way or if there 's a a problem then come back to the council but i think we 've given you uh a steer more than a stair about what we want we want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engaged with its community understand that something good that we do yeah did you want to speak to it yes whether it may be just more appropriate to reallocate reallocating costs from other libraries rather than just targeting manchester street particularly no that 's actually that 's actually a really good point because the summer library is shut and won 't be rebuilt for at least a year if not longer so there 's a whole bunch of cost savings there and that was another reason for longwood being open on a sunday is that this area has lost most of its volunteer libraries has lost the sumner library and so it was creating a not a enhanced level of service actually it was trying to get back some of the level of service that used to exist out in those eastern areas yep it does it does mean service levels but you know i i i just wouldn 't characterize it as a cut that 's all yep after the closure of central city you know you mentioned earlier the peterborough street and the manchester street two library replaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have any the vehicle i mean draco how many the people or residents you know use the manchester or peterborough street especially in the we considered in sunday i 'm concerned if something more people already reached the manchester right now we relocate probably still make people inconvenient make a complaint i just want to the figure can can speak sorry carol robertson is on her way and she has those figures i know peterborough street is very busy in the weekend it 's used well by the residents of that sort of northern side of the central city um the turm street which so chewing street is just closed manchester is a replacement for german chewing was a very busy both during the week and in the weekends so yes they were well used and not just by people doing research a lot of the research stuff was in peterborough street so um so they were well necessarily all of our libraries are quite well used by whatever communities happen to be by them so it 's it 's just a matter of reallocating some resource around that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ setting the priorities so that 's that 's okay we 'll do that we 'll come back we 'll come back with something that will work for you yep that 's brilliant there any other comments david east can i propose an amendment really that that the wording be um council reassessing library costs so that the result is cost neutral well i had it this is clearer i just think you 're targeting one library where there may be other other areas that we could be looking at and maybe the whole library structure the library operating needs an overview that there may be other costs elsewhere janio henson i think we 're going to do that wider piece of work and the committee had previously under the old term asked for a review of the library strategy and a report to come back around what we 're doing particularly around some of the temporary transitional stuff you 've got libraries in bishopdale for example that have been shut that are now open and they 've suddenly got i don 't know how how frequent the temporary one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the city around library provision post earthquake and that 's what this was trying to address i mean you know the fact the fact is that yes we have a financial constraint but actually we 've saved we 've got operational savings built into our budgets on the fact that libraries are being shut um and in areas like the central city has had a huge focus and a huge amount of money being spent on it where as other areas like in linwood have had you know an opportunity to provide a an improved service the committee asked for this in september early september and we 've been waiting this long to even get this information back so we just need to be more enabling and flexible in providing the things that are important so i mean we will have a chance to look at that wider issue i would have liked this to be open in 2013 but you know that 's probably not realistic now given we 're so close to christmas councillor skandra um i want to support this i think that we should allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ options with regards around this and i 'm happy with the wording as it is i 'd really like to get this moving forward uh jamie goff just a quick question um i 'm really happy to hear yanni says chair of the community committee that um it is about that bigger piece of work because you know well in theory this sounds nice i just can 't help but feel that we 're kind of going about this in an ad hoc manner and having a bit of a step back and being able to look at that bigger picture and how it fits in on it on a city scale i think is terribly important my question really is when is that going to happen when is your committee going to be doing this where is the wider piece of work up too in terms of evaluating our library services across the city and looking at you know the strategic two pieces of work underway one is the revision of the library 's 2025 plan which will be um i 'm trying to meet with the chair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but early in the new year that will be available for the committee to consider there uh the more operational uh what are we doing operationally when there 's some savings we can have will be part of the annual plan and ltp processes that we 'll work through with councillors as well and that levels of service can be looked at as well in terms of what people want to do so that 's all imminent obviously for the annual plan consideration that 's going to need to be done very early next year the wider strategic document was waiting on some work on the voluntary libraries which is complete now to come back to that committee in the first meeting in february would be available for that right so so it 's not far away which is good yeah all right so um so i don 't think there 's a seconder for your amendment okay okay so um i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no that 's carried thank you thank you very much,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

mrs. me you 'll see in this report this is the context in the rationale for what we did last week and approving the RFP for Andrews present and will be for future developments this is weeks we extreme three of three rebuild and partnerships in our program there are full work crunches in this work stream now the this in this work stream it consists of 479 units all up the first tranche for instance consists of 329 if we proceed with the this program or when we do for instance in the first tranche will add an extra 96 units now I think if you bear in mind a kind of shifting demographic in terms of those who may need social housing in Christchurch against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rentals all up in Christchurch in any given month the council really is beginning to make quite a significant contribution in rental housing in Christchurch there are two rather three amendments there now these are I 've attempted to communicate with the starters has come through an informal conversation so we have to get some feedback but the we 're asking that the two reports for Willard and Brian village which are the second two after Andrews present come to the februari meeting and then feasibility studies are timelines been put on those and of course with it our courts that 's quite new as well so that 's come through the elected members energy and excitement today and I think it would be good to get the staff comment on these recommendations there any other speakers to this Oh Mike awaken yeah it we welcome the enthusiasm and the housing Kennedy 's great group to work with I 'm just and in their enthusiasm to get everything done yesterday there 's a real danger that we end up stumbling and not achieving that the I think we were from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although March would have been better than februari we 're okay with three for the reason it out court doesn 't entrench one it was never in the 2009 old and cold bucket so it 's never part of that we would need to take staff who are busy doing all the other things plus two and three off doing all the other things in two and three to really give you a good thing on 44 februari I just don 't know that we can do everything to a quality level that will allow you to make a good decision by the 72 fevery given the resources count 30 handsome I think maybe four has been slightly misinterpreted what we 're asking staff to report back on how airedale courts could be included and in a you know in a work tranche to get it possibly in tranche one but it just I think there 's a desire to see that this is a really valuable piece of real estate if there 's opportunities to do an exemplar project here we really want to start thinking about how that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous decisions around us and some of it will be happening at the moment but it just seems that we 're losing an opportunity to try and do something quite innovative on a site that 's got high value and has a large number of people being could be accommodated is it the you specs of the word feasibility that caused the the eyes to glaze and maybe if we put that staff report back on on how heed our courts could be included in the work program that would help

parking would proceed on the same basis as part of the earthquake okay can i seduce then that i put 6.1 separately from 6.22 7.51 it 's on page 11 til 1130 sorry I 'm on I 'm on page 113 at the bottom 6.11 yes so what I 'm going to seduce that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two key central city areas because we 're really only dealing with these two but i 'm very happy to put that separately so that we can debate that separately okay i think i think that covers it you 're happy now okay so moved and so you can do is cancel the lonsdale I mean what 's the point out and I like to go Regulus as putting this out is that the car parking level was pre youth quick was not enough and and I believe that we to reinstate to pre Craig levels as a minimum and I would not want to see that remove from these discussions okay so in that case what I 'll do is put i 'll put the 6.2 26.5 anyway separately and then and i 'll put 6.1 separately okay and the amendment is as does somebody wish to move this amendment and these two keys in actually i 'm happy to move that seconded counselor ok so you so everybody 's happy with that you just want to place that on record okay out any further discussion on the issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walter I just want to make the point to counselors that in fact it 's important to clarify what you as we 're talking about the council 's strategic plan itself is quite clear there in fact the purity asked for significant changes in the current transport systems and with a move to more pedestrian and cycle free he city to happen and there 's why I asked their ketamine okay right can 't slack off it 's a quick clarification there so the only change that I 'm saying is that you 've just changed to pre-earthquake it was in the central city just to simply these two being litchfield and the crossing so the way I really see there is that 's just reaffirming that in this key area and it is a carrier because it 's adjacent to the retail precinct so um it 's probably better for parking in the central city as far as i can see ya mate seems just to say that that is the case that the public did want to see a more cycle and pedestrian friendly city it is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a catered for and the preference for actually driving to an area as X a year lot greater than any other motor transport we can try all we like to force people on the public transport to do their their business but at this point in time we have to make sure we cater for the majority which is the private motor vehicle point five those in favor please say aye those opposed any carried thank you the next item is the accessible sitting and the recommendations are on the bottom of page 119 moved cancel a clear water sitting good counselor chin any discussion cancel Johansson thank you oh just some questions of staff um one is I see that it 's in versus that 'll be no consultation or engagement with affected stakeholders on anything agreed in the central city recovery plan is that is it correct through you madam chair nada I don 't think that 's the case what we 're proposing to do it here is I guess not relitigate the consultation that was undertaken through the inaccessible city but we need to also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government act and those are many and varied so there is a requirement for consultation with effective den interested parties but what the paper proposes is really to bring two counts laws basically to workshop up with councillors an early februari and then agree on a way forward and part of that way for it will certainly be consultation with the community it kind of raised that I think the local community board that 's most affected by this should be involved in that workshop given that there will be a number of resonance associations that are affected by these proposals that that community will do a day to day basis is that possible to certainly in terms of four point 10 Adam villages involving the community board second question is just I see that you want a recommendation that we proceed to early stakeholder consultation on the draft concept design for oxy terrace chilled street but we don 't service of my knowledge have not seen those draft concept plans so do we have a draft concept design and should we be seeing that before we approve to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared at the moment or we have as appendix 2 which is basically outlined what what is proposed through that swap part of it is envisaged within an accessible City it 's about basically closing off that portion of Oxford terrace adjacent to the avon river for general through traffic it 's about that portion of tuam Street which is currently to weigh between Antigua and higley basically making that one way in a west east direction and for some s of Street which is currently to weigh again between Antigua and headley basically making that two-way so it 's a it 's basically a change to the transport system but the detailed what the concept plans have been prepared as you that they have the health or they haven 't they 're basically been prepared at the moment next it was an initial consultation on the on the proposals which is outlined in appendix 2 if I made it admit I 'm just I 'm just concerned that we 're going out for public consultation at the end of the year and a time when people are away on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very limited opportunity for engagement can I seduced that these plans because I see they 're actually in the indices but there r l relatively limited could could they possibly come to the next council meeting which is surprise next week and I 'll just check to make sure they are going to be really opportune they are so I 'm certainly if they are they can be okay and then and then we can have a look at them before they go out to could we possibly ever devised the word that isn 't stakeholder just it 's not important at the moment but just possibly have something I 'm sure the strategy and planning we can come up with some ability we have vegetarian holder yeah look eco-friendly changes there were amendments that anybody wants before us like they or any other speakers if not i 'll put the recommendations those in favor please say aye those opposed okay and the next one is the hotel grand charts are a very simple move label some clearly lady development to get it underway I 'm very happy to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question of staff before we put this to a vote would we be able to get just some explanation please around exactly what happens as described in paragraph 2.1 and 2.2 we we 've got a flat coming up on the footpath we 've got a building moving up to 700 millimeters in each direction I 'd appreciate just some explanation of exactly how this is going to work well I 'm not to pretend to be a structural engineer but yeah exactly what what you 've described it happens actually in a major earthquake the construction of the foundations allows the building to move in that way and if it actually would push against the footpath and it would flip just flip up the plate that actually would be in the footpath as it would normally be so actually it does it just rides on some rollers in terms of the building so if I was a pedestrian walking by this building at the time this thing happened what would I experience in terms of well you 'd feel the shaking of the ground it was a major earthquake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steel sort of chamber lids would be the least of your problems i think it 'd be more about what else is coming around your head and anything else falling down on you rather than the plate itself moving so the way the plate moves hasn 't got the potential to cause any public injuring bury it very unlikely and certainly not a serious issue and that 's something that flips up all the moves or it depends on it designs sometimes they will just flip out just the movement to the building that sometimes they might be hinged to come out and this would happen on the part of the footpath a person could be walking along at that time beckley but you 've got to remember it 's purely in a major earthquake event take your point about that may well be the least me aura thank you that in relation to 6.3 that they 'll working party be the mayor or deputy mirror and any other it 's going to say any other counselor wandering by but any other committee chair just so that we can easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we are not holding up very minor things that are required in order to achieve development this is that clear we looking at the whole policy oh ok ok that 's fine ok so well in that case shall we suggest whoever 's available from the mere DB damier and the chair of strategy and policy ok no problem yani just just on that some have you seen the new design and does it is it discredit narrow Kevin like it was before or is it actually going to be I mean is it coming into our airspace above I 'm not aware that 's coming into the airspace book so I mean I just think you know we tried to get some lanes as part of our central city plan and it would seem this was one of the worst lanes in the city in terms of public amenity are we going to get any improvement or have we discussed that with the developers I presume teams are working with the developers and going through the urban design panel I would imagine as we see naturally detailed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just the membership of that working party what did I will see you sort of in my portfolio okay so counselor um I 'm sure we could add you to it I don 't think it 's a major not yeah perfect mirror deputy mere might be very happy to have you guys do it so of any of two of any of those four people including you okay and we had it we had a significantly we haven 't to seconded by council Livingston she 's been amazingly quiet okay I 'll put I 'll put that with that amendment I don 't need to but leave me let separately doing no okay those in favor please say aye those opposed carried the next item the portals slope stability information paper which is just a motion to be received canceller tuna moves can 't select clear water seconds any comment what 's up here with him money in relation to the submission that was owned made this morning in the deputation I just think I would find it helpful as a new counselor if for information was given to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that council has on those so that we can be really clear about what is available for residents and I 'm thinking particularly of those who they referred to today who you know there 's a lot of stress attached for these residents particularly those who were green and have now been moved to read so I was asked if that information could be made available to us so exactly what we didn 't do want or do you just want to seek that information being made available no problem so I was terrified counsel here what information you 're seeking well it 's particularly in relation to any mitigation protection features that their tummy has already been considered for the port hills and basically I know they 're well known but it would be particularly what might actually work in some particular areas by way of the buns or whether it 's actually tying the rocks down that that kind of thing and how many residents might you know be affected by those if they were to be put into place I 'm well aware that Sarah have ruled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we have could be made available so we can see where it might fit we can certainly make the information we have available and there 's generic information around are the types of mitigation options that exist but I don 't believe there will be information that takes that down to individual property level that says the the detailed optionality for a property or group of properties but we 're happy to Mason we have and whatever information syrah makes available to us I had a question given that council had resolved to contribute fifty percent on the basis that all rock roll property acquired that a joins existing council reserves would be vested and council how how can the cost sharing agreement doesn 't give a feat to that and gives away fifty percent of the properties does anyone does the chief acting chief executive or any stuff no just clarify endeavor madam chair to answer but can you go to clarify what the the giving away of fifty percent o properties means as part of the cost sharing agreement signed by the mayor and the CEO it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of the gross land area adjoining City Council reserves in terms of the rockfall but the resolution that we had agreed to was that all of the land would be transferred across two adjoining reserves where a joined reserves so we 've gone from a hundred percent to fifty percent and I can 't understand where that came from because it 's it just seems to have been put into the final binding agreement against a resolution that council had already made i 'm looking at page 127 yeah 3.5 and there 's no I mean there 's no mention in this report about the cost share agreement but I think it would be I think we need to be aware of what the actual what why there 's such a huge difference and what what the rationale behind it was no no I don 't know I 'm happy to go and find out i mean the intention always from the council and and and my knowledge is more around 3.5 than theirs around the details of the cost share that might be relevant here but there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land we actually acquired as a result of the visa and offer because not all land where the rejoinder didn 't join a reserve was actually useful to us so while that that certainly that resolutions diem it was always going to be a a solution that would be negotiated as and when we finally knew what the red zone really looked like so that 's that 's my recollection of that happy to go away and see if I can clarify the relationship with the cost share agreement okay and second question is given that the council had agreed to contribute up to fifty percent of the net costs for mitigation and given that council staff were involved in the zoning review that came back and said that we will no longer be able to remove the red zone around where we do mitigation what is how does where does that leave us in terms of us funding mitigation to happen in the hills and what is the process ultimately that 's going to make that final determination about what people can do what they lend what I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual mitigation I think as far as I understand continues to stand by that offer people may choose to achieve mitigation however as I understand that the government 's decision is that that won 't remove the red zone notation because they believe in general the risk remains it may be we may be able to ameliorate that risk on individual properties but not remove the brisk in general so that 's as I understand the principles that the government have used and establishing it so someone may continue to live happily get a building consent get a mitigation work but live with the fact that they are in a red zone and same way that people live inside other hazard management areas just for clarification I presume that basically through our district plan review that will give people the ability to either remain in their property or not based on the level of risk and hazard so we shouldn 't be too focused on reds and greens what we should be focused on is what is I just don 't plan to say and what does that allow and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a area that I just took cleanse allow I presume that 's okay well provide a year so it provided ultimately the tool that will manage us in the long term will be the district plan and that will sit in place hazard management areas and we 've had some discussion about those and they will control well they will set standards for activity and people people coming into new properties will need to meet those one of those is likely to be around mitigation so the red zone in that sense still remains they 're largely as a zone in which the government is offering to purchase people out of their properties or because of heightened levels of risk now the red zone will correlate closely to our planning zones and that higher level of risk will be related in the thresholds people need to meet if they 're developing property but they could still continue to set as they can continue to satisfy the council in a land use since you know they can continue to satisfy the council in terms of our obligations under the building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submitted this morning and their neighbors could choose to do the could choose that the rock medication be done and Romania well at the moment as I would understand that that mitigation would need to occur they would need to be able to either mitigate their on their own property or presumably if it 's an adjoining property negotiate privately with an adjoining property owner to create that level of mitigation so that mitigation maybe around removal it may be around putting in forms of engineering structures to protect the dwellings correct finally um so if you accept that the district plan review is going to be the time when people will know whether they can remain there or north or whether they can build or not what what are we doing in regards to infrastructure in the red zone that has a potential future use because of the district plan we have we got a stop gap measure in place so that Sarah 's not pulling all the services out of the red zone we 've got people paying rates remaining living possibly building in the future well the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the infrastructure and the roads and networks the pipes are council 's decision to make I really thought just so I 'm clear I thought that we agreed to give the red zone to the government property and land that we owned as part of the cost year is that secret from the port hills I 'm not well Jane maybe I 'll also ask their business I think it 's separate from the port hills but we 'll follow up them yeah but just for shadow an emotion at the appropriate time just that um that the council ask staff to investigate community-based mitigation of rock fall hazards and the port hills and identify areas that are more cost cost cost efficient than the zoning purchase the M response to this morning 's present yeah okay so significant that 's not here any discussion on that motion just just to give some context I think when counsel originally decided to allow mitigation it thought that it would be able for individuals to go through that process put together the case get the geotech advice and get some progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a complicated process for people to go through and given the zoning review its credit such an uncertainty I think now really what we 've heard this morning is that there 's a huge advantage to counsel being the leader in this regard it 's not uncommon we did it for Lucas Lane we did it we did some work for the gondola and I think we should be doing work around the areas where we can actually cost effectively mitigate the risk an able people to love in their houses given especially given the housing crisis that we have and considering the financial issues and challenges we also have as a council so what we heard this morning was it actually is possible and cost effective to save some communities not all but some in certain areas to enable people to live and remain in the housing that is currently there undamaged and perfectly feasible to be loved in I think we need to as an organization be proactive in this regard we 've tried to leave it to the local individuals to do and that hasn 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have hoped so I really think it 's important that we do this work that we 're proactive and identifying these areas and solutions and then we move forward as a council and yeah I certainly believe that we we 've got a responsibility to the people that are living on the hills in these houses where mitigation work would be both cost-effective and effective and particularly bearing in mind our obligations under the to the government under the zoning where we can be saving funds for council and giving a better outcome for residents that 's something that we we must in my view be be taking serious in looking at and I support what counselor your handsomeness said but I just wanted to add a few more comments we we mustn 't forget that the people on the hills have been dealing with not only multiple hazards but multiple challenges in terms of their dealings with central government in terms of their dealings with counsel I recall as a person that lives on the hills when council passed the original resolution around mitigation features acknowledged by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy process to follow and it may not be easy to come up with something that that worked we 've heard from residents this morning who have believed that they can come up with something that works and I think we owe it to those people to give them an opportunity to be able to do that and one final point a lot of these people living on the hills are in houses in unique locations very often unique properties in micro climates in areas which are quite unique and the situation on the hills is very different than the situation on the flat land where one piece of land may infect in some cases be quite similar to another piece of land on the hills almost every piece of land in terms of its aspect its view its microclimate and so on it 's quite unique which are some of the very good reasons why people are emotionally and physically attached to the land that they 're on so on yet obviously very supportive of this and there is a subsequent paper in here on memorials as well okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seconded by Councillor chin okay I 'm this they 've get i 'll put that 6.1 recommendation those in favor please say aye those post cap carried sorry one speak to 6.1 briefly that 's just that to me that the recommendation didn 't really capture what i felt was the essence of the deputation and it was that they were quite happy to do a lot of theater OOP themselves and it just seems to me like an ordered to syrah to tidy it up and let us not the intention okay so yeah and that the families be closely consulted on this work is so I think the requester Sarah was to take down the fence put some basic grass in there and in that the families wanted to be involved very much in the creation of a temporary memorial and that it was obviously urgent before febri 22nd not just for the speaker but for a lot of others as well including the Japanese in this so what would the process for that be is it just over to staff to organize council skinship are you going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well what I was thinking was that the families could go directly to Sierra Sierra now decided that they 're going to take the fencing down and do something that perhaps his family should direct work directly with Syria as it is under serious control how 's it been and this is still a staff member that actually is working in this area if not how would it be on Monday when we meet with sarah and ccd you if we ask them the process and get back to the to dr. ok ok see ya I 'd be comfortable with it we 'll just do that and i think that the depending on what the families want it could be thrown open to lots of people to participate in their heart why myself would be happy to go down and do something I 'm sure a lot of us would because I think it 's really really important there 's another course in the agenda to on temporary memorials where people haven 't been able to do them and hello cool ok so we 've just passed 6.1 of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can ok 6.2 the majestic theatre council again just illness um we 're going to get some feedback around what had happened previous ease we 've already seen two liters and I 'm happy to support this I do think there 's an urgency about it and I wonder if we also need to resend alicia repeating our request so i thought we were going to seek a meeting but we 're also going to reaffirm our request in writing to Sarah okay so we 're meeting with them on monday right and i think we absolutely need to meet with them on a range of things very very regularly and that should be one of the outcomes of Monday 's meeting it was it 's crazy that this is happening by a different organization in the city council but the issue previously has been that it 's not Sarah that are making the decisions it 's the ministers so because we can 't meet with the ministers we can 't seem to get progress around these these issues so like that 's why council last time resolved to write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heritage recovery because we were concerned that we were repeatedly raising up Sarah but not getting any traction okay so the recommendation here is that we meet with Sarah we 're meeting with them on monday why don 't we work through a process with them at that stage so that all of those issues that are coming to us that should be going to Sierra are actually dealt with properly okay so that our staff respond to the previous requests that have been made and we were in off for monday so that we can be informed when we go to the meeting yep you know who that is yep okay thank you a pet edition 6.2 you are you right okay i 'll put that those in favor please say aye those opposed carried 6.3 the riverside heritage garden with the recommitted recommendation there moved and seconded by those same people who moved and seconded everything before okay no snow speakers cancelada in clarification i think that it needs to be noted the EPS on the last line to enable this to occur in to prevent and delay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urgency about that I just think that should be really noted in the minutes you 're thinking um I also thought that we were going to make a staff move available to work with them on the concepts so I think it 'd be really good to have a champion within the organization that can work with this group and help develop some of the plans is that is that something that we can identify yeah but I just think it would be useful to have a staff person actually like a champion within the staff to be able to coordinate at work with Joan okay this one get what support is available i 'm assuming that will come back to us at some stage but they did actually mention money is but this this phone do you think this to support support often means of all is ok right yeah okay put that it 's moved and seconded by Councillor cutter and she and you hit a whole spate of them there those in favor please say oh sorry did you speak Hindi those in favor please say aye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Part C discussion and now you can have your room here now we,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Committee,WWeEPh4emXU,20131212,585.22,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1391,"the report of the chairperson of the community committee and we have microwave come at the table and there are there 's a committee recommendation somebody like to move the recommendation Yanni o handsome dick invitamos can drop any discussion Yanni Johansson Thank You counselors um you 'll note that the committee recommendations are slightly different to what the staff have recommended you 're also not in the agenda we do have a letter from the fifa under-20 World Cup New Zealand 2015 CEO and I just wanted to emphasize a few points because that leader does talk about us having missed a deadline but I just want to reassure counselors that we are if we approve this today then we are getting on top of our commitments as a study but there is more work that we need to do this is a huge event for Christchurch this is one of the fourth biggest sporting events in the world as I understand it so we will certainly be have an ability to have a stunning showcase of people coming into our city this council in the city has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FIFA we 've had some real success stories in the past around some of the junior our women 's tournaments and also some of the junior means these sports fields that have been recommended are really about creating an opportunity to get higher quality playing surfaces as per our commitment with FIFA when we put in the bed we were successful on getting a semi-final in our city which is no small achievement and that is an incredibly positive thing that that we were opportunity that we will have these building these these sports fields are really key to us being a fantastic host and they 're really key to having a long-term legacy where we do have much more use out of our sporting fields than with head in the past given winter so time is of the essence it 's really important that we approve this today there is a significant underwrite but we should be aware that that is you know a financial contribution that we must take on board as a council and as a city but I think this will provide an opportunity to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facilities in our study that that lived as a legacy for the world cup so I urge you to support this and help us get on and get this done any other speakers David East just like to ask a question and start if I may I totally support the recommendation and I 'm just interested in timelines that other sports fields may come back online particularly the qe2 village green and Lancaster Park can give us any indication of any timeline that they may be able to be utilized again Thank You councillor east no i 'm unable to give any firm timeline I 'd and this occasion I qe2 as we know is the subject to some asbestos contamination and we have to work through a solution to that Lancaster parks been extensively damaged and is subject to an ongoing insurance claim are both of those facilities the enders yacht not yet identified so it 'd be remiss of me to suggest deadlines at this time councillor Jones wanted us to have heard that it 's did you say the third or the fourth largest yani competition fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the money it brings them to the city I can 't quantify the precise amount expected to come in to Christchurch from this tournament the all of the figures haven 't haven 't been established at this case when we put together the the bid document and council signed off the bid oui oui we quoted a number of figures yeah and i can give you our array but a definitive financial benefit here no I the okie-doke broadcast to over 200 countries 470 million viewers the I 've heard our estimates of well the organ come up with estimates of 170 million dollar net benefit to New Zealand the this hasn 't been drilled down into cities yet but under the current awarding of games christchurch has the second biggest allocation so Oakland has the first and we are number two so it 's it 's multimillion-dollar the we would expect at least 25 million dollars Pauline Cotter some clarification and the committee 's recommendation lear number five fear to 170,000 for garrett park should this be possible to it supposed to be should this be necessary it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the logic was that we 're doing a you know about two-thirds of garrett park in the first level funding and it just seems silly not to take the opportunity to do the whole park and get an extra sports field of a good quality at the same time so staff will have to work that through with what 's happening there with the people that are doing the work but effectively for a small for it 's much more cost-efficient to do it at the same time then either come back later and do it again so it was just looking at that possibility because it would give us five John like to make a comment yeah the in detail they we look at things whether the existing drainage and the existing irrigation and other infrastructure will be able to handle the extra pitch if it is possible the this recommendation gives us the opportunity to explore that and proceed if it is possible yeah and recommendations 60 is it pictures first week pitch let 's go I send carpet sports pictures so take the AARP so how many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you just want a clarification yep timmis Kendra just to follow on from there but as my understanding us and John you be able to correct me as FIFA we have to have four of these standard pictures but the idea was to have five so one as a backup so there would be yeah sorry this and these will be legacies for the settings oh that just as a sport I 'm Paul lonsdale immigrants from the two weeks a year support everything Yanni you said aside from the benefits of this coming to New Zealand and largely to Christchurch as well where to get left with some international facilities there can be other use of us and pitching for further games in the future so I personally would like to us to actually support this fully I 'm refugee yeah John given that we 're going to be left with a lot of legacy assets was any thought given to the geographic distribution because we 've got three fields sort of quite close to each other nothing in the southwest is that something you looked at god @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the southeast of the city that 's been a historical shortage the the southwest we are just about to open to new pitches at Wigram skies that alleviates up at that a little bit these the southeast got hit art most and at it alleviates a historical shortage and a shortage brought on by the effects of the quake so it was considered right if there any further questions anyone else like to contribute to the debate she just seemed to total up the total expenditure that the 985 plus these other figures 1.8 million that 's it in my career keys those are I 'm on the right of mine 85 there 's a request from the infrastructure fund 500 and 170,000 and there 's existing council funding are for repairs or repairs and renewals the directed to garrett park essentially you 're telling us that this was a requirement of our bed yeah yes we all lose thank you very much okay i 'll put the motion all those in favor say aye those opposed say no carried moving on to the andrews present redevelopment item number 20","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

same people it 's very descriptions gone now just um you 'll note that we got a circulator the 1a appendix which other level of service expect exec exceptions I just had a question for the chief executive I know we 've um Wilfred Diane brandish we 've just we 've had some information back this morning around some of the responses that the committee has asked for the one I was particularly concerned about was the fact that we were supposed to be provided with some information about how councils monitoring at strategies and its implementation of its strategies we were failing to meet that level of service last time and we still I don 't think received any information back about information that was supposed to be circulated to advise us what was happening so I know the response we got back from Diane was that the chief executive was looking into it but I really do think it 's important that we do get some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of service I 'll take responsibility for that I think I 've got something my inbox to check off and then send to you so sitting with me and I do have leader hurry up to do it so it 's it that okay and also just at the Finance Committee there was concern raised around our targets around the satisfaction with hearts and also the the reporting of roading contracts and things being fixed in a timely manner could staff just explain where we got to in terms of a response on that I just want to alert counselors to the fact that the Finance Committee there was quite a lot of concern expressed around what appeared to be a declining maintenance around some of our parks and also some of our streets and that was quite concerning to see that we are failing on a number of these targets levels of service which are the clear service levels we agree with our community through the three-year plan we did hear some antidotal feedback that Stafford cut back on maintenance to save money and that possibly was having an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all kind of were quite concerned about that so I think it is pretty critical particularly going into summer that we 're reassured there are levels of service are being maintained as a standard that we expect I don 't have other committee members wish to raise any points around this I can answer the question regarding parks and I counsel you may recall I did send it through it was about two weeks ago but the there was a misunderstanding in the conversation that that council of lonsdale ahead with the staff member and in fact they were not cutting back on levels of service around parks I think it was a timing thing with the spring and the spring grace that keeping the lawns and the parts under control is always a challenge at this time of year so I don 't have the answer on roads but that was the answer on parks so if i look at our levels of service that we aren 't meeting customer satisfaction with recreation facilities overall satisfaction with neighborhood parks where targets eighty percent we 're receiving 67 that says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an action plan i guess i really want to be Richard you know what does that action plan and how are we going to do that because clearly we 're failing and I think we need a fuller explanation about why Thank You counselors gain trip are those more than packs as well if you look at them some of the areas that are head brain and cut regulate by council they 'll come to hero whoever the contractors and I know there 's one area that gets capped one side there 's the bitter one corner and then go away then it seems another team come to the up the opposite corner which seems bit ridiculous but anyway I mean that right across the board I think that that I believe anecdotally that it is but it seems to have dropped off so these entries to get some feedback so i think it 's going to be more than just a spring growth coming through there was another issue where I 'm particularly concerned around the cycleways program being behind schedule and we have had an explanation that came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear that skirt what scoot were not aligning the work that they 're doing like on the brom he 's got over pass to our cycle ways which is a really clearly identified cycle corridor so it 's one of our key corridors and in just I guess it 's just a question for the chief executive acting chief executive what can we do to ensure that we 're not spending money twice and getting skirt to take into account these these are appears because as I do the repair they should incorporate the cycleway cycleways into that but at the moment doesn 't appear to be happening but look I 'm happy to I can 't answer that off the top of my head but I can follow through with scoped and raise the issue that you 've raised and come back to the issue for art for me and I think for us is that we keep getting told it 's happening but in practice it 's not so it 's an implementation thing we 've got an explanation here that the cycleway team are working was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not doing it so you 're going to get that information so the recommendation now moved counselor mangie seconded counselor tournament is that was that the council receives support that okay those in favor please say aye those post Carrie I think I don 't,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Plan,57iCZj87dI8,20131212,1446.9,"Christchurch, New Zealand",2876,one and have you got the have you got the amendment and that enter the system oh well there 's a there 's a look of surprise on okay so all right so what we 'll do is we 'll take counselor Livingstone as having moved the original resolution and would somebody like to second the original resolution fell Clearwater and David es would like to move in a min monde so sorry I haven 't I haven 't got a here 's the report got the details of the eastern suburbs sports and recreation facility I don 't know what that is sorry peps of well pepsi mike tilan can you come to the table as well yeah can you tell us what the eastern suburbs sports and recreation recreation facility is well in brief the that facility was or is designed to be the community size replacement I suppose in the eastern suburbs of aquatic facilities at a loss mantilla to was was destroyed and is the sort of the concert those of the decision to put the Metro level facilities in the center and council agreed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what the is is intended to do but it 's not a intransit linked to the new brighton master plane because no decisions been made about where it 's to be located is that right it 's that that 's that 's partly why I raised that question today before anyone else saw the the draft resolution so the two have been linked and so much as there 's been discussions about aquatic facilities in New Brighton and the eastern record sport center and in some degree that they both they 're both competing for the same pool of money there is a potential always that the two could be located in the same location but the evidence that last council who was in fact that the eastern reckon sports facility probably if it 's to serve the the wider eastern community wouldn 't be at the same location as some form of water park that specifically served in their new brighton area but the two have been discussed on and off together because are they both aquatic related and at times they both seem to be looking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a seconder for the amendment Oh a bull it will let it without a second I can 't take okay breakfast just well i think david s was going to speak to up first yeah um i just want to be clear around the is a new brighton business land owners association and there was i went to one of the presentations where they had this presentation around just upgrading the surf club there and that being sort of like an attraction and a bit of a sports Rick the Koala facility is there does that include a secret that currently engaged in preparing a wider scope must plan for New Brighton it 's on page 83 just damn 4.7 so my understanding is that this was in order to enable a full engagement across all of the the council planning processes and the new brighton business and land owners association okay david s thinking about a mere i think i think i probably need to reflect back a little and in terms of we 're on coming with on this amendment and an essence I do support the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do feel that the planning committee recommendation of the fourth of September last year where they considered reports from international experts on on options for aquatic facilities in the new brighton area which at the time was part of the integrated master plan process the decision of that committee at the time was to defer the decision of the report to the incoming castle for for its consideration very quickly after that a meeting on the fourth of october of this year the master plan came to county council and recommendations were given regarding the aquatic options that i personally them comfortably with on top of that we are in the eastern suburbs facing quite a strong feeling from our community that we want to move forward on the aquatic issue and twenty odd thousand signatures were obtained and a lot of public support and in recent days there has been a move by two members of our community to look at engaging legal counsel to review where we 're heading with things on on on the eastern suburbs sport and recreation location and a number of other things so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aquatic facilities in our ward is a very hot potato and that if the eastern suburbs sport and recreation facility goes out to consultation which is likely to shortly there is a strong possibility or strong likelihood should i say that the residents of our ward will come out very strongly in favor of new brighton being part of being that location and hence I want to just acknowledge and in the master plan process that is a likelihood that needs to be considered and that if the master plan process going forward as we I agree it should do at the moment that we need to take governance of the fact that public opinion in the eastern suburbs may sway towards the location of the nice turn subject sport and recreation facility being in New Brighton and therefore we mean that may need to make provision for its inclusion and future master plan sorry in the final master plan adoption I what I 'm concerned about because you know given the fact that the deputy mayor second at the resolution in order to you know pro forma in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than passing an amendment that that were not passing an amendment that that ties us to an outcome whether it is better that the amendment not ask you to consider this that agree that the decision on the location of the eastern suburbs sports and recreation facility needs to be taken into account when considering the new brighton master plan yeah yeah it might be facilities may not be it does say a new eastern recreational sports facility is what the staff report refers to but it yeah so agrees that the eastern suburbs sport sports and recreation year facilities plural yeah facility or facilities yeah settle well at some or facilities location decisions yeah yeah be considered on this process be considered and the process yeah yep so it 's basically illusion that this is a decision that could have an influence on the outcome yep yep yep whilst I recognize that the northern end of the east and suburbs have got to lengthen to their master plan I wonder if because the southern end of the eastern suburbs which is had me fear me bored we don 't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a new brighton and I think there may well be a situation we need to review aquatic facilities and sports facilities for the whole of the eastern suburbs which would include you brighten and obviously happy I know and this is this is an issue you know that when you look at facilities that are available on the west you know it is quite clear that there are two major gaps one is and the bill would Pegasus ward and the other gay sun hagley ferry meet and I mean we can see that absolutely crystal clear and that 's going to obviously have to be taken into account but I don 't think that this be precluded so or maybe it 's maybe the word not as considered agrees that location possibilities may affect this process or may met yeah okay big considered on the process all right all right see what Yanni Johansson I mean but I would like us to break for lunch after we deal with this item so yah Johansson Jamie golf Jimmy chin and Glen loving stone but I think it 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've had the fortune of going and seeing the presentation from a separate growth that 's doing another concept around New Brighton and some of the stuff that they looking at I thought was quite exciting and it 's not necessarily around an essence of a sport and recreation facility although it could be something like as i said the surf club thing upgraded expanded which is really cool and and so I just I just think that we 're complicating this too much what needs to happen actually is part of our annual plan process and kostya processes we actually need to do an aquatic facilities review with our community across the city and work out where the priorities are and where the expenditures going and so you know I I just don 't want people getting a mixed message from this amendment that somehow all the submissions in support of the new brighton must bury an aquatic facility are going to inform that decision because that is a wider process and I think we need to be really open with our communities that it 's not one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the board ya know and that 's why I tried to change the wording of it and I 'm still thinking that be considered as the wrong phrase for that reason I would rather that it read that the location possibilities may impact on elements of this process yep if you if you are okay well it 's just it 's just alerting that the master planning process to the fact that there is another process that 's going to go on in relation to facilities location and that may impact on the decisions that they make in terms of the master planning process I would have thought that that doing I mean we 're setting up a stakeholder group they are considering public and private initiatives for doing stuff yep I 've got meetings workshops surely as Papa bet are we looking at a wide range of issues including that 's why is it necessary that we specifically save us here without knowing what ideas those people are coming up with its that 's fine and you can vote against the amendment yep then I 'll keep pretty tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only suggestion that i 've got i guess going forward as um if the mover and seeking that of the substantive may be agreeable why you just included as part of an addition no one 's really saying anything they 're different I don 't think necessarily it 's been a meaning that complements the substantive so would it be a better way for it yeah but I don 't think that there is a universal view on whether thus as an acceptable amendment say wouldn 't you just add this as literally just an additional point to his substantive yeah even it doesn 't the thing is that it doesn 't it doesn 't change what the substantive was it is in the dish it 's in here in the in addition anyways what which was why I was trying to find some wedding but I 'm hearing that their ascent unanimity so I 'm just looking for a way forward who was next Jimmy chanting Glenn Livingstone I would like to ask the staff to clarify because I remember last and a council meeting regarding to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have already on the you know the his kind of the recommendation regarding to the easter superb the sport recreation facility no location is in the wider easter the suburban their kind of area but a new brightest is one of you know possibility but a wider Easter 's also spa spirit we into the I remember in the meeting minutes am i right I just want to ask a stock trader can reply this way well I think as we as the last council consider there were a multitude of options in terms of both where the location could be in terms of the eastern region support facilities and that could either complement a range of other aquatic or even non aquatic elements as part of the new brighton master plan it was considered about where it might might be if it was to be located in new brighton but obviously as a number of councillors have raised it needs to be in a location that best serves the the wider eastern suburbs so yes those those options remain and i think that this this allows us to recognize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sports facility will obviously have some influence on the final outcome off the master plan whether it 's included in that master plan process for or not okay Andrew Tina is that including this amendment in the discussion about the new brighton master plan raises an expectation that there there is a link and that they 're likely will be this facility in the east and to what extent does a link i think still remains to be seen according to the recommendations around the final position of this facility i don 't think there 's any debate around whether a facility somewhere in the east is needed but clearly there 's still some further considerations needed about exactly where that 's going to be i 'd certainly prefer to see the aquatic facility viewed in a citywide context knowing and accepting that there is a need for that in the without necessarily put india act to New Brighton I 'm aware that the new brighton master plan has been consulted on to a reasonable extent already and i certainly wouldn 't want to see anything linked to it that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan de paul n cotta oh did you want to speak yeah IM where it was debated first it started off in a kind of question mo but this is debate yeah okay i guess some i just want to say is the other counselor for bill would Pegasus this is new to me today it 's new to the community board it 's you to you buying colleagues as counselors I just want to put this on the record I want something but burwood Pegasus there 's no question and I push for that all along but what I want is some good politics I want transparency I want no surprises and I want the high trust environment to be acknowledged I 'm right behind a poor replacement but I won 't be held to ransom by a last-minute surprise amendment so right behind your day I want a good project good pull I want good procurement with the economic base for it is secured and I want us to do this together so I need to process this further not sure that I can go with it at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff staff have come up with another option which I must say would actually solve everyone 's problem which has notes that the final location of the Eastern recreation and sports facilities facility or facilities the final location of Eastern I I don 't eat you anyway but anyway Eastern recreation and sports facility or facilities may impact on the final new brighton master plan we 're not dealing with the ferry road master plan today well I mean it 's just a way that that people could support it but look I mean if that 's the reaction then it 's not going to be supported so I 'm so sorry I haven 't kept a list of who wanted to speak poor lane Cotter it 's briefly i support andrew here there has been considerable work done on this master plan already we 've just had to each weird master plan and each where Paul was definitely not on that even though it 's right in the area there is a separate project going on on its own I think that the pull of the aquatic facility your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own the area of the new brighton master plan is pretty much around the commercial area it 's not a given that anything will go in near i think it 's some a bit of a mistake to throw it in here and i don 't like the word impact on the process because we don 't want anything impacting on a process that 's already well down the track so that 's my view you,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Stokes about the noble subdivision there is another issue that 's raised its ugly head with this subdivision and that storm water retention when the when the original subdivision for naval went through the the court the whole site the whole noble subdivision site was part of that resource consent in relation to stormwater and roading but subsequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that original resource concede that affected the rotating layer quite dramatically as you 'll find out from subsequent meetings quite drum and at all Dorf part of the subdivision 44 more that storm water discharge issues now that the store board that were put in place now for the commercial and high-density residential area of the noble subdivision it is not for the existing part of the noble subdivision at all so the only option those people have got now that they found out that their storm water has not been catered for is for the storm water to be to be discharged on to additional land that was never part of their subdivision at all to buy to the west to put a stormwater system in but the stormwater system would have to run 1.7 meters uphill and storm water doesn 't normally run uphill or two to pump the water uphill which is all very good as long as you 've got our electricity and the pump 's working but it 's very very unusual for storm water to water maphill so don 't know what the engineers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology that nobody knows about but anyway that 's an issue that these poor people have been left with is they 've got no storm water and hooked up into the end of the storm water a team they 're in place at the table subdivision now and there 's virtually no ability for them to hook up to another sub devel storm water system that on land hasn 't been born yet or assisted to pump it up hill and the rest of our meeting was quite positive in giving away funds to young people and teams to take part in sport and thing for adults and older adults events and also we allocated some additional responsibility to a cubed it was and then I was nominated to to serve zone 5 on than the New Zealand community boards executive and as far as I 've been able to find out I was the only nominee so I think people for their support and that and we did have the extraordinary meeting of the table but that will be subject to another report on another date and otherwise we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very much I would like to get a motion on the table and to deal with the partay and we 've got a recommendation that all I 'm sorry get the staff include for consideration and the annual plan this issue I know that the recommendation from staff came through that it go into the long-term planning process but I think a number of us felt that that was too long to wait and that we 'd put it into the annual planning process regarding payment plans for community recreation for siletti 's would Jimmy chin and Bucky buck so that 's that 's the motion that 's lying on the table and I 'd like to take comments on that thank you okay sorry Pauline Cotter it 's what my question is around is it necessary to to be consulted on surely we 're just reviewing back to the status quo what 's the original payment method consulted on when it was set up you 're not obvious stuff i don 't know all i know is that the system and work fine nobody complained about it my point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it says here there 's no financial implications but consultation is expensive and I 'm just querying the need for it so bad sorry I you 're going to consult on the annual plan anyway so it 's just merely a part of that I can 't imagine to be any additional cost to it what still is thyroid your meetings and stuff no no no it 's part of the annual cut the annual plan is consulted on this document I mean I mean I don 't know whether I personally think that we just need to double check that there isn 't an additional costs associated with it I mean if it 's part of the budgeting then we should we should do that but I mean if it comes back within that process that there is no additional cost and it can be reinstated I mean I 'd rather have a little bit more history to it before we make a final decision but if you 'd rather bet it was put to a report back to the next council meeting i 'll be happy to receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think it 's better to go down the you know recommended goes into the consultation on hippie with theatre i was just flagging finances they would have to report back in February on on this matter so it 's really instead of reporting back to the first meeting in January yep Phil Clearwater I I felt see really what in and making it more available for isms there will be extra costs and I don 't staff can outlined to me how the would be and why in fact we can 't follow the committee board 's recommendation well I mean oh I I know that we haven 't got a report on the matter at this stage and I would rather that we made a report knowing if there were actual costs enough there were actual costs what they were before we make a financial decision so I just think that that 's a sensible approach to take going on that Madame tearfully are off the opinion that this having been status quo I 'm satisfied that this would be a prudent move to just support the community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think we have enough information because this was a system that was already in place okay we can 't come to the table pit the community board proposal is an extensive change to our user charging structure in the last long term plan the the 2009 19 LT CCP the there was a thorough review of admission shop as of that review the current charges and structures was identified and implemented the it was extensively consulted amongst user groups and focus groups it worked it allows us to retain customers far more efficiently and it drastically cuts down the amount of repeat transactions at our front counters allowing us to reduce staff costs and keeping customers waiting our customer satisfaction is high there will be retention issues there will be financial implications if we follow this recommendation our feedback has been if there is a need to review some or all of this that we do that in the standard annual plan process where council can understand the full implications of the decision because they could be there will be a number that are not apparent at this point in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's after consultation with thirst after mr.

Martin 's o power toy library and Phil clear water will move that and Tim scandrett will second it so now I will open it up for discussion again Livingstone thank you so I ask a question of stuff that 's being asked but so the question is are both reports about this in a regular Wigram say from a staff perspective that council would consider this is part of the LTP pricey sorta no no no no no so we 've dealt with that I mean the that 's already dealt with so we 've dealt with it under the previous one so we do not vote the same side no no but we don 't need to deal with it we 've dealt with it under the previous report and pull McMahon 's accepted that that 's the decision that success was named the question is why wouldn 't be just part of the annual plan price but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what we did in the previous fun yeah okay right there any comments or that anyone will clear water but I urge counselors to support this in the original report that the QED Board received and council received in fact there was no reference at all to hear the heritage aspects of the building and and clearly the community see that there is a lot of character and history attached to this boat in which your things about approximately 80 years old our pool which when you consider the loss of heritage across the city this is an 80 year old building in one of the few buildings of that age still standing and it 's a cherished public library and I I really do think that even though it 's not listed did it should be considered by the council is a heritage building okay jaani johansson p i think it 's important just to put this into context when this first came for a request for demolition the committee actually said that we wanted the community board to provide its view it did provide the view that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on what the community board the new community board want us to do i think we 've talked about giving greater powers to community boards and i think it 's really important we listen to their concerns so happy to support it this is the other thing you should know about this building is it 's not a dangerous building it 's not a building that needs to be knocked down because it 's going to fall over and hurt someone or kill someone it 's a building that has actually got a residual value the issue for council is the fact of the cost to bring it up to earthquake code is considerably more than we have insurance for and and what the damages so that 's really the issue that council saw last time is why you might consider not fixing it because you obviously do something with that land and put that money into a joint facility but I really think we should listen to what the community board is saying in this case it is a local facility and if they value up then I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is there was 58 thousands of work done re-roofed and new spouting in August 2011 and then repair works valuing 30,000 162 dollars and the building would cost more to replace than it would to strengthen so I don 't think it would be good use of council money to know it down anyway well I mean I think that with the passing of this resolution it goes back to the community board for further consideration and in discussion with the local community so i 'll put the resolution all those in favor say aye those opposed say no carried thank you thank you much in this alley sorry and I have to know you have a resolution which I think will be a Clearwater scandrett resolution that we received the reports all those in favor say aye those opposed say no carried so we 've dealt with item 17 a as well and thank you very much Thank You minute man Kevin and that now we deal with delegations under the new building control organizational structure as there somebody who will move the yep I 'm wondering if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the community board cheese are waiting for well so they don 't have to hang around isn 't nearly each we must play and aimlessly just a suggestion I don 't know how you feel about changing I 'm though I don 't think we 'll take very long to get there yep so","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

yeah and there is a redfish and then from point 10 say the lease was taken over from 2005 2008 by accountant company yes they were very shocked that they then operate in breach of the resorts yes and it 's also a near the fact that the wind the council actually paid awake of holdings a substantial amount of money it was also to take over their liability of the non-complying consents okay scary okay I also have something here in the report which says this is an airport at one of these meetings the regulation and democracy services general manager publicly apologized for countless historic lack of compliance and monitoring relating to this site and provide an undertaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes I was at that meeting okay right now the only other question I have is his eidem four point three point five the council had said that they would respond to the matter by thirty first of all was 2009 and you chose to pursue an enforcement order application through the environment court before they responded to but why was that that was the reason for that was that I 'm at that meeting the council officers advised awake Holdings to seek variations to the existing consents we perceived what they were doing was advising them to legalize an illegal activity and we we either had to go to the Environment Court and test the legitimacy of the hints or perhaps have to fight variations to the consents okay that 's fine no more question um so clear water you just you 've said that you 've hit as a community had to live with the environmental effects from this neighborhood patch just explain briefly what some of them are and I can 't recall something being in the middie we 're going to just remind one this has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the community relatively close to the site and we 're continually subjected to dust noise road pollution and more recently the huge mdf fire which went for many many months and we were given assurances at that once the mdf fire was extinguished it would be removed from the site it was a sting wish many many months ago and it 's still on the site and even that itself was the mitigating facts were meet Davina was either meant to be covered or water down even that hasn 't taken place okay I 'm confused about the status of meter and your documentation you say that it 's a CCC company and partnership with Concord limited and in the attachment that you put as an exhibit note with the report of the meeting of the software and service center it says that the Peter summarized some of the issues raised at the last meeting one of them being the status of metal New Zealand limited and a comment made that the City Council had some responsibility of metal we in turn to Peter confirm that there is no connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be picking up the pieces there is no fall back on the council what 's the difference there well I guess very clever of people in me will be able to point that out and that is the fact that at that stage that we perceived that meter was a council company now I know through the logistics of bookwork you can make it look as though it isn 't a council company but basically it was the council that stampin up with one point five six million dollars to infect settle meters liability to the away corrode site now it 's a mystery to me here you can stump up with one point five six million dollars when you say it isn 't your company thank you I mean I what that obviously raises a few other questions yani Johanson um I think the point to make is that meter went belly-up and countless credit a lit out so so as part of the bailout this was one of the conditions that we pay the money and she gets resolved obviously it hasn 't been resolved I just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whether there 's anything that you think we should be doing as a council to deal with what 's currently happening there okay the result of the Environment Court hearing we put into place a lot of conditions which all parties have agreed to and create including the Christ City Council we have given all parties a period of time to implement that proposal and they are to basically two years for the landscaping proposal which will hopefully mitigate some of the things that we 're talking about where if all this had been implemented in 2005 which is in the same 2005 consent it would all be established now and we wouldn 't be here today having this conversation if it 'd just be clear when wind is the window these conditions have to be met what days and is there anything like the burnt-out stuff that 's there now that we should be serving abatement notices on or taking action on to geisha we 've been dealing with your accountant enforcement staff over that issue and sure what stage its head at this time but thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've raised a lot of questions certainly and the minds of councillors so thank you very much if you 're drawing presentation and on the same subject could we invite mike moore thank you you 're met me Ren counselors I 'm I 've been involved in the site for well over 20 years and not one day and that 20-year period not what not for one day has it ever complied with the conditions of its resource consent or resource consents and it 's still absolutely outstanding on heaps of resource consent issues so there 's a lot of work to be done on that side a report that i was reading last night said that that site could be over filled from the original ground level which judge Jackson ordered and in 2005 that it not be filled above the original ground level it has been filled above the original ground level between eight meters there was a bigger report came out about three years ago that the time when when we 're on site that report stated that the table that site down by one meter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last night on there and this is factual that it would site down to the compliance of the 1985 consent would cost between 264 and 330 million dollars now I know that people are sniggering and think that cannot be right I 'm telling you that is right and we 'd be trying to get this sorted out since the thing with average level this the biggest mess I think in the city and the City Council at the end of the day are possible as the crew operating on that site and sorry could I just interrupt from just can I eat a little caution around language and thank you and assertions about individuals who are not here to defend themselves thank you I wish they were but anyway the result of the situation has been the residents association being incorporated society has been the only tool that the community board has in the wider community of racket and Wigram to actually fight this issue and I the meeting at service indras at all of those meetings where promises were made the bull got a new enforcement team running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will get it sorted it 's never been sorted it 's never been sorted and not only did the council bailout matter to the tune of 18 million dollars 80 million dollars to bail mirror out they also paid one point five six million dollars to Ellen edge to take responsibility for the areas of non-compliance on that site so when we look at that and the hundred and twenty four thousand dollars that the residents association have had the front up to enforce to get done for the people of Christchurch because the council has not been doing and all they 're asking for is 50,000 to pay the illegal bills i would say that as the best bag in the city could ever look for if that is to the point of the law and not negotiated forced ago the second judge that was involved in the court case Judge bothwick got sick of being messed around by parties not awake not our Bertie a resident association but other parties involved in this case we 're not well over two years and this case still hadn 't been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they brought in another judge to hear it so after two and a half years of messing about that Judge two and one-half hours hear the case two and a half hours a new judge two and a half hours makes a decision that judge to made the decision to not to grant the residents association every costs but the previous judge had half way through the case Judge both mechanic because she could see that the residents association were doing a very very good job it wasn 't really there issue but somebody had to fight it so it was the residents association that thought the judge realized that and allowed the mating thousand dollars in costs at that point in time so honestly it 's a mess it 's not this has been to this christchurch city council we 've had heaps and heaps of meetings we 've met with enforcement team we 've met with peter mitchell and crew we 've met with everybody i hope current resource can see no it hasn 't all that mdf that was a business was a issue with that particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state here now uncovered it was supposed to be wind road as well so that the 12,000 cubic metres of combustible material would be wind road so if it was to spontaneously combust again it would be only a strip of it and then the fire service would be able to get in a thorough allowed on site and actually that hasn 't happened it was supposed to be that hasn 't happened why is it that all of these things are still happening and nothing 's getting done about there was a whole heap of mdf above the same em operator at Pearson good freezing work site that spontaneously combusted to that out to say the material that sitting seeping into our aquifer system there uncontained aquifer system now as we speak and I wacker bring that from from the islington site to the o workers they do they started cutting the bird stuff from islington and adding it no way illegally so things took an some community detectives including me we discovered this alerted our enforcement staff they discovered that that Mike and his crew were telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an issue an abatement notice to stop him from doing it and has he taken that stuff away the illegally put there so what I 'm saying is 50,000 to reimburse the residents association is just an absolute pittance compared council the nine they have it even to pick it up yet little and picked it up and done something with it they haven 't even been able to find it it 's been running out of control for four years we 've had different changes in the leadership of the enforcement team of the council that was supposed to be that time with a new enforcement team system in place is the enforcement arm of the council working to the satisfaction than it should be I would and looking at this issue alone no it 's not otherwise I wouldn 't have to be gone around snooping these people here wouldn 't have to be gone around snooping we wouldn 't have to be following their trucks down the road to see where they taken us illegal material we wouldn 't have to be doing that because our staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any questions Tim Scandrick I 'll just be clear that the council management knowingly bought a site which they knew was operating outside resource consents were in breach of Rico it was accounts that was me yeah mirror that was operating the site they leased the site of 0 from occur rected boy Alan edge because it changed several times in that period but Alan edge was involved in that slide all the way along through those changes when metal started going into difficulties financial difficulties the council brought mehta out and then they transferred the operation from a worker holding site to the Bromley treatment and transfer station site and that 's where they still operate now but to keep the trucks on the road and to keep the rubbish from being picked up boy from the people 's footpath the only way out at the time was for the council to give an 18 million dollar injection and to neither to keep it running so the trucks would still be at lea click the rubbish and take it away so suppose the core of the Christian is we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the liability i believe is well you 'd have to say the owner of the site owns the liability because the liability that was left on that site by meta was except mr. edge when he took the check for one point five six million dollars from the right players of christchurch so we thank you that 's that that 's the end of the time allotted for the presentation thank you very sure to speed up a little bit to lay more time for questions it 's all right thank you very much and now we move on thank you and I 'm just going to move that the supplementary reports that have been circulated to councillors be formally brought onto the agenda as as reports if is there any objection to that course of action i 'll just take the leave of the council to do that there appears to be none thank you very much and I","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

10,GPYMDMc6Vkg,20131211,708.75,"Christchurch, New Zealand",2073,"oh um now I 'm not going to be able to pronounce people 's names so perhaps if you come to the table and then please introduce yourselves thank you very much did ER and counselors my name is and rubicam smart nough Lydia be as a street and some of you may have met Phil L me before and Richard are geotech engineer are as I say loosely I was unable to attend this is made similar in august 2013 when there was a different council sitting before us and i 'm not just like to restate the urgency with which we like this matter moved on essentially it 's all about house now we 've got some slides up at the front I think you 've got that on your front of you now and really it 's about so the rock protection funding offer from across the city council in relation to private land IE one house or the possibility of area-wide mitigation for the larger immediate community and back in almost a year are going out the council moved to consider funding for our protection structures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however we still believe that slightly short-sighted and so ali if you persecute us move on to the next one this maybe gives a better representation just about the slope above us tie the side of us you can see that the yellow connotations that just dictate more cliff face and in between the sort of blue identified rockfall source is kinder more gentle so what so we 've been told by geotech engineers and so either side of our house we 've had the portillo geotechnics s at least twice and we 've had Geoscience go up there as well another approved provider for geo technical support and there 's been no rock roll than 60 metres either side of its not a companies that sort of covers over approximate 18 houses one of them kneeland bev on the corner of lower son of a lamp and survey are green we 'd like to give them some more neighbors and we think it 's a sensible and viable option to consider area-wide mitigation its favorite 25th 2011 out F that 's great thanks Ali we 've been out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our knowledge with which we 've looked into is currently the only house seeking Rock protection funding from the Christchurch City Council and I think there 's only two other houses we know that we 're not entirely sure down on lower Simon avail if they 've taken out the the offer from the government yet so if we follow the recommendations to pursue Rock protection funding on private land however we 've had geotechnical advice time and time again pretty much ever since day one that area wide mitigation in our area is cost-effective and so I guess looking onto the next slide the bigger pictures we 've touched on before is that there 's you know 17 houses including ours currently unoccupied that yeah they do need a bit of touch of work there 's no doubt about it but the land is safe and there 's currently a housing shortage so um why are we not looking forward to spending more money to save a lot more houses and get you know recoup a lot more money and and I guess one of our key questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time I 've had immense support from Phil and other members of the community and even they you know sort of unfunded geo tech support as well too and we just fielding a lot of work and we 're always working against the the council staff and we just with we 've had a good indication of one solution i don 't know if it 's the solution where you know the council we asking the council are considering spending up to about a million dollars and recouping potentially seven million dollars of housing asset based on a 2007 government valuation and fairly sure if you move on their alley thanks that we 'd you know those houses may well be worth quite a bit more at this particular time so what are we asking the council please support area wide mitigation that 's both time and cost effective as opposed to just doing one house at a time and also just a reminder that the council is an equal partner with Sarah and sharing fifty percent of the red running costs so please use our money to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and councils ratepayers area-wide mitigation for our media community as well and you know it 's it 's a win-win situation council make a real difference in rescuing good quality houses and saving millions of dollars so just just to recap for the next picture their alley if you would just a quick summary there the yellow lines dotted down so we 've you know initially we geoscience was commissioned to look at our house and they looked at three very straightforward solutions treatment outsourced are going up and bolting and netting and i believe the sermon shop treating the cliff face in blue and that was more to do with our house however you know when we discussed about extending that scope they into council and they looked at the next alley if you would thank you they this is an aerial view points here is that the dotted lines are similar to the previous picture our house is dotted in red you 'll notice that there is some purple boulders and there 's some blue boulders the blue boulders are historical ones they 've fallen between the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those have fallen since februari 2011 so that 's the corridors and it sort of gives you an indication about the gullies with which these boulders will fall and if they do fall again those are bolded lines that they 'll most likely take and that 's that 's geotechnical advice that 's not just sort of our thoughts on it however the red line is the area of the captain thomas and the proposal for one earthworks bund of 250 meters along those lines would be approximately in a conservative estimate over 950,000 and this is again what we 've asked them Richard Anand Geoscience New Zealand team to provide for us just as a you know chem geotechnical he backed idea of what 11 structure would be they 've they 've also said in order to lead seriously support revisiting treatment its source however it in order to do that they really need to get boots on the ground up there and that 's that 's quite a lot of time to get up there next if you would please I like thanks so we made the similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this response and I know there 's a new council and a lot of other things have been going on but nothing 's happened and you know where we 're not a unique situation here there are a number of other communities you know it can be a number of houses and a small number a large number but within the port hills this I guess you could argue a model kit extended areas where they 're very sensible cost-effective means returning people to their houses and we did talk about trees before and certainly mirror that 's another discussion but area-wide mitigation itself based on geo technical assessment about life risk is what we really want to push forward and if you please move on to the next slide so that just recoups basically potential costs that you 're exposed to or we may be already be exposed to and if if you can recoup them also in considerations that you know this tenders up for about twenty five thousand dollars per house and that 's approximating about two hundred thousand dollars the cost of activities Christchurch City Council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars and this is from the crisis city council and this alley if you would the next one so again just briefly cost-benefit I guess one thing that 's been put forward over by Gerry Brownlee is that the you know if it does go forward then hopefully when you know Sarah and crisis city council get together and agree on this let the the original owners would have first right sorry purchasing their property and then if not then them then you know council have the right to put this up on the market I 'm not sure how much more time do I have nope three minutes great I think we 're just about finishing up just quickly this is the next one le just quickly this is actually on page 126 to the committee agenda so it 's the first agenda here and on the left-hand side is the cost effective concerns when it was made a decision by Sarah not to pursue it in our answer simply as that as far as we can say between Sarah and yourselves you 're spending a million dollars and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know it 's not a fence we 're looking for it 's a bun dortch and or treating its source and so again there 's some all those concerns were raised back and I think 2012 so you know it 's a very sensible and straightforward acting without weed request the council to make in this matter and maybe in our situation as a start and then hopefully extending this to other communities as well and what it does gone I think evidences feel just make a comment in relation to this is case hundreds of help on the port hills that could be viably saved in an economic way the is not backed up by technical evidence we 've displayed that time and time it 's now and it needs to happen fast the bark or on the port hills is at a stage where we 'll send into a great deal of community this location and legal action and you know that 's what 's going to happen unless the council backs now it 's 10 minutes exactly but I 'm just going to take much years you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question are you aware that the minister has stated that well that the government has stated that they won 't change the zoning even if the mitigation has put in place yeah absolutely and the thing is that there 's two bouncers that first of all I will consider it if you remove all the rock fall hazard now I 've talked to engineer about that that 's millions and millions of dollars we 're going to meet with Sarah engineer as well just to clarify exactly how much rock we have to remove but around the world there are many many examples and very sensible effective measures and we don 't have a promising red zone because our insurance company or supporters are bankrolling supporters and people of other houses around us right as residents we can 't do anything about what the minister has decided we think that you possibly can I appreciate my pressure okay look thank you very much for your deputation I mean it 's it is worthwhile and I think that part of what we 've discovered as a new council and we discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is such a Pinter level of frustration and different parts of the community that we were quite overwhelmed at that at that meeting but please be assured that your representations today are being listened to and we will certainly take them away and and do what we can within the constraints that that our environment places upon us but thank you very much it 's been a very powerful presentation okay fresh","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

factually incorrect statements contained in the staff report and given the opportunity the ARA can produce relevant documentation the justification for taking proceedings and the Environment Court was to clarify the conditions of the 1986 consent the breaches of the 2005 can see could not be properly addressed until such time as the decision was made on the breaches of the 1986 consent of excessive

orders were put before the court by the ARA which broadened they met the remedies available to the court to mitigate non-compliance however the full-back orders should not have been seen as suggesting the aoac a personal sense anything other than strict compliance with the 1986 consent it should judge Thompson 's orders are interim and the ARA is able to return to the environment court within seven

finding a solution and agreement between 2005 and 2007 the ARA generously gave the lessee 's of the site is new zealand time to complete their plans and it was very disappointing to the ARA when it was realized that the site had become an environmental mess and subjected to lex monitoring by enforcement staff all parties have acknowledged that the site was a breach of the 1986 consent and the ARA considers they had helped substantially to find a solution the AIA fails theory let down by staff report recommending the council decline contributing to level costs incurred by the ARA failing to carry out duties competently in accordance for the Resource Management Act and as a consequence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admitted as recommends to declining the IRS request for financial support which will have the effect of the ARA going into debt for finding a solution to a very difficult environmental situation which was not caused by the M sound decisions are made by gathering all facts which can be

ARA that found a workable solution and if proven successful would have saved the Christchurch City Council a significant amount of public funds thank you for listening to me are there any questions cool sorry if Peter could just do it has one on a half a minute I type I mean if you want to use all of it yeah I can 't Jimmy chin so the based on your the submission information I would like to know especially at a pair of six and seven so a moment you got a phantom from communal boys eleven thousand dollars from the mo e @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much you all ready to spend yeah he started treating with the legal yes I just got a calculation act justly a total cost for all costs and 2005 consent was around 25,000 plus and for this case everything it 's a hundred thousand-plus that 's that 's that 's that 's what that 's what the costs are you know and it 's 50,000 years and we have had funding and what they what the residents of contributors well can you just expand in the short time available on why the council didn 't pursue the abatement notice and that you felt that you know the community had to take it on board what 's your cover yeah what it really comes down to is that we had two meetings with the council staff at the supply and service center good on a solution to the problem the council at the time thought the way forward was for resource consents be requested to it to legalize an illegal activity and we knew we were placed in between a rock and a hard place and that we would either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the environment call or forced to fund fighting the new resource consent application in the environment court so we knew we had existing resource consents which spent thousands of dollars getting those and it was easier to seek enforcement 's of the

received the report first thing this morning you consider that report and therefore that item 22 ferry road master plan will be on the agenda for next week 's meeting so thank you very much and we return now to deputations and the next deputations and relation to the Litchfield street ain 't crossing car parks and I think to howl from the ocean partners is here to speak to their thank you the area that 's to be developed around the bridge remembrance on the south side of where the terraces are we are adjacent to the west side of the electrical street car park we 're the owner of the ODP which is the only live one sitting on the block of the prison time and we are confident that following the work that we 're doing with Sarah at the present time we will be in a position to deliver a world-class an outstanding development which will be on the banks of the river park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one key issue that the success of this development will fall on all be successful on and that is the access to modern efficient revitalized in permanent car parking solutions at the present the asset being the litchfield street car park has set for a long period of time and the feedback we 're receiving is that even if it is to be repaired there will be some concerns that the initial outset about going back into that building given the length of time it set there and the nature in the way that it 's been portrayed as being a damaged air said we have been with dialogue and dialogue with the Christchurch City Council over an extended period about entering into a joint venture with neighboring landowners to redevelop the sympathy card street and enable a solution where it can be funded by private sector owned by a of City Council and private sector managed by either the council what private sector in consultation with council and with the ability of council to take ownership of this air set back in a 25-year period so effectively we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with council retaining long-term control of the acid Christchurch good history of asset ownership and the council should be very proud of that I think I 'm not in it surprising as an investment banker to say not supportive of selling every asset that has owned however I would say is a need at some point in time to consider partnerships as long as the long-term future of these strategic assets within the council framework are kept within their control there is a lot of capital required for the rebuild of the necessary parking assets and knowing the cost of the redevelopment of litchfield alone as we are anced in the pricing of that we are aware mindfully that there is insufficient capital in the budget which the council has available to repair all of the assets that they need to so I think an offer in or a solution to work with private sector is at this point in time one that should be given a significant amount of consideration we are proposing to one of two options and one of them is obviously a negotiation with council however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone through for this to be achieved alternatively and this is the likely path that we are proposing would be an uninvited bid under the ministry of business innovation and economic rules to submit an uninvited bid to redevelop impact council in delivering the outcomes that we that I 've referred to we would like to also work with council if it was deemed appropriate of an event that we were successful in a bid to consider the insurance position on the asset as other work that we are doing in our advisory capacity of our business is seeing that there may be more assurance available in the event that would end to be multiple claims that affected the the latrel Street asset event under control and would obviously not be part of our development but we are offering we 're offering that part as well I have put in front two pieces of paper which I hope you have schematically we have prepared what the redeveloped car park may look like and we are advanced in pricing pneus structural steel has been prepared that the degree are the diagrams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be able to press them and we anticipate that we will be able to have a bit on the table by December end of December so in a couple of weeks next week currently there were 90 920 car parks before the earthquake we understand that 300 of these in the council car park have now disappeared with the removal of the crossing and the Valentine 's car parks so a restoration of the existing asset is around 600 car parks being returned we are proposing an asset which will deliver about 750 car parks and the advantage of 28 residential apartments on the north side that will deliver an immediate number of people into the central city as residents that does two things one it starts the flow of people back into the city into it will help with our crime prevention through Environmental Design for the risk issues around the crime for by having people in the independent 24 hours a day I think the basis of our in the urgency for our approach has been that we are in discussions with the bank of new zealand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accommodation in the city there is an email that has been circulated to you as counselors that I have seen a copy that expresses the urgency of being able to determine the car parking Lucien in that critical thing of their decision to in their timing to re into the city so it 's not just developers saying we want the car park solution to be accelerated we actually need it because we are in very time critical discussions with major tenants who will bring the fabric of the commercial sector back to the city to have any questions see anyone got any questions Yanni Johansson oh um just in regards to you know you 've talked about the asset belonging to council war or doing a joint venture but you know no other cities around New Zealand have sold off their car parking building and that set an impact on the prices that people are charged in terms of the view whether counsel should just do it ourselves if we if we had the money would this be a good investment in terms of the demand for car parking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comment on whether you should be managing or outsourcing because there may be there may be an answer for you to own it to control the pricing you need outsource management alone anyway so it would it be a good investment it would be an investment if one had capital the question in the reason that we 're bringing this to you as we are asking probably whether the capital is available for the redevelopment of all the assets that are needed in the city so I guess it 's a good investment if the capital was there but we 're suggesting that the capital may be sure but it would centimeter investing capital into a car park building which provides a return there 's probably a more sensible use of capital if you if you 've got a shortage if you have enough to provide all the other car parts isa would be Phil Clearwater who could you outline where the entrances and exact but for the proposed car parking part would be the insurance in the exit is on the right-hand side of the green wall so it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ park and if you wear the cap council staff have advised us that in terms of the proposed scale of vehicle movements in fact because of potential conflict with pedestrians insight to say that this needs further investigation I it may need through their investigation dresses the urgency that we are looking at bringing tenants back into the city who need an outcome and they need an outcome in the near em there is no assets available with no tenants to use them so balancing the need for investigation loses the need for a decision to get tenants needs to be very carefully considered from a council perspective thank you a question following on from there so with Litchfield Street no longer being one way does that make a difference in terms of traffic flows it is something that needs to be worked through we 're obviously looking at that it probably as an advantage in some way of getting access into the car park and it 's one where we need to look at with the entrance and the exit lanes going at what point they start to queue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and what we know but obviously if we were successful in the bid we 'd be able to have those negotiations with council thank you through any other quick question back very quickly is this the only thing that 's stopping you from developing this it is one of the things we need to be clear about to enable istea tenants one of the things it 's a bit thank you very much much appreciated now we 've moved on to the portholes slope stability informational paper,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

community your travel through there 's about 2,800 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a million people each year who are transporting along that corridor so will any description that 's a significant part of the activity for public transport within christchurch and i think if you look at it from a kind of holistic perspective you 've got record as being a link between the east central and the west and write the prison time it is really under resourced in terms of infrastructure and capacity so the basic infrastructure it has there at the moment doesn 't I think meet the customers needs it 's not there 's not user friendly it 's not user friendly for buses and not user friendly for people who drive along the roads associated with those that include cyclists so it 's really few amenities there 's little if any weather protection really limited space for passengers and buses you 'll if you have a look at the stop outside of mcdonalds you 'll find some planter boxes on the right side you 'll find red paint green cape white paint and purple paint where buses have it various times struck those planets as they try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy access I think that I would look at harsh perhaps but would describe the the facilities in record currently a second-rate they really don 't match we would want to be as a city I think and where we need to go particularly when you look what 's the wonderful designs that are occurring within the central city if you then walk out of that along wreck of the road it 's so many others transformation to something really belongs back in the 50s because that 's kind of where it is in my view and also passenger numbers continue to grow and we 're getting you know seminary presenting here currently and that would continue and when they see central city comes back online i believe it 'll be step up again just to reflect on those 1 million passengers i just acknowledge the business owners comments and concerns and I think I kind of come to that a minute in terms of what they might look like what am I feel like she 's want to make the comment that each one of those individuals carries a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area which that kind of accessing transport for orders and the Christmas as who these people are and is a couple of nth images there you 've got in front of you which talks about the shows a bit of detail on the past you mean sorry I had a projection I had a presentation to give but I can 't today but you 'll notice significantly and this is pre earthquake obviously there a substantial part of the though I saw this image of poor near too well so she economically challenged people isn 't actually true I mean there 's a whole range of people all across the range from those who are wealthy and have vehicles and this is a means getting around to those who have fewer options and constitutes a good a good proposition the thing when you look at age also you see there 's a reasonably good distribution of age traveling on so we 're not talking about again a particular group of individuals it 's actually the whole community are traveling on public transport so as long as see in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accessible space you know it 's got a connection between the mall in the street so it looks like a sort of a connection there potentially obviously is going to provide things like real time during the information so passengers who want to come can see what use the bus service can see when the next bus is coming Oh with what 's being proposed around the central city so look and feel you know in terms of development I think that 's something useful I actually quite like the idea of having a cafe as part of that proposal or retail for that matter because it seems to me that joins the public transport which is actually normal it 's just not used by a lot of people into a kind of the community and a wider sense I think that 's something valuable to encourage and one of the failures if you like of the previous interchanges where they were completely isolate they were separate from retail separate from any other activity that might be described as kind of broadly normal and I think that finally that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ businesses in the area and through that the walkway into that area now I 've got a couple of photographs there of a retail based interchange from overseas and I think that 's where this proposal is really going it 's really trying to integrate the community of retail into kind of normalize public transport and I think it 's something as well well worth pursuing having said that I acknowledge the concern that business owners have I think there 's an opportunity here that I say look how can we implement this in a way which infecting encourages and enhances that rather than creates a negative outcome so common summary answer I think it 's a good step forward it 's good like it 's a good facility a good good location and it 's someone 's used early they comment not perfect but it 's it 's a really big step forward it gives I think improved access safety and comfort but passengers really critical in terms of passenger transport growth I think it actually does support the ritalin community business center if you like in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view it also suggests a way forward for other other interchanges and also tries to create a above some service continuity across the sea so when you go from central city through records and the home or in the morning there 's potentially some some new facilities there that look and feel much the same and I guess in that respect what I 'd like to do is sort of as a parting furniture uses encourage the council to look at a similar facility on the other side of the road that 's within the line of sight so you 've got a effectively kind of transport hub which services people both coming in and out of the city and across the city have you taken to Christmas thank you okay well Jimmy chin and then Yanni and then call in question based on your presentation your particular emphasis the anything a function of the bus passenger the weight in knowledge but the key issue properties how to link the past stock or past the end of the passengers the kind of offer univ 89 g but right now because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 119 victim rule they have a currently either a car park space in there so at the same time only can bill for two and a half bus stop in the area but I also reviewed a curving the bus stop in the car park of ways feel more commonly the Pistons means is a camp Air Force reader pasta at the same time and also they have space to extension to up to the sixth pasta at the same time a moment my understand is quite heavy you know the past come in a boat job in the pic other people so whether there is sufficient space for the past stop in the post of 119 a victim look at the same time my understanding is the design that 's being proposed around the bus stop so there 's three bus stop so basically it 's stop and go which is what Nigel talked about so the bus has come in they come up to the stop la then load and they go and the sufficient room to allow them to get off the road without having tail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the main road and then to get back out again after that so as I understand it it 's it 's a well-designed slick operation that perspective Yanni Johansson I 've got Sarah Christopher like everybody you 've got one minute so you leave some time for an answer thanks for photos they look they look like wicked and more with a real-time information board which is great but the hubs and spokesmodel what 'swhat your feedback that you 've had from people around the convenience and benefits or just benefits of the hubs and spokesmodel I think there are a number of views are not really sure who really want to spend time on it right now I five for me I 'd rather respond to a question about the this under change I think that 's critical we have good facilities along main corridors and this is a core corridor for public transport in Christchurch repair bandera road Rick Allen Road Archy cool car doors and they should be well-serviced I think regardless of how the model actually is is designed 12 seconds we 've heard from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had a hub and spoke model out on colombo street now I was in my previous life in the business association management central city we spend a million dollars on that getting that foot out done and I can tell you it always appeared empty and the people tended to be out on the street can you just cut make a quick a little bit I do absolutely I think that 's really about having a collocation of activity so retail and other activity associated with that rather isolated it separate from from the rooster community that 's right I understand that thank you killer or deputations on that issue so will now break for morning tea but before we do i 'll just say that that as i said we will deal with this issue at the council meeting next week we won 't be receiving through the delegations are deputations on the issue and we will be in a position to consider additional information which we will request from staff as a result of the deputations that have been before us this morning so thank you very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past eleven so it allows 15 minutes for a cup of tea or coffee and people are welcome to join us outside and the foyer thank you","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

7,0nj0LRFXXEw,20131211,602.66,"Christchurch, New Zealand",1447,all hyper operating director of go bus your worship councillors thinking for the opportunity to come and address you this morning gogos transport fully supports the proposal to establish the passenger transport hub including the waiting lounge facilities in riccarton go bus is a major provider of public transport along the record and corridor we operate many trips per day transporting large numbers of customers in to and from the Rickett and shopping area we carry a cross section of passengers through to elderly to workers in the area people with disabilities and residents these pets a great facility that provides a safe in accessible environment I 'm mindful of your pointing so I 've got three key points that I 'd like to speak to first of all safety the current layout encourages a dangerous mix of traffic and pedestrians our drivers daily observed passengers and cars dodging each other while they 're attempting to cross the roads to catch buses there 's also issues with pedestrians walking between the buses which which frankly is quite the current stop layout is not adequate to accommodate the number of buses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not been able to get into the stops spins into the traffic and this is results generally in motorists and cyclists making unsafe passing maneuvers the second point I 'd like to speak to is accessibility we believe that providing this bus stops ly outside the lounge is critical to the success of this passengers with limited mobility need to be close to where the bus is stopping it 's not practical to have the lounge and have the bus stops further down the road that 's simply not going to be able to get there equal it 's equally important that the bus is able to pull up parallel to the stop to enable the accessibility features that have been built into the buses to be fully utilized and the grist slightly this week we deal with a complaint from a wheelchair passenger who was unable to disembark from the stop because the bus couldn 't get the current stock couldn 't get up to the up to the footpath and deploy the wheelchair ramp so the only solution they had was to go down to the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driver and in an an enviable position but also was greatly for the wheelchair passenger the bus operators and councils have invested vast sums of money in supplying accessible buses they have wheelchair bays ramps and conil to the curb christchurch has been a leader in this it was the first council to insist that buses be built with two wheelchair bays to to provide positions for people in wheelchairs but also for mums with a pram and people with mobility walkers and so forth these features are useless unless we can get the bus up to well to the to the curb in the benefits not just for wheelchair passengers you know people with limited mobility as I mentioned before mums with prams elderly use the feature every day another point I want to make is that having having the ability to get in and out of the stops quickly as essential it speeds up our boarding and and unloading of passengers it 's not a layup it 's a bus stop so the bus comes in drops off passengers picks up passengers and disembarks they won 't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a transit point we also feel the security is going to be important it 's going to be improved providing an up-market facility encourages people to use it and encourages people into the area and any less desirable people generally don 't congregate in those areas where their security whether a CCTV and a lot of people around it 's not an area that they go to and there 's plenty of examples around New Zealand web with interchanges and facilities with that type of facility has removed a lot of that congregating of undesirables in that and of course it 's one of those self-fulfilling things the more you the better facilities you provide the more friendly it is the more people use it and it 's just self generating so in conclusion I 'd like to thank the council the opportunity to speak and happy to take any questions thank you thank you back all lands now you just in terms of the ability for people in wheelchairs and other end for the hole mobility issue does it work for you as an operator on the existing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were lengthened to allow the number of buses to actually fit in there as opposed to sticking out as they currently do i would imagine that would the existing stock allows the us to deploy and Neil so the curve is is adequate for that the structure if you were designing this and you had a skinny narrow structure that you may or may not be able to build anything on given that you may not own it what sort of structure would you then put there in terms of the footpath in the curving structuring you mean we 're in place of the current bus stops outside wicket amor I guess the the key thing is providing shelter with sufficient curb height and two for us to use those accessible features would be the key thing the Alps was the other point is that they did we need good access to where people want to go and and I think you know the point that the position of this proposal gives that Paul Paul ons Dale who questions the squishy ask for renewed obviously had more information how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me this model could fit very nicely and the current location I think the general feedback is that it was an improvement on what they had before but it 's not perfect but I guess it 's one of those things ever please everyone and the second thing was around security you talked about the undesirables wouldn 't want to be where security is now security are going to be inside the fussing p the model the lounge which would then say to me that the undesirables will linger at the street and cause the province sorry yeah i think the proposal included circuit TV cameras and the likes in just general population you know that they 're unlikely to graffiti something while there 's a lot of people around the chances of getting caught Jamie golf thanks Mitch this makes a bit quicker Vicki asked my first question pool that 's the second so I 'm pretty good apart from just your answer that you gave that was around the soup stop and my question is really going to be about from a from an operational perspective how go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Northlands just your common interested me though around working well but not perfect I know perfect doesn 't quite as US but what could be done and you know realistic feasible fashion that would make that super stock better or more functional from your perspective to be honest and I don 't think I 'm qualified to answer that question that I 'm relatively new arrival at christ church so I didn 't really have a lot of exposure to how it worked for unfortunate if I had a colleague here who might be able to answer he 'd be able to give probably a more informed position so just when you say it 's it it 's not perfect it could there could be better then not sure how that okay the the the feedback that I 've had just generally i 'm not trying to crush you know that 's right except that we 're running out of time so yes or even out who he is I suppose it 's one of those things that whatever you do is never never going to be perfect I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and out of the stops quickly and the traffic flow through the airs doesn 't necessarily lend itself to their everything thank you twenty seconds to go thank you very much for your time and I thank our next dumb submit it may well be able to,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

is john harrington and i 'm the owner of 111 he wicked on row the 60 so we 've got quite a bit of experience on Rick Allen Road the advent of malls has been the demise of strip shopping in New Zealand with record and being no exception good quality retail outlets the key to the survival of record and shopping area and retailers I 'd key tenants such as avanti Scorpio books baby factory etc variances in surrounding ones will suffer from a downturn of business to the extent that was someone will close or in who will replace them but more food outlet and so it goes on until we end up being like another church his fight with it 's got a lot of experience and editing and can back that up I 'm trying to lease just completed building a few doors away we could have easily lead it to food outlets as we had numerous inquiries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm prospective tenant looked at the food outlets either side of us in said no nearly speak has said that the bus exchange will bring vitality back to record and I dispute that I think it will do quite the opposite does this city or the local the local community want this I don 't think so the business area is the identity of record and we don 't want to lose it the idea of Metro passengers come in to catch a bus having a coffee sitting down with their laptop or lounging about as great in theory but in reality we 're congregating on the footpath because the bus is only five to ten minutes away in consequently blocking the shop windows which are crucial for attracting passage in entranceways pedestrians trying to make their way through a crowded footpath is daunting if not threatening especially with young people who don 't tend to make room we 'll sit on the footpath it 's graffiti in rubbish everywhere buses can only pull into where there were car parks and not off the road and this will cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it is in line with the mall car park and here the shelters upgraded as has been done at northlands the interchange is not needed metros only thought it was a good idea because it was offered to them we were off we were asked we did ask to have the question sent to us that was done by the survey to the Metro users and their gain nothing came forward but from what we could gather the questions were a little bit loaded is and you know would you like a coffee lounge of course you 're going to say yes would you like some way where you can sit down and you know relax cuz you 're going to say yes I don 't think the questions were as a user what could we what could we do to improve the route if they came up with ideas those ideas well I think there 's a whole different scenario and if you 're adamant that there has to be an exchange put it in the record and more car park either by compulsory acquiring the land or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the library is thank you thinking I just like to add a couple of things and ideas have come along today because I feel quite strongly about it and just an or decision making the one was the consultation process as a group of building owners we got invited to a meeting and then subsequently to another meeting that we got one days advance warning on and most of us couldn 't attend and the reporting back on the consultation was quite different to what we fit in so I have concerns about the information that you 're receiving around the consultation that 's number one the other one as I don 't think any of us dispute that there needs to be a bus bus service down Rakatan but the fact that we 're proposing a bus park where there 's not going to be a bus lay to take them off the road as just crazy in a road that 's already so congested and in between the two main roads feeder roads into the mall so unless that can be looked at then what you 're doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congested the other thing that I 'd like to feed on as as the building proposal having worked with people and events I but long skinny building is not a safe place and I 've been doing a lot of work with international students and big users of the bus service and big users of it on record and road and for young females or Asians going in there at night into a space that you go back into without visibility is not a safe place and they will avoid it so I think and as a female I would avoid it as well so I think you 're some of the premises there are quite flawed in terms of use and I would like the council to really consider all other options I do believe the current bus position as good in that its services the roads from the area all around and we are we 're putting it as immediately got the shops and the mall behind so for those that are going from home to catch about the current location is probably one of the best in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I add to the discussion thank you very much questions Paul lonsdale you mentioned the Northlands model which is interesting did you actually our staff how successful weather 's been in the customer satisfaction around that that particular model which could actually quite easily fit in not personally but one of the people in our group discussion had done it and they had been long in they had surveyed the people staining their asking them what the opinion of it was and I they loved it yeah any other questions it appears to be all thank you very much for end again thank you for helping us with them combining your

hoping not to be there long thank you very much for i 'm here in me today i am a newly elected member of the Ripken and Lou Gramm community board and we 've been dealing with a lot of serious issues in what I 've loot from the noble subdivision as let 's try and get this right the first time other huge expense not just financial physically all sorts of damage and say stops to be presented where they are be simply they are going to be placed on the current road where is it present as I traveled down record road the other day heading west approaching record and McDonald 's there was the bay for which the buses can come off the road which there 's a couple of places for buses and the third one kind of struts that 's really in doubt now I noticed at that point that these are lots of garden area there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could actually be room for a third one in come off the road when I was at a another meeting of a new Henderson Basin subdivision and will there was a hubs and spokes person representing the hubsan spokes design for their area and he stated then it is one quick mode and that 's to actually put parked buses on it and such a manner and so what is safety and I would love you to order the peanuts safe tons it 's John back traffic it 's difficult for the buses to maneuver on the road when they come off goods there 's been ranger at present I 'm concerned that there will be danger going forward you and so I put a question that arises out of their presentation we 've got to get a place of shelter for people by winter how do we do that without going down this track yes um I haven 't looked at that because it 's mere I 'm looking at the same you know the safety report could possibly advise that but my personal opinion would be to extend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the next block that would show to them I 'm not sure of the current material because a lot of it can get damaged today glass and who speaks and all of that sort of thing I 'm thinking maybe the old design of wood that it 's as to maybe put their you know designs on the walls etc to invite them to be power is being powerful Christchurch such a aimed the record and sound so you don 't you don 't think that a shelter a successful they personally I was concerned about the opinion poll that was it appeared disingenuous when I spoke to the people at the relevant matings that the polls would bring reflection from the opinion poll so I am because these that 's become available one consume that we 're just trying to grade the first thing that comes along with it see that there are and cheaper in safer ways in which to deal with that Paul n cotton Thank You TV do you think that that location is too far for people to walk with all their shopping to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you think that would work does it work now walking too far from where Tori aside from written more tow to be the best side McDonald 's you 're talking about isn 't it where they are now well they walk via Nair so it wouldn 't be a problem because the bus stops are currently via I would be suggesting that leaves the bus stops where they are and maybe just knock out a bit of the garden area so we can make room for food bus stop any other questions I had breath Angie yeah Derek I did the community board consider just amending the current bus stop so that it could fit three buses in and put in some kind of shelter removing the bus stops from outside the shops you extending the current bus stop which is what you just called about so did the community board discussed that option ah luton they did I certainly did and did you have any staff input on whether that was feasible I think they 're wanting to run with what they 've got at hand and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the congestion where they 're proposing to put them you don 't have to start all today to discuss no no we 're going to have the debate next week so we 'll have staff and next weekend yes Jimmy chin four minutes thank you me ask you one question you mentioned earlier regarding to your particular concern safety issue then the camel poor you know make recommendations regarding to the undertaken the independent safety audit but right now because the due to the repo is only one option am i right the proposed 119 predicted law but if ever two option was your point of view is this kind of the independent safety auditor is cover every option or just these hearts you well because I 'm not an independent safety person I don 't expect you to all believe my my word but I do travel on the road and I do know the congestion that arises I about the congestion of the traffic because the buses aren 't coming off the roads and remembering what the means seen about the hubs and spokes model when he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to color road as to have parked buses there especially when we 're talking a main road like this I I think it 's so important just to have the maneuver off as they are keep it safe create shelters create some art design to betterment the streetscape and possibly continue with your lounge it 's it 's not that far away from the bus stops if they 're wanting a lounge but in regards to safety in foot traffic and the crossings of roads I can only see people trying to jet out and walk on between buses and so forth and such a congested area so close to lights and anything else somebody thank you very much

handed out to run manager of the crossing and the city bus exchange for seven years and I quote bus interchanges are very distinct beast when they come into close contact with most types of commercial business especially retail positioning any bus interchange near or outside a prominent retail environment comes from either a lack of knowledge of what the adverse effects may follow or simply an ill-informed belief that broadly public transport grace tss retailers and their businesses in my experience at the crossing I had four businesses that failed almost certainly due to the location which was situated on or close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frontages blocked by mainly gangs of youths some quite intimidating and manner and appearance not only that the window space which is most retail in which in most situation most retail situations as vital to a business was never seen there was any branding of display merchandise appreciated by the passing by traffic indeed the only businesses that sorry these businesses include a cafe sports store gift store and fashion retailer indeed the only business do reasonably well was a 24-hour branded dairy that mainly traded well in alcohol cigarettes fast motorists most of the real concerns will come after dark with these businesses closed with closed bus sorry most of the real concerns will come after dark we 're with businesses closed this bus interchanges tend to attract attention from groups of adolescents that temp to turn these areas into their own patches which usually means constant tagging Wars and other group and other groups of youths with of course draws the surrounding buildings into this resulting conflict and some very real expense for the building owners and businesses I 've also attached a letter from Craig Nicholas who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ menswear and nine shots from the crossing right down to literature Street and his letter outlines the very bad experiences he had when the bus stops moved outside his shops and the exchange around the corner the adverse effects on the retails retailers are fumes noise and vibration of bus engines smokers bikes and intoxicated people who are not able to enter the lounge and have to wait on the relatively narrow pavement together with the constant stream of passenger arrivals and purchase shop displays and entrances will be blocked also another thing that happens these people continue going past the door they keep activating the electric doors so with the fumes wouldn 't act old times people stand in the door as the doors get open the fumes blown to the shops it 's a very very difficult situation for retailers 50 meters the links the three bus stops will become extremely busy intimidating for people especially the elderly and disabled and negotiator path through the shopping experience will be ruined the good shops will depart rents will decrease and less attractive shops will move in it will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the area and the end of the dream for vikatan village it will become a shabby area with constant graffiti mess and vandalism it is little wonder that a recent meeting at opinions market research a hundred percent of business and property owners present were permanently ement Lee opposed to the bus stops being shifted and the interchange located at 119 wicked and Road of interest though a hundred percent of these people like the idea of hubs and spokes and interchange now little bit of leader facilities the obvious location is where the prison bus stops are located beside wis fields car park where there are no retail shops if the size of the slip line for buses was lengthened at this location to accommodate the three or more bus stops if necessary and better covered seating like the new facility at northlands with peps bike stands and hopefully toilets were installed this is the ideal location for an interchange negotiations could then be undertaken with Westfield to allow for a lounge on their car park while a lounge is desirable it is not essential for an interchange there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ option that wouldn 't delay the interchange happening the interchange could go ahead before next winter under that option the lounge is the only thing that would depend on but there as I said there is a coffee shop and the intranet it very near the entrance way and from there a lot of people submitters said that they 'd like it covered between the bus stops in the entranceway another point to is that i haven 't mentioned them is that a lot of elderly people shop at pac and save and riccarton they will their trolleys out of there to the bus stops and leave the trolleys there and carry the groceries onto the bus if this if the best exchange is down by division street these are only people will not be able to do that they 'll have to shop elsewhere it make its it 's not good for this location with the bus is pulling off the road will alleviate the extra road congestion that would be created at an interchange at 119 Rick and Road 119 written road this is already a bottleneck adding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pedestrians and make it more difficult for emergency vehicles to get through at peak times at peak times the council reports anticipates report anticipates one bus per minute with only three best stops bus stops this will lead to buses blocking the single main traffic lane through riccarton if buses cannot get loaded and out in a very short time now with the buses with the new cycle provision on the front of buses the best driver I presume has to load the bikes on to the front of the bus now I can 't see how you 're not going to get you 're going to get that turnover buses of buses through three bus stops without the back of the bus sticking out into Rickett and road and as I think Commissioner Williams said the buses have been getting a lot of damage with cars hitting the speck of them I think this will even be worse here this part of written road has a very high crown dropping quite steeply into the gutter with a small step up to the pavement no assessment has been done as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for disabled travelers to get on and off no traffic input input impact assessment has been undertaken or safety audit the Crown has given the council six million for a lounge and a change in riccarton to upgrade the bus court for it sorry the council ground has given the council six million for a lounge and change in riccarton and to upgrade the bus corridor to hot porn be under this proposal this many the duration of the current three year plan with no long-term solution being achieved if the oats to confirm the same year lease you 'll be committing the council to an ongoing cost at 101 661 thousand dollars rent plus Vince 's end running costs that is at least two hundred and thirty thousand dollars a year that will have to be budgeted for and the next city plan and this is only one in one of the interchanges he can requires the council to provide so that 's an ongoing cost of almost quarter of a million dollars into the plan so that this proposal has huge implications i quote i quote item 25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the broad position of council has been that interchanges should be purpose built on land owned outright by the council i believe this is the right approach and i hope this new council does not continue down the path the previous council is heading to lease this facility expedience is a very poor excuse a bit more time and careful planning could deliver a far better outcome for everyone you have six million dollars capital available this is build purpose-built facility with some left over for corridor upgrades spend this went off capital wisely for a long-term solution not an ongoing problem um what is it Elizabeth what would you like to say something and yep I would like to say that the Latin key has has covered everything that I had planned to say there are one or two things that I wish to add very simply I 'd like to make it completely plain but it 's the retail stores which give retail road work it in road the buzz that it has now and it 's wonderful to see wicked in regenerating and becoming an exciting and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as ours the new with the bus hub proposal retailers such as ourselves we have the diva shop and wicked and road will have to shift out the people who shifty banks insurance companies legal and accountancy currents etc by the netting look for the area but they 're people who will be able to afford the rents yeah that I think it would be a the bus hub would ever rekha didn 't road it will become what you call in your proposed plan a transport corridor Asian in itself think of Auckland Sydney Melbourne they treasure areas that for an excitement outside mores develop in such a way mores may be essential but they do not contribute to the visual appeal of the areas they serve we 'd like Christchurch to be interesting again the other point that i 'd like to make and if you must have an interim thing happening what about putting in a what am I call them I 've lost the words the the the big sign boards that you put up in the airports and so on that give it not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give give timetables an electronic electronic real-time explain display with the more than the food food court that would provide the information that people need it would be solution the mall itself provides seating food whatever the whole the hope the mall itself has to provide parking why can 't it provide information as well as to what 's happening for the bus patrons it 's a simple solution just put up your electronic let people know what 's happening there are toilets there that 's crude there everything 's there the people can and still use the existing bus sorry I didn 't mean the bus stop outside Westfield people who are doing their shopping would prefer to go straight in and out of Westfield get on the bus with their shop and I watched them do it that 's putting your bus hub further down means people had to travel walk with the heavy shopping two or three minutes further to get to a destination which is not truly needed I love Christ huge just please keep it alive and untwisting and please I 'd also like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop at 123 wicked in road nobody informed us of this plan I am angry at not being informed the needs to be proper planning and sensible use of resources and this certainly needs to be a truly consultative process and Jeff phasing your VZ yes my name is doof easy i 'm a real estate agent and I specialize in leasing retail space I 've been active involved and doing this for a number years we 've done a lot of least a lot of shops and the wrecked an area recently be involved in the those lovely new shops that are on the corner of rather 'n street and Rixon road we 've got some very very nice tenants going in there and we and some of these international tenants and I think they probably don 't know what 's happening but when they do find out that the bus lounge will be I think they will be reasonably grumpy about it so I 'm really here to support the hundred racine opposition on near to one hundred percent opposition from the landowners and from the retailers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 119 record and road I think there will be quite negative effects on these stakeholders and and in particular the retailer 's the bus lounge and the concentration of the bus stops and will cause congestion on the footpaths blocking entrance to the shops obscuring the shop fronts and obscuring the shop signage and causing difficulty for customers to access the shops in and around the waiting lounge because the amount of people that will use will be waiting on the pavement waiting for the bus every bounce that was in Colombo street next to the bus exchange it caused many problems for the retailers that were around it and it was significant retailer turnover and amber are vacant shops which were which I was involved in trying to lease very difficult to lease you take a retailer down there and say what 's that say oh let 's see the bus exchange we 're not interested show us somewhere else do the waiting lounge in colombo street if we can you know it was hardly ever used everybody congregated on the pavement if you are traveling north you never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ballantine 's veranda and this scenario will likely happen in Rickett on the bus layer effused will cater for passengers traveling west it is too far for the passengers going east into the city because it will be too for them I know will have real-time saying all the bus will be two minutes away or three minutes away but most people will think they don 't wait for the bus for more than three or four minutes anyway I mean bus people know when their bus is coming if they have to wait five minutes or more its course the bus is late the people are people are pretty savvy busque you know bus travelers and I think they won 't wait in the waiting lounge because then that is too far to walk the 40 meters down to the river street crossing cross wait for the wait for their those lights which take a long time to change because they 're just pedestrian lights cross over to the ASB bank turned a right and walk another 10 minutes 10 meters to get the bus I mean most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 'd be pretty risky the bus might just go sailing past while we 're waiting at the lights so lunch as it is is only really going to cater for with traveling people and so I really I asked the council not to give approval to establishing the waiting lounge at 119 reckon road I 'll make changes to the bus stops and parking areas there must be a better alternative and a long-term alternative to create this bus exchange and waiting lounge I don 't think body is opposed to having the bus exchange and having good efficient busing exchange for rekelen I think that quarter of a million dollars which will be the operating costs each year that you are going to ask the ratepayers to stump up for there 's a lot of money I think it just needs a wee bit more time for the council can 't to look at alternatives and come up with a far better option then affecting the retailers and the landowners because things may happen to their property which may not be mean it 's more valuable what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to think about and remember one hundred percent of them are against it bus lounge so thanks thank you so who would like to start the questioning Jimmy chin issue thank you Mary I would like to ask the other other looks like you fully supporting or the idea of the hops and dispose you also look fully the subpolar kind of Rick Tanner pass interchanging facility only against is the location sunny the lost of our stop yet but my questions no any location is a perfect if the you favor either the past our current pasta you know expansion to the new the past the interchange a facility a moment i am i understanding the petition closing the safety that 's one issue if we ascend the oldest pasta in the area maybe this petitioner closing the safety issue will be getting worse what 's your idea to improve of remedial this app edition cozy issue right in other words if the best ops remained it outside the westfield carpark by lengthening the length of the bus stops to get say four maybe even five they 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to right to buy mcdonalds so you 've only got the link Donald 's to walk to the meadow street corner now the lights at metro street corner i dint of people are going to cross by traffic lights not jaywalk I don 't see what the difference is it 's the difference of probably walking an extra maybe 50 feet or 100 feet or something like that I would have thought so I see that you can have a pedestrian crossing there working quite adequately yarny Johansson I just one other thing on that if it was put up to their the traffic lights at Division Street could probably be taken out and just a pedestrian crossing there and that there could be other traffic lights sorry pedestrian lights put at the remove think it 's the real moose or Carey Street there so to speed the traffic up through division street removing the traffic lights and having the road partially blocked off cars coming out of Division Street only able to turn the left you could possibly the time saving there you 'll be able to put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would provide a similar situation as the division street and it 's not in a bottle in the division street round there is very much a bottleneck thank you ok well just to two questions one is do you think is a need for a or is there an overall parking plan for Rick Adam and then the second question is there an overall development plan for where things are happening and do you think if not do you think is a need to do that before we make some of these decisions and as far as i know i don 't know of any plans it would be great to make those decisions before but obviously there is urgency to have the bus habbers and spoke system has happened running and I accept that just on that part I think is important sorry having an overall plan because things like a lot of people drop their children off to buses and pick children off from an interchange there 's no pre this parking for a parent to come and pick up a child or drop a child off at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have it but this is true does that answer your question yeah to a degree but just in terms of the wider Rickett an area you know you 're talking about some of the streets than the traffic lights on some and not in the most logical location so i just i wonder whether it is a need to actually have some holistic look at you know record and rode from meta post street down to clarence straight and actually understand what all the demands are and how really must getting together very much but I yeah I very much agree with that and that could be done after the improved improved facilities at the westfield car park stop was the Wizards car park stock could be improved and make it more covered and better for pedestrians in the meantime so Hudson spokes can operate and then and the fullness of time a full review of all that would be wonderful it 's excellent look thank you very much and thank you for accommodating the council in a way that you have is much appreciated thank you if I could is doing more here yet yep Debbie Mora,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

Christchurch City Council shares responsibility for the provision of the bus services in Christchurch and we have moved for the provision of the bus services and the infrastructure we 're responsible for getting the public transport system up and running again after the earthquake and it 's been an extremely frustrating process and I 'd like to pay tribute to you people for the way you have moved up so quickly to embrace this issue we all say responsibilities for the people of waimakariri and Selwyn who travel to Christchurch there 's an average of three thousand people a day passing through riccarton and a good percentage of those people are from from sulwon today we 're considering a step forward and providing a quality facility in the transport network and this is used by the people of wider wider Christchurch and the these people are the elderly mothers with young children schoolchildren low paid workers the shopping public of Greater Christchurch and people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road these people need a safe quality facility and I believe they will respect it I 've seen similar facilities overseas and they will will looked after by the users and I 'm sure if we provide a quality facility here the same will have it 's a very important to get it approved as soon as possible so that it will be operational before the winter so that we don 't have another winter with people standing out and they in the rain so I now hand over to Commissioner Rex Williams thank you so I 'm Rex Williams I 've got governance responsibilities Canterbury Regional Council for public transport so I 'm speaking in support of the proposal would passenger transport system as essential of Greater christchurch 's to become an even more sustainable and vibrant and modern city talk about five items and speak briefly to each of them the strategic importance of this facility the crown and Christchurch City Council recognized the importance of record on to the recovery of the transport network why change funds in the 91 million crown funding agreement a record and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which further recognizes the importance of this hub to the wider network and a record enlarge has long been identified as a need by the crash at City Council and Environment Canterbury speaking of hubs and spokes hub sins model responds to the community requests to reduce bus numbers on the city streets and provides greater economy in the transport system hubs and spokes delivers this by turning around minor roots at suburbs such as record on this makes regulon a popular place to transfer between services safe convenient and quality facilities are required to enable passengers to make those transfers the current facilities are safe and poor there is insufficient space for passengers or vehicles insufficiency and shelter and there are no safe pedestrian crossings the proposal is for a fit for pair cost-effective facility to deliver improved passenger access any off-street solution such as the mood at Westfield wall car park would take many years to develop costs many millions of dollars and significantly delayed by turning buses and changing the bus routing speaking of the design we support the concept design particularly the inclusion of other facilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facilities will be enjoyed and respected by passengers we support the facility being maintained or high standard with supervision at peak times to address unruly behavior should it occur this innovative approach provides an opportunity for the council to support local businesses and help bring vitality back to the main street of rectum we strongly support the proposed location of the passenger lounge this is centrally located in the heart of the retail area and provides passengers good access to three more entrances and provides good amenities for passengers surrounded by shops and other activities speaking of safety facility is very poor there are no safe crossing facilities nearby the proposal is close to two pedestrian crossings which will greatly enhance pedestrian safety buses are regularly damaged due to a lack think three bus stop sorry right speaking briefly of operational issues who bus stops must be installed directly outside the passenger lounge if it 's to work and he Cain the Regional Council would not support this proposal companying bus stops are not included in the planned location every to answer question right any questions Jimmy chin one question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section as 77 eburg local authority back decision before met decision they need to consider all those the pretty corner and also the reasonable kind of options but regarding to this one I 'm wondering whether the staff when they you know discuss with the weekend whether you consider alternative option because right now that looks like the solar consultation the business owners and the popular owners strongly against that is the location I 'm sorry counselor chain I can 't I can 't answer the question I don 't know I mean I know a number of locations have been considered over many months but I don 't know specifically the issues with respect to the local government but certainly and I mean the general proposal in routing of the bus routes meant that the City Council staff nek and staff who work on the programming of that looked at a number of alternatives before choosing this one pill Clearwater thank you and could you just outlaw him briefly for us the concept of the consultation engagement processes that that should have been undertaken like Aaron but i will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean it 's the city council is responsible for the infrastructure provision but the just from memory the American research company was engaged and carried out extensive consultation amongst the public amongst the best and amongst the local shop owners going back a month or two but further details of that would come from city councils don 't think thank you know it just was that it wasn 't particularly clear and air reports too I think we 're learning there any additional questions thank you very much thank you could I invite Debi Moore a community board

debate moving i will move do I have a seconder for that seconded by Andrew Turner right now we 've got the staff at the table and I think probably it would be appropriate just to ask councillors if they have particular questions that they would like to direct to staff I think some some councillors have indicated that there are questions that they want to clarify at the table Yanni Johansson um I just wanted a staff could just outline in terms of the public having any knowledge of these comprehensive developments what what notification of any day they would receive and how they would discover that these developments were happening in their areas both now and possibly in the future so yeah what mechanism more people have to be aware of the fact that these mechanisms have important place in the developments that are occurring these mechanisms that they 're introduced by the minister would we understand will be introduced through section 27 of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan there there would be no formal notification of any landowner or party whose land was subject to that to those changes in respect of the living two three if well in respect of any individual who wanted to pursue that on their own property or through the purchase of land they would rely on City plan to inform them of those rules I think this provision where the comprehensive development mechanism is used and if that is used that 's a resource consent but it 's not notified so there would be no obligation on council to consult with any third party can I decide and just to just as riches just pointed out that the proposal to create some form of mechanism to allow companies was obviously in the draft loop so the concept as a as a concept was understood the appliqué may not be I think that I 'm adjusted by way of clarification I think the question really directs one 's attention to 4.2 1 in your port which indicates that although it wouldn 't be a statutory area-wide master planning process that would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk with the local community vector refused to an eighth of community participation and that would that would cover the community housing redevelopment mechanism but the comprehensive development mechanism wouldn 't be covered by that because that 's a living 2 and a 3 which actually could end up with worse implications then a comprehensive development mechanism under thus especially where there 's a buffer between that and loving one with that big correct yes I 've been into I mean living to a living three are different in so much as they already allow more intense form of development and fair use of the comprehensive development mechanism in those zones would create a better urban design outcome then then people could currently do as of right now if they chose to there any other questions Yanni Johansson I 'm just had several more questions one is in regards to the just like that the kind of legal test that we have to be satisfied with as a council you know obviously we 've had some high court cases around pressure sewer systems for example have we don 't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we 're making around recommending this whether or not they 've cast any legal test in terms of decision making in terms of local governing and seeking the views of people that are going to be impacted by these outcomes I think we think we have to understand that this is a process that 's actually being developed through the sareng so canopy Earthquake Recovery Act and legislation so that has its own process in its own consultative process so that 's so in fact what a council is doing in this instance is actually effectively offering a position to the minister so that it is the decision of the minister he needs to satisfy the tests not under the local government name but under the c 'era that he is acting within that and that he has that he has acted appropriate within the legislation he 's operating under and I supposed to round that out this recovery plan was a result of if you recall the minister taking some actions in late two thousand eleven thirty 2012 which were appealed to the high court and the court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minister to address these meds was through a recovery plan which is what he 's done pursuant to his legislation could I just also just to ask you to clarify the different scenario that would apply if the government hadn 't come back to the council and asked for us to head some come to the plan is certainly so as as counselors made will realize that there was a number of conversations that went on as we tried to work out what the floating zone might look and feel like and staff discussed a number of iterations the government took some of our early thinking and actually applied those those concepts rather differently and the plant the black and white version but it 's scenario three would have seen large swaths of the living ones own certainly open to this form of intensification and that we believed as officials went a beyond what we believe the community had to had any expectation of what the right to expect but also basically started to address the issue at a scale the we thought was more appropriate to that City plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the through the draft loop proposal that in fact the city plan was the most appropriate way to comprehensively look at density and development and the in the broad mass of the living one 's own pool lonsdale yeah I look like I just wanted to say that um I think this council has done a great job negotiating for the betterment on the public 's perspective so the outcome we 've sort of arrived at I think in comparison to what we could have actually had has been a really great move forward so now I just want to thank you guys for your work you 've done on it as well Tim scandrett I 'm just um question with regards to and thoughts obviously we 've done some work on them modelling of the pressures on search and stormwater and also traffic modelling that will be one of the questions that I think the public will be looking it certainly I mean trick traffickers is slightly more complex than say sewer because you know where stuff goes down a pipe you know that can only go down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that that you know the traffic in the city has changed considerably and so we 're getting pressure points where we didn 't I think at the scale that we 're working at particularly with the the comprehensive development makers and that and the ones being located in some of the suburban areas we compared the scale of those changes are not significant in terms of their impact on the network and obviously we 'll be able to fine-tune the network if and when development starts to occur in those areas Oh clean Livingston thank you or just kicked that I 'm reading a table to lately and estimated sources of supply 2016 business number of poems sweet Jesus 16,000 the contingency and our table is eight house in total point of reed is at first reading is that what it is so it 's actually at fifty percent if I got that yes and of course that those even those broads figures in tate in the table and 4.2 our estimates and their their rounded estimate I think that 's consistent with the intention of the government and certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there is an abundant supply of opportunity bearing in mind that we know that not everybody is going to take the opportunity up that they have be there green fields or comprehensive thank you there any other questions for officials Jimmy chin one question is regarding to the fair profit sweep on the 11 now the remove for occupancy nutrition for elderly persons sub-item the to change the city plan to either a in the B I 'm not sure what a difference a in the B it certainly the reference looks to recognize how we might deal with people going forward who are not covered by the temporary workers accommodation definition but who may wish to occupy what a traditional elderly person 's housing units so the the two models that we have put up one is to introduce a rule that will require the other occupants of that particular block of units to give their consent or the agreement for somebody is non-qualifying to occupy it that 's option a option B is to rely on what effectively is the current mechanism which is relying on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unit titled the required every body corporate and the body corporate can specify with that people need to have a qualifying age or not so they are really two different ways one as one is using the city plan as a an upfront mechanism one is relying on the unit titles act and the body corporate process is under civil law to exercise that control and the recommendation I think you 'll see at the deck is to use the city plan as them as the mechanism any other questions for officials have vocally order terrify one thing just on 311 with the conversion with the chat with the table their conversion of large homes of two units the term provides recommendation no change in effect means continuing the present council of sort of the previous councils position that 's correct it was supported by the previous council and the recommendation as we will continue to support that option Oh Pauline Cotter just talking about the roof the intensification will now be focused more around primarily around housing New Zealand areas with perhaps a buffer zone out there and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urban design now what where does the council fit and ensuring that with housing New Zealand developments play are they prepared to work with council ensuring those designs the verified it yeah under both mechanisms are the comprehensive development mechanisms be they for individuals or community housing they would stall the fire resource consent they would still require an urban design assessment so council would be involved in that process and and we have been working obviously with housing New Zealanders probably as the major social housing agent in the city around their plans and have had extensive discussions with them regarding that I think the other aspect relates to the fact that as the mirror Leah pointed out there 's a second action and the loop around requiring a sort of more comprehensive look at the development of wider areas so we 're not limiting those two site-by-site redevelopments there is also a process in place a dialogue I suppose with with the key partners to look at those those other matters as well we 've got any other questions hmmm thank you for that right so who would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you um it 's well acknowledged that there 's a need for additional housing in the city we 're aware of the upcoming pinch as its described and we 're already seeing the effects of increased pricing both for purchasing houses and for renting houses and we 're seeing a number of effects of lack of supply already and that course is predicted to get worse it 's also acknowledged through the work already done in the UDS the unchecked urban sprawl isn 't the way forward so infill of brownfield sites and its intensification in existing residential areas is clearly one area that we 're we 're needing to look at to achieve what needs to be achieved I certainly would have preferred to see a lot more community consultation in the sort of paper that 's been put forward before us today however this isn 't business as usual and clearly there is a need to get this work underway so that we alleviate the effects of the housing shortage as quickly as we possibly can and we also need to bear in mind that this piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initiated by the council of course it 's a piece of work which is done by which has been done by a can on the direction of the minister and certainly when you look at the evolution of the maps that are in the attachment to today 's agenda that certainly stands testimony to the work which has been done between council and the minister as in arriving at a compromise our best we could I guess we could call it that is in the circumstances and the best balance of private property rights and the need for intensification that we 've been able to come through and come to working through that process I particularly wanted to draw attention to an area which concerned me in the agenda for last week 's and meeting relating to elderly persons housing and I was particularly uncomfortable looking at me the way the resolution was put last week with the fact that we were just going to allow the body corporate arrangements of over 60 s developments to deal with the issue of allowing younger people to move into those developments and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other matters recently that a lot of those body corporate arrangements are quite inadequate or are not that strong and I was certainly uncomfortable with leaving regulation around this to those body corporate arrangements so I 'm particularly pleased to be able to support the recommendation today including option a where there 's a need for those already living in those over 60 s developments to agree to between themselves agree to younger people moving into there so we 're we 're not allowing anything to happen that each person living in those units are owning those units wouldn 't in fact be uncomfortable with so whilst I was uncomfortable with that particular part of the resolution last week with option A now inserted and I certainly would urge councillors to support the recommendation including option a I 'm certainly very comfortable that we 've got good controls through the city plan in there to ensure that those over 60 s developments can remain exactly as that if it 's what residents are wanting or there is the option for those people to to be able to make the changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the residents of those developments desire Thank You Dean Livingston thank you I wish and I wanted to speak early in this debate by way of providing a scene setter from the information given to us two days ago the housing workshop so just as in terms of housing at the moment in the city we 've lost two and a half thousand rentals since the quakes from all the social housing providers all up we 've lost a thousand social housing units 350 bed suits and the inner city may be mainly in the inner city east house sale prices are running it an increase of at work of twelve percent per annum rentals ten to fifteen percent per annum the current average rental in the city now is four hundred and fourteen dollars per week that 's a forty-two percent increase on pre-earthquake levels here 's another telling effect prior to the quakes there are about 900 rentals available in the city per month that 's now cut back by two-thirds 300 a month so we or at least I support the loop as a framework for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current situation in the city in fact when some of us ran some housing summits I think it was last year one of the provisions actually came through and that 's what is colloquially known as the to kitchen rule where you can divide a house to an effect create an extra an extra dwelling so in summary i support the provisions which can assist in increasing the supply of housing because it 's a supply-side problem but I also support good urban outcomes I 'm looking forward to this debate to to seeing how we can manage both and enabling the the provision of more housing but also retaining good urban outcomes in our living zones and you know I 'm really looking forward to a good debate and a good outcome on the school of us anyone else would like to Yanni Johansson I just a question of clarification of staff because in regards to the elderly persons housing resolution that we 're about to pass and the appendix that we 've got changes to the district plan I can see no reference to what we 've asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the what what we 've set out is quite clearly will be relying on that delegation to do that over the next day or so i I 'm sorry I don 't see the deli oh ok the delegation has given to the media right right the engineer water yeah ok thank you I 'm god like to speak so thank you um thank you I would like to speak to this report I think the Christian was made it 's unfortunate we didn 't have color and the documents but I think the community should really be aware of what the government wanted to do which was this yellow met this is what government have said they would do if we didn 't come to a recommendation to support some more intensification and loving zones and you can see the yellows pretty extensive they would have been done without any community consultation any the public would have had very little notice that there was about to occur and you could have seen a huge change to our study so i think you know it 's really needs to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council previous term did go back to government and say here 's where we got to here 's the ideas that we had and we were right that in the previous resolution but the council wasn 't the one holding up the land use recovery plan what happened was the minister and the government weren 't happy with what council had decided and wanted us to revisit it in very short order with the threat hanging over our head that this was what this is what would be done if we couldn 't come up with some agreement with him so I I commend us for not agreeing to this last week I thought it was unfair that we got heavily criticized as somehow been delaying when in fact we 'd actually council already made its position clear it 's just that government didn 't accept it and what did the new council to take a different approach I also think it is good that government have been upfront and open with us about what their intention was and as you can see the yellow met as pretty extensive so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being proposed today I do accept that there 's a need for supply for housing in our city I am still not convinced you know given that we 've got 30,000 spare capacity under current zoning arrangements I 'm still not convinced that just opening up zoning is actually the way in which this housing is going to be delivered to affect the supply there are two years that we 're making changes to our district plan removing regulations making it easier I guess for development to happen in some zones where might have been harder previously but we still have a zoning capacity of 30,000 properties that could be developed and could be providing housing at the moment that is not happening and so we need to understand as we go through the city plan review why that isn 't working because clearly just opening up more land isn 't the answer I do think that there 's some pragmatic things in here around that the one in 22 in terms of the sections and also around the elderly persons housing i do want to state that i think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recorded somewhere captured so that when future property owners or purchases are looking at buying these properties they are really clearly advised as to whether or not it 's an ugly person 's housing unit or whether or not it 's become a workers camp or a workers village I think people will need to know what they 're getting in for and we need to make sure that their information is put in place so I will reluctantly support the idea that the concepts that we have come up with in terms of discussing with government I do also want to commend the staff and the government and hopefully us for agreeing that there 's a mechanism around the community housing redevelopment that enables a non-statutory master planning area wide planning approach to occur because what we don 't want is government agencies or community housing agencies building the slums of tomorrow what we actually want better urban form we want buildings that actually connect to local communities and we want local people to be involved in the redevelopment of these areas and so we have I think got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanism that enables us to be open and transparent and the local neighborhoods about we are some of this intensification is happening and I think that 's a really positive thing because for anyone that 's seen their housing New Zealand developments in Richmond it 's probably the most frightening example of intensification that you would ever wish to put on a local community and that community has rightfully reacted to it so hopefully this enables us to get a better quality of design a better quality of intensification than we currently have and enables us to reduce some of the chronic housing issues facing our city I still think is a need for further government intervention on a whole lot of other policy mechanisms around housing other than just opening up land supply unfortunately that that hasn 't been carried through into the loop and because it 's a government document we really are at the behest of what government wish so I will support this today I think it 's important that we have opportunities to review it I am concerned about the five-year timeframe and I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've got really good regular monitoring of what 's happening so that if things start to go pear-shaped we can actually look at some interventions earlier than five years Jimmy chin yes I support early support framework and supported the staff recommendation because like a counselor the cleanest on he mention you know we have to review the no current situation that demand for housing is huge then in the supply how to dealing with this issue the rent rental fee increase of 15 percentage positive increased 12 percentage so the people can afford to pay so we are not to take a positive way to dealing with this one how how to wait to make love people 's needs so time and a tree with the council industry council effort we have a same view and have a sender paid you know who like to dealing with this issue and working together not only the cut central government or sealer local gamma but also because the he came Sarah and a half in some other agencies work together skimp to resolve this problem so that 's I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adult and also you will reveal in the last about a couple weeks we have any know kind of issue or concern regarding to these the language will complicate we request Sarah replace the staff you know to provider out more information to clarify so h-o-t right now these to make is probably different from the country yani Johanson anime police maples probably is new amend Amanda maple know this we or understand is the kind of a comprehensive devuelveme Canada mikania least you know some social housing caster his new revised back so this one my understanding problem am a church council we agreed Easter Newton member but but absolutely you know this not have a proper consultation while range the community you know a cameo in Somali people etc parcel a district plan review soon as the city planner review still have the time to ask the people to help layer say no to kind of visual amenity or landscape in sc2 still committed the requirement so we 're now my personal

the resolution yep and do I have a seconder Thomas Kendra any discussion I 'll put the motion Oh David East by supporting principle a desire to have a review of cch old structure and governance and also the council controlled companies and trading organizations I am concerned that the process we are adopting today does override the accepted commercial practice and processes set out in section 80 of the local governments Act 2.1 12.14 2.13 we 're appointing persons to see CHL based on their position that held in the council was decent of interest I feel that a key factor in the appointments of a board in this case one controlling several hundred million dollars worth of assets as soon as the selection of board members based on their merit experience consideration of conflicts of interest to name but a few of the prudent and criteria remuneration is also a contentious issue but considerest consideration also needs to be given to the extensive qualification some have acquired extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notion motion as an interim measure I will be ensuring that the review addresses matters of appointments a mirror and remuneration in an approach that has recognized the significant commercial practices processes involved there anyone else who wants to pull lonsdale I just issue support David on that last comment yah Johansson actually um I support doing this this way what used to happen was that it used to be a bit of a Sharad that you know these are political appointments and it used to be kind of like we go through a process but then council still makes the decision so he 's been a whole bunch of money on consultants that I think was just kind of wasted money because it was always going to be a council decision so I 'd rather be a lot more upfront and do this and I know that this is just an interim basis for appointments and i think that 's that 's welcome so I do understand that we will be doing a review around these these issues and how we do appointments and this you know that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're actually saving a lot of money by doing it this way as an interim thing rather than going through a very expensive process with certain consultants that make a lot of money from council by just making effectively what our political decisions that we end up costing us a lot more than they should so I welcome doing this this way and we look forward to that review around directors fees and remuneration the previous council did do a review of that and they did decide that directors would be remunerated I I don 't think it 's right and I think it 's really you know we can look at that but I think it is important to acknowledge that in the interim minder steering is that we will not be receiving directors fees for these for these appointments and I think that 's a really good sign that we 've seen signal that we seem to our community that the directors fees that we 're receiving go to a charity or to another fun secret for doing good inner city rather than Isis counts as being paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommendations I think that our council was making a change in their culture and part of that is transparency and also that in fact as councillors we work together so that people who are directors for example in christchurch city holdings and I think in pain those fees as an interim measure into the mayor 's Welfare Fund is excellent in terms of for example the counselors who r T and Brock for meetings and that in fact we will be on a level plane fueled in terms of their salaries and I think as I also think that is elected councillors our remuneration is certainly adequate and I think that this is part of the public perception that all wasteful spending in needs that needs a change it was counsel and sorry who is next to me chin okay i supported isa staff recommendation if we recall the last time in a purist and we consider the council point not only CC h ere directors actually cover lot of council own trading company or organization or a community etc a support member of directors but last time of before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ americans own trading company they have elimination so some of the council to focus in the area i bypassed and our community as appalled essential but i think we a council we already together receive our photon chapter remuneration income so that we based on our skills our knowledge and our experience focus on which the area of which the company risk of the community we can fulfill out with conspiracy to contributor in the community or the trading company is settled so i know we shift these the relation to the mail welfare fund that 's very very good you know one is not inconsistent compared with the policy paralysis fiat need some minor amendments it 's all but even c equal then we could focus on just you know contributor ourselves not only just considered emulation so I fully supported this yeah i just bucket but i think what happening here is actually really important i disagree completely with the concept that the appointees to see CHL made as per previous council by a recently retired counselor and outsider and the chairman of the board it is absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have to be completely clear about what we want to achieve from major resource holding that we have in CC HL what are the strategic reasons that we only assets what do we want to achieve how do we deal with the finances that are there i am not happy at all with a kind of hands off laissez-faire for major council assets I regard them as especially at the moment critically important to the future of this council it 's going to have major financial issues major insurance issues and we need to be absolutely sure that what 's ECHL is doing is completely in line with what the community of christ church wants it is not an arm 's length corporate arrangement that is comfortable it is going to be very much hands-on for this city council to control as a hundred percent shareholder NC CHL what it does and why and be very clear and transparent and accountable for all of those things so I think process that we 're going through of appointing now and then reviewing the entire structure is absolutely right I agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealthy fund that seems entirely appropriate for this council to give money from director stories that were previously going to director counselor directors and to those people in the community who need the money most so I 'm completely in favor of these recommendations Pauline oh sorry Ellie James yeah I just want to comment on the other comments that have been made over the payment of directors fees counselor appointed people their directory is going to the Emmys welfare fun I would not support the payment of councilor director fees to that fund it is additional responsibility and work that should be remunerated accordingly and I think that if councillors choose to donate that money will direct that money somewhere else the next should be the choice you cannot have rules for other directors sitting on boards and different rules for councillors and I support a review of directors fees that 's clear that I am uncomfortable with the suggestion that councillors directors fees should be automatically paid into the working class term Scandrick and I reiterate what Vicki back I said I think we 've got be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been doin opt and he 'd hunted to sit on these boards prior to being elected there 's are things quite important we don 't have to sell nice we as individuals we can choose whether we sit on these boards or not and if it 's something that our councils are very some councils are very strong on then they make it choice I do think that the review and six months is going to be very important and I think that we should focus now on what we 've what we 're deciding here and then really look at how their next six months goes and we can have a very in-depth conversation about how they 're does in six months thank you Andrew Turner unsupportive of the recommendations in the agenda today on the subject of directors fees I i absolutely believe and I 'm sure that certainly from my contact with with members the public during the election campaign that the remuneration that we get as councillors is there to cover the work that we do as councillors regardless of whether that 's as somebody referred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meetings briefings or roles as directors of council and companies so my belief is that the recommendation as it stands today is absolutely correct and therefore on supporting it and that councillors shouldn 't be receiving additional fees sitting as directors of these companies and I 'm aware that that was one of the issues in the the last council term that caused some political divisions and to remove that from this council certainly would be be seen as positive and I 'm also aware that particularly with regard to see CHL and I come to the points that council a buck made these the holdings of C CHL we are very aware of the the benefit from the dividends from these companies in keeping our rates down but i also want to draw members attention to the social angle of these companies have their strategic assets there 's a strong social angle to the work that they do as well and i believe that one of the roles of the council director sitting on the board of CC HL is to be custodians of that social interest as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and clean livingston thank you or support this and support the fees going to the me as well be fun my view on this is that what that fund these are some flexibility exists for those have fallen through some of the gaps there are gaps in our city whether it 's with the winds grants or accommodation announces where you may not qualify there some people and very dire straits and I think to put to put that into that fund would be a really would show our priority for the city and is you know really good expression to us as a new council we are remunerated more than suffice and I think this is quite a reasonable thing to do it also sends out the signal that this is about our community about us and for me it also sets a precedent there are some other directorships floating out there that I can think of one with Canterbury waist committee the landfill committee fitbit 's what well-paid is as well so I i think the sets a good precedent for for these others to also be channeled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not about us it makes about them and it 's why we 've been elected ref mangie I guess I 've ever speak to us now that everyone else is done um clearly i 'm in favor of this because it 's something that i 've proposed and have been working on for a while the two issues here in terms of C CHL clearly I flagged a few weeks ago that there would be a comprehensive review not just as ECHL but of the CCOs and CC TOS in their entirety to make sure that they are fit for purpose in terms of the appointment of the current directors we actually have spent a lot of time in depth discussion about the right to the right people to put on that board for the moment as well as some of the other boards that we 're considering as well we are appointing a lot of councillors to a lot of different boards around the city and everybody is doing different bits of work and i think phil mentioned the point that you might be at a board meeting you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hours and there should be no differential in terms of the fees i think as an organization we 're already receiving a pretty decent salary ninety thousand dollars a year now it is quite normal for companies to appoint employees to sit on boards as part of their job all the boards that we are appointed to sit on our part of our job and therefore should be considered part of our salary dchl currently remunerated its directors at a rate of thirty thousand dollars a year a reporter had recently suggested that director would put in about 170 hours of work a year now that works out at 217 dollars an hour which is a lot of money so I think it 's been a pretty cushy job for some people for many years and I see absolutely no reason why counselors should be getting extra money we 're doing a job that they may have a skill set for other councils maybe doing jobs that they have skill sets for that 's the whole point and that 's why we allocate different jobs to different people so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ echo Vicky 's comments about how we look at CC HL how we manage those assets and the one and a half billion dollars of equity on behalf of the city to make sure that it is used in the most appropriate efficient and productive way possible and that 's why I 'm supporting this motion okay I 'm going to make a statement in relation to this matter as well because this was something that I campaigned on as a mayoral candidate I felt that it was really important that we send a powerful message to the city that things had changed and one of the things that I wanted to see change around was that the directors fees that people received an addition to their counsel and merrill salaries were directed to the people that needed our assistance the most rather than being paid to us directly and the reason for that is is that you know when we 're being appointed because of our positions honor council to a trading organization or to c CH 0 in this case and i 'm not one of the four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go on knowing that this is a resolution that will pass today but i really wanted us to bring this here so that there 's a new council we could say this is the line in the sand in terms of past practice that will be no more I totally support the review the reviewers much more than just two rictus salaries and conflicts of interest and various other matters that obviously have to come into account but it is obviously as deputy mayor has said and ref mangie who will be leading the review has said it is actually about I don 't know gaining the most that we can from the position that we have maintained as a council unlike other councils who have seen assets dissipated without the benefit that can be obtained for for the residents of Christchurch so I just really wanted to place on record my thanks for having us on the agenda so early in our new tomb and enabling me to say that I have delivered on one of my promises so on that face is that can you speak again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a giantess take that last part of the resolution out as a separate resolute of a separate to it you can move in amendment so if you want to complete them secretly okay okay so two three okay so we 're going to put okay won 't go back at the top you scroll up right I 'm going to put the scroll up just a little bit yeah that 's right right I 'm going to put the staff recommend well the recommendation that 's now moved by mangi Council mangi counselor scandrett I 'm going to that the resolve points 1 and point 2 so I put points 1 and point 2 all those in favor say aye those opposed say no carried item number three where have we got to okay so 3.1 3.2 scroll up a bit sorry I 've got should have in front of me 3.3 okay so we 'll put item 3.1 3.2 3.3 together all those in favor say aye those opposed say no carried and now i will put item 3.4 all those in favor say aye those opposed say no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intend to vote for the motion click on yes if you want to vote no against the motion vote no and if you want to abstain then that 's pretty obvious all right like this oh sorry I haven 't seen this before it 's actually quite exciting thank you for causing a vote so I declare the motion what so but I did hear the motion carried so thank you and I think it 's now time for morning tea

community board the local community ball welcome yeah adults to mou between counsel and the Crushers code pathway group and refer the mou to the local community board for and put i think so that it basically enables the community board to consider it as well and i think it would be really important to see whether they you know they might like to just sign up as a signatory crime and okay so i 'm dr. yeah you know no that 's okay adopt the Memorandum of Understanding between council I 'm a Christchurch coastal pathway group and refer at for refer it to the to the local community board for adoption something along those lines with that you are you happy with that as the mover Paul yeah I think you could the council at its role could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a wishes so essentially it is I mean the council can delegate those responsibilities out so I think it would just make a point to that rather than I think that council generally wanted to formally adopt the the mou here to give an absolute reassurance to the community that we are completely behind them but i think that the comments that would have been made and the questions asked and answered would indicate that having the additional support of the community board would actually strengthen that so I 'm quite comfortable that doesn 't undermine it should just say refer to the higley ferry to community board for consideration of adoption we 've had some suggested wording i think the suggested wording and refer it to the heck leafy ramee community board as a party as a party as a party to the to the memorandum of understanding because then that makes it absolutely clear that the community board is a party to the memorandum of understanding take out the red adoption so both the mover and seconder happy with that resolution then we won 't need accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the resolution so who would like to speak to thee yep Jana Johansson thank you um Thank You counselors for the opportunity to speak to this resolution actually this MOU I think there 's a real really fantastic opportunity a new way those this project has been incredibly frustrating at times because one of the things the decisions that was made post-earthquake was that all that infrastructure repair would go back to what we had on September fourth rather than look at the new and exciting opportunities to do things differently and transform local communities people in this area of the city saw a wonderful opportunity and have come together numerous on numerous occasions to try and get council to embrace the exciting opportunity that throughout through the destruction that was caused by a natural environment that the opportunity to actually bring joy and and growth to our local communities through that same natural environment existed through this coastal hathway concept so the coastal pathway concept has been a challenging project at times it has struggled previously to get ahead of the game and that is ahead of the route @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repair today I think is a really clear signal that we are committing to working with the coastal pathway group as a council as an organization through the three of the things that we can control such as skirt around doing things in a different way and I think it 's legacy to future generations if we can get these mechanisms in place it 's not about us as a council doing everything there is a huge amount of money that the time and resource of the community are bringing to the table and although council has put up a sizable chunk of cash it is important to recognize that many many hours of community and volunteer time have gone into making this project a reality and we I believe as a council should be incredibly grateful to those people that have done such a wonderful job so I do want to formally acknowledged thank you to the coastal pathway group and all the people in the community they 've served on that and have dedicated their time to it so please support this today it is a new way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide community support and we should be incredibly proud as a council to recognize that we don 't need to do everything but that we can actually work collaboratively with groups to enable things to happen that will transfer transform our city and our community thank you and Paul lonsdale yeah lots of fully endorse exactly everything Yanni is said but also I think we need to look at crisis in the future we have some massive opportunities from local tourism national tourism enter and international tourism to strengthen that and of course strengthening our pathways to add natural assets i think is a key factor and actually strengthening all those elements now and our tourism sector we were producing 2.4 billion dollars per youthquake and tourism we know that tourism and the future is going to be another major growth factor for us this is going to strengthen that and could potentially tip that 1.9 day stay from the international visitors to that 2.5 days which would put place at least another billion dollars on to error our current income so I want to thank the coastal pathway group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style the way our council is going to work collaborative with groups such as these to produce a great outcome for the city so I want to see that we get right behind the csn another signal out as we 've done on

CCC,P9DwJNpUIfY,20131120,2490.42,"Christchurch, New Zealand",6364,"from a numbers point of view under the current city plan zoning could we allow 30,000 extra houses tomorrow if the market wanted to deliver that we could potentially allow up to that sort of none that that 's correct 30,000 so the changes we 're making aren 't going to increase any capacity to the housing they 're not going to well they will because they will allow on the land about a higher density then the current rules would allow so they would potentially allow a greater number but what they actually do is they deliver a different form of development that 's probably the key more than the absolute number because as I said there was always excess capacity in the market but the market chooses not to take that up just a clarification on this and you know one or figure that could be produced by the land that is currently available would require everyone that had a large section to chop off the back and put a house on us on you know and probably develop elderly person 's housing units so that they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that don 't produce anything and some of the comparable of the enhanced Development Mechanism won 't produce that gives an opportunity could you just talk about the buffer because I don 't think we 've heard about that and I think it might address some of the concerns that the public have about this form of development and then I 'll come to Ali and then Jimmy so in terms of your pracy there yes madam ji you outline quite well what that what the opportunity is I suppose one of the things that we 've introduced and worked with the government officials on with the enhanced development mechanism is to manage the transition between existing living one and any land that might utilize this mechanism so one of the one of the issues that we have if you under if you think about the living one and if you juxtapose the living three right next door you go from a very low density potentially to a very high density right on your boundary subject only basically to the recession plains and any side yards what the comprehensive development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property comprehensive in a way that says that for the first and I think and I don 't exactly have the exact scale for the first between 10 and 20 meters of that larger block that the development forum cannot be more any more intense than the living one 's own so in fact what it does is it actually creates a much better buffer between the living one and the comprehensive development area and what it does do is it says well while you can intensify that development their intensity has to move to the center of effectively of that block and that the outside edge of that block will be very akin to the living one land that adjoins it ally Jones I just go back to the point that Halliburton raised with regards to the wording and the link to the map that me does ill mentioned whereas the map does quite clearly show that there is no change in that green area and riccarton it does appear in the wording of scenario to that that it could change that and I 'm just wondering does one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Helen was making that the the map does reflect little change however the wooden suggests that they could be well I think the the wording because this is a this is a dynamic tall and that it doesn 't fix a zoning so it allows for this tool to be applied where it meets the preconditions of the rules now what the the maps show are the areas that currently meet those conditions so for example in getting to the areas that are shown in the map the the the staff have layered a whole series of criteria those criteria are proximity to supermarkets proximity to schools proximity to major transport routes and they 've also had some exclusions so exclusions from areas where there are infrastructural conclusions where there are natural hazard risks exclusions where there are proximity to heavy industrial zones so what you have is a multi-layered serving of those criteria to produce what you see on the blue met while it 's theoretically possible for those areas to shift and change probably given that we 're talking about a five year scenario before this has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there it 's what again while it 's theoretically possible for new areas to come into that it is unlikely that there would be any substantial change in the areas being identified simply because of the criteria mix that they would need to meet to achieve that outcome one last thing that the changes in infrastructure and addressing those limitations as to where you can do this could and I know you see theoretically but they could change in those five years so the wording would be the ultimate measure if you like of whether that could happen so I just want to confirm there are no guarantees that that green area we 're seeing in the written map that this is limited to that that that 's correct yes yes yes Jimmy Chaney to patients first one the government has been reviewing the resource management at nineteen ninety one especially section 6 in the 7th a moment and my understanding consultation has been underway some issue will be closed at beginning of februari if they true they consider concerned original plain statement Regional Plan and the teacher play which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management plan instead if at all by the Talmon soon whether have any impacted regarding good today 's our decision no that wouldn 't have any impact on that what they what the intended changes to the legislation are twofold one is to deal with councils which may operate more than one plan so for example we 're a council like that where we have the city plane and the banks peninsula plan it seeks to draw those together it makes provisions for plans to be combined so potentially in the future to combine with with why me then but I think that the key point two pads recognize is that the regional plan already now has provisions in it that continue to that thing that are there 's both reflected in the current regional policy statement and it further introduced by or further amended by changes to the loop to reinforce that so there is a need for our plan to be in alignment with the regional policy statement and we are confident that these changes are consistent with that direction my concern because the regarding to our monomer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear 2.1 and 2.2 for and also the head important she emphasized last council adult the scenario wife rather than scenario two they already make a decision august of this year so is there any legal otherwise opinion regarding to these council overturned the purest council decision the council certainly entitled to reconsider its position in two to adopt a different position and and i 'm just waiting for mr. Thompson to give me advice about what we we may need to add to the resolutions just to make that happen correctly so no council can certainly do that yeah sorry press the wrong button Phil Clearwater things do you report Mike can I just the with the recommendations we 've got the line that that the recommendations be subject to appropriate developments being read by council and I just wonder what you consider in relation my suggestion to Helen brought them there is a way preps of ensuring that developments are a good standard inappropriate how we would define them that there be some community involvement in actually making that decision you where I 'm coming from is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite clear that community should be enabled and empowered to lead their own recovery right and I 'm just wanting to look at how we could allay reasons concerns by having some local democracy involved in the sign off of there so good for example community leaders like community boards feasibly be involved in this process I think that I mean like all things that 's a theoretical possibility I mean I think I would advise strongly against that I think you should rely on amendments to the city plan to to ensure that why do I say that largely because it ensures that therefore there is a measure of predictability about what people may be dealing with and it allows I suppose that about a market and individual landowners to get on with their developments the city plan establishes the criteria and that does include some assessment criteria around urban design and people need to be able to rely on those statutory documents if you really wish to get to community input you 're effectively really asking for all those things to become resource consents and in some respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largely to make this sort of development are easier to to happen so people can make resource consent applications for this form of development now they can test that they may or may not get third party rights through that process so if you wish to have that level of involvement by the community in the outcome then you should do that by not adopting any changes to this mechanism Glenn Livingston thank you my just got a couple questions might be the first on page eight in regard to the number of homes on the total demand to 12 to 16 7,500 and we had heard previously in an MB report they put that at eight our thousands it 's pretty close if we 've got to break down of or a further breakdown of what that housing consists of so the proportion of social housing for instance temporary accommodation worker and combination if we know is there one body that gathers that or is that is that MV that does it no no one either in that respect would have a total picture simply because a large part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its properties so while we would be able to identify what may be in councils ownership or in housing new zealand 's ownership how the private market chooses to use that land is not something we would have any information on okay all right my second questions in relation to page 9 where it says in 4.6 therefore one of the principal concerns is that housing New Zealand 's recovery program is program has facilitated is there anything we need to know about our own luxury housing in relation to this I mean I nothing leaping out but are there any implications in this for our own self well to to the extent that councils land may be captured by this then council itself could take make use of that mechanism so opportunity for council to also do that but in most cases this is really targeted at the the amalgamation potentially of land which is in single title ownership or with single housing on and largely most of councils facilities are already multi property developments so probably not be one way or the other for council yeah not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think the housing New Zealand scenario is largely that they have they have a significant stock but that stock is a very low density which probably reflects the time frame in which those properties were bought new zealand does have a clear objective and certainly across the country to redevelop it stock more efficient use of its stock and obviously also part of this is actually aligning that the nature of the stock more to the current market so what we 've seen and this was part of the UDS concept obviously our market is changing well our family sizes are generally eating smaller we 're aging as a population so shifting not only the density but also the form of development is something that housing New Zealand 's interested in and something that been interested in for some time in a planning sense as well Tim scandrett thank you Mike I 'm three quick questions first you mentioned before buffer zones and Eddington we 've had issues in the past with regards to people perhaps restoring old villas and then having three-story flip blocks of flats built next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protection into that for the future or not yes weird this this particular mechanism is designed with a buffer and to stop radical justs the position of form yep technically this will allow a bit of planning mechanism than we 've had in the past or could do well I think actually it will and it 's probably something you know looking forward to the city plan review that we would probably what want to pursue further as well but I suppose the quid pro quo to that you can only actually achieve that if you actually get some practical amalgamation of land because of someone 's intensifying on a single property then the opportunity to buffer that is very limited so I suppose one of the quid pro quos of this model is by amalgamating to larger bodies of land to begin with you give you give better opportunity to manage that periphery in a way that 's less intrusive on the adjoining properties or you could I 'm not allowed to be on that property but I mean this for another one well that 's a different that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenario map on page 26 at the bottom right-hand side we we 've got some Martin 's we 've got parts of bikaner Martin 's a no power on the green but with the photos of assault on Helen Broughton is your prediction or a provision to protect those areas with a particular character or as it 's within the existing city plan sorry no no Danny I might need advice is that where there are established same areas so Sam 's which as define city plan these exclude the council 's current same areas so social media sees that on page seven their seams are excluded most of the Erie 's would be as standard that you can cross lease etcetera is pure mr. city plan outside yes that this was by just standard l1 land a third question with regards to Eddington we we have the development adjacent to her Morton etc the an Ellington and the surrounding areas we have huge parking and traffic issues have we got sufficient traffic modelling to keep ahead of this I think a whole traffic environments obviously very dynamic at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we understand or predict the net impact of this and given that one of the scenarios of this reflects is that you know while we 've while this allows for lower development the predicted take up of this is obviously going to be less than the again the notional capacity same argument we have about the current living one zones so i think i think our assessment is that the traffic implications of this are not significant or are not going to be material in terms of what they might add to what is already potentially you know pinch points in the network thanks Mike you back thank you just and on the table on page 7 these sections and living one have to be between fifteen hundred and ten thousand square meters so an existing single section in most of these areas is unlikely to be that size and therefore it would require some amalgamation so in an area and such as riccarton or the part of single town the cost of acquiring that land would be actually very high at the moment and just in relation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a resource consent interdesign panel I might ask John or Scott to come and just give me some advice on the details I just introduced John mica John 's an urban designer and planner with the council all applications all applications will require resource consent that it will be subject to design assessment matters so every consent will be reviewed in that sense so in relation to any development that went in any of those areas people would have the normal rates under a resource consent all of these some applications will be non notified that 's that 's the way that the government have suggested this package of rules works so effectively they are restricted discretionary activities the council will review the applications but they are non notified so there would be that there would be no third party which goes a little back to Council clear waters question so just to get the difference the difference thing is not in the visual map the difference is that if you want to develop on one of those green areas and you have acquired land that is between fifteen hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the council design approval process but with no notification to your even immediate neighbors ouch yep and that is consistent with the changes that have been introduced to the resource management data and continue to be around reducing the amount of their tardy and put into decisions yeah so just in terms of the difference of the one that the council previously adopted and having a done it in secret it makes it quite tricky for people to have known about it and the difference in the one on page 64 the second one would be there the notification in those living one zones of that development yes I mean the first scenario wallet wallet added some living one areas they were very very small live in one of years and they were living one areas that were directly adjacent to either living tour living three so they were adjacent to or very close to areas that were already subject to high-density development opportunities so that roof under me producing it into that living one 's own thanks sorry to have on this that so the effect of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currently being recommended here is that notification of neighbors no no it 's the extent of the area affected so that an end to be to be fear that the process of what is both the area that there 's a subject to and that the actual development mechanism has continued to be I suppose review and commented on and we 're gone between stars between staff from Sarah and the council but the fundamental different so the development contribute the comprehensive development mechanism of the enhance about mechanism always required these to become a resource consent always required these to have design assessment of them but the ear it 's fundamentally that the change has been the change of the areas impacted or the potentially available for this can I ask for a clarification on that because around the living three zones which are the blue but on the mech does that mean I mean by putting the enhanced Development Mechanism over those does that then improve the situation in terms of the buffer between you know what can happen now which is like 52 units go on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got occurring and the Richmond area and and the you know so our current rules allow for that sort of development without any buffer it uses this goes into and to the loving one but with the buffer also applying now in the living three areas is that correct if their particular rule was used so someone so someone 's not compelled to use the enhanced about mechanism the living three they could they could also use the standard living three provisions as well so and again developers all in those instances because those those are two paid a higher density development they will they will make choices about which presumably is the most advantageous rule for them to use Andrew tuna thank you Mike with relation to Klaus Klaus to point for the elderly persons housing units and commonly known as over sixties units there 's obviously a potential concern here that people have moved into these types of development because they are inhabited by over 60s and that gives those people a level of control our guess of who their neighbors are going to be now the level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the existing body corporate arrangements I 'm very aware that the body corporate arrangements for each development may well be very different what level of study has been done on those body corporate arrangements to ensure that that control in fact will work and be effective well I think what we can reflect on is how we 've head to enforce those in the past and John may wish to comment on some of their experience with that but we have had over the years some need to we have had some complaint with people who have been potentially younger or of a different yeah it 's an age related category have moved in and created some problems and the council has been has taken enforcement action where that 's been the case so I don 't know John whether you wish to if you could quickly come and comment on how that 's going to fourth so who is the department manager for resource consents so so there have been some instances in the past where there have been people below the age of 60 move into these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been addressed it 's not common but there are some examples particularly in locations like around the university where it 's quite attractive to put students and those types of units but they tend to be quite self-monitoring because obviously it 's quite we 're quite quickly contacted by the other residents and those units the body corporate arrangements themselves are they likely to be thinking of what 's contained within those sort of rules and requirements within those developments if say three of the people living in a block of four units were in favor of younger people moving in and and one of them wasn 't would that be an effective control i mean we 're into specifics obviously here but I 'm concerned that you know all of those people bought into those blocks of units expecting that it was an over 60s complex and it could be that on a majority but without universal approval that could in fact be changed and I 'm just very aware that you know majority decisions may rule and people may end up with living in a situation very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a possibility if the body corporate got amended that could happen under under these provisions and the body corporates vary widely now as well because the city plan only requires an encumbrance and eating a body corporate we don 't see following that it tends to be developed by the the set of units that are being developed at the time and yeah and we understand that they can can vary and not not actually have clauses of our over-60s in them again as a way of clarification I thought the government had passed an order and Council which basically suspended that provisions requiring the the under the over-60s to be applied until the year 2022 is that correct I 'm not aware of that I think the result of the autumn counselor is some provision for that I 'm not exactly sure the day 's energy yeah so so I mean we 're at the moment we are in the position where the government has well in fact I think after morning tea if you could provide us with some advice on that we 've got three more speakers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are pulling Potter ref mangie and Jamie golf Pauline thank you I 'm just following on from counselor Livingston 's point about housing New Zealand now I 've noticed that this has come up regularly in this document and particularly at 4.6 to facilitate housing New Zealand 's rebuild and end in intensification I 'm wondering and you might not have this figured out how much of housing new zealand stock is on l1 land at the moment really a majority of it yes certainly i wouldn 't have the exact numbers but by far the majority of their property is in l1 and we know too that well the ministers told us that they 're wanting to build seven hundred a year new so it signals to me that a lot of this is about housing New Zealand requiring land how much of this is actually about housing New Zealand and how much of it is about the residential open market with my view being that I I would look at the intensification of residential and the inner city being really important and this could actually adversely affected if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so my suggestion is is there any way we can tease out the housing New Zealand requirement for full land out of this and perhaps start to address that in an individual manner I 'm just flagging it for discussion yeah so I mean I think think fundamentally no this is this is not a tool that 's simply aimed at housing New Zealand I mean I think really what what happens is that simply because of the way that the tool is established because of the the requirements around proximity to schools transport routes that actually does align relatively well with housing New Zealand developments historically so a lot of housing New Zealand land is captured some of its some of it clearly isn 't and and we do signor continued desire to work with housing New Zealand on some of their to identify some key areas that they want to do some development in which are not captured by this mechanism so in some respects that possibly reflects and I would argue good planning in the past where in fact a lot of some of the early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the planning process so often if you go back far enough to housing New Zealand developments they were actually playing quite comprehensively with their own parks with proximity to shops and other facilities so that actually actually has reflected itself in the way that some of those properties have been captured I think one of the key things and the loop does talk it 's to housing New Zealand as a as a provider obviously one of the issues that we 've challenged in Christchurch end around the country as a things around affordability it 's also around again a mix of stock housing Zealand probably the key agent that is going to be delivering a lot of affordable housing and social housing in the future has the opportunity to do so it has a strong mandate from the government so I think that 's certainly an underlying benefit and and it 's it 's probably a good outcome that there is an overlap between this mechanism and the housing New Zealand land but signaling that there are also other areas at house museum are interested in am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work with them to facilitate the redevelopment of their stock follow on from that then at least we put the changes agree to changes in l1 will this prevent housing New Zealand intensifying a lot of these sites already on our one well this mechanism certainly facilitates them doing that so it would make that more of a challenge for them that 's correct yep ref man gee thanks Mike looking at the numbers in table 4.3 we 've got citywide intensification and CDM 3,000 units is that taking into account the scenario to alternative or with that an addition better to be fit in addition John 's half in addition so that so scenario 1 and scenario 2 will be additions to that supply okay so we 've got 16,200 in your table which gives an oversupply of eight thousand seven hundred units ozolins scenario one if we take a midpoint will give say another fourteen hundred and scenario to give another 4200 so it seems to me looking at the numbers what is the rush to go to scenario two given that there 's been no consultation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra 1,400 through scenario one to an oversupply of already 8700 which gives us an extra ten thousand so given that actually what we 're trying to do here is address housing supply we have a plan which will give and oversupply of 10,000 units so I don 't really see the rush to approve scenario to when we can have a look at up next year in a district plan review so it 's not ruling it out it 's just saying what 's the rush let 's have some consultation around that mmm would that be fer yes about but I was I supposed to educate them on the base that this is these are always notional figures and it 's really I suppose so you 've got that potential that 's what the market will pick up and I suppose the the rationale coming forward for here was to say well actually while the first model looked at l2 and l3 that that 's already been relatively open for intensification that hasn 't been fully taken up so perhaps there 's some opportunity to expand that into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obviously take a different lie and say look we would consult on that that could either be done through this path city plan review of which is the residential developments one of the early tranches of work for that well I mean that brings so that 's fine talking about the incentives to develop so if we go to living one zones in suburban areas and say okay you can now intensify here more than traditionally know traditionally allowed could that potentially have the unintended consequence of raising land prices in those areas because where 's the incentive for anybody to intensify coming from well the intense of the intensification opportunity as I suppose in the yield so effectively while you may seal you may see a lift and land values like I can 't predict that but you may also see that if that 's then spread over the sale of five units instead of two houses that were there previously then that still may lead to a lowering of average cost but the whole point of the incentive is if you can say put three units instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the value of that land automatically rises to balance that out yes but in terms of the affordability back to the market it will that would in depend on the nature of the development that 's actually then laid on that property so yes in gross terms the land value might rise but when it comes onto the mark of them turns the people buying that they 're only actually buying you know a third of that land every time that 's fun Jamie got it 's actually following on from here Adam I guess not taking this is an upholstery intensification certainties and compulsory as we 're talking about earlier it 's um it 's a relaxation of regulatory framework that provides options notwithstanding that I would imagine that surely the most likely sites to be developed or intensified or take up the relaxation of the route through framework would be probably uninhabited sites or uninhabited homes vacant sites you know we had a submission from Helen brought in earlier and I guess if any of any of us asked Helen if this a fewer site was eligible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because she 's been with me opposed to and probably a lot of people moved to these sites and live in these houses in live in l1 because they actually like giving a big bet yeah they 're like having a big house there and if they 're still living there they 're probably have no ambition to actually change it how many vacant sites are actually in this proposed area so we 've identified they are one L to an end our three there are currently three thousand bacon sites and is that uninhabitable as well will I own homes or uninhabited homes know if they 're uninhabitable paying they can land rights but okay it 's unsure but around that figure okay and even from that again it 's still not compulsory for that to be intensified no it 's not it 's not and I think again you come back to what is the fundamental ins is about actually opening choice back into the market and heading in a direction that says actually around some of those T knows where those conditions are right there 's an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not there at the moment but that I 'm just clarifying that point the you one side isn 't enough to make up minimum 6 in size goes click it would require contiguous sites to be amalgamated to allow for further intensification I mean at the moment you could you could buy two sections next to each other that produced 1500 and under our current rules you could divide them into three separate sections anyway that 's correctly because it 's a 450 square meter minimum section size and l1 but most people that have these large houses have 600 square metres 700 square metre sections would that be correct yes I mean we are clearly historically we 've with like the rest Museum help Everage land titles have over shrunk over generations so and so a lot of what we see in the past have been the subdivision how many square meters is the quarter acre sorry thousand thousand thousand and twelve so we always started what we started with the court with a thousand square meters we probably started with the third of an acre oh yeah heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know there and that would have reflected when when we all relied on individual septic tanks to do our sewage so if we if we think about the the 50s and the early sixties a thousand square meters was about the standard in the 80s 70s it dropped to around 800 to 600 probably now 450 to 400 is probably pretty standard for an independent living property across the country so it does vary and and and below that then you start to get the drivers that move to things such as common wall boundaries the use of town houses those sorts of things so I don 't know John might wish to comment on on that it pretty much just reiterate what you 're saying what we see now is a lot of average sort of section sizes around the six to seven hundred mark and a lot coming in around the 450 mark as well so there is this gradual decline and if you start going down further maybe below the 3 330 back you need to get to this multi unit type housing the sections just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have seen is that that the proportion of built form on any section has has increased so people the market is effectively shrunk the land costs to given self value for the built form so which is why if you go to modern subdivisions we tend to have more to story houses could get bigger forms on smaller bits of land it 's sort of basically where the market wants to go and obviously in terms of the size of sections you know there are price points in the market that different to you know basically pump towards thank you all right well I think we should adjourn for morning tea and it 's 1046 so I think we should come back here at eleven o 'clock and we 've changed the process of the previous council so that we 're now joining the public for morning tea and would invite you to to do so out there and the foyer thank you","(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"

CCC,ddkW4D1d7fk,20131120,1844.26,"Christchurch, New Zealand",4265,to deputations and relation to that request sorry to request for deputations in relation to at that one item on our agenda today and I would like to invite how I 'm brought unto to the table we can both come up together yet so we 've also got Jeff friend from the c 'mon acting squash residents association and members of the council my name is Jeff friend on chairman of the ribbon bushkill Mannix residents association and i have studied the agenda overnights Rasputin 's and i don 't pretend to be fully conversant with it but there are just a couple of aspects that has race and consumed within within our association we 're particularly concerned that the council staff has recommended scenario to as the preferred option that 's on page 21 in our do the limit the living one zones who do not want to be swamped with high-density development and in it in our view there are no problems with the existing rules as I 've said we 're concerned that the staff recommends scenario 2 has the preferred option appendix three to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the living run zone will have a range of views in regard to intensification and more importantly that consultation with residents in potential areas of intensification is necessary before any informed decision can be made and I just remind the council of that particular aspect that it is important that the his consultation and in my view this should have happened before today 's meeting but that the first we heard of it was picking up from Helen Broughton advising me last night that the this matter was to be discussed today and I spoke to the secretary of our association and she knew nothing about it and I just felt that in the circumstances that should have been more publicity given so that other affected residents mate who make their comment so you worship that 's all I have to say on this matter and I defer to this is broadening okay thank you madam you do you want me to start he 's thank you good morning everybody and I didn 't expect to be addressing a council meeting is a resident in in the new council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way that you wish to but I wasn 't sure I wasn 't aware of this issue until I open my computer at three o 'clock yesterday in many many affected residents throughout the city will not even be aware that this change is in fact proposed so the process is not good if a major changes to be made to living one zones I believe that you need to notify the meeting clearly in the paper and the content of that meter if there is a proposal to radically alter a neighborhood which I believe you do have in 6.3 and it will affect our area and particular cycle talk then about our our area we should have been informed about it to make comment if even if we 'd had more time the whole gallery here would have been full and that 's just our area alone so it 's very serious what the proposal is and 6.3 in terms of changing the living one moments and I am focusing on living on 6.3 there are a number of other options but you 've got not carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them so I think they 're probably good and fair and will give you more housing so I 'm going to speak on two for two on two sort of hats 1 i 'm going to talk briefly as an elected member for record on Wigram and secondly i talk as a resident and as an elective members accounts the last term I attended all the planning meetings relating to residential zoning I wasn 't a member of that committee but I attended those sections where we were looking at residential zoning and I felt what came out of that was reasonable intensification or density would occur in living two and three but if there was a need to add on from a loving one 's own then you would do that and that seems reasonable but living one was actually excluded as a whole and I continually asks questions senior planning stat brigitte dorando mentioned her hips saying to me living one would be not tampered with and that cut right across the planning staff and senior planning staff now the reason to protect living one is that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that understanding it normally has established houses and trees and tributes strongly to our garden city image so whatever you do it 's ended to be an intense in dense environment and I 'll talk now as a resident and because i 'm actually affected by this the area i live in is 25 rata street it 's zone and it 's got Rickett and rode on one side and a buffer then it 's the living one it 's got rata it 's got rata Carrie renew and to Toki and a cross Draven road there 's bread Shaw terrace as well and I think we go broader than that but just in my local area it 's become and we have reggaeton house and bush on the other side you 've got reggaeton road this precinct and then record and house and bush with lots of trees it 's a precinct area now and council spent I think over a hundred thousand on reconstruction and planting about five years ago for which we were very very grateful but it actually made it enhance the aesthetic value of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway it 's a mixture of character homes units both older and recent new ones it 's got recently built standalone homes on some of the sections that have become become available and recently in rem U Street a sec bided and a back house was built hot and all that has been no problem it has created or added to Orton at least not harmed the ambience of the area I 've lived there for over 30 years my second child was born so the strong links there and a lot of people are have lived there for such a long time as well so it 's a defined community which has got social connections and it 's got the sort of ambience which lots exceedingly good we always have been concerned about encroachment from the commercial sector and the residence group when it was formed about 1987 I 'm not a member of it because I had to stand aside as Victor member but it 's the Kilmarnock Dean Jewish residents association was formed about 87 formed to protect the encroachment of the commercial sector into the residential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw record and Road shops expanding or parking expanding but we never expected to happen and we would have seen an erosion of our living standards only coming through our formal review of the district plan we wouldn 't have seen it coming in this way it 's almost a back back door way of doing it can I just now I did give someone a prickly just flick through the the housing me that 's up so people get a picture but it 's a divided fiction not sure what that 's that the old one of the character homes for the long side some new unit thank you thanks there 's a section next to me so come back to that the vacant vacant section there 's some new housing become one of the character homes new housing of 33 units which have been able to be built under living one got a view down five to two new units sorry living one yep and as far as I know it won 't in fact there 's no resource than seemed so it 's which it just allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure why it was done but it 's just now that 's a view down the street again a new unit their new years lips of you again ok so I 'm those were taken by my husband this morning so it 's it 's just a snapshot of what it 's like as so a lot of developments occurred there already it hasn 't caused any problems and the people wanted to get a few more housing on it they could always apply for a a resource can see I 've got a vacant section now that the worry we have is a vacancy right next door to me was an old student flat bold because of the earthquake I know they lend the owner of its waiting to see how things go I mean that 's just waiting a year but and you could potentially build three unit c or may before but what could happen if you go ahead with what what is on the staff recommendation you could potentially build 10 units there take take another section along side and then you 'll get a mess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex built on the corner of retro street in records and wrote that holds 24 house of units and a three-story high and it 's a concrete block so the worry at an extreme end is that you get concrete block apartments and you might have student accommodation for those of you you 're probably see mile and reggaeton and with having issues with between the residents and the students largely sorted it 's not a huge issue but it 's that could be an effect if you do not stay with scenario 1 and he 'll then we 're going to we 're going to run out of time okay I just want you to explain what the difference between scenario one scenario to us for where you live well if it scenario this is my interpretation I 've had with a plan oh I you know this is my I mean it 's just that the pictures look identical for the record turn area yes it is well this is a living one 's own and a lot of developments been able to occur in that that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenario two yeah you would allow that any development as a right no scenario one and two are identical for the Riccarton area because we 're not allowing significant intensification and the rectal area because of pressure and on the search system will then better than my interpretation from lemme just look at the two pictures on the map the two maps scenario one I scenario to go to the maps and look at the briquette inception and just explain to me how they 're different well i think in Rickett and one is slightly bigger but I I 'll Italy and go it 's more the wording leave but he looped the blue verts are just the existing living three it 's the little green box that is the addition to the enhance or the comprehensive mechanism that 's a development mechanism and that is exactly the same size and scenario to accept that if you look at the pendeks three so it 's really what it 's it 's it 's the water so my understanding of it is that if you take scenario one which is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living to and living three with a slot the living one on occasions I mean it 's needed Mario 2 is that the living one mechanism you have as a so it 's not as living to living ghost in the living one it 's just the green but samba it 's only the green bits on the on the plane and I 'm just saying that in terms of riccarton there is no difference between scenario 1 and scenario to know that you might need to talk to my understanding talking to the planner except the length it could go into a living one area it 's not just what 's on the map no it 's just what 's on the map you sure it is what you say yeah would you follow it through yeah well we 're so when we get on to the actual discussion but but your significant concern is based around the wreck attorney area and I think you 've presented that case very well but I 'm also probably concerned that there we been Alton more areas are going to have this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it 's any area that 's any live in one area which is close to a supermarket conflicts or shopping complexes potentially at risk and I don 't think the plan is a watertight plan but that was the issue i got when i spoke to the cleaner yesterday okay so yes I 'll just conclude please the living one areas not allow intrusion into them at this point take a precautionary approach I 'd approve the other aspects of this chain of the changes today the six point two point one or six point two point two eight six two point three six point two point four but please was scenario one rather than scenario two please protect the people who are in the living one environment who have chosen to live in a less dense area and please don 't do this with a stroke of a pen today at the very least if you think it might be a good idea perhaps I know the others today then let 's have more consultation on their other issue of the living one if you think you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months time if you have to but it 's really an unknown and the potential to change neighborhoods and the living one area isn 't that huge thank you thank you very much thank you don 't appreciate it thank you so that brings us on to oh sorry yep okay both sorry Helen could you answer a question counselor clear water thank you right as a new counselor I 've looked at the recovery strategy for greater Christchurch at some of the ideals are in there and I just wondered if what might perhaps assist your findell community in riccarton as if for example a housing development is part of part of our approach the counsels approach if if say it had to be either agreed to by community representative or a community board would that assist your concern yes was assessed addressing your consume think it would but I think it 's had to actually do and because I think a developer has views he 's got his cost structures I think to put it through a community board would probably not be quite the right thing from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave living one alone at this point if you still don 't have housing and years time we 'll go back to it then another changes that are going to help to allow one more question can search in Ellen may ask you one question the because are you aware if from the change in a scenario want to sanara to but still need to sue council operative city plan the review there 's a consultation whether you 're satisfied or not oil before another consultation no look probably I 'd look if I was talking as a resident and i would say please do not go with scenario two but you can look at this area through the district plan and at that point the wii consultation yeah I 'm happy if you 're doing it through the district plan fine it gives people an opportunity to come in and discuss okay thank you very much thank you right we 'll now move on to the item concerned and we have a report in front of us and i would i would like to well I want to amend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder should we have a separate mover and seconder or should we or shall I can I move them in months before just move the amendments so item 3.12 to a mean endorses the intensification provisions of the land use recovery plan so that it doesn 't read endorses the land use recovery plan but endorses the intensification provisions of the land use recovery plan I 've been waiting for some wording on the legal aspects for number two have we got any food there on there so I I want to indicate that there are some elements of cause to that need to be that need us to revoke the decisions of the previous council which as I understand was taken and public excluded so this is the first time this has been debated and the public arena and the previous council it was debated behind closed doors and there is unfortunate i think for a lot of people not understanding the history of the council 's involvement and the development of the land use recovery plan which is now in the government 's hand for the government to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two as well and then on number three if we change the word comprehensive development mechanism to the word enhanced development mechanism is that will be the language that will be adopted when the government gives effect to the land US recovery plan so i will come back to the come back with a further amendment and I think the Dipsy mere will second those amendments and if we could open that up for debate who would like to start or perhaps perhaps we 've got Mike tellin at the end of the table and I think that perhaps we could start with questions because obviously this is a significant issue and and I think that a number of questions have already been indicated so counselor your hand son can start thank you um question for Michael um if I was a resident or a citizen of the city and I looked at the draft land use recovery plan would I have any idea that we would be about to make change as as part of finalizing that program what would I expect that it would have been a further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of intensification wouldn 't would occur the the I suppose of the draft land use recovery plan did signal that there would be that intensification was one of the tools that was identified in that plan as meeting some of the housing needs the the I suppose the process that was adopted and recommended by council initially was twofold one was to look at intensification as part of the district plan review and that would look at intensification globally across the city and that was reflected in in terms of the previous position that the council and the other councils of Canterbury took with the urban development strategy so and to that extent the concepts of intensification were were arguably well Nolan the council also committed to looking at the introduction of a comprehensive development mechanism was referred to as a floating zone at the time and there was a clear direction in the draft loop that that was to be that would be activated at the time of the minister making the draft the recovery plan operative so in that sense the issue around intensification was was understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signaled by the council was primarily to look at their intensification mechanism in terms of further modifications to look at how it could further enhanced development of the living two and three zones and some i suppose what will termed modest sort of amendments to those so some some tweaks to those where they 're made with some logical sense to do so so the community may not have anticipated that out of the land use recovery plan there would be direct changes to large parts or parts of the living one 's own so it 's a really a matter of degree in some respects about what the changes people may have anticipated versus what may come out of the land use recovery plan by the minister just so I 'm clear the the land use recovery plan talked about a further process to work through what changes for intensification would be made to read Vettori documents what we are now being asked to do is make the changes without those further process is happening and it public have had known about it since three o 'clock yesterday was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it signaled a number of tranches so it 's signaled a tranche around the review of the city plan and that would have addressed intensification as part of that and will continue to do so it 's signaled that there would be a floating zone or what 's now call the enhanced development mechanism would be looked at and would be introduced through the plan what was not known at the time because the work hadn 't been done was the extent to which that would apply to different parts of the city and this the second question is when we look at the photos that were presented we saw a number of intensification developments in the living one 's own under the current district plan can you just advise how much current capacity do we have under existing clip zoning in our city to accommodate more housing and how is this going to be any different to what currently exists to enable people to intensify okay in terms of that if you if you look at page section 4.3 of the report that that figures there Alan in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the question so there is there is capacity in the current living one two and three zone to allow further intensification that that exists and that exists either through the nature of development I you 've got large sections which could be further subdivided and all the possibility always remains for people to apply for resource consents to make their intensification happen so what we have those is a relatively stable market and most cities in New Zealand and elsewhere will have effectively a greater notional capacity for development than they actually have ever taken up because people make choices about they don 't want to develop all their properties in this particular way they don 't want to intensify they like to have a large backyard or they want to have a tennis court or something of that nature so there 's always a notional supply of land and there 's what the market ultimately delivers and prior to the earthquakes there was there was a regular subdivision of some of those larger sections but there wasn 't ever a great it never was a great number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of housing what I suppose this mechanism is designed to do is to say actually it does two things one is actually talks to the market and says actually what we will do is not only allow for that development to happen but in certain instances we will allow for a further intensification of that so a greater incentive to the market to develop but also talks about developing or making opportunity for a different form of development so a more intense form of development because while traditionally in the living one and two zones or in the living one 's own in particular you could re subdivide you were largely confined in standalone houses again and a lot of the photos that were showing our that so the and as I 'm effectively potentially opens the market for new development it opens the market for a comprehensive form of development ie it looks at amalgamating sites and actually generating high yield and I suppose in some respects that speaks to a reflection of some of the problems that we 've had used the word problem advisory a form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in Christchurch for many many years and that is that our form of intensification is largely been driven by carving off the back of sections and that 's actually not a very effective form of intensification as an irvin as an urban planning tools on summers this tool does that actually allows a more comprehensive version of intensification to be offered to the market,"(-43.5320214, 172.6305589)"
