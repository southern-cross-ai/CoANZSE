number of years we 've been working on a major project to make narrow streets like this one safer and more accessible for everyone this will affect 285 streets across pae as always the outcome is a balancing act between the wants and the needs of the affected community and the requirements under the law to get the best outcomes for everyone including residents and road users while also meeting the legal obligations for road management we understand a lot of these streets have been unchanged for a number of years and changes may take some adjustment we 've also been working to minimise the impact for residents where we can we 're making changes to narrow streets to allow cars cyclists rubbish trucks and importantly emergency service vehicles to travel unimpeded along streets where they often face difficulties due to parked vehicles blocking access or impeding visibility for emergency vehicles in particular narrow streets can cause problems when time is of the essence causing them to be held up or possibly not even being able to get near where they need to be we also want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all pedestrians can safely use footpaths on foot in a wheelchair with walking stick or with a pram [Music] since the australian road rules were introduced in 1999 if a clear distance of three metres cannot be provided between a parked car you cannot legally park there since this time council have relied on road users to abide by this rule however with more and more households having multiple vehicles and more people parking on the streets we have no choice but to formalise this arrangement to improve things for all users who share narrow streets our transport engineers and traffic management staff undertook a detailed analysis of all streets under 7.2 metres in width across pae each street is different so the changes happening will be different in each case we 've created a priority list of 25 streets under 5 meters in width which are most in need of work streets under 5 metres will have no parking on either side of the street one-way arrangements will be considered where appropriate there may be a possibility for straddled parking on the footpath on one side of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets which are 5 to 7.2 metres will have parking on one side of the street only if a narrow street is used as a shortcut for non-local traffic other treatments may be considered to discourage this we have allocated 200 000 for initial works to begin now on priority streets we 've created a further priority list for the remaining narrow streets based on a criteria listed in the policy for inclusion in future planning in our annual business plan and budget [Music] we 've undertaken a very thorough consultation with our community about this while things need to change it 's important that you 're involved in the discussions and decisions that affect you and where you live as well as a general consultation open to everyone we sent over 7 000 letters seeking feedback from residents living on a street identified as a narrow street and received 608 responses with 75 supportive of the changes you can read all of the submissions on our website we also held five dropping community sessions with over 50 people attending to discuss the changes we thank everyone who provided their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarding the program of works regular updates are provided on our website some streets will have further consultation while some will receive a notification of works as there is no further consultation possible an overwhelming majority of the affected streets are in older areas which were made before we had such large vehicles and a greater need for parking others such as light 's view were caused by other factors at the time of light series development the council did not have the jurisdiction to approve the width of the streets or the amount of on-street parking in the area as this was done by the state government the then minister for planning created some very lenient parking conditions in lion 's view with the aim of encouraging residents to use public transport instead of relying on private motor vehicles since many of the laneways in light 's view predominantly contain driveway crossovers they do not have any on-street parking this is an example of planning regulations being outside of our control as a council and just one example of something that is undertaken by other parties then left to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular area please get in touch with us by email and we can provide some more specific information [Music] of properties have parking in a driveway carport or garage available we encourage you to park your vehicle on your property if you can or in a designated parking bay on the street vehicles may be parked on the street where it 's safe and they do not breach any australian road rule or existing parking conditions always remember that a minimum of three metres distance between vehicles must be left to

'm sure that many of you are aware that the port adelaide football club is proposing to develop new club rooms and facilities at albertan oval which has been home to the club since 1880. i 'm here to explain what 's being proposed how the process works and how you can have your say about it firstly it 's important to note that the development is being proposed by the port adelaide football club it 's not a pae council project however we own the main parcel of land at albertan oval which is managed through a community land management plan portions of albertan oval are also currently leased and licensed to the port adelaide football club the proposed redevelopment and use of the land would require changes to the current albertan oval community land management plan the port adelaide football club is proposing to build a new facility at albertan oval this includes a training and recreation facility with two indoor basketball courts an outdoor naturally turfed soccer pitch dedicated change rooms and amenities plus shared car parking and ancillary infrastructure the club has confirmed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soccer pitch will be available for use by the community [Music] it 's important to reiterate that this development is being proposed by the club and not the council however pae council has a legislative duty to consult and make decisions about this proposal in two different areas as the owner of the land and manager of the community land management plan and the holder of the lease to port adelaide football club a third assessment is a separate independent process and conducted by the port adelaide enfield council assessment panel using the development act each decision has a separate consultation process and we want to make sure that everyone in the community has their say about this project as of july 2021 pae council has not made any decisions regarding the proposal other than to offer in-principle support which is a standard procedure that enables the port adelaide football club to develop a concept and a plan for consultation to seek interest from other funding sources and to canvas their own consultation process it also makes it clear that this support is conditional on the adoption of the community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the buildings all of which require either statutory notifications or community consultation in accordance with legislation at the conclusion of the community consultation process the council will consider all of the feedback received from the community and make decisions on each aspect depending on the outcome further consultation may be undertaken the albertson oval community land management plan guides pae council as the landowner in making decisions about the use of community land here this diagram shows the portions of albertan oval currently owned by pae council with the blue areas being buildings owned by the port adelaide football club their proposal includes encroaching on community land and also proposes a transfer of privately owned land to council to become amalgamated and become community lands this means we must consider a revised community land management plan for albertan oval that will better support shared community use of the land in the future including any redevelopment by the port adelaide football club in the proposed new plan albertan oval will remain community land for the purpose of sporting and recreation which supports community and elite sporting activity the pae council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensure that the community will continue to have community space for their use and their enjoyment to have your say on the community land management plan head to havyoursay.cityofpae.sa.gov.eu consultation is open until the 27th of august 2021 the port adelaide football club has an existing lease and licences to support their activities and the use of albertan oval in order to facilitate their proposed redevelopment the club has requested to lease an additional portion of the alberton oval precinct for 42 years we are required to consult on any lease proposed for longer than five years it 's important to note that the progression of this lease proposal is reliant on the adoption of a new community land management plan which is why the two proposals are being consulted on at the same time but subject to entirely separate consideration to have your say on the lease you can go to the same website at haveyoursay.cityofpae.sa.gov.au consultation is open until the 27th of august 2021 [Music] under the planning development and infrastructure act the council 's assessment panel known as cap is the relevant authority to assess the port @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be different to the community land management plan and the lease and the decision-making process by the council will be based upon its merits from a statutory perspective under the planning development and infrastructure act which is a similar process to other development applications lodged with council after the public notification process all comments will be considered by cap which is an entirely separate making authority from the council body you can have your say about this development application notification which will appear on the plan sa website plan.sa.gov.eu in due course further all properties within 60 meters of the development site will receive written notification of the public consultation process associated with the development application before it commences unfortunately we 're not able to advise when this consultation will commence at this point in time howerton oval sits on the boundary of the city of port adelaide enfield and the city of charles sturt local councils work together all of the time and in this case we will be consulting with residents in charles sturt no matter where you live you 'll be able to have your say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be considered by pae so that 's the process in a nutshell we 're currently consulting on the albertan oval

Australia",1626,hello i 'm michael collins and this is my colleague stuart dowie we 're from the city of pae property team and we 're here today just to explain to you a little bit more about the two proposals that council is currently out seeking your feedback on now they are two distinct proposals and we do require two separate feedback two separate bits of feedback on each of these proposals the first is the in relation to the draft albertson oval community land management plan and the second is the proposal to lease the community land for a period of up to 42 years including landowner consent to undertake development now we do want to make very very clear the council has not made any final decisions yet in relation to the above two proposals so we do want your feedback both good and bad in relation to these two proposals now we also want to make very clear that this community engagement is a separate engagement process to that for the development application this is completely separate the development application has its own separate statutory process at which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation to proposal one the draft albertan oval precinct community land management plan we need to explain to you what is community land so all land that 's owned by council or under the care and control of council is classified as community land unless that classification has been revoked or the land has been excluded from classification as community land also all roads are not classified as community land so just a couple of examples of what 's not community land so 74 south most of you would look at that and think that 's obviously community land it 's actually road reserve so it 's not actually classified as community land beneath that you 've got the relum road depot that 's had its classification excluded because it 's an operational asset of council the hillcrest basketball stadium that went through a revocation process of its community land classification in order that it can be sold and all public roads are not classified as community land now there 's some very distinct areas within the alberta and oval precinct that we need people to be aware of so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are owned by port adelaide football club outright so they 're not part of this process the area is colored in red so the pooled adelaide bowling club land and the former croquet club land are excluded from classification of community land so the community land management plan for the alberta noble precinct only relates to those areas that are colored in green now we also just wanted to run through what other community land management plans we have we 've got two distinct types of community land management plans at city of pae we 've got some categorized plants and these have multiple parcels of land that are that sit under these individual community land management plants and then we have some individual plans where the parcel of land didn 't fit neatly into one of the categorized plants and we 've got ones for for fulham park the lights community and sports center north haven foreshore and now we 're looking at doing an individual plan for the albertan oval precinct now this is a copy of the draft community land management plan which is available on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key components of the local government 's act requires us to have in the community land management plan but the first thing that we have in there is the ghana acknowledgement which we feel is important we then have the purpose for which the land is held now in this case we 've designated that council holds the land primarily as a sporting and recreation ground which supports community and elite sporting activities and then the objectives for the land for the management of the land in this case we 've got two key objectives the first one being to provide an area where a range of organized sport and recreation activities may be undertaken for the use and enjoyment of the community the second being to maintain a high quality elite sporting facility we then have various proposals for the management of the land again i 'm not going to read through all of these in detail but they allow for things like alienation by lease or license they allow for provision maintenance renewal an upgrade of assets they allow us to maintain other occupancy agreements that support elite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or organizations under a permit lease or license we then have the performance targets and measures these relate to the objectives and they 're designed to measure how well council is performing against those objectives we then have a list of policies and plans that relate to the individual parcel of land so within the draft community land management plan we 've got these listed for you to have a look at and then finally we have the legal description of the land to which the plan relates now in terms of the the next steps in relation to the draft downton oval community land management plan council have already finalized the draft and endorsed this draft plan we 're currently here undertaking the consultation once we have your feedback and we really do want that feedback it will be reviewed by the elected members and they will make a decision now that decision will either be to retain the alternative precinct land within the commercial properties community land management plan where it currently sits or they may decide to adopt this plan as it 's written in which case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be used in future decision making or it may be that council decides it wants some amendments made for this plan now if these amendments are minor in nature they can be made council can adopt and the plan can be used if the amendments are fairly significant we then need to go back again for it to be re-endorsed by council and a fresh lot of consultation will need to be undertaken i 'm now going to hand over to stuart who 's going to talk to you about the lease proposal so jumping into the second proposal that council 's seeking feedback on the community on is the proposal to lease a portion of albertan oval to port adelaide football club so to facilitate their redevelopment so their request from port adelaide enfield is that a grounds lease over a portion of the site being the red portion marked up in the attached and they would like this on a peppercorn basis and um for the maximum term allowable under the local government act which is 42 years the proposal would include land owners consent from council in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the club to undertake their development but is entirely separate from the development approval process the proposal would also include a boundary realignment that allows port adelaide football club um privately owned headquarters land to be subdivided and a portion of the land amalgamated back with albertan oval to be council-owned land the proposal is completely separate from the development approval process which will undergo its own statutory assessment and potentially require a notification period in which the community would be invited under that process to give separate feedback the development that 's proposed includes indoor recreation facilities and also a soccer pitch and also car parking and ancillary infrastructure so to give you an idea of the existing tenure that we have at albert and oval the area marked in blue is the bowls club as michael explained earlier excluded from community land but that 's least under under community arrangements to the port adelaide bowls club via port adelaide football club they 're areas marked in green reiterating that they 're owned privately by port adelaide football club which leaves that parcel the main parcel and the croquet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to port adelaide football club currently and these areas would need to be altered as part of the development and potential grounds lease under the proposal too in summary council wears two hats when it comes to development on its land it has a decision to make as a landowner and a decision as a statutory authority both of these are entirely separate from the other as part of this community engagement and consultation process we 're seeking feedback on two landowner decisions the first being the draft albertan oval community land management plan and the second the requested 42-year ground lease to port adelaide football club that 's proposed to contain landowner permission for port adelaide football club to undertake development the outcome of the proposal to lease is contingent on the adoption ever all of the community land management plan council must separately capture feedback on these proposals and councils encouraging feedback and will consider this feedback in its future decision making feedback on the proposals must be made formally and the best way you can do that is by heading to our have your say website where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land management plan document however you can always give us a call on 8405.600 if you need any assistance accessing this information or for further information,"(-34.8442994, 138.505369)"

there thank you so much for getting involved in the doggy festival this week we 've had loads of fun online creating content to help you and your dog get the most out of your relationship i 'm shelley from port adelaide enfield and i 'm joined here today with with daven from charles sturt and our joint education officer petra we 're here today to answer some of your questions covering dog behaviour and training as well as questions relating to council processes the first question we have is from a child state resident who would like to know how to stop his neighbor 's dog from barking while this is not a simple answer we can share with you some strategies we would recommend from a council perspective we contact both the dog owner and the neighbor and ascertain the severity of the issue and the times when the dog biking is allegedly happening we would then work with both parties to reach a suitable solution there are usually a range of issues that can cause excessive barking i think we 've all lived with that dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that likes to let everyone know when a leaf falls down three houses away sometimes the con the solution can be as simple as bringing the dog inside at night or increasing training exercise or enrichment barking is part of normal healthy dog behavior but if it 's consistent enough to upset the neighbours there 's usually a reason why such but why it 's occurring so that could be a boredom or alert barking if someone passes by sometimes it can be anxiety or pain related and sometimes it can just be a part of growing old in all of these cases quite a few strategies that we can there 's quite a few strategies that we can use to help reduce the barking but not all are equal as we need to look at the reason the dog is barking and consider individual circumstances to find the best solution if you want to learn more you can jump onto your local council website for tips and tricks or if you 've tried a few things and are stuck you can find a list of qualified trainers who can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is from a resident in port allenfield who 'd like to know why he wasn 't provided with the details of another dog owner when he was involved in a dog attack thank you for this question all of us here know how traumatic it can be when dealing with a dog attack and all of our staff take these cases very seriously and we undertake full investigations we also must respect the legal process especially when it comes to protecting personal data to receive this information we ask that the dog owner would write to us and depending on the circumstances we may refer the resident to lodge a freedom of information request with all of that documentation so that we can ensure that the correct process is followed council staff are always available to answer any questions so please give us a call for a chat or any guidance on this the next question is also from a resident in pae who would like to know why his dog always licks him and that 's the question that i get asked on the beach as well is everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might lick our skin because we have moisturizers or sunscreen or sweat that tastes good to them sometimes it might be a way of getting our attention because dogs like to be social if the licking is accompanied by intense sniffing they might be trying to work out where we 've been sometimes they 'll touch their tongue to ascent on our shoes or pants or hands and then transfer those scent particles to the vomero nasal organ which is in the roof of their mouth and that 's a whole secondary organ devoted to scent that transmits information straight to the olfactory processing hub in the brain which is really cool we have one as well but ours isn 't as good lip-licking where the dog flicks out their tongue as if they 're a lizard can actually be a sign of stress or fear in dogs it 's not the dog giving you kisses to test this um to test if this is the reason for licking you can stop the interaction and see what your dog does you might find that they turn around and ask to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from you or they might ask for more it 'll depend on what the rest of their body language is trying to tell you if the dog 's licking is really hard to interrupt or you find that it 's increasing in frequency or intensity or across multiple different situations and becomes almost compulsive in nature it might be worth chatting to your vet about it as there can be medical conditions like anxiety that can influence that sort of behavior the last question is from a child 's third resident who would like to know why he needs to have his dog on a lead on a public footpath when there 's no one around we get this question quite a lot and aside from the fact that it is indeed legislated within the dog and cat management act it is also because circumstances can and do quickly change while your dog may have very good recall the requirement reflects consistency and fairness within these spaces and also in it sets a norm of expected behavior but it 's also about doing the right thing having your dog on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all safely enjoy these areas and keep off lead play for off lead spaces where we will where we all know what to expect we know that dogs interact differently when one is on and one is off lead and so you 're creating a less than an ideal environment for um for that dog that 's on lead if you 're not following the same rules as everyone else it puts the only dog at a huge disadvantage and increases the risk of aggression on that note allowing offly dogs to approach unleaded dogs regardless of how friendly or small or young that doggy is is incredibly rude there are many reasons why some dogs are on lead even in an off-lead space they might be still in training they could be too young or too old or unwell or recovering from surgery or perhaps they 're really shy and timid and their parent is trying to help them build their confidence about the world and here comes larry labrador with the enthusiasm that rivals the strength of the sun and attention span of a house that bumbles in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hard work i 'm joking i love labs really i wish i had their enthusiasm for life the other thing to consider is that your environment is constantly changing on your walks and even if you have been walking your dog off lead for years they 've really and they 're really well behaved you never know when a car will backfire or a cat will run across the road or a child might walk past with an ice cream better to keep to be safe and follow the law and keep your dog on lead dogs in only spaces help us create a predictable environment for everyone that uses those spaces and each of us in our community have a responsibility to ensure those spaces are shared respectfully and responsibly thanks devon and petra for your help in answering these questions we hope we 're able to answer your questions too however if you 'd like any further information please get in touch with your own local council and don 't forget to check out all of our education training videos that we 've put online as part of the doggy festival bye,"(-34.8442994,

petra the beach education officer for the city of charleston and port adelaide enfield i 'm here today to chat to you about the different types of equipment that we might use on our dogs so the very first thing that i wanted to say was it is by law a requirement that your dog is on a lead no greater than two metres long on any public footpath um on the on lead times in the foreshore and it is really important that you adhere to that two meter length so that 's the very first thing make sure you 've got a two meter lead while we 're on leads i did want to mention the extender leads or the retractable leads it is uh while i totally appreciate the value that they might have in an off-lead area to be able to give your dog that extra freedom without risk of losing them they actually do work to potentially encourage pulling because your dog has to get used to having that pressure on the throat to get further away from you so that 's the the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health and safety associated with those retractable leads is that they can cause injury to fingers they can trip people up that don 't see them they can break especially if you 've got a large breed dog so um we tend to not recommend retractable leads but you can certainly get if you want to give your dog that freedom um large uh sturdy long leads like a horse lung drain for example there 's other things that you can buy in pet stores that can replace them quite nicely i actually did my honors research on the equipment that we use on our dogs and i was really surprised to find that there 's not much research out there unfortunately um what we do know is that excessive pulling in a collar in any type of in any type of collar can put a lot of pressure on their windpipe and potentially damage their windpipe it can also increase the intraocular pressure in their eyes so those dogs with dome heads and large eyes like your pugs or your cavaliers your boxes it can put their eyes under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don 't want we also follow the guidelines and recommendations placed by the rspca we don 't recommend choke chains used on dogs prong collars are actually illegal to import into australia they are a metal or plastic collar with spikes that dig into the dog 's neck and electric shock collars are illegal to use in south australia as well just so you know we obviously all want to take our dogs out for a walk so i really like harnesses because it gets that pressure off the throat you can have a back attach harness or a front attach harness so a back attach harness attaches the lead at the back there sometimes that you might feel that that helps dogs pull um stronger because they can put all of their weight into that breastplate if that 's not a problem for you it doesn 't matter otherwise a front attach harness which is what gwen is demonstrating for us here um the lead clips on at the front and it can help uh lessen we think the amount that a dog can pull there 's two different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape which we think might help with their range of movement so their shoulder movement forward and the other is a t shape which is a strap that goes straight across their chest but there 's not much research out there to say whether one or other is is better or worse for a dog but that anecdotally they certainly do um seem to help with dogs that pull a lot so gwen is 52 kilos and we walker offering a front attach harness there 's only a few harnesses out on the market that have been crash tested for dogs for safe travel um so if you 're interested in that make sure that you do purchase one of those types of harnesses otherwise the other ones that you can buy are probably better than nothing but we that they 're not being crash tested and it is really important that you restrain your dog in the car either by a piece of equipment or a crate or have them behind a cargo barrier as well one of the other things that i just really quickly wanted to mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reasons why a dog white might wear a muzzle it 's not just because they 're an evil or aggressive dog but if you see a dog wearing a muzzle obviously please do give it as much space as possible that 's for their safety and for yours and but it does mean that that person is getting the dog out which is really lovely the dog is still um being able to enjoy its walks and uh and is safe for everyone involved but some of the other reasons why a dog might wear a muzzle is because they 're on medication that required that makes them starving and they just pick up anything that they can find on the floor and eat it which is obviously very unsafe and so if for some reason you do need a muzzle for your dog the muzzles that we tend to recommend are what we call these basket muzzles here and that means that your dog can open its mouth completely it can pan and it can still drink so in stressful situations or in in hot weather dogs need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muzzles enable dogs to do that so if you 're using a muzzle while your dog is exercising or like just going for a walk then this is the muzzle that i would recommend so i hope that provides you with some ideas on different types of equipment that you can use on your dogs if you have any more questions you can find a trainer on the rspca force-free trainers list and they will be able to give you some more tips and tricks for helping your dog enjoy your walks and reducing the pulling as well which can can make walks a little bit less comfortable for us all thanks very much bye you,"(-34.8442994, 138.505369)"

AUS,SA,City of Port Adelaide Enfield,City of PAE,https://www.youtube.com/c/CityofPAE,Doggy Festival - Choosing the Right Dog,GA_0XtpG4CE,20210513,479.84,"Port Adelaide SA 5015, Australia",1646,hi i 'm petra the beach education officer for the city of chelsea and port adelaide and food councils and i 'm here to chat to you today about how to choose the right dog for you i 'm sure you can appreciate there 's lots of different factors that go into picking the right dog for you and your family and we 're going to go through some of the real basic ones now so the very first thing to consider is why you 're actually choosing a dog why are you considering getting a dog is it for your children is it because you want a companion is it because you want to encourage more exercise um or are you do you have already have a dog and you think that that dog needs a playmate and the first thing that i want to say is that your pet does not need a pet so when you choose to get a dog often two dogs are much harder to work with than just one dog and it 's really important to make sure that your first dog is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a second dog into the mix because often the older dog will teach the new dog bad habits but it can go vice versa as well so that 's the very first thing make sure you 're getting the dog for the right reasons make sure your entire family is ready because consistency is so important when you 're training and setting up your house rules it 's really important that everyone 's on the same page so the second thing to consider is the amount of time and money and resources you have into making sure that that dog is a happy member of your family and a happy confident sociable member of our community as well so there 's uh the initial purchase price uh is often a big purchase but that 's not the only thing that you need to consider there 's ongoing registration fees vet fees for annual checkups you have the cost of food to consider you have the cost of bedding and equipment that you might need to use with your dog the cost of kennels if you go away frequently or pet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so that ongoing cost and the ongoing time and effort you that you 'll need to put in and your family will need to put in to do uh dog training and to teach the dog the rules of the house and to teach the dog how to be a happy confident sociable member of our society can often be more than we expect so it is really important to sit down with everyone and make sure that everyone is on the same page sometimes things as simple as picking up after your dog when you 're out and about which is obviously a really important requirement that you do pick up after your dog but even in the backyard uh having someone that 's going to do that regularly is really important and often if we get dogs for our kids um that 's not a thing that they really want to participate in so once you 've decided to get a dog you need to consider where you might get one from obviously you can rescue dogs from the rspca or the animal welfare league the staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that dog and you can meet that dog before you pick it up um so that is an option for you another option is to go through a breeder so you can get a breeder that 's registered with dogs and cats online and then you can also get which is a requirement for all breeders in south australia um and then you can also get a dog from a ankc registered breeder which have some more regulations and ethics about how they go about breeding their purebred dogs so those are the different options there for you obviously you can look elsewhere as well but it is really important to make sure that you go and see the home that the dog is coming from you meet the parents as much as possible because the temperament of the parents can often give you a clue as to some of the behaviors that you can expect from your dog as they grow up so once you 've decided to look at the different places that you can get your dog from you also obviously need to have a look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's large breeds and small breeds um there 's breeds with long hair there 's breeds that need a lot of exercise there 's breeds that prefer perhaps not to have a lot of exercise or perhaps aren 't very good in cold weather or aren 't very good in hot weather so you need to do your research on those all of our dog breeds are bred for purpose so they were bred to help humans through the domestication process of retrieving or herding or guarding or digging ratting that sort of stuff so it 's really important that you have a look at what that breed was bred for if you have a crossbreed look at both of those breeds that go into it because that will give you an idea of some of their behaviors that you might see in your dog so it 's really important that you do your research on breed but it 's also really important that you look to where the dog is coming from as well make sure that you meet the parents make sure that you can go in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up because it 's not just breed traits you need to be aware of genetics from um like anxieties and aggressions and different sort of neuroses can also be hereditary and it 's really important to get a really good picture of what the parents are like and even more relatives before you commit to picking up your dog and then from there you bring your puppy home you need to puppy-proof your house or rescue dog if it 's an adult dog proof your house make sure that your fences are safe make sure that you have a place where they can sleep make sure that you are prepared to spend the time with them and take them to some training schools so once you have decided what breed you 're getting and where you 're going to get it from have a think about whether you want a puppy or an older dog there 's pros and cons to both so a puppy you can bring up and mold so it 's perfect to you but you also have to deal with things like house training and mouthing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of extra work you need to do with puppies because of the critical socialization period that 's very important um adult dogs can often be a little bit calmer and a little bit easier but they might have some habits that take a little bit of extra training as well so have a think about which sort of age might be the best for you and your family and also have a think about making sure that you can commit to some training at least for the first year year and a half of the dog 's life as they 're going through that puppy stage and that adolescent stage as well and so uh the the portland enfield and city of charles sturt councils follow the recommendations from the rspca which is the positive reinforcement based training um and so that training involves rewarding dogs for behaviors that you want to see more of the behaviors that you like and behavior that is rewarded will be repeated in that training punishment isn 't generally recommended so there 's no need to apply an aversive after an unwanted behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavior is if you 're reinforcing them correctly for it there 's lots of different places that you can go for puppy preschools and for training classes and again on the rspca page they have a list of qualified force-free trainers uh that um all across adelaide that will uh be able to help you with training your dog for the skills that you need so one of the things that you might want to consider is whether you want a large or a small dog as well that might play into the bridge that you choose but there 's lots of different breeds and and sizes that are more prone to different health issues as well and then with large breeds everything of course costs a lot more with the large breed they need more food they need bigger clothes they need bigger beds they need a bigger car they need bigger collars and harnesses and all of that sort of adds up as well as vet fees often go by the weight of the dog so that is something to consider having said that large breeds are really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit lazier and better suited to smaller backyards or less exercise than smaller breeds depending on on the dog that you pick so it 's really important to do your research and sit down as a family and work out what is the best for you,"(-34.8442994, 138.505369)"

Australia",1212,hi everyone i 'm petra the beach education officer for the city of charleston and port adelaide enfield and here with me today we have danny and the lovely milo milo 's just a one-year-old maltese cross who 's very kindly agreed to help us with this next video that you might be interested in so um what we wanted to talk to you about today was the teaching the behavior leave it so lever is a behavior where it comes to mean to the dog back away from what you 're heading towards and come to me for a treat we want always positive associations with the cue leave it so that your dog is very happy and very eager to perform every single time you ask them to do it and leave it can be a really valuable tool to teach it 's an emergency behavior you can get your dog to come away from things that might cause it harm so chasing cat across roads maybe snakes maybe chicken drumsticks in the gutter can be really really life-saving for your animal it can be life saving for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have endangered species all through our council areas especially on the beach with the hooded plovers and it is really important that you don 't let your dog chase those birds um and so leave it is one of those tools that you might be able to use and we recommend you train this for a rainy day and hope you never need it but it is something that you definitely need to train in advance the emergency is not the time to do this practice right so milo has very kindly agreed to join us for this training session because he 's never been taught leave it before is that right that 's right and so we wanted to show you these steps from scratch this would be an excellent opportunity for leaver as milo 's now investigating the cameraman so when we 're talking about teaching leave it the it 's really important that we build a positive association with that queue so our very first step is to say i 'll leave it q and then pair it with a reward i know that sounds counterproductive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work so we would say now what q would you like to use for milo 4 leave it danny a lot of people use leave it or leave or off leave it fantastic so with milo what we 'll do is we 're going to say the word leave it and then we 're going to pair it up with a reward so that he builds that positive association with leave it means food from mum or dad what we 're going to do here is start introducing items for your dog to leave so we want to set our dogs up for success when they 're learning new behaviors as much as possible so when we start introducing items they 're going to be boring inanimate objects it could be your car keys it could be a plastic plate something that you think you 've got a good really good chance that your dog 's not going to be interested in and then we 're going to go from there when you ask your dog to leave it you 're going to offer the item in one hand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value in the other hand one of the tips for teaching new behaviors is that dogs learn in proportion to how highly they value the treat so if lever is a really important behavior for you and your dog to learn you want to pay with really good stuff barbecue chicken sausage sometimes you will be asking them to leave it in when they 're off lead in open spaces you really want this behavior to have a really solid reinforcement history so you 're going to ask the dog to leave an animal object a very boring boring item in one hand when they leave it you 're going to reinforce with the really high value food from the other hand now we 're going to make it a bit harder we 're going to add ask them to leave some boring food so this might be your dog 's breakfast and dinner it could be some diced carrot if you 've got a labrador it might be bark chips so we 'll see how we go but this is going to be much harder for your dog so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the other hand and it 's really important that you never reinforce with the food you 've asked them to leave so when you are on step three you 're going to offer some boring food and food in a tightly closed fist and you 're going to ask your dog to leave it as soon as their nose comes off you 'll reinforce with your other hand step four it 's time to take it on the road so what we 're going to do now is start introducing food on the floor food being offered by other people food that you accidentally come across on your walks and it 's up to you to set up those scenarios so that your dog can be successful when you 're practicing this you can still have your hand over the food to physically prevent them from accessing it if you need to but it 's really important that you 're reinforcing every single time the dog comes off an item no matter how easy you think it is because in real life we never want them to second guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as often as possible and we know through the research that if you want consistent reliable responses to behavior you reinforce every single time they offer you the behavior and so it is one that um because it 's an emergency behavior it 's never one that i 'm going to take a chance on i 'll always reinforce a good lever even if it 's your socks reinforce it make it worth their while so that 's how to teach lever in a nutshell it 's obviously quite a complex behavior and it takes a lot of practice to teach so even though it might look like that we 've done this in a short period of time with milo milo doesn 't necessarily know what leave it means in every context it 's up to danny now to take it out on the road i hope that video was

Australia",888,[Music] urban planning is the discipline of controlling the development of land buildings and land uses that take place in our council area have you ever looked at google maps and wondered why the streets are laid out the way they are have you wondered why are some parts of pae developed for housing and others for industry well others for shopping centres have you wondered why some areas have heritage protections and some don 't or have you noticed that your local suburb has parks and open space that are available to the public these are an important part of our suburbs but they don 't happen by accident they 're planned that way which is why we call it urban planning the planning system is a set of laws and development policies created by state and local governments the system is prepared after consultation with the general public most people will deal with the planning system at some point in their lives the most common time is when people seek approval for building a house or a carport other cases might be for subdividing a block of land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ [Music] at the moment the city of pae has our own rule book which is called a development plan this that 's the zoning of a given block of land along with rules for individual developments in that zone if the law says that something is development it needs legal approval two of the more common zones in pae are the residential zone in places like hillcrest and the industrial zone think of places like wingfield there are rules for many different things these can include the maximum height of a building or the minimum size of a backyard it could also include the number of car parks for a new shopping centre [Music] if you need an approval for your development you 'll need to lodge a formal application with the council or sometimes the state government you can lodge an application in person at the civic centre through the post or even online by law the application will include copies of the plans other written details and fees will need to be paid at that time from there a planning officer will review the application against the development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and applicants the negotiation might include adjustments to things like a building 's design its layout or its setbacks from neighbouring property boundaries additional rules can also apply to heritage listed properties when looking at applications we 'll also pay attention to things that might cause impacts on the neighbours these include things like overlooking overshadowing noise levels and the hours of operation in many cases if the development would be expected in a local area such as a house in a residential zone the answer is no but in some cases the answer is yes there are times where state legislation requires council to consult with neighbours to enable them to lodge a representation either in support or opposition to the proposal where representations are received the final decision is made by the council assessment panel in other cases usually for large-scale developments will invite comments by the general public we advertise these applications through newspaper ads and our website if the application meets the rules it will most likely get approved in rare cases council may refuse an approval this is in cases where a development may cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to appeal the decision [Music] you may have heard that the planning system is changing this is the result of laws that were passed by state parliament in 2016. since then the new system has been rolled out in stages with the final stage due for commencement in march 2021 overall this will be the biggest change to the essay planning system since the early 1990s in the new system there will be a single rulebook of planning rules for the whole entire state this rulebook is called the planning and design code and has been drafted by the state government planners the code is already in effect for most rural parts of the state and coming into effect for the adelaide metro area on march 19 2021 it replaces the current development plan the code changes the zoning and individual rules for development of existing properties it sets new rules for public consultation on development applications for example some applications will be advertised with science placed on the site of the development inviting comments from the public the code will be digital by default if you visit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address in the state and it 'll bring up the zoning for that lens in a matter of seconds this should help people know the rules a lot more quickly especially for more common and simpler developments overall the new planning system is expected to encourage greater population growth better use of infrastructure and stimulate more investment and activity at the city of pae we 'll be monitoring the new system over the next few months and we may do more videos on this in the future

[Music] do [Music] when i heard about the tiny gems project it was about the opportunity to do something playful and tiny and you could just make something and put it out there and you wouldn 't have to go through all those hoops and things and and also it was about the person who 's walking discovering it you know um that that encounter that you come across something unexpected yeah while you 're out walking um and for me it was like because of creatures it was about pay attention to the other animals that we share our neighborhoods with you know and i 've made representations of animals and and they 're you know abstracted a bit um to draw people 's attention to the fact that there 's some really beautiful creatures we share our homes with [Music] with with the pieces i 'm putting up i i think it 's an ongoing theme amongst my work to get people to seriously look just to look and once you start looking you appreciate and there 's just there 's just things to look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful they get some lovely photography here of the colors even but people a lot of people just they cycle past they walk past and they don 't look so to have that seeing things really seeing things appreciating things is a wonderful gift so i want my work partic particularly in this project to be a wonderful gift 60 grey red orange and yellow blue triangle shapes on the square to the walls to the eyes forms from thorns and 160 thousand and for thousands of thousand years ago the fly of the flight of the flight get caught by the venus fly trap and and and kill its prey bob 's head bites head off it 's very fantastic i 've completed it on the december the 17th and this one looks very great now daryl look at this in poultry of the mural sixty thousand hundred and hundred million dots um um sparkling hundred a fist fifty thousand sparkling all um or captivity over the over the mural orange yellow greens blue aqua green gold light gold orange and and um and and and and lavender and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other on top of each other about about 16 times over 100 which is fantastic we wanted to create some surprise and and using natural elements so we 've used some natural wood um and there 's a little bit of off cut wood so sort of just natural found stuff and we 've created these things these objects rainbow or a piece of pizza you know and they just fit in and and hopefully someone just comes upon them and says well what 's that or gets just gets a smile or a laugh or um yeah so that 's kind of what we 're hoping to achieve when you work with wood you can see the beautiful shapes that it has and and the shape of a bit of wood is like a rainbow and then adding the colour to the rainbow on the beautiful organic shape of the wood is some of the works that we 've made for tiny gems and we we also really um enjoy a working site specifically and when we came to the library we found a little slice in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wood to fit and then we drew pizza toppings onto it and just placed it into the garden bed so that 's one of our other works so we also like to have a bit of fun while we 're making our work i love the idea of people discovering them so i 'm looking forward to distributing them widely amongst the port adelaide enfield council area not just in the port because we do have wonderful things in the port there 's wonderful artwork everywhere i want to hide some there and i think i 'll hide two or three of them together but i want people to discover them and to get a sense of wonder from them and to to just feel that buzz that you feel when you think oh my god what 's that where did that come from who did that and we 've talked with the project we 've talked about the fact that what if people take them well that 's okay that 's okay they 're like a creative gift it 'd be nice if they hang around for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but then yeah take it have the artwork enjoy it i hope you enjoy it the idea of printing threatened animals with these prints is that here i can sometimes reproduce them perfectly sometimes they reproduce as a ghost only just a shade of what the image can be and the animals are either threatened or extinct hopefully in people 's minds they 'll think about well what are these animals like in real life and that 'll be a good thing such a beautiful initiative by the council and they they 've done an awesome job of letting people make something that 's not you know it 's it 's definitely open to tradition but there 's also so many like there 's people doing weird little ephemeral things and and um yeah taking time to just think about new ways of making art in the public sphere and um you know it doesn 't have to be huge it doesn 't need to be massive it can just be little moments of beauty and and it 's almost those little modesties that really entice people to go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modest it can be small you know i can have a small impact but every small impact is an impact and it 's like you know a whole a whole nest of ants can move a boulder but yeah [Music] you,"(-34.8442994, 138.505369)"

management of our assets is a really important part of what we do here at pae we have an asset management plan that outlines how we look after maintain and repair over two and a quarter billion dollars worth of infrastructure for our community to enjoy and to keep the city running smoothly proper asset management not only helps us maintain infrastructure to the higher level expected by our community but to do it in the most cost effective way it means we can be proactive with our projects we can fix problems before they become a concern and extend the life of our assets it also helps us to decide when to replace old assets with new ones a lot of work goes into determining how we manage our assets we have seven asset management plans each with their own unique set of requirements and challenges for all of our infrastructure we seek community input to make sure that we 're focusing on what matters most and to check our service levels are in line with expectations we collect accurate information about the condition of assets by undertaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assets and infrastructure from staff and members of the community this is valuable information direct from the people who travel around pae all day every day we record and collate all of this information into sophisticated computer software and then use various methods modeling and strategies to gain in-depth analysis of the data doing this enables us to come up with maintenance plans for all of our assets to maximize their life by looking after them well we then use further modeling to prioritize our maintenance program and determine what and when maintenance is needed addressing the worst defects first this analysis also helps us make decisions about what assets are reaching the end of their useful life and when they need to be replaced because it 's no longer cost effective or feasible to continue maintenance [Music] all of this helps us to plan for the long term and informs us about how much we should spend each year to maintain and renew existing assets to get the most value for money taking into account future demand and increasing populations let 's take a closer look at our seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with over 14 million dollars allocated annually for maintenance and repairs to ensure they are smooth and good to drive along we maintain other infrastructure including roundabouts traffic devices and crossings we use more than five tons of asphalt each day to fix issues such as potholes and also replace 28 kilometers of new road each year there are 1 243 kilometers of footpaths in the city of pae and this is continually growing due to many new developments similar to roads footpaths degrade over time so require constant maintenance to ensure they are safe and accessible to walk along this costs 2.4 million dollars each year with an additional 1.3 million spent on new footpaths curbs and ramps although most of it is hidden underground stormwater infrastructure is vital to avoid flooding and ensure water from across adelaide can flow away freely we have over 550 kilometers of storm water channels and pipes as well as 90 detention basins 4 000 pits and over 10 000 inlets we continually fix cracks and breaks however much of the underground infrastructure was built in the 1950s and is coming towards the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new stormwater assets to improve water flow especially around the lower peninsula kilburn blair athol and areas with new housing developments pump stations are part of our stormwater infrastructure we have pump stations throughout the city to enable us to control the entire stormwater system and avoid flooding when we experience heavy rain rainwater is pumped away from built up areas in infrastructure through the stormwater systems into outlets detention basins and retention basins spaces including local parks and gardens reserves golf courses natural areas streetscapes verges playgrounds outdoor gyms and coastal foreshore are at the center of the lives of much of our community maintaining all of this to high expected standards and renewing assets at the end of their life cycle costs about 23 million dollars per year as well as mowing pruning gardening watering and cleaning we maintain all of the surrounding infrastructure including paths verandas barbecues fencing and much more we look after and maintain a wide range of buildings and infrastructure to ensure they continue to meet the changing needs of our community this includes 294 buildings such as civic facilities libraries community centres sports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms plus other structures we continually assess these buildings and fix walls patch carpets clean paint and repair the structure then when the time is right we upgrade these buildings or build new facilities to replace old ones which are past their useful life our fleet consists of 290 vehicles including passenger vehicles excavators sweepers mowers graders loaders buses plus more than 650 pieces of smaller equipment such as chainsaws blowers whipper snippers pumps and generators that we use day to day we manage our fleet to ensure maximum utilization before we turn it over at the optimum time to ensure the best value for money hopefully that gives you an insight into the extent of the assets and projects we have here at pae a lot of work goes into managing these assets appropriately and we do it all for our community to enjoy and to keep the city running smoothly [Music],"(-34.8442994, 138.505369)"

have decided to build a relationship with the aboriginal community in in this area i think we 're the only council that has an advisory panel the aboriginal advisory panel is important to ensure that we are advocating on the behalf of other community people not just aboriginal people and if the the paddle didn 't exist i think then you would be having people making a lot of cultural decisions without actually understanding the impacts or the knowledge of the area the history the the stories and really that richness of culture the council members that are present in the aboriginal advisory panel that come along really are there to listen and deeply listen to our voices well i 'd like to think that what i bring is certainly the connection of being a ghana person living in also the area of port adelaide enfield i bring my culture my background in regards to the history of port adelaide i bring knowledge of not only community but what 's happening with our young people in the community i 've worked in the area and lived in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i 'm not only an aboriginal person who lives in this space i also work in the local government area i suppose as aboriginal people we want to see a strong aboriginal culture not just for the aboriginal people but for all of the community members to understand that in richness and the value that it can present whether it be looking at from a tourism point of view whether it be understanding the first nations peoples uh or whether it be embedding some of those values that our people have continued to to carry with us you know we have a very dynamic council that are really truly invested in working in partnership with aboriginal community members so that 's getting closer and closer the realisation of that i believe that help support adelaide and for council to stay on track in regards to their cultural connections to the aboriginal people of this community there 's an opportunity for us as aboriginal people that live in this community to have a voice have a voice with the with the council and and other members of the community anything that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consult we have a discussion and there 's always there 's always a positive answer i believe in terms of you know having reciprocal relationships between aboriginal and non-aboriginal people is very important moving forward you know considering that we all do share the area it 's about encouraging people to see culture as not just belonging to the aboriginal people but belonging to all of us look if the aboriginal advisory panel wasn 't there it would make it harder for aboriginal people to put forward arguments to council in relation to could be building aspects could be historical aspects we need to be the motivators to change because we need to build better lifestyles in our community for our mix community we want to look at introducing young people as well we 're all old fellas we 've been around for a long time you know but it 's nice to be able to have some young blood in there to be able to come up with some fantastic ideas you know it 's not for us to be speaking on the behalf of young people or our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the self-confidence and strong cultural identity to be able to translate those personal opinions and ideas about once again what that means for them living in the local area aboriginal community port adelaide airport council can both prosper by enhancing the culture in a bridge that will build a good community well one thing that i would finally like to leave as a story a story about this one great leader who decided that he wanted to know and have control of all of the knowledge and the wisdom in the world and so he collected all of the knowledge and the wisdom from our communities and he kept it to himself and he put it into a big bag a big bag that was made of kangaroo skin and he decided well he needed to hide this to keep it away from everybody else because he only wanted people to come to him for knowledge wisdom and information so he found the tallest tree and he decided to climb that tree and put this knowledge and wisdom at the top of this tree and as he was climbing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way it was holding him up and he was struggling to climb this tree and this young person walked by and called out to the great elders he said great elder what are you doing what are you doing and the great deal said boy go away it 's none of your business and then the young boy could have been oh great elder i can see you 're troubling i want to help you and the great elder said go away boy none of your business and as he continued to climb this tree all of a sudden he lost his grip and he fell to the ground and all of that knowledge and wisdom spread across all of the nations again so we have that opportunity to be a part of the knowledge and wisdom by not only learning it not only by sharing it but in some ways by collecting it and we can do that by talking to people by being engaged with people being a part of groups and councils and things like this but what really was the puzzling for this great elder was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to offer them that would be of any help considering they had all the knowledge and the wisdom in the world and so he said to the young person what were you going to tell me that would have been a benefit for me he said great elder i could see that you were struggling i could see the weight of that bag sitting on your belly was holding you down he said all i wanted to tell you was if you put the bag to your back therefore you would have given yourself more arm span therefore getting your arms quite around that trunk of the tree and therefore climbing to the top of the tree [Music] and he said but how did you know this i have all the knowledge of the wisdom in the world he said one thing he said common sense so in life we can collect all the knowledge and wisdom and it sits up in our heads but it 's what we do with it in our hearts it enables us to connect and so like this young person he was interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we can help people so nakada being see you later because we never say goodbye as aboriginal people and i look forward to seeing you and each other thank you you,"(-34.8442994, 138.505369)"

19 period the ways that we 've done that is through assisting our vulnerable and aged community we 're looking at ways that we can continue to support our businesses but also provided rent-free periods for those who do lease our properties they have access to our economic development team which are a fantastic team who are there to work alongside our businesses as well as the fact that we do have deferral of rates for those who need that option to the city of PAE is open for business to live work and play and we 've created this video to help you on your road to recovery you 'll hear from some experts from the Adelaide business hub in collaboration with the city of Port Adelaide Enfield in the state government and the federal government to find out ways that we can help Adelaide business hub has partnered with the Western alliance of councils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for small business owners so we 've set up business experts on the other end of the line people simply register for a callback via our website we match them to the correct business advisor so there 's no time wasted and they can spend time confidentially on the phone for free on any issue that 's important to them at the moment in addition to that a delay business hub is partnered actually with the Commonwealth Government to deliver very targeted and very specific digital solutions programs which of course we 're all doing online at the moment but the significant thing about that is that people get one-on-one mentoring support in addition to attending as many webinars as they want so for 55 it 's an example of a very low cost service that we 're able to offer to firms within the Western area and in fact across South Australia the other significant thing that is important for small business is that if they feel that they are operating out of premises that just not suitable to their needs they might even be a bit nervous about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square meters of office and studio space and we can provide a one-stop shop with all that support and advice on site high speed internet that 's four times the speed of NBN the dedicated space a professional front-of-house reception service and an opportunity for them to start taking a few calculated risks because we 're looking after you we 're providing a safety net where you can test the water test the market on that new product or opportunity or business model that you want to engineer for your future in this particular climate the business does need to make sure that they 've thought about and at least explored every new market opportunity they have I 'd be thinking about it can I be ready who do I need to talk to to be informed and what 's my strategy going forward governments like any large business there will be small purchases that people in government will make directly with businesses so there isn 't the need to tender so one of the things that we 've done in the last 12 months is created what we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then is what profile does your business have so the people that are buyers that work in the state government do they know you exist so all they need to do is register with us then one of my staff will contact them and let them understand how they actually profile their business in this direction then what we do is we promote that directory very heavily to all government staff making them aware of and asking them to prioritize their purchasing requirements with local businesses Department of Innovation and Skills which has a lot of different support services for small business there 's a small business commissioner who can assist those businesses that are really struggling with disputes potentially with landlords or even other customers and then my role as the industry advocate is making sure essay based businesses understand the procurement process and understand how to pitch for government work we 've got modules on their website and we 've titled this a category ready to tender so businesses can log on whenever they like and it walks them through a series of modules to understand what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even to a head contractor virtually there 's a lot of support programs that businesses connect if they want to either move forward all sort of start again there are programs like job keeper there 's also assets that people can buy there 's different amounts that assets can be written off for there 's wage subsidies that are available for people if they 've got trainees or apprentices and there 's a number of emergency relief programs that are available through both state and federal governments it 's all laid out on the ATO website and it 's very very clear and people can go in and just do a quick online chat with someone to find out but they also do have a great book of questions and answers whether you 're working or not it 's such a destructive discombobulating time keeping an idea of what the guidelines are around returning to work about how you can set up your office space what sort of cleaning practices you need to bring in all of those things are things that people need to consider and they need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are available on the internet through the National Action Committee and for ovid recovery and that 's got the step-by-step guides and checklists that companies can access my piece of advice would be to hang in there but also to understand what you 're hanging in there to do it 's a good time to reflect and look at what your plan B is going to be there are some businesses that are looking at partnering with others so I think that sharing with others and understanding your value-add is going to become more and more critical it 's a really good chance to reflect on what you do well and what you want to go back to I think business owners need to understand that everyone 's going to respond to us differently so when people say they 're okay don 't just take it or face you really check that they 're coping make sure that there 's flexibility for people because some people have had to change their entire way they operate the only way to be sure that you 're getting the right information from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treasury Gulf Ju has a large number of resources available the ATO website has an enormous amount of questions and answers and resources available accountants have a range of information and they are keeping up to date by going to a lot of webinars and a lot of information so they should become your best friend [Music],"(-34.8442994, 138.505369)"

was born on the deputy mayor of the city of Port Adelaide Enfield Council our March meeting with three and a half hours but today I 'd like to share with you some of those key decisions in just a few short minutes that really affected the city and our community John Hart Reserve in Elberton is a really popular local park used for sporting and community purposes that 's why residents were really concerned when they found out about a telecommunication companies plan to install a second phone tower at that location so what our March meeting some local residents came along and provided a deputation they spoke to us directly about their concerns and they also shared with us a video of some of their neighbors and how they felt about this proposal as well so council will listen to this we really clearly heard the community 's concerns and as such we elected to not allow this company to install the second phone tower John I reserved the site of the former Enfield high school soon be a residential development in our area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assigned street names for this area and I wanted to share with you why we chose the three that we did so dawn world place is named after Edith Dawn well now Edith was the first woman to graduate from a university in Australia with a science degree which is fantastic and she was indeed the first person male or female to graduate with a science degree from the University of Adelaide so we really wanted to honor her in this way the other two streets have been named using Ghana words Paul Tudor Avenue Porter water is a word that means stout hearted brave bold fearless and yatika for you take a drive that 's a gun a word that means black cockatoo so we 've really enabled a celebration of accomplishment and also recognition of our pre European heritage in this unique way the intersection of fallen Davin II and City View Boulevard in lights view opposite the North Gate shopping center it 's been a real headache for the local community there 's a lot of traffic and pedestrians who move through this intersection and with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's why I 'm really happy to say after three years of negotiations with the lights view developer and also the management of the shopping center we 've been able to land on a solution which will involve the installation of a roundabout and the indentation of the bus stop right there this is going to have a great benefit for drivers and for pedestrians and improve community safety overall Mariners Park playground in North Haven has been an issue that 's vexed Council over the recent times and this is a playground that overlooks some residential backyards and issues of privacy have been raised to council we were initially going to remove the entire playground which would have been a costly exercise but now instead we 've decided to remove just a single piece of the play equipment and replace it with something of a smaller profile we 'll be modifying another piece of the equipment there but this is an outcome that does resolve those privacy concerns but doesn 't restrict the kids from being able to use this fantastic playground in our area you may have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side of the road these are part of a new dopplers bike sharing system by oaf oh now they 've asked our permission to operate in the community and we know that there 'll be a lot of benefits from this bike sharing initiative in health and tourism and just adding transportation but we 're also aware of some community concerns around and how these bikes are left in the time that all take to be collected so council resolved to undertake a 12-month trial and will be requesting data from ofa so that we can really review this program see how it 's working before we make a final decision on whether this would be a part of our city Foothill Park is our new facility at Blair Athol reserve where you 'll be able to go along and participate in a street style pickup soccer game with yourself in a few mates it 's basically 5a five-a-side soccer this is a cool way of involving yourself in some more informal sport rather than being part of an ongoing elite level club the council is now called for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we already know that there 's some great activities that are coming around the corner such as one culture football who are teaming up with Council with the state government Flinders University and Adelaide United to provide opportunities for kids to participate and get involved in this really fun and fresh brand of soccer thanks for joining me as I walked you through some of the key decisions from councils March meeting please let us know via social media email or just get in touch about things you 'd like to hear more about in future from our council meetings and I hope to see you again soon,"(-34.8442994, 138.505369)"
